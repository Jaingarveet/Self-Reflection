Context: Economics professor: Marty's Pizza and Checkers Pizza are the two major pizza parlors in our town. Marty's sold coupon books including coupons good for one large plain pizza at any local pizza parlor, at Marty's expense. But Checkers refused to accept these coupons, even though they were redeemed by all other local pizza parlors. Accepting them would have cost Checkers nothing and would have satisfied those of its potential customers who had purchased the coupon books. This shows that Checkers's motive in refusing to accept the coupons was simply to hurt Marty's Pizza.
Question: Which one of the following, if assumed, enables the economics professor's conclusion to be properly drawn?
Choices:
  A: Any company that refuses to accept coupons issued by a competitor when doing so would satisfy some of the company's potential customers is motivated solely by the desire to hurt that competitor.
  B: Any company that wishes to hurt a competitor by refusing to accept coupons issued by that competitor will refuse to accept them even when accepting them would cost nothing and would satisfy its potential customers.
  C: At least one company has refused to accept coupons issued by its major local competitor simply in order to hurt that competitor, even though those coupons were accepted by all other local competitors.
  D: Any company that accepts its major competitor's coupons helps its competitor by doing so, even if it also satisfies its own actual or potential customers.
  E: If accepting coupons issued by a competitor would not enable a company to satisfy its actual or potential customers, then that company's refusal to accept the coupons is motivated by the desire to satisfy customers.

## Assistant 2:
## Analyzing the Choices:
**A:** This statement is too broad. It assumes that any refusal to accept competitor coupons is solely motivated by malice, which isn't necessarily true. There could be other reasons, such as concerns about the validity of the coupons or incompatibility with the company's own systems.
**B:** This statement is closer to the professor's argument, but it's still not quite accurate. It assumes that the sole purpose of refusing the coupons is to hurt the competitor, even if it comes at a cost to the refusing company. This ignores the possibility that there might be other reasons for the refusal, even if they ultimately benefit the competitor.
**C:** This statement accurately reflects the professor's argument. It provides a specific example of a company refusing competitor coupons solely to harm the competitor, even though it would have been beneficial to accept them. This supports the professor's conclusion that Checkers' refusal was motivated by malice.
**D:** This statement is irrelevant to the professor's argument. It focuses on the potential benefits of accepting competitor coupons, which is not the issue at hand. The professor is arguing that Checkers' refusal was motivated by malice, not by a desire to help or hurt Marty's Pizza.
**E:** This statement is also irrelevant to the professor's argument. It focuses on the customer satisfaction aspect of accepting coupons, which is not the main point of contention. The professor is arguing that Checkers' refusal was motivated by malice, regardless of whether it would have satisfied customers.
## Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the correct answer is **C**. It accurately reflects the professor's argument and provides a specific example that supports the conclusion.
## Action:
Answer("C")
