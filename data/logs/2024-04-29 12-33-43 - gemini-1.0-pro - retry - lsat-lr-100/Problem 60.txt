Context: A computer game publisher has recently released its latest adventure game. The game's inventive puzzles and compelling plot induce even casual players to become preoccupied with completing it. The game can be purchased from retail outlets or rented for two-day intervals. The publisher offers a rebate equal to the cost of one rental for renters who go on to purchase the game, saving them a significant portion of the purchase price. Since the rate of sales now meets expectations and rentals are exceeding expectations, the publisher predicts that soon sales of the game will also exceed expectations.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to justify the publisher's prediction?
Choices:
  A: The game can be purchased directly from the publisher as well as from retailers.
  B: It takes several weeks for most players to complete the game.
  C: The publisher's games are among the most popular computer games on the market.
  D: Most people who complete the game do not play it extensively afterward.
  E: Some people buy and complete the game and then give it away to a friend.

## Assistant 2:
## Analyzing the Choices:
* **A:** This information is irrelevant to the prediction of exceeding sales.
* **B:** This information suggests that players are engaged with the game for a longer period, potentially increasing sales.
* **C:** This information is irrelevant to the specific game in question.
* **D:** This information suggests that players are not likely to purchase the game after completing it, contradicting the prediction.
* **E:** This information suggests that sales might be boosted by word-of-mouth recommendations, but it doesn't directly support the prediction of exceeding sales.
## Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the most likely option to justify the publisher's prediction is **B**. The longer engagement with the game increases the chances of players converting from rentals to purchases, exceeding initial sales expectations.
## Action:
Answer("B")
