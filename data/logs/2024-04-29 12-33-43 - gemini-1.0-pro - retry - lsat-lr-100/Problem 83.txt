## System:
You are an expert in Law.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Law
Context: Although Pluto has an atmosphere and is much larger than any asteroid, Pluto is not a true planet. Pluto formed in orbit around the planet Neptune and was then ejected from orbit around Neptune when Triton, Neptune's largest moon, was captured by Neptune's gravity.
Question: The conclusion of the argument follows logically if which one of the following is assumed?
Choices:
  A: No celestial body can simultaneously be a moon and a planet.
  B: Not all celestial bodies that have an atmosphere and orbit the sun are true planets.
  C: If Pluto had not been ejected from its orbit around Neptune, Pluto would not have its current orbit around the sun and would still be a moon.
  D: The size of a celestial body in orbit around the sun is not relevant to determining whether or not it is a true planet.
  E: For a celestial body to be a true planet it must have formed in orbit around the sun exclusively.

## Assistant 2:
## Analyzing the Argument and Answer Choices:
**Argument:**
* Pluto has an atmosphere and is larger than any asteroid.
* Pluto formed in orbit around Neptune and was ejected.
* Therefore, Pluto is not a true planet.
**Answer Choices:**
* **A:** This statement is irrelevant to the argument. Whether or not a celestial body can be both a moon and a planet has no bearing on Pluto's status.
* **B:** This statement aligns with the argument. The fact that Pluto has an atmosphere and orbits the sun is not enough to make it a true planet.
* **C:** This statement is a hypothetical scenario that is not directly relevant to the argument. While it's true that Pluto's current orbit is a result of its ejection, the argument focuses on the reason for its ejection, not the consequences.
* **D:** This statement contradicts the argument. The argument implies that Pluto's size is not a factor in its classification as a non-planet.
* **E:** This statement is too restrictive. The argument doesn't specify that a true planet must form exclusively in orbit around the sun. It only suggests that Pluto's formation around Neptune disqualifies it.
## Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the assumption that best supports the argument is:
**Action: Answer("B")** 
**Explanation:** 
The argument hinges on the idea that having an atmosphere and orbiting the sun are not sufficient criteria for being a true planet. This aligns with the statement that "not all celestial bodies that have an atmosphere and orbit the sun are true planets." 
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: E
Score: 0
