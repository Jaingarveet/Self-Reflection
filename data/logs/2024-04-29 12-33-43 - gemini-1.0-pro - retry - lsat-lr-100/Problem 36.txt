## User 2:
Topic: Law
Context: Native speakers perceive sentences of their own language as sequences of separate words. But this perception is an illusion. This is shown by the fact that travelers who do not know a local language hear an unintelligible, uninterrupted stream of sound, not sentences with distinct words.
Question: Which one of the following is an assumption on which the argument depends?
Choices:
  A: It is impossible to understand sentences if they are in fact uninterrupted streams of sound.
  B: Those who do not know a language cannot hear the way speech in that language actually sounds.
  C: People pay less close attention to the way their own language sounds than they do to the way an unfamiliar language sounds.
  D: Accomplished non-native speakers of a language do not perceive sentences as streams of sound.
  E: Native speakers' perceptions of their own language are not more accurate than are the perceptions of persons who do not know that language.

## Assistant 2:
Let's analyze each option:
* **A**: This statement is too strong and not necessarily true. Understanding sentences requires identifying words, but it doesn't mean the sound must be perfectly segmented.
* **B**: This is the key assumption. The argument hinges on the difference in perception between those familiar and unfamiliar with the language.
* **C**: This statement is irrelevant to the argument. The focus is on the inherent difficulty of perceiving words in an unfamiliar language, not on attention levels.
* **D**: This statement is not relevant to the argument. The argument focuses on the initial perception of native vs. non-native speakers, not on the potential for improvement with learning.
* **E**: This statement is too broad and not directly related to the argument. The argument focuses on the specific difference in perceiving words, not on general accuracy of perception.
Therefore, the assumption the argument depends on is:
**Action: Answer("B")** 
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: E
Score: 0
