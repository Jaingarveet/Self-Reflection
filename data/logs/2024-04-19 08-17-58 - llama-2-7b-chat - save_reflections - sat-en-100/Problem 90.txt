  Great, let's break down the question and the possible answers:

Question: Do the data in the table provide support for the authors' claim that infection with varroa mites increases a honeybee's susceptibility to secondary infections?

Choices:

A: Yes, because the data provide evidence that infection with a pathogen caused the colonies to undergo colony collapse disorder.

This answer is incorrect because the data do not provide evidence that infection with a pathogen caused colony collapse disorder. In fact, the data show that the percent of colonies infected with each pathogen is greater for colonies with colony collapse disorder than for colonies without colony collapse disorder, which supports the authors' claim that infection with varroa mites increases a honeybee's susceptibility to secondary infections.

B: Yes, because for each pathogen, the percent of colonies infected is greater for colonies with colony collapse disorder than for colonies without colony collapse disorder.

This answer is correct! The data in the table do provide support for the authors' claim that infection with varroa mites increases a honeybee's susceptibility to secondary infections. For each pathogen, the percent of colonies infected is greater for colonies with colony collapse disorder than for colonies without colony collapse disorder, which suggests that the presence of varroa mites may make honeybees more susceptible to other pathogens, leading to an increased risk of secondary infections and colony collapse disorder.

C: No, because the data do not provide evidence about bacteria as a cause of colony collapse disorder.

This answer is incorrect because the data do provide evidence about the presence of bacteria as a cause of colony collapse disorder. The table shows that the percent of colonies infected with each pathogen is greater for colonies with colony collapse disorder than for colonies without colony collapse disorder, and four of the pathogens listed are bacteria.

D: No, because the data do not indicate whether the honeybees had been infected with mites.

This answer is correct! The data do not indicate whether the honeybees had been infected with mites, so this answer is not a valid choice.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) Yes, because for each pathogen, the percent of colonies infected is greater for colonies with colony collapse disorder than for colonies without colony collapse disorder.
