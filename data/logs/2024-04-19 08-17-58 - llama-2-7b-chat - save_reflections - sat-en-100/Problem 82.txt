## Get Reflection:
 Great, let's analyze the passage and determine the correct answer.

The passage states that Woolf chooses the setting of the bridge because it is symbolic of the legacy of past and present sons of educated men. This is evident when the author notes that the procession of educated men has been a "caravanserai crossing a desert" for the past twenty years, and that they themselves are now part of that procession. The bridge serves as a metaphor for the passage of time and the continuity of the educated elite, highlighting the idea that the procession of educated men has been a constant presence throughout history.

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) The bridge is symbolic of the legacy of past and present sons of educated men.

Let's review the other options:

Option (A) is not supported by the passage, as there is no indication that the bridge is conducive to fanciful reflection.

Option (B) is partially supported by the passage, as the author does provide a good view of the procession of the sons of educated men. However, the passage emphasizes the symbolic significance of the bridge rather than its visual appeal.

Option (C) is not supported by the passage, as there is no mention of any specific historic episodes that Woolf alludes to.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
