## Get Reflection:
  Great, let's break down the answer:

The authors' main purpose of including the information about X-ray evidence and density is to provide support for their claim about the number of chains in a molecule of DNA. The authors use the X-ray evidence and density to argue that there are two chains in a molecule of DNA, rather than just one as suggested by the chemical formula. They believe that the density of DNA, combined with the X-ray evidence, strongly suggests that there are two chains in the molecule. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.

Now, let's analyze the other options:

A: Establish that DNA is the molecule that carries the genetic information.

While the authors do mention that DNA is the molecule that carries the genetic information, this is not the main purpose of including the information about X-ray evidence and density. The authors are primarily using these data to support their claim about the number of chains in a molecule of DNA.

B: Present an alternate hypothesis about the composition of a nucleotide.

The authors do not present any alternate hypothesis about the composition of a nucleotide. They are focused on the structure of DNA and the evidence that supports the idea of two chains in a molecule of DNA.

C: Provide support for the authors' claim about the number of chains in a molecule of DNA.

This is the correct answer. The authors use the X-ray evidence and density to provide support for their claim that there are two chains in a molecule of DNA.

D: Confirm the relationship between the density of DNA and the known chemical formula of DNA.

While the authors do mention the relationship between the density of DNA and the known chemical formula, this is not the main purpose of including the information about X-ray evidence and density. The authors are primarily using these data to support their claim about the number of chains in a molecule of DNA.

In conclusion, the correct answer is option C: Provide support for the authors' claim about the number of chains in a molecule of DNA.
