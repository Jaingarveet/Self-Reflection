Passage 2:

The author argues that the denial of civil and political rights to women has resulted in their exclusion from participating in government and decision-making processes. The author contends that this is a political phenomenon that cannot be explained by abstract principles, and that it is inconsistent and unjust to subjugate women while claiming to act in their best interests. The author argues that women have the right to participate in the investigation of truth and the promotion of virtue, and that society's leaders should not deny them these rights.

Question:

In Passage 2, the author claims that freedoms granted by society's leaders have

The correct answer is (D) Ensured equality for all people. The author argues that the denial of civil and political rights to women has resulted in their exclusion from participating in government and decision-making processes, which is inconsistent and unjust. The author contends that society's leaders should not deny women these rights, and that they should ensure equality for all people.

Now, let's analyze the other options:

Option (A) Privileged one gender over the other: This option is incorrect because the author does not argue that society's leaders have privileged one gender over the other. Instead, the author argues that the denial of civil and political rights to women has resulted in their exclusion from participating in government and decision-making processes, which is inconsistent and unjust.

Option (B) Resulted in a general reduction in individual virtue: This option is also incorrect because the author does not argue that the denial of civil and political rights to women has resulted in a general reduction in individual virtue. Instead, the author argues that the denial of these rights has resulted in the exclusion of women from participating in government and decision-making processes, which is inconsistent and unjust.

Option (C) Caused arguments about the nature of happiness: This option is incorrect because the author does not argue that the denial of civil and political rights to women has caused arguments about the nature of happiness. Instead, the author argues that the denial of these rights has resulted in the exclusion of women from participating in government and decision-making processes, which is inconsistent and unjust.

Therefore, the best answer is (D) Ensured equality for all people.
