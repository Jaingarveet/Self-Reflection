## Get Reflection:
  Explanation:
The correct answer is (A) The narrator emphasizes Silas's former obsession with wealth by depicting his gold as requiring certain behaviors on his part.

The narrator describes the gold as needing nothing and must be worshipped in close-locked solitude, implying that Silas's obsession with the gold consumed him. This is the first mention of the gold in the passage, and it sets the tone for the narrator's representation of Silas's character before he adopted Eppie. The narrator highlights the gold's importance to Silas by describing it as something that required his constant attention and worship, indicating that Silas's obsession with wealth was all-consuming.

In contrast, the narrator's description of Eppie as a creature of endless claims and ever-growing desires, seeking and loving sunshine, and living sounds, and living movements, suggests that Silas's character has changed significantly since he adopted Eppie. Eppie represents a new aspect of Silas's character, one that is more carefree and open to new experiences. The contrast between the gold and Eppie serves to highlight the transformation in Silas's character.

Therefore, option (A) best describes the technique the narrator uses to represent Silas's character before he adopted Eppie.
