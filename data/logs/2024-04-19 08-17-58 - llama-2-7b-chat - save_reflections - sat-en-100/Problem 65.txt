## Get Reflection:
  Great, let's break down the answer:

The main idea of the last paragraph is that Mr. Peters is preoccupied with the knowledge that he is growing old.

The passage provides evidence to support this idea through the following sentences:

* "Time is probably no more unkind to sporting characters than it is to other people, but physical decay unsustained by respectability is somehow more noticeable." This sentence suggests that Mr. Peters is aware of the physical changes that come with aging, and that he is conscious of the fact that he is not as young as he used to be.
* "Mr. Peters' hair was turning gray and his scalp showed through on top." This sentence indicates that Mr. Peters is experiencing hair loss and graying, which are common signs of aging.
* "He had lost weight also; he no longer filled out his clothes the way he used to." This sentence suggests that Mr. Peters has lost weight, which can be a result of aging or other factors such as illness or lack of exercise.
* "His color was poor, and the flower had disappeared from his buttonhole." This sentence implies that Mr. Peters is not as healthy as he used to be, and that he is experiencing physical decline.

Therefore, the best answer is option (D) - Mr. Peters is preoccupied with the knowledge that he is growing old.
