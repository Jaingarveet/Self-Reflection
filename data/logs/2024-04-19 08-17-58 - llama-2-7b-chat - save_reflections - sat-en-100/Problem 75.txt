## Get Reflection:
 Explanation:
The correct answer is (D) Lymie's experience reading a book.

Throughout the passage, the focus shifts from Lymie's inner thoughts to his experience reading a book. The passage describes Lymie's actions while reading, such as bringing food to his mouth and counting off names on his left hand. The passage also mentions the book's content, including the Peace of Paris and the Congress of Vienna. The primary focus of the passage is on Lymie's experience reading the book, rather than on the actions or personalities of the other characters in the restaurant.

The other options do not accurately describe the passage's focus:

Option (A) is incorrect because while there are some observations made by other characters in the passage, the primary focus is on Lymie's experience reading the book.

Option (B) is incorrect because while there is an exchange between Lymie and the waitress, Irma, the primary focus is not on a satisfying personal relationship.

Option (C) is incorrect because while the physical setting of the restaurant is mentioned, the primary focus is on Lymie's experience reading the book rather than on the different characters' personality traits.
