  Great, let's break down the passage and identify the keywords that describe the type of errors made by Beveridge and Bryan:

Beveridge (Passage 1):

* Calculation error: "The product of 4*4 is 16" (should be 16)
* Arithmetic error: "The coast lines of the United States would enclose half the countries of Europe" (should be "countries")
* General knowledge error: "It is a mighty people that He has planted on this soil" (should be "God")

Bryan (Passage 2):

* General knowledge error: "The Filipinos do not need any encouragement from Americans now living" (should be "Filipinos")
* Logical fallacy: "If the Republicans are prepared to censure all who have used language calculated to make the Filipinos hate foreign domination, let them condemn the speech of Patrick Henry" (should be "Patrick Henry's speech")

Both Beveridge and Bryan made errors in their calculations, general knowledge, and logical reasoning.

To solve the problem again, step-by-step, based on the correct answer:

Passage 1:

* Identify the city where the university is located: Ames
* Identify the state where the university is located: Iowa
* Count the number of letters in the name of the city: 4
* Count the number of letters in the name of the state: 4
* Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state: 16

Passage 2:

* Identify the subject race: Filipinos
* Calculate the product of the number of letters in the name of the subject race and the number of letters in the name of the country: 16

In conclusion, Beveridge and Bryan made errors in their calculations and logical reasoning. To avoid making similar errors in the future, it is important to carefully read and understand the passage, break down the problem into smaller steps, and double-check calculations. Additionally, it is essential to have a strong foundation in basic arithmetic and general knowledge to avoid making errors.
