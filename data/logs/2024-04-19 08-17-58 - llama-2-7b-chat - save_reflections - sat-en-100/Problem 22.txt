## Get Reflection:
 Excellent! You have correctly identified the pair of base percentages in sea urchin DNA that provides evidence in support of the answer to the previous question.

Let's break down the reasoning behind your answer:

You noticed that the table shows that the percentage of adenine in sea urchin DNA is 17.3%, and the percentage of thymine is 32.1%. You then realized that these two bases are the only pairs of bases that can form hydrogen bonds in the DNA molecule, as described in the passage. Therefore, the pair of base percentages in sea urchin DNA that provides evidence in support of the answer to the previous question is (B): $17.3 \%$ and $32.1 \%$.

Great job! Your understanding of the passage and your ability to apply it to the problem are impressive. Keep up the good work!
