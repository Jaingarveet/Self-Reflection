## Get Reflection:
  Great, let's analyze the question and the choices:

The question is asking about the reason why the narrator closes the history book in the passage. The choices are:

A: his father has joined him at the table.
B: the people at the other table are too disruptive.
C: he has finished the chapter about the Congress.
D: he is preparing to leave the restaurant.

From the passage, we can infer that the narrator closes the book because he has finished the chapter about the Congress. The passage states, "Lymie closed the book and said, 'I didn't think you were coming.'" This suggests that the narrator has finished reading about the Congress and is now addressing someone else who has joined him at the table. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) he has finished the chapter about the Congress.
