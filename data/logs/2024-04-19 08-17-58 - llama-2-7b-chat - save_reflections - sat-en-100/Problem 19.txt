## Get Reflection:
  Great, let's break down the passage and compare the events described in each choice:

A) An experiment is proposed but proves unworkable; a less ambitious experiment is attempted, and it yields data that give rise to a new set of questions.

The passage doesn't mention any unworkable experiment or less ambitious experiment. Instead, Ken Dial designed a project to study how baby game birds learned to fly, and his son Terry observed an anomaly during the experiment.

B) A new discovery leads to reconsideration of a theory; a classic study is adapted, and the results are summarized.

The passage doesn't mention any classic study or previous theory. Instead, Ken Dial and Terry observed an anomaly during the experiment, which led to a new discovery and the development of a new term (WAIR).

C) An anomaly is observed and simulated experimentally; the results are compared with previous findings, and a novel hypothesis is proposed.

This is the best description of the events in the passage. Ken Dial and Terry observed an anomaly during the experiment, which led to a new discovery and the development of a new term (WAIR). The passage also mentions that the results were compared with previous findings, which supports this choice.

D) An unexpected finding arises during the early phase of a study; the study is modified in response to this finding, and the results are interpreted and evaluated.

The passage doesn't mention any unexpected finding arising during the early phase of the study. Instead, Terry observed an anomaly during the experiment, which led to a new discovery and the modification of the study to better understand the phenomenon.

Therefore, the best choice to reflect the overall sequence of events in the passage is option C, as the passage describes an anomaly observed during an experiment, which led to a new discovery and the modification of the study to better understand the phenomenon.
