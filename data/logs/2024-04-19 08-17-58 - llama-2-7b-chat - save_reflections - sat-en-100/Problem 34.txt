## Get Reflection:
  Great, you have identified the correct answer! Passage 2 challenges the argument presented in Passage 1 by providing alternative conclusions based on the same evidence. The author of Passage 2 acknowledges that the argument in Passage 1 has some merit, but then presents a counterargument that challenges the idea that women should be excluded from political rights and functions.

Here are some key points to remember:

* Passage 1 argues that women should be excluded from political rights and functions because of their delicate constitutions, peaceful inclinations, and duties of motherhood.
* Passage 2 challenges this argument by pointing out that education is essential for women to understand why they should be virtuous and to cooperate in the progress of knowledge and virtue.
* Passage 2 also argues that it is inconsistent and unjust to subjugate women, even if the speaker believes it is acting in the manner best calculated to promote their happiness.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
