## Get Reflection:
 Explanation:
The interaction between Miss Spivey and Ralphord serves mainly to establish a friendly dynamic between the charming schoolchildren and their indulgent and doting new instructor. Miss Spivey is shown to be patient and kind when answering Ralphord's questions, even though he is asking about a topic that she considers unimportant (the pearly white button on a string). This suggests that she is eager to connect with her students and make them feel comfortable in her classroom. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) establish a friendly dynamic between the charming schoolchildren and their indulgent and doting new instructor.
