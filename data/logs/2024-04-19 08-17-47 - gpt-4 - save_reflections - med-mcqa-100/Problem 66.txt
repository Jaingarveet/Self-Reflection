Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I underestimated the duration of Hepatitis A virus shedding in faeces. I knew that the shedding begins before the symptoms appear and continues after the onset of symptoms, but I was mistaken about the exact duration.
Error Keywords:
- Misunderstanding
- Incorrect recall
- Duration error
Solution:
Hepatitis A virus is primarily transmitted through the fecal-oral route. The virus is shed in the feces of infected individuals. This shedding begins approximately two weeks before symptoms appear and continues for about two weeks after the onset of symptoms. Therefore, the correct answer is "D: Two weeks before the symptoms and two week thereafter".
Instructions:
1. Understand the question, which is about the duration of Hepatitis A virus shedding in faeces.
2. Recall the correct information about the Hepatitis A virus shedding duration.
3. Remember that the shedding begins two weeks before symptoms appear and continues for two weeks after the onset of symptoms.
4. Choose the answer that correctly represents this duration.
Advice:
- Always read the question carefully and understand what is being asked.
- Make sure to recall the correct information about the topic.
- Pay attention to details, especially when it comes to durations and timelines.
- Double-check your answer before finalizing it.
- Regularly review and update your knowledge about different diseases and their characteristics.
