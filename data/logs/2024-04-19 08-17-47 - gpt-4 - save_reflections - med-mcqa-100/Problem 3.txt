## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I confused the catalysts for condensation silicone and polyvinyl siloxane. While both are elastic and set by a chemical reaction, it is polyvinyl siloxane that is catalyzed by chloroplatinic acid, not condensation silicone.
Error Keywords:
- Misunderstanding
- Confusion
- Catalyst error
Solution:
The question asks for an elastic impression material that sets by a chemical reaction and is catalyzed by chloroplatinic acid. Polyvinyl siloxane fits this description. Therefore, the correct answer is D: Polyvinyl siloxane.
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and understand what is being asked.
2. Identify the key characteristics of the impression material mentioned in the question: it is elastic, sets by a chemical reaction, and is catalyzed by chloroplatinic acid.
3. Recall the properties of each of the given options.
4. Match the characteristics given in the question with the properties of the options.
5. Choose the option that matches all the characteristics given in the question.
Advice:
- Always read the question carefully and understand what is being asked.
- Make sure to remember the properties of different materials correctly.
- Don't rush, take your time to recall the properties of each option before making a decision.
- If you are unsure, don't guess. It's better to leave a question unanswered than to answer it incorrectly.
