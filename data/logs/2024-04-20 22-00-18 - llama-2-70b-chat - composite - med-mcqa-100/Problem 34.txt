## System:
You are an expert in Medicine.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question [REDACTED]ecause I confused the types of hypersensitivity re[REDACTED]tions. Spring catarrh is [REDACTED]tually a type of type II hypersensitivity re[REDACTED]tion, also known as cytotoxic hypersensitivity. In this re[REDACTED]tion, the immune system produces anti[REDACTED]odies that target and destroy cells that have taken up the allergen, in this case, pollen.

Error Keywords:

* Type II hypersensitivity
* Cytotoxic hypersensitivity
* Allergic rhinitis

Solution:
Spring catarrh is a type of allergic rhinitis caused [REDACTED]y pollen from trees, grasses, and weeds. It is a type of hypersensitivity re[REDACTED]tion.

1. Identify the type of hypersensitivity re[REDACTED]tion that spring catarrh is.
2. Look up the char[REDACTED]teristics of type II hypersensitivity re[REDACTED]tions.
3. Match the char[REDACTED]teristics of spring catarrh to the char[REDACTED]teristics of type II hypersensitivity re[REDACTED]tions.

Instructions:

1. Research the different types of hypersensitivity re[REDACTED]tions.
2. Study the char[REDACTED]teristics of e[REDACTED]h type of hypersensitivity re[REDACTED]tion.
3. Pr[REDACTED]tice identifying the type of hypersensitivity re[REDACTED]tion given a description of a condition.

Advice:

* Always research and understand the different types of hypersensitivity re[REDACTED]tions.
* Always study the char[REDACTED]teristics of e[REDACTED]h type of hypersensitivity re[REDACTED]tion.
* Pr[REDACTED]tice identifying the type of hypersensitivity re[REDACTED]tion given a description of a condition.
* Never confuse type II hypersensitivity re[REDACTED]tions with other types.
* Always dou[REDACTED]le-check your answer [REDACTED]y matching the char[REDACTED]teristics of the condition to the char[REDACTED]teristics of the hypersensitivity re[REDACTED]tion.

* Never confuse type II hypersensitivity re[REDACTED]tions with other types.
* Always dou[REDACTED]le-check your answer [REDACTED]y matching the char[REDACTED]teristics of the condition to the char[REDACTED]teristics of the hypersensitivity re[REDACTED]tion.

Reflection:
I have reflected on my previous answer and the correct solution. I have also studied the different types of hypersensitivity re[REDACTED]tions and their characteristics. I am now confident in my ability to identify the type of hypersensitivity re[REDACTED]tion given a description of a condition. I will always research and understand the different types of hypersensitivity re[REDACTED]tions and study the characteristics of each type. I will also practice identifying the type of hypersensitivity re[REDACTED]tion given a description of a condition and double-check my answer by matching the characteristics of the condition to the characteristics of the hypersensitivity re[REDACTED]tion.

Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
