Question: Sheep Challenge Evolution A species of sheep lives on the Scottish island of Hirta. Hirta has plenty of grass for the sheep to eat, and no natural predators of the sheep live on the island. Some sheep have dark wool, and some have light wool. The sheep with dark wool tend to be much larger and stronger than the sheep with light wool. However, researchers have found that in the last 20 years, the sheep with light wool have increased in number. Usually, strength and size help animals survive and breed. A new sheep predator is introduced to the island. Which change to the sheep population will most likely occur first?
Choices:
  A: a decrease in the population of sheep with dark wool
  B: a decrease in the population of sheep with light wool
  C: an increase in the population of sheep with dark wool
  D: an increase in the population of sheep with light wool

## Assistant 2:
  Thought: I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand that I misunderstood the scenario and overlooked important details.

Action: I will reassess the question based on my reflection.

The correct answer is (B) a decrease in the population of sheep with light wool. The passage states that the sheep with light wool have increased in number in the last 20 years, indicating that their population is growing. On the other hand, the population of sheep with dark wool is not mentioned to be changing, which suggests that it is stable or even decreasing. Therefore, the change that is most likely to occur first is a decrease in the population of sheep with light wool.

Reflection: I realized that I misunderstood the scenario by assuming that the passage was describing a situation where the sheep with dark wool were in danger of becoming extinct due to the introduction of a new predator. However, the passage actually suggests that the sheep with light wool are the ones that are increasing in number, which means that they are the ones that are more vulnerable to predation. I also overlooked the detail that the passage does not mention any natural predators of the sheep on the island, which further supports the conclusion that the population of sheep with light wool is likely to decrease.
