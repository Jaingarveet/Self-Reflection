Question: A teacher opens a can of food in the front of a classroom. Soon, all of the students in the classroom can smell the food. Which statement identifies a property of a gas that allows all of the students to smell the food?

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, stating that the correct answer was (D) A gas keeps its shape when placed in a container. However, upon further reflection, I realize that the correct answer is (C) A gas takes the shape of its container.

Here's why: When the teacher opened the can of food, the gas inside the can (such as carbon dioxide or nitrogen) expanded and filled the classroom, allowing all the students to smell the food. This is because gases will expand to fill the space available to them, which is a property of gases known as "volume expansion." Therefore, the correct answer is (C) A gas takes the shape of its container.
