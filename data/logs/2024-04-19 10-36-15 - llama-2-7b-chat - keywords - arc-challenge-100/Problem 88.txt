  Topic: Science
Question: Michelle performed an investigation but the results did not match her hypothesis. What should Michelle do next?

Reflection:

I previously answered this question incorrectly by selecting option B, "change the hypothesis to match the results." However, upon further reflection, I realize that this is not the correct solution. Changing the hypothesis to match the results is not a valid option, as it goes against the scientific method of forming hypotheses based on observations and testing them through experiments.

The correct answer is option A, "perform the investigation in a different way." Michelle should try to replicate the investigation with different methods or conditions to see if the results are consistent. This will help her to identify any errors or limitations in the original investigation and to refine her hypothesis.
