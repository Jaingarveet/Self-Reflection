## System:
You are an expert in Science.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

## Assistant 2:
  Thought: 
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand the mistake. The density of red-clay bricks is approximately 2000 kg/m^3, while the density of air is 1 kg/m^3. To find the lowest mass, we need to compare the volumes of the two substances.

Action: Answer("C")

Reflection:
I reflected on my previous answer and realized that I made a mistake in my calculation. I compared the volumes of 2 m^3 of bricks and 6000 m^3 of air, but I should have compared the volumes of 4 m^3 of bricks and 10,000 m^3 of air. The correct answer is (C) 6000 m^3 of air, which has the lowest mass.
