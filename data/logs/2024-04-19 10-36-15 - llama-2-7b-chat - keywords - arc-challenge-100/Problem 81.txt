Choices:
A: Use only new equipment.
B: Use a very strong telescope.
C: Project image onto a piece of cardboard.
D: Look at the Sun only in the morning.

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I realized that I overlooked an important precaution. Here is my reflection:

When making observations of the Sun, students must take the necessary precautions to avoid eye damage. The Sun emits harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays that can cause eye damage and even blindness. Therefore, it is essential to use proper eye protection when observing the Sun.

The correct answer is (C) Project image onto a piece of cardboard. This precaution allows students to safely observe the Sun without looking directly at it. By projecting the image onto a piece of cardboard, students can view the Sun's image without exposing their eyes to the harmful UV rays.

In conclusion, it is crucial to prioritize safety when making observations of the Sun. By following the correct precautions, students can enjoy this fascinating celestial body while protecting their eyesight.
