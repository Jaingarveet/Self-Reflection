Context: Economics professor: Marty's Pizza and Checkers Pizza are the two major pizza parlors in our town. Marty's sold coupon books including coupons good for one large plain pizza at any local pizza parlor, at Marty's expense. But Checkers refused to accept these coupons, even though they were redeemed by all other local pizza parlors. Accepting them would have cost Checkers nothing and would have satisfied those of its potential customers who had purchased the coupon books. This shows that Checkers's motive in refusing to accept the coupons was simply to hurt Marty's Pizza.
Question: Which one of the following, if assumed, enables the economics professor's conclusion to be properly drawn?
Choices:
  A: Any company that refuses to accept coupons issued by a competitor when doing so would satisfy some of the company's potential customers is motivated solely by the desire to hurt that competitor.
  B: Any company that wishes to hurt a competitor by refusing to accept coupons issued by that competitor will refuse to accept them even when accepting them would cost nothing and would satisfy its potential customers.
  C: At least one company has refused to accept coupons issued by its major local competitor simply in order to hurt that competitor, even though those coupons were accepted by all other local competitors.
  D: Any company that accepts its major competitor's coupons helps its competitor by doing so, even if it also satisfies its own actual or potential customers.
  E: If accepting coupons issued by a competitor would not enable a company to satisfy its actual or potential customers, then that company's refusal to accept the coupons is motivated by the desire to satisfy customers.

## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The economics professor concludes that Checkers refused the coupons solely to hurt Marty's Pizza. 
2. The professor bases this on the fact that accepting the coupons would have cost Checkers nothing and would have satisfied some of its potential customers.
3. So for the professor's conclusion to be properly drawn, we need to assume that if a company refuses to accept competitor coupons when doing so would cost nothing and satisfy potential customers, the only possible motive is to hurt the competitor.
4. Looking at the answer choices:
A) This matches the assumption we identified in step 3. If we assume this, the professor's conclusion logically follows.
B) This is the reverse of what we need. It says if a company wants to hurt a competitor, it will refuse the coupons even when acceptance costs nothing and satisfies customers. But we need the reverse implication.
C) This just says at least one company has done this, not that it's the only possible motive. Doesn't enable the conclusion.
D) Not relevant, as the professor's conclusion is about Checkers' motive, not the effect on Marty's.
E) Also not relevant, as it's about cases where accepting coupons doesn't satisfy customers. Here accepting them would have satisfied customers.
5. Therefore, A is the correct answer, as it provides the necessary assumption to draw the professor's conclusion.
Action: Answer("A")
