Topic: Law
Context: People who are allergic to cats are actually allergic to certain proteins found in the animals' skin secretions and saliva; which particular proteins are responsible, however, varies from allergy sufferer to allergy sufferer. Since all cats shed skin and spread saliva around their environment, there is no such thing as a cat incapable of provoking allergic reactions, although it is common for a given cat to cause an allergic reaction in some-but not all-people who are allergic to cats.
Question: Which one of the following statements is most strongly supported by the information above?
Choices:
  A: Any particular individual will be allergic to some breeds of cat but not to others.
  B: No cat is capable of causing an allergic reaction in all types of allergy sufferers.
  C: Not all cats are identical with respect to the proteins contained in their skin secretions and saliva.
  D: The allergic reactions of some people who are allergic to cats are more intense than the allergic reactions of other allergy sufferers.
  E: There is no way to predict whether a given cat will produce an allergic reaction in a particular allergy sufferer.

## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The passage states that the particular proteins responsible for cat allergies vary from person to person. This suggests that a given cat may cause an allergic reaction in some cat allergy sufferers but not others, depending on which proteins that cat produces and which proteins a person is allergic to.
2. The passage also says there is no such thing as a cat that cannot provoke allergic reactions at all, since all cats shed skin and spread saliva. However, it notes that a particular cat often causes reactions in some, but not all, people with cat allergies. 
3. This directly supports choice B - no single cat will cause allergic reactions in every person with a cat allergy, because different allergy sufferers are sensitive to different cat proteins.
4. Choice A is not supported, as the passage discusses individual cats, not cat breeds. Choices C and D are not directly addressed. And while E may often be true in practice, the information given suggests that if we knew which proteins a cat produced and which proteins a person was allergic to, we could predict if that cat would trigger that person's allergies.
Therefore, B is the statement most strongly supported by the given information.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
