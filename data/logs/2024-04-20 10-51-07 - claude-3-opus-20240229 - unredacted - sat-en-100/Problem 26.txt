Context: Akira came directly, breaking all tradition. Was that it? Had he followed form-had he asked his mother to speak to his father to approach a  go-between-would Chie have been more receptive?He came on a winter's eve. He pounded on the door while a cold rain beat on the shuttered veranda, so at first Chie thought him only the wind. The maid knew better. Chie heard her soft scuttling footsteps, the creak of the door. Then the maid brought acalling card to the drawing room, for Chie.Chie was reluctant to go to her guest; perhaps she was feeling too cozy. She and Naomi were reading at a low table set atop a charcoal brazier. A thick quilt spread over the sides of the table so their legs were  tucked inside with the heat."Who is it at this hour, in this weather?" Chie questioned as she picked the name card off the maid's lacquer tray."Shinoda, Akira. Kobe Dental College," she read.  Naomi recognized the name. Chie heard a soft intake of air."I think you should go," said Naomi. twenties, slim and serious, wearing the blackmilitary-style uniform of a student. As he bowed-his hands hanging straight down, a black cap in one, a yellow oil-paper umbrella in the other-Chie glanced beyond him. In the glistening surface of the courtyard's rain-drenched paving 30 stones, she saw his reflection like a dark double."Madame," said Akira, "forgive my disruption, but I come with a matter of urgency."His voice was soft, refined. He straightened and stole a deferential peek at her face.35 In the dim light his eyes shone with sincerity. Chie felt herself starting to like him."Come inside, get out of this nasty night. Surely your business can wait for a moment or two.""I don't want to trouble you. Normally I would 40 approach you more properly but I've received word of a position. I've an opportunity to go to America, as dentist for Seattle's Japanese community.""Congratulations," Chie said with amusement. "That is an opportunity, I'm sure. But how am I 45 involved?"Even noting Naomi's breathless reaction to the name card, Chie had no idea. Akira's message, delivered like a formal speech, filled her with maternal amusement. You know how children speak50 so earnestly, so hurriedly, so endearingly about things that have no importance in an adult's mind? That's how she viewed him, as a child. It was how she viewed Naomi. Even though Naomi was eighteen and training endlessly in the arts 55 needed to make a good marriage, Chie had made no effort to find her a husband.Akira blushed."Depending on your response, I may stay in Japan. I've come to ask for Naomi's hand."60 Suddenly Chie felt the dampness of the night."Does Naomi know anything of your... ambitions?""We have an understanding. Please don't judge my candidacy by the unseemliness of this proposal. I65 ask directly because the use of a go-between takes much time. Either method comes down to the same thing: a matter of parental approval. If you give your consent, I become Naomi's yoshi. ${ }^{*}$ We'll live in the House of Fuji. Without your consent, I must go to 70 America, to secure a new home for my bride."Eager to make his point, he'd been looking her full in the face. Abruptly, his voice turned gentle. "I see I've startled you. My humble apologies. I'll take no more of your evening. My address is on my card. If 75 you don't wish to contact me, I'll reapproach you in two weeks' time. Until then, good night."He bowed and left. Taking her ease, with effortless grace, like a cat making off with a fish."Mother?" Chie heard Naomi's low voice and 80 turned from the door. "He has asked you?"The sight of Naomi's clear eyes, her dark brows gave Chie strength. Maybe his hopes were preposterous."Where did you meet such a fellow? Imagine! $\mathrm{He}$ 85 thinks he can marry the Fuji heir and take her to America all in the snap of his fingers!"Chie waited for Naomi's ripe laughter.Naomi was silent. She stood a full half minute looking straight into Chie's eyes. Finally, she spoke.90 "I met him at my literary meeting."Naomi turned to go back into the house, then stopped."Mother.""Yes?"95 "I mean to have him."\begin{itemize}\item a man who marries a woman of higher status and takes her family's name\end{itemize}

Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
Upon further reflection, I realize I focused too heavily on Chie's perception of Akira as childlike and earnest, leading me to conclude his greatest fear was being seen as immature. However, the passage places more emphasis on the inappropriate nature of his abrupt proposal. Akira himself acknowledges the "unseemliness" of his approach, suggesting his biggest concern is that Chie will deem his direct, untraditional proposal inappropriate given the social norms and expectations of the time.
Error Keywords:
 - Misinterpreted emphasis
 - Overlooked key detail
 - Focused on minor points
 - Drew incorrect conclusion
 - Proposal appropriateness
Solution:
The passage states that "Akira came directly, breaking all tradition" in his approach to Chie. It then questions if Chie would have been "more receptive" if Akira had "followed form" by going through his parents and a "go-between" to arrange the proposal. This establishes that Akira's direct approach violated social norms and expectations.
Later, Akira explicitly acknowledges the "unseemliness of this proposal" and explains he came directly only because going through intermediaries "takes much time." This shows Akira recognizes his proposal is inappropriate, but felt he had no choice given his time constraints. 
Chie's amusement at Akira's earnestness is mentioned, but it is a minor detail compared to the major emphasis placed on the inappropriate nature of his surprise visit and proposal. Akira's concerns about being seen as childish are never directly stated, while his fear of his proposal being deemed unseemly is made explicit.
Instructions:
1. Identify the main themes and points of emphasis in the passage. 
2. Locate any direct statements by characters that reveal their thoughts, feelings or motivations.
3. Differentiate between major and minor details in the passage.
4. Avoid making assumptions not directly supported by the text.
5. Eliminate answer choices that focus on minor details rather than central themes.
6. Select the answer choice that best aligns with the primary concerns and motivations expressed by characters in the passage.
Advice:
 - Always read the passage closely multiple times.
 - Focus on identifying and understanding the main ideas, themes and points of emphasis.
 - Pay special attention to direct statements that reveal characters' perspectives.
 - Be careful not to get distracted by minor or peripheral details.
 - Make sure your answer is directly supported by evidence from the text.
 - Avoid making inferences that are not explicitly backed up by the passage.
 - Eliminate answers that are plausible but not fully supported by the text.
 - Select the answer that ties in most closely to the central themes and concerns expressed in the passage.
## Assistant 2:
You're right, upon rereading the passage and reflecting on the key details, it's clear that Akira's primary fear is that Chie will consider his unorthodox proposal inappropriate given the social norms and traditions of the time.
The passage emphasizes how Akira "came directly, breaking all tradition" and ponders if Chie would have been "more receptive" if he had followed the proper protocols. Akira himself acknowledges the "unseemliness of this proposal" showing he recognizes it is improper.
While Chie's view of Akira as childlike is mentioned, it's more of a minor detail compared to the central focus on the inappropriate nature of his surprise visit and proposal. The other choices about Chie underestimating his sincerity or seeing the visit as an imposition are also not as strongly supported by the text.
Therefore, the best answer is that Akira most fears Chie will consider his proposal inappropriate, since this aligns closest with the main themes and concerns expressed in the passage.
