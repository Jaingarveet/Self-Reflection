Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to dance at a middle school dance [title] Keep things simple during your first dance. [step] If this is your first time dancing, don't try out complicated moves you might have seen in a music video. No one is expecting you to do so, and many of your classmates are probably thinking too much about how they look themselves.
Choices:
  A: Avoid trying out other moves or movements that all of your peers are unfamiliar with. Don't use these movements as excuses as they may be too awkward.
  B: Start building up your confidence and learn some of the moves before you try them out. Maybe you know what to do better than the person dancing to your right.
  C: [substeps] Try to blend in by mimicking your classmates' movements. Most djs at your middle school dance will probably play simple, high energy songs with an identifiable rhythm.
  D: Instead, try dancing with your hands or open arms as the band starts to play. [title] Use the opportunity to learn something new.
