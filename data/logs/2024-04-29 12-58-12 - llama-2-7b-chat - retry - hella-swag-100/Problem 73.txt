Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to decode binary numbers [title] Remember that in binary 1 is " on : [step] And 0 is " off. " [title] Choose the binary number that you want to decode. [title] Give each number a value, starting from the extreme right.
Choices:
  A: [substeps] For example, using the number 1001001 , 1=1, + 0=2, + 0=4, + 1=8, + 0=16, + 0=32, + 1=64. The number becomes : 32 + 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1.
  B: [title] Draw a circle around your decimal place (which is considered the edge of the decimal place) (the first place furthest from it). [title] Place the " on : [step] " digit on the left side of the decimal place.
  C: [title] Put a value next, and add either 1 or 2 values. [step] For example: " 1/1 (1/1/1 and 1/1 1/1.
  D: [step] But the content button will say " value " is set to 0 and the denominator when you set down the values. Example in numerary 1, the number (and the numerator) is " 10, " but 0 may still be the clue you've referenced.

[title] Choose the binary number you want to decode.

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly. Upon reflection, I realized that I misunderstood the instructions and answered based on my previous knowledge of decimal numbers. I will now provide the correct answer.

The most likely completion to the text is:

A: For example, using the number 1001001, 1=1, + 0=2, + 0=4, + 1=8, + 0=16, + 0=32, + 1=64. The number becomes: 32 + 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1.

Explanation:
In binary, each digit can have one of two values, either 1 or 0. The number 1001001 can be broken down by assigning a value to each digit based on its position from the right. Starting from the extreme right, the values are: 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0. The number becomes 32 + 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1.
## Result:
Agent Answer: None
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
