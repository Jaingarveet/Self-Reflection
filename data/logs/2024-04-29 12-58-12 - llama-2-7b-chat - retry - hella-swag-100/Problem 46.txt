Subtopic: Spread mulch
Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
A man dumps a wheelbarrow of mulch on the lawn. He rakes it out over the ground. [REDACTED]
Choices:
A: rakes up dirt over the mulch.
B: uses a leaf blower to blow it around.
C: brings another wheelbarrow full of mulch and rakes it out over the lawn.
D: scoops out a puddle with the rake.

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly. I realized that I misunderstood the situation and selected the wrong answer. To solve the problem, I will use the correct information provided in the question.

The correct answer is (C) brings another wheelbarrow full of mulch and rakes it out over the lawn. This is the most likely completion to the text, as the man is already on the lawn with a wheelbarrow of mulch and is raking it out over the ground. It makes sense that he would want to spread more mulch to improve the appearance of the lawn.
