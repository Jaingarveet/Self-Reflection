  C: are finished, one by one, they shake hands and salute.
  D: are done, they walk away and bow before it goes onto their shoulders.

Action: Answer("C")

Explanation:
Based on the context of the text, the most likely completion is option C: "are finished, one by one, they shake hands and salute." The text mentions that the men are lifting a heavy barbell in a competition, and then receive a score on their efforts. It makes sense that after they finish lifting, they would shake hands and salute each other as a sign of respect and sportsmanship. Option A, B, and D do not make as much sense in the context of the text.
