## Reflection on Incorrect Answer

**Error Keywords:**
* Misinterpretation 
* Comprehension error
* Focus on detail 
* Missing the main point
## Solving the Problem
1. **Identify the core argument of each person:** Peter argues for the necessity of immoral characters, while Yoko acknowledges their presence but highlights a change in their portrayal.
2. **Analyze the disagreement:** The central point of contention is whether modern children's stories "tend to have clearly immoral characters" (Option D). 
3. **Eliminate irrelevant options:** Options A, B, and C discuss the level of fear, overall quality, and the purpose of teaching consequences, which are not the main points of disagreement.
4. **Choose the correct option:** Option D accurately reflects the central disagreement between Peter and Yoko.
