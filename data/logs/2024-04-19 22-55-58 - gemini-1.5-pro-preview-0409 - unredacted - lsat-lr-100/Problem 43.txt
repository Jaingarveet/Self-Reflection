Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore

Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Law
Context: Ethicist: Marital vows often contain the promise to love "until death do us part." If "love" here refers to a feeling, then this promise makes no sense, for feelings are not within one's control, and a promise to do something not within one's control makes no sense. Thus, no one—including those making marital vows—should take "love" in this context to be referring to feelings.
Question: The ethicist's conclusion follows logically if which one of the following is assumed?
Choices:
  A: None of our feelings are within our control.
  B: People should not make promises to do something that is not within their control.
  C: "Love" can legitimately be taken to refer to something other than feelings.
  D: Promises should not be interpreted in such a way that they make no sense.
  E: Promises that cannot be kept do not make any sense.

## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:** I focused on the ethicist's reasoning about control over feelings but missed the key point about interpreting promises in a way that makes sense. The core assumption is about interpreting the meaning of the vow, not the nature of promises or feelings.
**Error Keywords:**
*   Misinterpretation of argument
*   Focus on irrelevant detail 
*   Ignoring key assumption
## Solving the Problem
1.  **Analyze the Conclusion:** The ethicist concludes that "love" in marital vows should not be interpreted as referring to feelings.
2.  **Identify the Reasoning:** This conclusion is based on the premise that promises to do something uncontrollable (like controlling feelings) are nonsensical.
3.  **Find the Assumption:** The assumption must bridge the gap between the premise and conclusion. It is that promises should not be interpreted in a way that makes them nonsensical.
## Instructions for Future Similar Problems
1.  **Identify the Conclusion and Premise:** Clearly understand the main points of the argument.
2.  **Focus on the Gap:** Determine what unstated assumption connects the premise to the conclusion.
3.  **Evaluate Answer Choices:** Choose the option that best represents the missing assumption needed for the argument to be valid.
4.  **Consider Alternative Interpretations:** Explore different ways the conclusion could be reached and the assumptions underlying each path.
## General Advice
*   **Read Carefully:** Pay close attention to the details of the argument and avoid jumping to conclusions.
*   **Identify Assumptions:** Be aware of unstated assumptions that arguments rely on.
*   **Consider Context:** Think about the broader context of the argument and the author's perspective.
*   **Practice Critical Thinking:** Regularly engage in exercises that challenge your reasoning and logic skills.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The ethicist's argument hinges on the idea that interpreting "love" as a feeling would make the vow nonsensical because feelings are uncontrollable. So, the assumption is that promises should be interpreted in a way that makes sense.
