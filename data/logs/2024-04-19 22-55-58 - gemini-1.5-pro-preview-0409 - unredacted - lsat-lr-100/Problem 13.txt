Topic: Law
Context: Economics professor: Marty's Pizza and Checkers Pizza are the two major pizza parlors in our town. Marty's sold coupon books including coupons good for one large plain pizza at any local pizza parlor, at Marty's expense. But Checkers refused to accept these coupons, even though they were redeemed by all other local pizza parlors. Accepting them would have cost Checkers nothing and would have satisfied those of its potential customers who had purchased the coupon books. This shows that Checkers's motive in refusing to accept the coupons was simply to hurt Marty's Pizza.
Question: Which one of the following, if assumed, enables the economics professor's conclusion to be properly drawn?
Choices:
  A: Any company that refuses to accept coupons issued by a competitor when doing so would satisfy some of the company's potential customers is motivated solely by the desire to hurt that competitor.
  B: Any company that wishes to hurt a competitor by refusing to accept coupons issued by that competitor will refuse to accept them even when accepting them would cost nothing and would satisfy its potential customers.
  C: At least one company has refused to accept coupons issued by its major local competitor simply in order to hurt that competitor, even though those coupons were accepted by all other local competitors.
  D: Any company that accepts its major competitor's coupons helps its competitor by doing so, even if it also satisfies its own actual or potential customers.
  E: If accepting coupons issued by a competitor would not enable a company to satisfy its actual or potential customers, then that company's refusal to accept the coupons is motivated by the desire to satisfy customers.

Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:** My reasoning focused on finding a direct link between refusing coupons and the intent to harm, overlooking the broader context of the professor's conclusion. The correct answer requires an assumption that encompasses the specific scenario of Checkers refusing coupons despite it costing them nothing and satisfying potential customers.
**Error Keywords:**
*   Misinterpretation of argument structure 
*   Overlooking key details 
*   Focusing on a single aspect while neglecting the bigger picture
## Step-by-Step Solution
1.  **Identify the Conclusion:** The professor concludes that Checkers' motive was to hurt Marty's.
2.  **Analyze the Context:** Checkers refused coupons that were accepted by other competitors, cost them nothing, and would have satisfied potential customers.
3.  **Evaluate Options Based on Context:**
    *   Option A aligns with the scenario by stating that refusing coupons under such circumstances indicates the motive to harm the competitor.
    *   Option B, while linking refusal with intent to harm, doesn't consider the specific context of cost and customer satisfaction.
    *   Options C, D, and E are irrelevant to the specific situation and conclusion.
4.  **Choose the Option that Supports the Conclusion:** Option A provides the necessary assumption for the professor's conclusion to be valid.
## Instructions for Future Similar Problems
1.  **Identify the Conclusion and Evidence:** Clearly understand the argument's main point and the evidence supporting it.
2.  **Analyze the Context and Assumptions:** Pay attention to the specific details and circumstances presented in the argument.
3.  **Evaluate Options Holistically:** Consider how each option relates to both the conclusion and the context, not just isolated aspects.
4.  **Choose the Option that Bridges the Gap:** Select the option that provides the missing link between the evidence and the conclusion, considering the specific context.
## General Advice for Similar Problems
*   **Read Carefully and Actively:** Pay close attention to the details and nuances of the argument.
*   **Consider the Bigger Picture:** Don't get caught up in isolated details; analyze how each element contributes to the overall argument.
*   **Think Critically and Evaluate Options Thoroughly:** Don't jump to conclusions; carefully assess each option's relevance and validity.
*   **Practice and Learn from Mistakes:** Regularly engage with similar problems to improve your analytical and logical reasoning skills.
