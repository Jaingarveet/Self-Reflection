Question: The monthly salary S of a shop assistant is the sum of a fixed salary of $500 plus 5% of all monthly sales. What should the monthly sales be so that her monthly salary reaches $1500?
Choices:
  A: $50000
  B: $40000
  C: $30000
  D: $20000
  E: None of these
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Let x be the monthly sales.
Then, S = $500 + 0.05x.
To find x when S = $1500:
$1500 = $500 + 0.05x
$1000 = 0.05x
x = $1000 / 0.05
x = $20000
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
