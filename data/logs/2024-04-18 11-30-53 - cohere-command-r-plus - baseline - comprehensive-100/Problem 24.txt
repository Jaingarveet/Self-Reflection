Context: Of the eight students—George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert—in a seminar, exactly six will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.

Choices:
  A: Helen, George, and Nina
  B: Irving, Robert, and Helen
  C: Nina, Helen, and Olivia
  D: Olivia, Robert, and Irving
  E: Robert, George, and Helen
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then the remaining six students giving reports are George, Helen, Irving, Nina, Olivia, and Robert.

We are told that Tuesday is the only day George can give a report, and this must be during the morning session as Robert and Olivia cannot give afternoon reports.

We are also told that if Nina gives a report, then Helen and Irving must give reports the next day. Therefore, Nina can give a report on Monday or Tuesday, with Helen and Irving giving reports on Tuesday afternoon and Wednesday morning.

This means that the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday could be given by Nina, George, and Helen, respectively, which is choice A.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
