Question: The average (arithmetic mean) of the weight of 10 vehicles is 12.2 tons. The average weight of the group of vehicles increased by 2.6 tons after a new heavy duty truck was added to the group? What is the weight in tons of the heavy duty truck?
Choices:
  A: 40.8
  B: 41.6
  C: 42.2
  D: 43.5
  E: 44.8
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The total weight of the 10 vehicles is 10 x 12.2 = 122 tons.
After adding the new truck, the total weight increased to (10 + 2.6) x 12.2 = 153.44 tons.
So, the weight of the heavy-duty truck = 153.44 - 122 = 31.44 tons.
