# Model: cohere-command-r-plus | Agent: baseline | Exam: comprehensive-100 | Problem 96 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Medicine.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:

  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")

Subtopic: Biochemistry
Question: Protein structure not lost in denaturation is ?
Choices:
  A: Primary structure
  B: Secondary structure
  C: Teiary structure
  D: Quaternary structure
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Protein structure refers to the different levels of organization of a protein molecule.
Primary structure refers to the linear sequence of amino acids, which is determined by the nucleic acid sequence of the gene that codes for the protein.
Secondary structure refers to local spatial patterns in the polypeptide chain, including alpha helices and beta sheets.
Tertiary structure refers to the three-dimensional shape of a single polypeptide chain, including all the atoms in that chain.
Quaternary structure refers to the structure formed by multiple polypeptide chains, either from the same protein or from different proteins, that function as a multimer.

Denaturation refers to the process by which a protein loses its native tertiary or quaternary structure, typically due to exposure to extreme environmental conditions such as heat, acid, or chemical treatment. This process generally results in the loss of the protein's biological activity.

Therefore, the correct answer is that the primary structure of a protein is not lost during denaturation.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
