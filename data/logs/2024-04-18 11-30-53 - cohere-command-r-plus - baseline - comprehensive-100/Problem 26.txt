Context: A shopping center has exactly seven spaces—space 1 through space 7—arranged in a straight row. Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
Question: If the shoe store is in space 2, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: The optometrist is in space 5.
  B: The pharmacy is in space 1.
  C: A restaurant is in space 3.
  D: The toy store is in space 6.
  E: The veterinarian is in space 4.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants must be at the other end. As the shoe store is in space 2, the pharmacy and the restaurant can only be in spaces 1 and 7, respectively. This means that the optometrist cannot be in space 5, eliminating choice A. 

The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, which means that these three businesses must occupy spaces 1, 2, and/or 3. This leaves spaces 6 and 7 for the remaining two businesses. Therefore, choices D and E can be eliminated. 

The shoe store is already in space 2, and the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. This means that a restaurant cannot be in space 3, eliminating choice C. 

Through a process of elimination, we are left with choice B as the correct answer.

Answer: choice B is the only option that could be true if the shoe store is in space 2.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
