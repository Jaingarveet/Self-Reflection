Question: In planning maintenance for a city's infrastructure, a civil engineer estimates that, starting from the present, the population of the city will decrease by 10 percent every 20 years. If the present population of the city is 50,000, which of the following expressions represents the engineer's estimate of the population of the city $t$ years from now?
Choices:
  A: $50,000(0.1)^{20 t}$
  B: $50,000(0.1)^{\frac{t}{20}}$
  C: $50,000(0.9)^{20 t}$
  D: $50,000(0.9)^{\frac{t}{20}}$
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The population decreases by 10% every 20 years, which means in one year, the population decreases by $\frac{10}{20}=5\%$. So, the population after one year is $95\%=0.95$ of the original population.

Therefore, the population after $t$ years is $50,000(0.95)^t$

Now, we need to express this in terms of 20 years. So, $t=\frac{1}{20}*20t=0.05*20t$

Substituting, we get the population after $t$ years is $50,000(0.95)^{0.05*20t}=50,000(0.95^{20t})^0.05=50,000(0.9975)^{20t}$

So, the final answer is $50,000(0.9975)^{20t}$, which can be written as $50,000(0.9975^5)^{4t}$, and $(0.9975)^5\approx0.95$

Therefore, the expression that best represents the engineer's estimate is $50,000(0.95)^{4t}$.
