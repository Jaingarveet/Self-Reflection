# Model: cohere-command-r-plus | Agent: baseline | Exam: comprehensive-100 | Problem 69 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:
Topic: Geography
Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: $$\begin{aligned}& 2 x-3 y=-14 \\& 3 x-2 y=-6\end{aligned}$$If $(x, y)$ is a solution to the system of equations above, what is the value of $x-y$ ?
Choices:
  A: -20
  B: $\quad-8$
  C: -4
  D: 8
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
We can solve this system of equations using elimination.
Multiplying the first equation by 3 and the second equation by 2, we get:
$$\begin{aligned}
& 6 x-9 y=-42 \\
& 6 x-4 y=-12
\end{aligned}$$

Subtracting the equations eliminates the $x$ variable:
$$9 y - 4 y = -42 - (-12)$$
$$5 y = -30$$
$$y = -6$$

Now, we can find the value of $x$ by substituting $y = -6$ into either equation:
$$2x - 3(-6) = -14$$
$$2x + 18 = -14$$
$$2x = -32$$
$$x = -16$$

Therefore, $x - y = -16 - (-6) = -10$.

Choice B is the closest to the correct answer, but it is not exactly right.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
