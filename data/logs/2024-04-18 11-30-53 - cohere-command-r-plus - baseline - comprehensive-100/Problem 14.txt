Topic: Logic
Context: A company has a 6-story office building.The company's finance department, planning department, administration department, sales department, human resources department, and research and development department work here, and each department occupies one of the floors.Known? (1) The two floors of the human resources department and the sales department are not adjacent; (2) The finance department is on the next floor of the planning department; (3) The floor of the administrative department is above the planning department, but in the manpower Below the Resources Department.
Question: If the Human Resources Department is not at the upper level of the Administration Department, which of the following may be correct?
Choices:
  A: The sales department is on the upper level of the R & D department
  B: The sales department is one level above the administrative department
  C: The sales department is at the next level of the planning department
  D: Sales Department is on the second floor
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
From the known information, we can deduce the relative positions of the finance, planning, administration, and human resources departments, but not the exact floors they are on.

Given that the human resources department is not directly above the administration department, we can determine the following:

- The sales department cannot be below the administration department (due to known information 1 and 3).
- The research and development (R&D) department must be on a different floor than the administration department (as they cannot be on the same floor as the sales or human resources departments).

Therefore, the correct answer is:

A: The sales department is on the upper level of the R&D department.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
