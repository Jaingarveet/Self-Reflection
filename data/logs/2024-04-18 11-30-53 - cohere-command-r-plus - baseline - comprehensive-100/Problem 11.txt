Context: In recent years, China's housing prices have risen rapidly.In the fourth quarter of 2004, various government departments issued a number of measures to suppress the excessively rapid growth of housing prices, but national housing prices continued to rise in the first quarter of 2005.It was asserted that rising land prices are the chief culprit in soaring housing prices.
Question: Which of the following, if true, is the most doubtful of an assertion?
Choices:
  A: Shanghai's housing prices in the first quarter of 2005 increased by 19.1% over the same period last year, and land prices rose by 6.53%.
  B: Residential prices in Beijing increased by 7.2% in the first quarter of 2005 compared with the same period last year, and residential land prices rose by 0.37%.
  C: The chairman of Huayuan Real Estate believes that as land development costs increase, house prices will definitely increase.
  D: The chairman of Yongtai Development Company said? "The skyrocketing housing prices are because supply has not kept up with demand."
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The argument claims that rising land prices are the main driver of soaring housing prices. To cast doubt on this assertion, we should look for evidence that housing prices can rise independently of land prices. 

Choice A provides data showing that Shanghai's housing prices rose more sharply than land prices, which weakens the argument's claim. This choice is the most effective at raising doubt about the assertion.

Answer: The correct answer is "A".
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: B
