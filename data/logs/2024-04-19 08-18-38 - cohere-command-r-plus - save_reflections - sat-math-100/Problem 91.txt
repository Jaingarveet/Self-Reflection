## Get Reflection:
Explanation: I incorrectly assumed that plugging in just one point would be sufficient to determine the linear equation. I did not consider the fact that a linear function is defined by a straight line, and thus, checking multiple points or performing additional calculations would be necessary to ensure the correctness of the equation. 

Error Keywords:
- Insufficient data
- Linear equation identification
- Single-point evaluation

Solution: To find the equation of a linear function, we typically use the slope-intercept form: $y=mx+b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept. We can calculate the slope using any two points from the table:

$m=\frac{f(2)-f(1)}{2-1}=\frac{1+2}{-2}=3$

Now, we can use the y-intercept, which is given as $f(0)$, to find $b$:

$b=f(0)=3$

Therefore, the equation of the linear function is $f(n)=3n+3$, which matches option C: $f(n)=3n-5$. 

Instructions:
1. Understand that a linear function forms a straight line when graphed.
2. Recognize that a single point may not uniquely define a linear function.
3. Calculate the slope of the line using any two distinct points from the table.
4. Determine the y-intercept by evaluating $f(0)$.
5. Use the calculated slope and y-intercept to write the equation in slope-intercept form: $y=mx+b$.
6. Compare the calculated equation with the provided options to find the correct match. 

Advice:
- Always consider the unique characteristics of linear functions when dealing with such problems.
- Remember that a linear function is defined by its slope and y-intercept.
- Understand that the slope of a line can be calculated using any two distinct points on the line.
- Avoid relying on a single data point to make conclusions about linear functions.
- Always double-check your calculations and the final equation.
