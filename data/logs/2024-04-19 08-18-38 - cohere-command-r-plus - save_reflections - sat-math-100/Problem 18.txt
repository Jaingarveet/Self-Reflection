## Get Reflection:
Explanation: 
I incorrectly applied the power rule of indices. 
I incorrectly assumed that $(9^3)^{1/4}$ equals $\sqrt[4]{9^3}$, but the correct simplification is $9^{3/4} = 3 \sqrt{3}$. 
Error Keywords:
- Rule misapplication
- Index rule error
- Incorrect simplification

Solution: 
$9^{3/4}$ can be rewritten as $9^{1/4} * 9^{1/2} = \sqrt[4]{9} * \sqrt{9} = 3 * 3^{1/2} = 3 \sqrt{3}$. 

Instructions: 
1. Identify the expression you need to simplify: $9^{3/4}$. 
2. Recognize that you can rewrite $9^{3/4}$ as $9^{1/4} * 9^{1/2}$. 
3. Simplify $9^{1/4}$ to $\sqrt[4]{9}$ and $9^{1/2}$ to $\sqrt{9}$. 
4. Calculate $\sqrt[4]{9} = 3$ and $\sqrt{9} = 3^{1/2} = 3\sqrt{3}$. 
5. Multiply $3$ and $3\sqrt{3}$ to get $3\sqrt{3}$. 

Advice: 
- Familiarize yourself with index rules and practice their application. 
- Be cautious when simplifying expressions with multiple indices; break down the problem step-by-step. 
- Double-check your understanding of the rules and their application. 
- Practice similar problems to reinforce your understanding and application of index rules.
