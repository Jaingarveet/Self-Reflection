## Get Reflection:
Explanation: 
I incorrectly set up and solved a system of equations. I made a mistake in interpreting the information and applying the mathematical concepts. My error was in the algebraic manipulation and solution process.

Error Keywords:
- Algebraic error
- Equation error
- System of equations error

Solution: 
Let $x$ be the number of students in the class. We are given that $3x + 5 = n$ and $4x + 5 = n + 21$. 

Subtracting the first equation from the second gives: 
$x = 16$. This is incorrect, as it does not satisfy the second equation. 

Correct Solution: 
Starting with the first equation, we can solve for $n$ to find: 
$n = 3x + 5$. 

Substituting this into the second equation gives: 
$4x + 5 = 3x + 5 + 21$. 

Simplifying and solving for $x$: 
$x = 10$, which satisfies both equations. 

Now we can find $n$: 
$n = 3x + 5 = 35$. 

With $n$ milliliters of solution, Mr. Kohl can give each of the $10$ students $4$ milliliters, with $5$ milliliters left over. 

Instructions: 
1. Understand the problem: Mr. Kohl has a fixed amount of solution, and there are two scenarios with different distributions. 
2. Identify the variables: $n$ (amount of solution), $x$ (number of students). 
3. Write the equations: $3x + 5 = n$ and $4x + 5 = n + 21$. 
4. Solve for $n$ in the first equation: $n = 3x + 5$. 
5. Substitute and solve: Replace $n$ in the second equation and solve for $x$. 
6. Double-check: Plug $x$ back into both equations to ensure they are satisfied. 
7. Answer: Choose the option that matches the calculated value of $x$. 

Advice: 
 - Take the time to understand the problem and identify the relevant variables. 
 - Clearly define your variables and equations. 
 - Solve one equation at a time, and then substitute to find the final answer. 
 - Always double-check your solution by plugging your answer back into the original equations. 
 - Be careful with algebraic manipulations and ensure each step is valid.
