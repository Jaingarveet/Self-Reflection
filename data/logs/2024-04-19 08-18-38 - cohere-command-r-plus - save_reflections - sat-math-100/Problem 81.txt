## Get Reflection:
Explanation: I incorrectly expanded the squared terms and made a substitution error. I should have substituted $a^2 + b^2$ for $z$ and $ab$ for $y$ directly into the choices without expanding the squared terms. 

Error Keywords:
- Algebra error
- Expansion error
- Substitution error

Solution: 

Given: $a^{2}+b^{2}=z$ and $ab=y$

We want to find an expression equivalent to $4z + 8y$:

Choice A: $4(a^2 + b^2) + 8ab = 4z + 8y$ (Substitute $z$ and $y$)

Choice B: $4(a^2 + b^2) + 4(ab) = 4z + 4y$ (Substitute $z$ and $y$)

Choice C: $16(a^2 + b^2) + 16(ab) = 16z + 16y$ (Substitute $z$ and $y$)

Choice D: $16(a^2 + b^2) + 64(ab) = 16z + 64y$ (Substitute $z$ and $y$)

The correct answer is choice B, which simplifies to $4z + 4y$.

Instructions:

1. Identify the given equations: $a^2 + b^2 = z$ and $ab = y$.
2. Understand the task: Find the expression equivalent to $4z + 8y$.
3. Substitute $z$ and $y$ directly into the choices without expanding the squared terms.
4. Simplify each choice to match the form $4z + 8y$, $4z + 4y$, $16z + 16y$, etc.
5. Choose the answer that matches the simplified expression.

Advice:

- Read and understand the question carefully.
- Identify the given equations and the task at hand.
- Substitute the given values directly without unnecessary expansion or manipulation.
- Simplify each choice step-by-step to identify the correct expression.
- Avoid overcomplicating the problem; sometimes the simplest approach is the best.
