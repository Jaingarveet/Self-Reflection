Choices:
  A: 69:91
  B: 59:91
  C: 59:90
  D: 59:91

## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's approach this step-by-step:
1. In alloy X, the ratio of zinc to copper is 6:9. This means in 15 parts of alloy X, 6 parts are zinc and 9 parts are copper.
   - In 40 grams of alloy X, there are (40 * 6/15) = 16 grams of zinc and (40 * 9/15) = 24 grams of copper.
2. In alloy Y, the ratio of zinc to copper is 7:11. This means in 18 parts of alloy Y, 7 parts are zinc and 11 parts are copper. 
   - In 60 grams of alloy Y, there are (60 * 7/18) = 23.33 grams of zinc and (60 * 11/18) = 36.67 grams of copper.
3. In the new alloy Z formed by mixing 40 grams of X and 60 grams of Y:
   - Total zinc = 16 + 23.33 = 39.33 grams
   - Total copper = 24 + 36.67 = 60.67 grams
4. The ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z is 39.33 : 60.67. 
   Simplifying this ratio, we get 59 : 91.
Therefore, the correct answer is B: 59:91.
Action: Answer("B")
