## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) Each picket is 1/2 inch wide, and there are x pickets in total.
   So the total width of all the pickets is (1/2)x inches.
2) There are 6 inches of space between each pair of pickets. 
   There is one less space than the number of pickets.
   So the total space between pickets is 6(x-1) inches.
3) The total length of the fence is the width of the pickets plus the space between them.
   Total length = (1/2)x + 6(x-1) inches
                = (1/2)x + 6x - 6 inches
                = (13/2)x - 6 inches
4) We need to convert the length from inches to feet.
   There are 12 inches in a foot.
   So dividing the length in inches by 12 gives the length in feet:
   Length in feet = ((13/2)x - 6) / 12
                  = (13x - 12) / 24 feet
Looking at the answer choices, the correct answer is E: (13x-12)/24
Action: Answer("E")
## Result:
Agent Answer: E
Correct Answer: E
