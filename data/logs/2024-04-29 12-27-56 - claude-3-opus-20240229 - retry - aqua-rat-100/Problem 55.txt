## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The man's speed in still water is 4 kmph. Let's call the speed of the current x kmph.
2. When rowing against the current, the man's effective speed is his rowing speed minus the current speed. So:
   4 - x = 2
   Solving this, x = 2 kmph. The current speed is 2 kmph.
3. When rowing with the current, the man's speed will be his rowing speed plus the current speed. So his speed along the current is:
   4 + 2 = 6 kmph
Therefore, the man's rate along the current is 6 kmph.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: E
Score: 0
