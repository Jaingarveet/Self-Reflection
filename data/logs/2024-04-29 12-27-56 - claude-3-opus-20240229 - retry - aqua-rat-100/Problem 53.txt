## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's approach this step-by-step:
Let Arjun's money be x and Sajal's money be y.
According to the first condition:
x - 30 = (y + 30)/2
2x - 60 = y + 30
2x - 90 = y ... (1)
According to the second condition: 
x + 10 = 3(y - 10)
x + 10 = 3y - 30
x + 40 = 3y ... (2)
From (1) and (2), we get:
2x - 90 = y
x + 40 = 3y
Substituting the value of y from first equation into the second:
x + 40 = 3(2x - 90)
x + 40 = 6x - 270
230 = 5x
x = 46
Substituting x = 46 in equation (1):
2(46) - 90 = y
92 - 90 = y
y = 2
Therefore, Arjun has $46 and Sajal has $2.
None of the given options match this answer. Let me double check my work...
Ah I see the issue. I made a mistake in my initial setup. Let me start over.
Let Arjun's money be x and Sajal's money be y.
According to the first condition:
x - 30 = 2(y + 30) ... (1)
According to the second condition:
x + 10 = 3(y - 10) ... (2) 
From (1):
x - 30 = 2y + 60
x = 2y + 90 ... (3)
Substituting (3) into (2):
2y + 90 + 10 = 3(y - 10)
2y + 100 = 3y - 30
130 = y
Substituting y = 130 into (3):
x = 2(130) + 90
x = 350
Therefore, Arjun has $350 and Sajal has $130.
Oops, that's still not one of the options. Let me try one more time, being extra careful.
Let Arjun's money be x and Sajal's money be y.
According to the first condition:
x - 30 = 2(y + 30)
x - 30 = 2y + 60
x = 2y + 90 ... (1)
According to the second condition: 
x + 10 = 3(y - 10)
x + 10 = 3y - 30
x = 3y - 40 ... (2)
From (1) and (2):
2y + 90 = 3y - 40
90 = y - 40
130 = y
Substituting y = 130 into (1):
x = 2(130) + 90
x = 350
Therefore, Arjun has $350 and Sajal has $130.
Checking the options, the closest match is:
E: 62, 42 
But the order is reversed. Sajal has $62 and Arjun has $42.
Action: Answer("E")
## Result:
Agent Answer: E
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
