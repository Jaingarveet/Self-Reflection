## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Let P = the amount of falafel in one pita bread
   Let R = the amount of falafel in one roll
   Let B = the amount of falafel in one baguette
2) From the first sentence: 6P = 2R
   This means: P = R/3  (one pita has one third the falafel of a roll)
3) From the second sentence: 3R = 5B  
   This means: R = 5B/3  (one roll has 5/3 the falafel of a baguette)
4) Substituting the value of R from step 3 into the equation from step 2:
   P = (5B/3)/3 = 5B/9  (one pita has 5/9 the falafel of a baguette)
5) The question asks: 2B = ?P
   We can set up the equation: 2B = xP, where x is the number we're looking for.
6) Substituting the value of P from step 4 into the equation from step 5:
   2B = x(5B/9)
7) Solving for x:
   18B = 5Bx
   18 = 5x
   x = 18/5 = 3.6
Therefore, 2 baguettes contain the same amount of falafel as 3.6 pita breads.
Looking at the choices, the closest answer is C: 3.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
