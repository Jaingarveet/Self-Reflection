## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Topic: Math
Question: Amy is organizing her bookshelves and finds that she has 10 different types of books. She then codes each book with either a single letter or a pair of two different letters. If each type of book is uniquely represented by either a single letter or pair of letters, what is the smallest number of letters Amy will need to create the codes for all 10 types of books? (Assume the order of letters in a pair does not matter.)
Choices:
  A: 3
  B: 4
  C: 5
  D: 10
  E: 20

## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) If Amy uses only single letters, she would need 10 different letters to uniquely code the 10 types of books. 
2) However, Amy can also use pairs of two different letters. Let's see how many letters she would need in this case.
3) Suppose Amy has n letters. She can make n different single letter codes. 
4) For the pair codes, she can choose any 2 letters from the n letters, and the order doesn't matter. This is a combination problem. The number of ways to choose 2 items from n items is given by the formula:
   $\binom{n}{2} = \frac{n!}{2!(n-2)!} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}$
5) So, the total number of unique codes (single letter + pair codes) is:
   $n + \frac{n(n-1)}{2}$
6) We need this total to be at least 10 (for the 10 types of books). Let's try some values of n:
   For n = 3: $3 + \frac{3(3-1)}{2} = 3 + 3 = 6$ (not enough)
   
   For n = 4: $4 + \frac{4(4-1)}{2} = 4 + 6 = 10$ (just right!)
   
   For n = 5: $5 + \frac{5(5-1)}{2} = 5 + 10 = 15$ (more than needed)
7) Therefore, the smallest number of letters needed is 4.
Action: Answer("B")
