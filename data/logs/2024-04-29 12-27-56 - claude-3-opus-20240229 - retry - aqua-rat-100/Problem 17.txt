## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) The company produces 420 components per month. So in a year, they produce:
   420 * 12 = 5040 components
2) The production cost per component is $110. So the total yearly production cost is:
   5040 * $110 = $554,400
3) They want a yearly profit of at least $626,400. Profit is revenue minus costs. 
   So if we let the selling price per component be x, then we need:
   (5040 * x) - $554,400 >= $626,400
4) Solving this inequality:
   5040x - 554400 >= 626400
   5040x >= 1180800
   x >= 1180800 / 5040
   x >= 234.29
5) So the minimum selling price needs to be at least $234.29. 
   Looking at the choices, the first price that's at least this much is $240.
Therefore, the minimum selling price that guarantees the desired profit is $240.
Action: Answer("C")
