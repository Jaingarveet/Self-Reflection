## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) Points A, B, C, D lie on the circumference of a circle in that order.
2) Minor arc AC is 160°. Since B bisects minor arc AC, that means:
   Minor arc AB = Minor arc BC = 160° / 2 = 80°
3) Minor arc BD is given as 150°. 
4) To find minor arc AD, we can subtract minor arc BD from the full circle (360°):
   Minor arc AD = 360° - Minor arc BD
                = 360° - 150° 
                = 210°
5) Alternatively, we could have added minor arc AB and minor arc BC to get minor arc AC, then added minor arc CD:
   Minor arc AD = Minor arc AB + Minor arc BC + Minor arc CD
                = 80° + 80° + (360° - 160° - 150°) 
                = 160° + 50°
                = 210°
Both methods give the same result. The closest answer choice is 220°.
Action: Answer("E")
## Result:
Agent Answer: E
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
