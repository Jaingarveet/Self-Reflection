## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")

Choices:
  A: 550
  B: 570
  C: 600
  D: 700
  E: none of these

## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) Let the total number of students be x. 
   We are told x > 501.
2) 20% of the students took physics. In other words, the number of students who took physics must be a whole number. 
   Let this number be p.
   p = 0.20x
   For p to be a whole number, x must be a multiple of 5.
3) Similarly, 28% took math. The number of math students, m, must also be a whole number.
   m = 0.28x
   For m to be a whole number, x must be a multiple of 25.
4) So, x must be a multiple of both 5 and 25. In other words, x must be a multiple of their least common multiple (LCM).
   LCM(5, 25) = 25
5) The least value of x that satisfies both conditions (x > 501 and x is a multiple of 25) is 525.
However, 525 is not one of the given choices. The least possible value from the given choices is 550.
Action: Answer("A")
