## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's approach this step-by-step:
1. Let the total number of matches played by Sachin be x.
2. His current average is 51. Let his current total runs be R. Then:
   R / x = 51
   R = 51x
3. In the finals, he scores 78 more runs. So his new total is R + 78.
4. His new average is 54. So:
   (R + 78) / (x + 1) = 54
5. Substituting R = 51x:
   (51x + 78) / (x + 1) = 54
6. Cross multiply:
   51x + 78 = 54x + 54
7. Simplify:
   78 = 3x + 54
   24 = 3x
   x = 8
Therefore, the total number of matches played by Sachin in this season is 8.
Action: Answer("B")
