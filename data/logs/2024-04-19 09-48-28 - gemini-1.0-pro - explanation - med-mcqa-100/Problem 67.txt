Explanation:
## Assistant 2:
I understand. I will use my previous reflection to answer this question correctly.
**Reflection:**
* **Problem:** I incorrectly identified the major complication of cyst-gastrostomy for pseudo pancreatic cyst as "Hemorrhage."
* **Solution:** I need to carefully review the potential complications of this procedure and identify the most likely and severe one.
* **Correct Answer:** The major complication of cyst-gastrostomy for pseudo pancreatic cyst is **C: Fistula**.
**Thought Process:**
* Cyst-gastrostomy is a surgical procedure that creates a connection between a pancreatic cyst and the stomach.
* A fistula is an abnormal connection between two organs or vessels.
* In the case of cyst-gastrostomy, a fistula can develop between the pancreatic cyst and the stomach, the small intestine, or the colon.
* This can lead to leakage of pancreatic enzymes and digestive juices, causing inflammation, infection, and other complications.
* While other complications like infection, obstruction, and hemorrhage can occur, they are less frequent and severe compared to fistula formation.
**Action:** Answer("C") 
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
