Explanation:
## Assistant 2:
I apologize for the previous incorrect answer. I am still under development and learning to improve my accuracy. 
I understand that the question is asking about the start date of a mental health program. However, the specific program is not mentioned in the question. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer without additional context. 
To improve my response, I will:
1. **Seek clarification:** If possible, I will ask the user for more information about the specific mental health program they are referring to. This will help me narrow down the possible start dates and provide a more accurate answer.
2. **Consider the context:** I will take into account any additional information provided in the question or surrounding text. This may include clues about the location, target population, or type of mental health program.
3. **Consult reliable sources:** If I am still unable to determine the start date based on the available information, I will consult reliable sources such as government websites, academic journals, or reputable news articles.
By following these steps, I aim to provide more accurate and informative responses in the future. 
However, for this specific question, I am unable to provide an answer without additional context.
