Context: Mike: Tom did not tell me that I could use his computer, but it would not be wrong for me to use it anyway. Last week Tom used Mary's bicycle even though she had not told him he could use it.
Question: Which one of the following principles, if valid, would most help to justif Y Mike's reasoning?
Choices:
  A: Using the possessions of others without their permission is not always theft.
  B: Generally one should tell the truth, but there are cases in which it is permissible not to.
  C: If people have used your property without your permission, it is not wrong for you to use their property without their permission.
  D: It is permissible to treat people in a way that is siruilar to the way in which they have treated others.
  E: Using another person's property is wrong if the person is harmed by that use.
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Identify the key action or decision being made.
2. Identify the reasoning or justification given for that action/decision. 
3. Determine if the reasoning relies on a specific example or a general principle.
4. If the reasoning uses a specific example, ask if there is a broader principle that could justify it.
5. Look for an answer choice that matches the general principle, not just the specific example.
6. Eliminate answer choices that are irrelevant to the key principle being applied.
7. Select the answer that best captures the broadest relevant principle justifying the reasoning.
## Assistant 2:
Let's break this down step-by-step:
1. The key action is Mike using Tom's computer without permission. 
2. Mike's justification is that Tom previously used Mary's bicycle without her permission. So Mike thinks it's okay for him to do the same to Tom.
3. Mike's reasoning relies on a specific example (Tom using Mary's bike) rather than stating a general principle.
4. The broader principle that could justify Mike's reasoning is something like: "It's okay to treat someone the same way they have treated others." 
5. Looking at the answer choices:
A) This is too broad, not specifically justifying Mike's reasoning.
B) Not relevant to Mike's reasoning.
C) Closer, but too narrowly focused on using property without permission. 
D) This captures the key principle - it's okay to treat people similarly to how they've treated others. 
E) Not Mike's reasoning. He doesn't consider if Tom is harmed.
6. A, B, C, and E don't match the general principle behind Mike's reasoning.
7. Answer D best states the broad principle that if someone treats others a certain way, it's okay to treat them that same way. This most closely matches the logic Mike uses to justify using Tom's computer.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
