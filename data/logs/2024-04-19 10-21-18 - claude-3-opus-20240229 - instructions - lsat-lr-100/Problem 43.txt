Topic: Law
Context: Ethicist: Marital vows often contain the promise to love "until death do us part." If "love" here refers to a feeling, then this promise makes no sense, for feelings are not within one's control, and a promise to do something not within one's control makes no sense. Thus, no one—including those making marital vows—should take "love" in this context to be referring to feelings.
Question: The ethicist's conclusion follows logically if which one of the following is assumed?
Choices:
  A: None of our feelings are within our control.
  B: People should not make promises to do something that is not within their control.
  C: "Love" can legitimately be taken to refer to something other than feelings.
  D: Promises should not be interpreted in such a way that they make no sense.
  E: Promises that cannot be kept do not make any sense.
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Read the argument carefully and identify the conclusion.
2. Identify the explicit premises stated in the argument.
3. Look for the gap between the stated premises and the conclusion.
4. Determine what unstated premise is required to bridge this gap and make the conclusion follow logically.
5. Select the answer choice that best captures this necessary assumption.
## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The conclusion is that no one should take "love" in marital vows to be referring to feelings.
2. The explicit premises are:
   - Marital vows often promise to love "until death do us part"
   - If "love" refers to a feeling, this promise makes no sense
   - Feelings are not within one's control
   - A promise to do something not within one's control makes no sense
3. There is a gap between the premises and the conclusion. The premises talk about what happens if love refers to feelings, but they don't explicitly state that therefore love must refer to something else.
4. To bridge this gap, we need an unstated premise like: If interpreting a promise one way makes the promise nonsensical, then the promise should be interpreted differently.
5. Looking at the answer choices:
   A is too broad - the argument is only about feelings of love, not all feelings.
   B is close, but a bit too strong - the argument allows that people might make such promises, it just says they shouldn't be interpreted that way.
   C captures the necessary assumption - if love can't refer to feelings, it must be able to refer to something else for the vows to make sense.
   D matches the unstated premise I identified in step 4.
   E is too strong - the argument is about interpreting promises, not about whether impossible promises make sense.
So I think the best answer is D - the argument assumes that promises should be interpreted in a way that makes sense.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
