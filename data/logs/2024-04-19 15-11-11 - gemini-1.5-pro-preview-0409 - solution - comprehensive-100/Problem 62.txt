## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: $$\begin{array}{r}3 x+4 y=-23 \\2 y-x=-19\end{array}$$What is the solution $(x, y)$ to the system of equations above?
Choices:
  A: $(-5,-2)$
  B: $(3,-8)$
  C: $(4,-6)$
  D: $(9,-6)$
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
Following the initial steps correctly:
1. We multiplied the second equation by 3 to eliminate x:
$$\begin{array}{r}3 x+4 y=-23 \\ 6 y-3 x=-57\end{array}$$
2. We added the two equations together: 
$$10y = -80$$
3. We solved for y:
$$y = -8$$
4. Now, substitute y = -8 back into the first equation:
$$3x + 4(-8) = -23$$
5. Solve for x, paying close attention to the signs:
$$3x - 32 = -23$$
$$3x = 9$$
$$x = 3$$
Therefore, the correct solution is (3, -8).
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The reflection points out the correct solution and the steps to get there. 
The key is to carefully solve for x after finding y, paying attention to the signs to avoid errors.
Action: Answer("B")
