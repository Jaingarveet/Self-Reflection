## Assistant 2:
## Reflection on Previous Attempt:
My previous error likely stemmed from not fully considering the constraint of Nina's report requiring Helen and Irving to present the next day, unless it was Wednesday. This oversight probably led me to a solution that violated this condition. 
## Answering the Question:
**Analysis of Choices:**
* **A: Helen, George, Nina:** This option violates the condition that if Nina presents, Helen and Irving must present the next day. 
* **B: Irving, Robert, and Helen:** This option violates the condition that Robert cannot give an afternoon report, as he would have to present in the afternoon on Tuesday due to George's Tuesday presentation.
* **C: Nina, Helen, and Olivia:** This option is valid as Nina presents on Monday, followed by Helen and Irving on Tuesday (fulfilling the condition), and Olivia can present on Wednesday morning.
* **D: Olivia, Robert, and Irving:** This option violates the condition that Robert cannot give an afternoon report.
* **E: Robert, George, and Helen:** This option violates the condition that Robert cannot give an afternoon report.
**Conclusion:**
Based on the analysis, only option C fulfills all the given conditions.
**Action: Answer("C")**
