Context: An administrator must assign parking spaces to six new employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young. Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
Question: For how many of the six new employees is the assignment of a parking space limited to one of only two possible spaces?
Choices:
  A: none

## Assistant 2:
## Reflection on Previous Attempt:
Unfortunately, I don't have access to my past responses and your feedback on them. However, I can still analyze the problem step-by-step and provide the best possible answer based on the given context and constraints. 
## Analyzing the Parking Space Assignment:
1. **Robertson's Constraint:**  Must be assigned #1, #2, #3, or #4, and must have a higher number than Young. This leaves only two possibilities for Robertson: **#3 or #4**.
2. **Young & Togowa Constraint:** Young must have a higher number than Togowa. Since Robertson takes either #3 or #4, and Young needs a higher number, this leaves only **#5 or #6** for Young. Consequently, Togowa is limited to **#1 or #2**.
3. **Xu & Souza Constraint:** Xu needs a higher number than Souza. We don't have enough information to pinpoint their exact spaces, but they will fill the remaining two spots (either #1 & #2 or #5 & #6) depending on the final placement of Robertson and Young. 
4. **Vaughn:** Has no constraints and will take the last remaining spot.
## Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, **three employees (Robertson, Young, and Togowa) have only two possible parking space options each**. 
**Action: Answer("C")** 
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
