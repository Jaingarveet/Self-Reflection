Context: A shopping center has exactly seven spaces—space 1 through space 7—arranged in a straight row. Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
Question: If the veterinarian is in space 5, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: The optometrist is in space 2.
  B: The pharmacy is in space 7.
  C: A restaurant is in space 4.
  D: The shoe store is in space 6.

## Assistant 2:
## Reflection on Previous Attempt:
My previous error stemmed from misinterpreting the constraint "The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian." I incorrectly assumed this meant the pharmacy had to be **between** them, leading to an invalid configuration.
**Key Learnings:**
* **Carefully analyze constraints:** Each constraint provides crucial information for positioning the businesses. Misinterpreting even one can lead to incorrect solutions.
* **Consider all possibilities:** Don't fixate on a single arrangement too early. Explore different valid configurations to find the one that satisfies all constraints.
* **Focus on "must be true" statements:** Eliminate options that could be false under certain valid arrangements. 
## Answering the Question:
Given the veterinarian is in space 5, we know:
* **Pharmacy is in space 4 or 6:**  It must be next to the veterinarian.
* **Restaurants are at ends:** One restaurant occupies space 1 or 7, and the other occupies the opposite end.
* **Toy store is NOT in space 4 or 6:**  It cannot be next to the veterinarian.
Analyzing the options:
* **A: Optometrist in space 2:** Not necessarily true. The optometrist could be in space 6 with the pharmacy in space 4. 
* **B: Pharmacy in space 7:**  Possible, but not guaranteed. It could be in space 4 depending on the restaurant placement.
* **C: Restaurant in space 4:**  Cannot be true. Space 4 is occupied by either the pharmacy or the toy store.
* **D: Shoe store in space 6:** Not necessarily true. Space 6 could be occupied by the pharmacy.
* **E: Toy store in space 3:** This **must be true**.  Since the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian (space 5) and spaces 4 and 6 are occupied by the pharmacy and possibly a restaurant, space 3 is the only remaining option for the toy store.
Action: Answer("E")
