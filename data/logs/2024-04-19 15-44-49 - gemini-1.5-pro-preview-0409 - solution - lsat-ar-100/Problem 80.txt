You are an expert in Law.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Topic: Law
Context: An administrator must assign parking spaces to six new employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young. Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
Question: Which one of the following could be the assignment of parking spaces to the new employees?
Choices:
  A: #1: Young; #2: Souza; #3: Vaughn; #4: Robertson; #5: Togowa; #6: Xu
  B: #1: Vaughn; #2: Togowa; #3: Young; #4: Souza; #5: Robertson; #6: Xu
  C: #1: Togowa; #2: Young; #3: Xu; #4: Robertson; #5: Souza; #6: Vaughn
  D: #1: Togowa; #2: Robertson; #3: Young; #4: Souza; #5: Vaughn; #6: Xu
  E: #1: Souza; #2: Togowa; #3: Young; #4: Robertson; #5: Xu; #6: Vaughn

## Assistant 2:
## Reflection on Previous Attempt:
**Error Analysis:**
In my previous attempt, I likely made an error in interpreting the constraints related to the parking space assignments. This could involve:
* **Misinterpreting the relative order of employees:** I might have incorrectly assigned parking spaces without considering the specific order dictated by the rules (e.g., Young needing a higher number than Togowa).
* **Overlooking the limitations on Robertson's parking space:** The constraint that Robertson must be assigned a space between #1 and #4 might have been missed.
* **Not considering all constraints simultaneously:**  The solution needs to satisfy all given conditions at the same time, and I might have focused on one or two while neglecting others.
**Improved Approach:**
To avoid repeating the same mistakes, I will:
* **Carefully analyze each constraint:** I will break down each rule and ensure I understand the relationships between employee parking space assignments.
* **Use a systematic approach:** I will consider each option and systematically check if it satisfies all the given conditions.
* **Double-check my work:** Before finalizing the answer, I will review each constraint and ensure the chosen option adheres to all of them.
## Analyzing the Current Options:
Let's analyze each option based on the given constraints:
* **Option A:** Violates the rule that Robertson must have a space between #1 and #4.
* **Option B:** Violates the rule that Robertson must have a space between #1 and #4.
* **Option C:** Violates the rule that Young must have a higher-numbered space than Togowa.
* **Option D:** Satisfies all the given constraints:
    * Young (#3) has a higher-numbered space than Togowa (#1).
    * Xu (#6) has a higher-numbered space than Souza (#4).
    * Robertson (#2) has a higher-numbered space than Young (#3) and is within the range of #1 to #4.
* **Option E:** Violates the rule that Robertson must have a higher-numbered space than Young.
Therefore, based on the analysis, the correct option is: 
**Action: Answer("D")** 
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: E
Score: 0
