**Error Analysis:**
My previous error likely stemmed from a misunderstanding or misapplication of the given constraints. I may have overlooked a specific condition or incorrectly interpreted its implications on the possible combinations of works. 
**Improved Approach:**
To avoid repeating the mistake, I will meticulously analyze each option against all the given constraints:
* **French works limit:** No more than 4
* **Novels limit:** At least 3 but no more than 4
* **French/Russian novel ratio:** At least as many French as Russian
* **French plays and Russian play:** If both French plays are selected, the Russian play cannot be.
**Applying the Approach:**
Let's analyze each option:
* **A: No Russian novels and exactly one play:** This could be one French play and three French novels, satisfying all conditions. 
* **B: Exactly one Russian novel and both French plays:** This violates the condition that if both French plays are selected, the Russian play cannot be. 
* **C: Exactly two French novels and the Russian play:** This could be valid with one French play, satisfying all conditions.
* **D: Exactly two French novels and exactly two plays:** This could be one French play and one Russian play, satisfying all conditions.
* **E: Exactly two Russian novels and exactly one play:** This violates the condition that there must be at least as many French novels as Russian novels.
Therefore, the option that CANNOT be true is **E: Exactly two Russian novels and exactly one play**.
