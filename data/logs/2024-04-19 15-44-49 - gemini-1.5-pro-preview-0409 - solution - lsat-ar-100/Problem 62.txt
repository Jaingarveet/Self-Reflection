Topic: Law
Context: A government needs to assign new ambassadors to Venezuela, Yemen, and Zambia. The candidates for these ambassadorships are Jaramillo, Kayne, Landon, Novetzke, and Ong. One ambassador will be assigned to each country, and no ambassador will be assigned to more than one country. The assignment of the ambassadors must meet the following constraints: Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships. If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne. If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen. If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
Question: If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Jaramillo is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela.
  B: Landon is assigned as ambassador to Zambia.
  C: Ong is assigned as ambassador to Zambia.
  D: Jaramillo is not assigned to an ambassadorship.
  E: Ong is not assigned to an ambassadorship.

## Assistant 2:
## Reflection on Previous Attempt:
In my previous attempt, I likely focused too much on the individual constraints and failed to consider their combined implications. I should have systematically analyzed each choice in the context of all given constraints to arrive at the correct answer. 
## Answering the Question:
**Given:** Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
**Analysis of Choices:**
*   **A: Jaramillo is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela:** This could be true, but it's not necessarily true based solely on Kayne being assigned to Yemen. 
*   **B: Landon is assigned as ambassador to Zambia:** This is not necessarily true. The constraint only states that IF Landon is assigned, it MUST be to Zambia, not the other way around.
*   **C: Ong is assigned as ambassador to Zambia:** This is not necessarily true. There's no direct constraint linking Kayne's Yemen assignment to Ong's placement.
*   **D: Jaramillo is not assigned to an ambassadorship:** This could be true because the constraint states "If Jaramillo is assigned, then so is Kayne," but it doesn't require the reverse. If Kayne is assigned, Jaramillo might not be.
*   **E: Ong is not assigned to an ambassadorship:** This MUST be true. The constraint states, "If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen." Since Kayne IS assigned to Yemen, Ong CANNOT be assigned to Venezuela. Additionally, with Kayne and (potentially) Jaramillo taking two spots, and Landon potentially taking the Zambia spot, there's no remaining ambassadorship for Ong.
Therefore, the only option that must be true is **E: Ong is not assigned to an ambassadorship.**
**Action: Answer("E")**
