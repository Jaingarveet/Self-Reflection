## Assistant 2:
## Reflection on Previous Attempt:
In my previous attempt, I likely focused too much on the individual constraints without considering the combined implications for each day. This led me to a conclusion that didn't satisfy all conditions.  To improve, I need to:
1. **Analyze each constraint systematically:** Break down each condition and see how it interacts with others.
2. **Visualize the schedule:** Use a table or diagram to track possible arrangements and ensure no contradictions.
3. **Consider all possibilities:** Don't jump to conclusions; explore different valid arrangements before choosing the answer.
## Answering the Question:
Given the conditions and that Jackson testifies on Wednesday:
* **Wednesday:** Iturbe and Jackson testify (2 witnesses).
* **Tuesday:** Exactly 2 witnesses testify, so it cannot be Franco or Garcia (due to their constraint). This leaves Hong as a possibility.
* **Monday:** At least one witness must testify, and it cannot be Hong. So, either Franco or Garcia must testify on Monday.
Therefore, if Jackson testifies on Wednesday, **either Franco or Garcia must testify on Monday.**
Action: Answer("C")
