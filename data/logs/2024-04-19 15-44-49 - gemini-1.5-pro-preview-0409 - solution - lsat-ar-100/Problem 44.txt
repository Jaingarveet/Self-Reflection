Context: On each of exactly seven consecutive days (day 1 though day 7), a pet shop features exactly one of three breeds of kitten—Himalayan, Manx, Siamese—and exactly one of three breeds of puppy—Greyhound, Newfoundland, Rottweiler. The following conditions must apply: Greyhounds are featured on day 1. No breed is featured on any two consecutive days. Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7. Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1. Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.

Choices:

## Reflection on Previous Attempt:
**Error Analysis:**
My previous attempt likely failed due to not fully considering all the constraints and their implications. I might have focused too much on individual conditions without analyzing their combined effect on the possible schedules. 
**Key Learnings:**
* **Interdependence of conditions:** The conditions regarding Himalayans, Rottweilers, and the "no consecutive days" rule are interconnected and must be analyzed together.
* **Process of elimination:**  Carefully eliminating options based on the given constraints is crucial. 
**Improved Approach:**
1. **Start with fixed points:** Greyhounds on day 1 and no repeat on day 7 are fixed. Use these as anchors.
2. **Analyze Himalayan placement:**  Three non-consecutive days excluding day 1 and 7.
3. **Deduce Rottweiler placement:** Based on where Himalayans are, identify possible Rottweiler days.
4. **Evaluate options against constraints:** Eliminate options that violate any condition.
**Applying Learnings to the Current Question:**
Given that Himalayans are not on day 7, let's analyze the options:
* **A:** Greyhounds on days 3 and 5 would violate the "no consecutive days" rule. **Eliminate.**
* **B:** Newfoundlands on day 3 doesn't provide enough information to determine validity. **Keep for now.**
* **C:** Rottweilers on day 6 is possible if Himalayans are on days 2, 4, and 5. **Keep.** 
* **D:** Rottweilers only on day 3 would mean Himalayans are on days 2, 4, and either 5 or 6. This violates the "no consecutive days" rule for Himalayans. **Eliminate.**
* **E:** Rottweilers on exactly three days is impossible as it would conflict with the Himalayan placement. **Eliminate.**
**Conclusion:**
Based on the analysis, option C is a possibility while adhering to all constraints. 
**Action: Answer("C")**
