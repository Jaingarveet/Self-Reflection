At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.

  A: O is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf M is placed on.
  B: K is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf G is placed on.
  C: I is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf F is placed on.

## Assistant 2:
## Reflection on Previous Attempt:
In my previous attempt, I likely focused too much on individual book placements and failed to consider the combined implications of all the conditions. This led me to a conclusion that wasn't necessarily true based on the given information. 
## New Approach:
This time, I will focus on analyzing the relationships between the books and shelves, paying close attention to the "higher/lower shelf" conditions and the constraint of at least two books per shelf.
**Analyzing the Conditions:**
* **More books on bottom than top:** This means at least 3 books are on the bottom shelf and a maximum of 2 books can be on the top shelf.
* **I is on the middle shelf:** This leaves 7 books to be distributed between the top and bottom shelves.
* **K is higher than F:** This means K cannot be on the bottom shelf.
* **O is higher than L:** Similar to K, O cannot be on the bottom shelf.
* **F is on the same shelf as M:** This pair can be on either the top or bottom shelf.
**Deductions:**
* Since K and O cannot be on the bottom shelf, and there must be at least 3 books on the bottom shelf, **F and M must be on the bottom shelf.**
* This leaves I on the middle shelf and K, O, G, L on the top shelf.
* From the given conditions, we know **O is higher than L** but we don't have enough information to determine the relative positions of K and G, or I and F.
Therefore, the only statement that **must be true** is:
**Action: Answer("A")** 
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
