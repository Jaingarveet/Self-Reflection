## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: $$y=a(x-2)(x+4)$$In the quadratic equation above, $a$ is a nonzero constant. The graph of the equation in the $x y$-plane is a parabola with vertex $(c, d)$. Which of the following is equal to $d$ ?
Choices:
  A: $-9 a$
  B: $-8 a$
  C: $-5 a$
  D: $-2 a$
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Rewrite the quadratic equation in vertex form by completing the square.
2. Identify the vertex of the parabola from the vertex form.
3. Substitute the $x$-coordinate of the vertex into the equation for $x$.
4. Simplify the resulting expression to find the $y$-coordinate of the vertex.
5. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
6. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The vertex form of a quadratic equation is given by $y=a(x-h)^2+k$, where $(h,k)$ is the vertex of the parabola.
To rewrite the given equation in vertex form, we need to complete the square.
$$y=a(x^2+2x-8)$$
$$y=a(x^2+2x+1-1-8)$$
$$y=a((x+1)^2-9)$$
$$y=a(x+1)^2-9a$$
The vertex of the parabola is $(-1,-9a)$.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
