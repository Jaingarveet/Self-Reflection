## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

  B: -3
  C: 3
  D: 6
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Identify the coefficients of $x$, $y$, and the constant terms in each equation.
2. Choose one of the variables to eliminate by multiplying one or both equations by a constant.
[REDACTED]. Add or subtract the two equations to eliminate the chosen variable.
4. Simplify the resulting equation to solve for the remaining variable.
5. Check if the two equations represent the same line or two different lines.
[REDACTED]. If the two equations represent the same line, they have infinitely many solutions.
7. If the two equations represent two different lines, they have either one solution or no solution.
8. For the system to have no solution, the two equations must represent parallel lines.
9. Find the value of the constant $a$ such that the coefficients of $x$ and $y$ in the two equations are proportional but the constant terms are not.
10. Simplify the resulting equation to solve for $a$.
11. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
## Assistant 2:
1. The coefficients of $x$, $y$, and the constant terms in the first equation are $-3$, $1$, and $6$, respectively. The coefficients of $x$, $y$, and the constant terms in the second equation are $a$, $2$, and $4$, respectively.
2. To eliminate $y$, we can multiply the first equation by $2$ and the second equation by $-1$. This gives us the system of equations: $$\begin{aligned}& -6 x+2 y=12 \\& -a x-2 y=-4\end{aligned}$$
3. Adding the two equations eliminates $y$ and gives us: $$-6x-a x=8 \Rightarrow x=-\frac{8}{-6-a}$$
4. Substituting $x$ into the first equation gives us: $$-3\left(-\frac{8}{-6-a}\right)+y=6 \Rightarrow y=\frac{2a-18}{a+6}$$
5. The two equations represent two different lines because they have different slopes.
6. There are no further steps to take because we are looking for the value of $a$ that makes the system have no solution.
7. For the system to have no solution, the two lines must be parallel.
8. The two lines are parallel if and only if their slopes are equal.
9. The slope of the first line is $\frac{1}{-3}=-\frac{1}{3}$.
The slope of the second line is $\frac{-a}{2}$.
10. Setting the slopes equal to each other and solving for $a$ gives us: $$-\frac{1}{3}=\frac{-a}{2} \Rightarrow a=\boxed{\textbf{(D) }6}$$
11. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(D) }6}$.
