Question: $$0.10 x+0.20 y=0.18(x+y)$$Clayton will mix $x$ milliliters of a $10 \%$ by mass saline solution with $y$ milliliters of a $20 \%$ by mass saline solution in order to create an $18 \%$ by mass saline solution. The equation above represents this situation. If Clayton uses 100 milliliters of the $20 \%$ by mass saline solution, how many milliliters of the $10 \%$ by mass saline solution must he use?
Choices:
  A: 5
  B: 25
  C: 50
  D: 100

## Assistant 2:
Given: 
- $0.10 x+0.20 y=0.18(x+y)$
- Clayton uses 100 milliliters of the $20 \%$ by mass saline solution.
To Find: How many milliliters of the $10 \%$ by mass saline solution must Clayton use?
Solution:
Let $x$ be the number of milliliters of the $10 \%$ by mass saline solution Clayton must use.
Then, the number of milliliters of the $20 \%$ by mass saline solution Clayton uses is $100$.
Using the given equation, we can solve for $x$:
$$0.10 x+0.20(100)=0.18(x+100)$$
Simplifying the equation:
$$0.10 x+20=0.18 x+18$$
$$0.08 x=2$$
$$x=25$$
Therefore, Clayton must use 25 milliliters of the $10 \%$ by mass saline solution.
Answer: Answer("B")
