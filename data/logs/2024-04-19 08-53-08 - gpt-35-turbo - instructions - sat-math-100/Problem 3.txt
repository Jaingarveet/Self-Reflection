## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:
Topic: Geography
Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?

## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math

4. Multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal.
5. Simplify both sides of the equation.
6. Solve for the variable.
7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
## Assistant 2:
Self-reflection:
1. The equation that needs to be solved is $\frac{3}{5} w=\frac{4}{3}$.
2. We need to solve for $w$.
3. The reciprocal of $\frac{3}{5}$ is $\frac{5}{3}$.
4. Multiplying both sides of the equation by $\frac{5}{3}$ gives us $\frac{5}{3} \cdot \frac{3}{5} w=\frac{5}{3} \cdot \frac{4}{3}$, which simplifies to $w=\frac{20}{9}$.
5. We simplified both sides of the equation by canceling out the common factors of 3 and 5.
6. We solved for $w$ and got $w=\frac{20}{9}$.
7. Double-checking our calculations, we see that $\frac{3}{5} \cdot \frac{20}{9}=\frac{4}{3}$, which confirms our answer.
8. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ \frac{20}{9}}$.
