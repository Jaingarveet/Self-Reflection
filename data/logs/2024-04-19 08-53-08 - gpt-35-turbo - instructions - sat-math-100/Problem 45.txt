## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: Shipping Charges\begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}\hline$\begin{array}{c}\text { Merchandise weight } \\ \text { (pounds) }\end{array}$ & $\begin{array}{c}\text { Shipping } \\ \text { charge }\end{array}$ \\\hline5 & $\$ 16.94$ \\\hline10 & $\$ 21.89$ \\\hline20 & $\$ 31.79$ \\\hline40 & $\$ 51.59$ \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}The table above shows shipping charges for an online retailer that sells sporting goods. There is a linear relationship between the shipping charge and the weight of the merchandise. Which function can be used to determine the total shipping charge $f(x)$, in dollars, for an order with a merchandise weight of $x$ pounds?
Choices:
  A: $f(x)=0.99 x$
  B: $f(x)=0.99 x+11.99$
  C: $f(x)=3.39 x$
  D: $f(x)=3.39 x+16.94$

Instructions:
1. Identify the given data in the problem.
2. Determine the type of function that relates the given data.
3. Use the slope-intercept form to write the function.
4. Identify the slope of the function using the given data.
5. Use any point in the table to find the y-intercept.
6. Write the final function.
7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
## Assistant 2:
Self-reflection:
1. Given data: Shipping charges for different weights of merchandise.
2. Type of function: Linear function.
3. Slope-intercept form: $y=mx+b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept.
4. Slope: $\frac{\text{change in y}}{\text{change in x}}=\frac{\$51.59-\$16.94}{40-5}=\frac{\$34.65}{35}=0.99$
5. Using the point $(5,\$16.94)$, we can find the y-intercept: $16.94=0.99(5)+b \Rightarrow b=11.99$
6. Final function: $f(x)=0.99x+11.99$
7. Double-check: $f(10)=0.99(10)+11.99=\$21.89$, which matches the given data.
8. Answer: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
