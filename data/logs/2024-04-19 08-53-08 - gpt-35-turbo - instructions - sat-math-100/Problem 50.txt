Question: \begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}\cline { 2 - 3 }\multicolumn{1}{c|}{} & \multicolumn{2}{c|}{Handedness} \\\hlineGender & Left & Right \\\hline\hlineFemale &  &  \\\hlineMale &  &  \\\hline\hlineTotal & 18 & 122 \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}The incomplete table above summarizes the number of left-handed students and right-handed students by gender for the eighth-grade students atKeisel Middle School. There are 5 times as many right-handed female students as there are left-handed female students, and there are 9 times as many right-handed male students as there are left-handed male students. If there is a total of 18 left-handed students and 122 right-handed students in the school, which of the following is closest to the probability that a right-handed student selected at random is female? (Note: Assume that none of the eighth-grade students are both right-handed and left-handed.)
Choices:
  A: 0.410
  B: 0.357
  C: 0.333
  D: 0.250

## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let's start by filling in the table with the given information:
\begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}\cline { 2 - 3 }\multicolumn{1}{c|}{} & \multicolumn{2}{c|}{Handedness} \\\hlineGender & Left & Right \\\hline\hlineFemale &  & 5x \\\hlineMale & 9x &  \\\hline\hlineTotal & 18 & 122 \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}
We know that the total number of left-handed students is 18 and the total number of right-handed students is 122. Therefore, we can set up two equations:
\begin{align*}
\text{Left-handed students: } & \text{Female: } 1f + 1m = 18 \\
& \text{Male: } 1f + 1m = 0 \\
\text{Right-handed students: } & \text{Female: } 5f + 0m = 5x \\
& \text{Male: } 0f + 9m = 122
\end{align*}
We can solve for $m$ in the fourth equation: $9m = 122 \Rightarrow m = \frac{122}{9}$. We can substitute this value into the second equation to solve for $f$: $1f + 1\left(\frac{122}{9}\right) = 0 \Rightarrow f = -\frac{122}{9}$. This is not a valid solution, so we made a mistake somewhere. We can check our work by solving for $x$ in the fourth equation: $5f + 0m = 5x \Rightarrow 5f = 5x \Rightarrow f = x$. This means that the number of right-handed female students is equal to the number of left-handed female students. We can use this information to solve for $f$ in the first equation: $1f + 1m = 18 \Rightarrow f + \frac{122}{9} = 18 \Rightarrow f = \frac{40}{3}$. Now we can find the total number of female students: $f + \frac{122}{9} = \frac{40}{3} + \frac{122}{9} = \frac{218}{9}$. Finally, we can find the probability that a right-handed student selected at random is female: $\frac{5f}{5f + 9m} = \frac{5\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)}{5\left(\frac{40}{3}\right) + 9\left(\frac{122}{9}\right)} = \frac{40}{218} \approx 0.1835$. The answer closest to this value is $\boxed{\textbf{(B) }0.357}$.
