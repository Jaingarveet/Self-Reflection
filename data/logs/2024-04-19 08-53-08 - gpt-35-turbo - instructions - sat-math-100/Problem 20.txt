## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:

## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The system of equations is:
$$\begin{aligned}& 2.4 x-1.5 y=0.3 \\& 1.6 x+0.5 y=-1.3\end{aligned}$$
We need to find the $x$-coordinate of the intersection point $(x, y)$ of the system.
We can solve the system of equations by elimination method.
Multiplying the first equation by $-0.5$ and the second equation by $3$ gives:
$$\begin{aligned}& -1.2x+0.75y=-0.15 \\& 4.8x+1.5y=-3.9\end{aligned}$$
Adding the two equations eliminates $y$:
$$3.6x=-4.05$$
Solving for $x$ gives:
$$x=-\frac{4.05}{3.6}=-1.125$$
