## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

## Assistant 2:
Self-reflection:
To solve this problem, I need to distribute the negative sign to each term inside the second set of parentheses. Then, I need to combine like terms and simplify the expression. 
$$\left(x^{2} y-3 y^{2}+5 x y^{2}\right)-\left(-x^{2} y+3 x y^{2}-3 y^{2}\right)$$
$$=x^{2} y-3 y^{2}+5 x y^{2}+x^{2} y-3 x y^{2}+3 y^{2}$$
$$=2 x^{2} y+2 x y^{2}$$
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
