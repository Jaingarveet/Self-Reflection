1. Identify the percent increase or decrease between the two values.
2. Use the percent decrease formula to set up the equation.
3. Solve for the unknown value using algebraic manipulation.
4. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
5. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The Type A trees produce 20% more pears than the Type B trees.
If the Type A trees produced 144 pears, then the Type B trees produced 20% less than that.
Let x be the number of pears produced by Type B trees.
Then, 144 is 20% more than x.
Using the percent decrease formula, we have:
20% = (144 - x) / x
Multiplying both sides by x, we get:
0.2x = 144 - x
Simplifying the equation, we get:
1.2x = 144
Dividing both sides by 1.2, we get:
x = 120
Action: Answer("B")
