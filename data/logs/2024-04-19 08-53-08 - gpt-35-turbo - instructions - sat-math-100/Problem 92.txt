## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: $$m=\frac{\left(\frac{r}{1,200}\right)\left(1+\frac{r}{1,200}\right)^{N}}{\left(1+\frac{r}{1,200}\right)^{N}-1} P$$The formula above gives the monthly payment $m$ needed to pay off a loan of $P$ dollars at $r$ percent annual interest over $N$ months. Which of the following gives $P$ in terms of $m, r$, and $N$ ?
Choices:
  A: $P=\frac{\left(\frac{r}{1,200}\right)\left(1+\frac{r}{1,200}\right)^{N}}{\left(1+\frac{r}{1,200}\right)^{N}-1} m$
  B: $P=\frac{\left(1+\frac{r}{1,200}\right)^{N}-1}{\left(\frac{r}{1,200}\right)\left(1+\frac{r}{1,200}\right)^{N}} m$
  C: $P=\left(\frac{r}{1,200}\right) m$
  D: $P=\left(\frac{1,200}{r}\right) m$

## Assistant 2:
Self-reflection:
The formula given is used to calculate the monthly payment needed to pay off a loan. We need to isolate the variable $P$. 
1. The given formula is: $$m=\frac{\left(\frac{r}{1,200}\right)\left(1+\frac{r}{1,200}\right)^{N}}{\left(1+\frac{r}{1,200}\right)^{N}-1} P$$
2. Multiply both sides by the denominator of the right-hand side: $$m\left(1+\frac{r}{1,200}\right)^{N}-m=\left(\frac{r}{1,200}\right) P$$
3. Distribute the left-hand side: $$m\left(1+\frac{r}{1,200}\right)^{N}-m=\frac{r}{1,200} P$$
4. Isolate the variable by dividing both sides by the coefficient of the variable: $$P=\frac{m\left(1+\frac{r}{1,200}\right)^{N}-m}{\frac{r}{1,200}}$$
5. Simplify the expression: $$P=\frac{m\left(1+\frac{r}{1,200}\right)^{N}-m}{\frac{r}{1,200}}=\frac{m\left(1+\frac{r}{1,200}\right)^{N}}{\frac{r}{1,200}}-m\cdot\frac{1}{\frac{r}{1,200}}=\frac{\left(\frac{r}{1,200}\right)\left(1+\frac{r}{1,200}\right)^{N}}{\left(1+\frac{r}{1,200}\right)^{N}-1} m$$
6. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
