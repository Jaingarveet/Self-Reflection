## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let's assign the unknown variable to the number of students in the class.
From the problem, we know that if each student gets 3 milliliters of solution, there will be 5 milliliters left over. This can be represented as:
$n \equiv 5 \pmod{3}$
where $n$ is the total amount of solution in milliliters.
We also know that if each student gets 4 milliliters of solution, Mr. Kohl will need an additional 21 milliliters. This can be represented as:
$n + 21 = 4s$
where $s$ is the number of students in the class.
We can use the first equation to solve for $n$ in terms of $s$:
$n = 3k + 5$
where $k$ is some integer.
Substituting this into the second equation, we get:
$3k + 5 + 21 = 4s$
$3k + 26 = 4s$
$4s - 3k = 26$
We can see that $s$ must be greater than or equal to 7, since Mr. Kohl needs at least 21 additional milliliters of solution to give each student 4 milliliters. We can also see that $s$ must be less than or equal to 26, since Mr. Kohl has only $n$ milliliters of solution to distribute.
We can use trial and error to find a value of $s$ that satisfies the equation. Starting with $s = 7$, we get:
$4s - 3k = 26$
$4(7) - 3k = 26$
$28 - 3k = 26$
$3k = 2$
$k = \frac{2}{3}$
This is not an integer value of $k$, so $s = 7$ does not work. Trying $s = 8$, we get:
$4s - 3k = 26$
$4(8) - 3k = 26$
$32 - 3k = 26$
$3k = 6$
$k = 2$
This is an integer value of $k$, so $s = 8$ works. Therefore, there are 8 students in the class.
Action: Answer("D")
