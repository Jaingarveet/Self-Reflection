  C: Planning Department, Finance Department, Sales Department, R & D Department, Administration Department, Human Resources Department
  D: Sales Department, Finance Department, Planning Department, R & D Department, Human Resources Department, Administration Department

  Thought: 
We can start by using the information that the human resources department and the sales department are not adjacent. This means that the sales department must be on the bottom floor, and the human resources department must be on the top floor.
The finance department is on the next floor of the planning department, so the planning department must be on the second floor, and the finance department must be on the third floor.
The administrative department is above the planning department but below the human resources department, so it must be on the fourth floor.
The research and development department can go on either the fifth or the sixth floor.
Action: Answer("B")
