Second, list the keywords that describe the type of your errors from most general to most specific. 
Third, solve the problem again, step-by-step, based on your knowledge of the correct answer.
Fourth, create a list of detailed instructions to help you correctly solve this problem in the future.
Finally, create a list of general advice to help you solve similar types of problems in the future.  
Be concise in your response; however, capture all of the essential information.  
For guidance, I will provide you with a single generic example problem and reflection (below).
## User 1:
Topic: Geography and Math
Question: What is the product of the number of letters contained in the name of the city where Iowa State University is located multiplied by the number of letters contained in the name of the state?
Choices:
    A: 16
    B: 20
    C: 24
    D: 32
Thought:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
ISU is located in the state of Iowa.
Action: Answer("D")
---
Correct Answer: A
## Assistant 1:
Explanation:
I miscalculated the product of the number of letters in the city and state names. 
The gap in my knowledge was not in geography but in basic arithmetic. 
I knew the correct city and state but made a calculation error.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Arithmetic error
 - Multiplication error
Solution:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
Iowa State University is located in the state of Iowa.
The city name "Ames" contains 4 letters.
The state name "Iowa" contains 4 letters.
The product of 4*4 is 16.
Instructions:
1. Identify the city where the university is located.
2. Identify the state where the university is located.
3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.
4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.
5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.
6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.
7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them.

Topic: Logic
Context: A university holds a Go game.After the first round of knockout, the six players who entered the second round are of equal strength, but they can still score points.In the two rounds that have been played, Chessman A defeats Chessman B, and Chesser B applauses Chessman C.Tomorrow, Chess Armor and C will play.
Question: Please logically predict the result of the match based on the question?
Choices:
  A: Chess armor will definitely win
  B: Chess player C will definitely win
  C: The two will be tied
  D: Chess armor is likely to win, but it is also possible to lose

  Thought: 
From the information provided, we know that Chessman A defeated Chessman B and Chessman B applauded Chessman C. This implies that Chessman C is stronger than Chessman B.
In the second round, Chess Armor will play against Chessman C. Since Chessman C is stronger than Chessman B, and Chessman B applauded Chessman C, it is likely that Chessman C will win against Chess Armor.
Action: Answer("B")

 --- 
Correct Answer: D
## Assistant 2:
Response:
  Explanation:
I made a mistake in my prediction because I didn't consider all the possible outcomes.
I incorrectly assumed that Chessman C would definitely win against Chess Armor, based solely on the fact that Chessman B applauded Chessman C.
Error Keywords:
- Insufficient information
- Overgeneralization
- Lack of consideration of all possible outcomes

Solution:
We know that Chessman A defeated Chessman B and Chessman B applauded Chessman C. This means that Chessman C is stronger than Chessman B.
In the second round, Chess Armor will play against Chessman C. Since Chessman C is stronger than Chessman B, it is likely that Chessman C will win against Chess Armor.
However, we cannot definitively say that Chessman C will win, as there is still a possibility that Chess Armor could win.
Therefore, the correct answer is (D) Chess armor is likely to win, but it is also possible to lose.

Instructions:
1. Carefully consider all the information provided in the question.
2. Evaluate the relative strengths of the players based on the information given.
3. Consider all possible outcomes of the match.
4. Choose the answer that best reflects the probability of each outcome.

Advice:
- Always consider all possible outcomes of a situation.
- Don't make assumptions based on incomplete information.
- Be aware of the limitations of your knowledge and the possibilities that may exist.
- Avoid overgeneralizing based on limited data.
- Consider alternative perspectives and outcomes.
