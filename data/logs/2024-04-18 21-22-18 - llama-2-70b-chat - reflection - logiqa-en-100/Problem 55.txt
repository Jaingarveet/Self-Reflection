## System:
You are an expert in Logic.
You have incorrectly answered the following multiple-choice question.
Your task is to reflect on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
You will then use this information help you answer the same question in the future.
First, explain why you answered the question incorrectly.
Second, list the keywords that describe the type of your errors from most general to most specific. 
Third, solve the problem again, step-by-step, based on your knowledge of the correct answer.
Fourth, create a list of detailed instructions to help you correctly solve this problem in the future.
Finally, create a list of general advice to help you solve similar types of problems in the future.  
Be concise in your response; however, capture all of the essential information.  
For guidance, I will provide you with a single generic example problem and reflection (below).

Topic: Geography and Math
Question: What is the product of the number of letters contained in the name of the city where Iowa State University is located multiplied by the number of letters contained in the name of the state?
Choices:
    A: 16
    B: 20
    C: 24
    D: 32
Thought:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
ISU is located in the state of Iowa.
Action: Answer("D")
---
Correct Answer: A
## Assistant 1:
Explanation:
I miscalculated the product of the number of letters in the city and state names. 
The gap in my knowledge was not in geography but in basic arithmetic. 
I knew the correct city and state but made a calculation error.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Arithmetic error
 - Multiplication error
Solution:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
Iowa State University is located in the state of Iowa.
The city name "Ames" contains 4 letters.
The state name "Iowa" contains 4 letters.
The product of 4*4 is 16.
Instructions:
1. Identify the city where the university is located.
2. Identify the state where the university is located.
3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.
4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.
5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.
6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.
7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them.

Topic: Logic
Context: In a magic show, from the seven magicians-G.H.K.L.N.P and Q, choose 6 people to play, and the performance is divided into two teams? 1 team and 2 teams.Each team consists of three positions? front, middle, and back.The magicians on the field happen to occupy one position each.The choice and location of the magician must meet the following conditions? (1) If G or H is arranged to play, they must be in front Bit.(2) If K is scheduled to play, he must be in the middle.(3) If L is scheduled to play, he must be on team 1.(4) Neither P nor K can be in the same team as N.(5) P cannot be in the same team as Q.(6) If H is in team 2, Q is in the middle of team 1.
Question: Which of the following lists are acceptable arrangements for the second team's performance?
Choices:
  A: Before? H Middle? P After? K
  B: Before? H Middle? L After? N
  C: Before? G In? Q After? P
  D: Before? G In? Q After? N

  Acceptable arrangements for the second team's performance are:

List C: Before? G Middle? Q After? P

Explanation:

Conditions (1) and (6) require that G must be in front and H must be in team 2. Condition (2) requires K to be in the middle. Condition (3) requires L to be on team 1, which means L cannot be on team 2. Condition (4) requires P and N to be on different teams, so P must be on team 2. Condition (5) requires Q to be on team 1, which means Q cannot be on team 2 with P. Therefore, the only possible arrangement that satisfies all the conditions is:

Before? G Middle? Q After? P

Action: Answer("C")

 --- 
Correct Answer: D
## Assistant 2:
Response:
  Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I misunderstood condition (6). I thought it said that H must be in team 2, but it actually says that Q must be in the middle of team 1 if H is in team 2. Therefore, the correct answer is D: Before? G Middle? Q After? N.

Error Keywords:

* Misinterpretation of condition (6)
* Incorrect application of conditions to the problem

Solution:

1. Before? G
2. Middle? Q
3. After? N

Instructions:

1. Read the question carefully and understand the conditions.
2. Decompose the problem into smaller parts, focusing on each condition.
3. Use a systematic approach to eliminate incorrect choices.
4. Check your work by verifying that the chosen arrangement satisfies all the conditions.

Advice:

* Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
* Use a systematic approach to solve the problem, breaking it down into smaller parts.
* Double-check your work by verifying that the chosen arrangement satisfies all the conditions.
* Be aware of any assumptions or misunderstandings that may lead to incorrect conclusions.
