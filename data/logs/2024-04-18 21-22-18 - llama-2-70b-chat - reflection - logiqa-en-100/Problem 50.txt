## System:
You are an expert in Logic.
You have incorrectly answered the following multiple-choice question.
Your task is to reflect on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
You will then use this information help you answer the same question in the future.
First, explain why you answered the question incorrectly.
Second, list the keywords that describe the type of your errors from most general to most specific. 
Third, solve the problem again, step-by-step, based on your knowledge of the correct answer.
Fourth, create a list of detailed instructions to help you correctly solve this problem in the future.
Finally, create a list of general advice to help you solve similar types of problems in the future.  
Be concise in your response; however, capture all of the essential information.  
For guidance, I will provide you with a single generic example problem and reflection (below).

Topic: Geography and Math
Question: What is the product of the number of letters contained in the name of the city where Iowa State University is located multiplied by the number of letters contained in the name of the state?
Choices:
    A: 16
    B: 20
    C: 24
    D: 32
Thought:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
ISU is located in the state of Iowa.
Action: Answer("D")
---
Correct Answer: A
## Assistant 1:
Explanation:
I miscalculated the product of the number of letters in the city and state names. 
The gap in my knowledge was not in geography but in basic arithmetic. 
I knew the correct city and state but made a calculation error.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Arithmetic error
 - Multiplication error
Solution:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
Iowa State University is located in the state of Iowa.
The city name "Ames" contains 4 letters.
The state name "Iowa" contains 4 letters.
The product of 4*4 is 16.
Instructions:
1. Identify the city where the university is located.
2. Identify the state where the university is located.
3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.
4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.
5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.
6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.
7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them.

Topic: Logic
Context: A heating station has 5 valves to control the delivery of steam to the outside.The following operating rules must be followed when using these valves? (1) If valve No.1 is opened, then valve No.2 must be opened and valve No.5 must be closed.(2) If valve No.2 or valve No.5 is opened, valve No.4 must be closed.(3) No.3 valve and No.4 valve cannot be closed at the same time.
Question: Now we need to open the No.1 valve, which two valves are to be opened at the same time?
Choices:
  A: No.2 valve and No.4 valve.
  C: No.3 valve and No.5 valve.
  B: No.2 valve and No.3 valve.
  D: No.4 valve and No.5 valve.

  Thought: 
When valve No. 1 is opened, valve No. 2 must be opened, and valve No. 5 must be closed, according to rule 1. According to rule 2, valve No. 4 must be closed if valve No. 2 or valve No. 5 is opened. Therefore, if valve No. 1 is opened, valve No. 2 and valve No. 4 must be opened.
Action: Answer("A")

Correct Answer: B
## Assistant 2:
Response:
  Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I misunderstood the rules provided. 
I thought that when valve No. 1 was opened, valve No. 2 and valve No. 4 must be opened. 
However, the rules state that when valve No. 1 is opened, valve No. 2 must be opened, and valve No. 5 must be closed. 
Therefore, when valve No. 1 is opened, valve No. 2 and valve No. 3 must be opened, as valve No. 5 is closed.
Error Keywords:
 - Misunderstanding of rules
 - Incorrect application of rules
 - Logical reasoning error
Solution:
When valve No. 1 is opened, valve No. 2 must be opened, and valve No. 5 must be closed, according to rule 1. 
According to rule 2, valve No. 4 must be closed if valve No. 2 or valve No. 5 is opened. 
Therefore, when valve No. 1 is opened, valve No. 2 and valve No. 3 must be opened, as valve No. 5 is closed.
Instructions:
1. Read the rules provided carefully and understand them.
2. Identify the first valve that must be opened.
3. Determine which valve must be opened or closed based on the rules.
4. Identify the second valve that must be opened.
5. Check that the chosen valves do not violate rule 3.
6. Answer the question based on the valves that have been opened.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that the rules provided may have exceptions or special cases, so be sure to consider all possibilities.
 - When dealing with multiple rules, ensure that you apply them in the correct order.
