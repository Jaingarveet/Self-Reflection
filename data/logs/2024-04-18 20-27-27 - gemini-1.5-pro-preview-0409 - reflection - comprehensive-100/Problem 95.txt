For guidance, I will provide you with a single generic example problem and reflection (below).
## User 1:
Topic: Geography and Math
Question: What is the product of the number of letters contained in the name of the city where Iowa State University is located multiplied by the number of letters contained in the name of the state?
Choices:
    A: 16
    B: 20
    C: 24
    D: 32
Thought:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
ISU is located in the state of Iowa.
Action: Answer("D")
---
Correct Answer: A
## Assistant 1:
Explanation:
I miscalculated the product of the number of letters in the city and state names. 
The gap in my knowledge was not in geography but in basic arithmetic. 
I knew the correct city and state but made a calculation error.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Arithmetic error
 - Multiplication error
Solution:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
Iowa State University is located in the state of Iowa.
The city name "Ames" contains 4 letters.
The state name "Iowa" contains 4 letters.
The product of 4*4 is 16.
Instructions:
1. Identify the city where the university is located.
2. Identify the state where the university is located.
3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.
4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.
5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.
6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.
7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them.

Topic: Medicine
Subtopic: Anatomy
Question: Which of the following drains directly into inferior vena cava?
Choices:
  A: Superior mesenteric vein
  B: Inferior mesenteric vein
  C: Right suprarenal vein
  D: Renal vein

Thought:
The inferior vena cava is a large vein that carries deoxygenated blood to the heart. 
Of the choices, only the renal veins directly drain into the inferior vena cava. 
The superior mesenteric vein and inferior mesenteric vein drain into the hepatic portal vein. The right suprarenal vein drains into the right renal vein. 
Action: Answer("D") 


 --- 
Correct Answer: C
## Assistant 2:
Response:
## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:** My knowledge of the venous drainage system was incomplete, leading me to overlook the direct connection between the right suprarenal vein and the inferior vena cava. I incorrectly assumed all suprarenal veins drained via the renal veins.
**Error Keywords:**
*   Knowledge gap
*   Anatomy misconception
*   Venous drainage error
## Step-by-Step Solution
1.  **Recall the function of the inferior vena cava:** It collects deoxygenated blood from the lower body and returns it to the heart.
2.  **Consider the options:**
    *   Superior and inferior mesenteric veins are part of the hepatic portal system, not directly connected to the inferior vena cava.
    *   Renal veins do drain directly into the inferior vena cava.
    *   **Right suprarenal vein:** This vein drains the right adrenal gland and, unlike the left, directly connects to the inferior vena cava. 
3.  **Choose the correct option:** Based on the above, the right suprarenal vein (C) is the correct answer. 
## Instructions for Future Problem Solving
1.  **Review the anatomy of the venous system**, paying close attention to the connections between major veins and their tributaries.
2.  **Specifically focus on the drainage patterns of the adrenal glands**, noting the difference between the right and left suprarenal veins.
3.  **When encountering questions about venous drainage, systematically eliminate options** based on your knowledge of the circulatory system.
4.  **If unsure, consider the anatomical location and function of the structures involved** to make an educated guess.
## General Advice for Similar Problems
*   **Continuously update and refine your knowledge base** in medicine and anatomy.
*   **Pay attention to exceptions and variations** within anatomical systems.
*   **Develop a systematic approach to problem-solving** that involves elimination and logical reasoning.
*   **Use anatomical and physiological principles to guide your reasoning** when faced with uncertainty. 
*   **Practice applying your knowledge to different scenarios** to reinforce understanding.
