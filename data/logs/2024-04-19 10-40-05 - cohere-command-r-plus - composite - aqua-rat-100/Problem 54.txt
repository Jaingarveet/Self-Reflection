## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: Silu and Meenu were walking on the road.
Silu said, "I weigh 51 Kgs. How much do you weigh?"
Meenu replied that she wouldn't reveal her weight directly as she is overweight.
But she said, "I weigh 29 Kgs plus half of my weight. "How much does Meenu weigh?
Choices:
  A: 12
  B: 28
  C: 27
  D: 58
  E: 91
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I made an error in solving the equation for Meenu's weight. 
I incorrectly assumed that "29 + x/2" meant "29 kg plus half of x kg." 
However, the correct interpretation is "29 kg plus half of her weight, which is also x kg." 
Error Keywords:
 - Equation solving error
 - Interpretation error
 - Algebraic error
Solution:
Let's represent Meenu's weight as 'x'.
According to the question, she weighs "29 kg plus half of her weight," which can be written as: 
x = 29 + x/2
Now, let's solve for x: 
Combine like terms: 
2x = 29 + x

Subtract x from both sides:
x = 29

So, Meenu weighs 29 kg.
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and identify the given information.
2. Understand the relationship between Silu's and Meenu's weights.
3. Represent Meenu's weight as an algebraic equation.
4. Solve the equation step-by-step for 'x'.
5. Interpret the value of 'x' as Meenu's weight.
6. Double-check your solution by substituting the value back into the original equation.
Advice:
 - Pay close attention to the wording of the question and identify any keywords or phrases that indicate relationships or operations.
 - Take your time to understand the context and interpret the information correctly.
 - Always define your variables clearly and represent the problem algebraically.
 - Solve equations step-by-step, being careful with each operation.
 - Double-check your solution by substituting the value back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the condition.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Let Meenu's weight be x kg. According to her statement, we can write the equation: 
x = 29 + x/2

Now, let's solve for x: 
2x = 58
x = 29 kg

So, Meenu weighs 29 kg.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
