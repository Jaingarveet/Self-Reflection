Question: 64 boys and 40 girls form a group for social work. During their membership drive, the same number of boys and girls joined the group. How many members does the group have now, if the ratio of boys to girls is 4:3?
Choices:
  A: 277
  B: 288
  C: 200
  D: 277
  E: 168

Explanation:
Error Keywords:
- Algebraic error
- Equation setup error
- Ratio calculation error

Solution:
The initial group has 64 boys and 40 girls, totaling 104 members. During the drive, an equal number of boys and girls joined to establish a new ratio of 4:3 (boys to girls). 

To find the total number of members now, we can use the ratio: 
Total members = (4/7) * Initial members 
Total members = (4/7) * 104 
Total members = [REDACTED]

Instructions:
1. Calculate the initial total number of members (boys + girls). 
2. Recognize that the new ratio of boys to girls is 4:3, which can be simplified to 4/7 for boys and 3/7 for girls. 
3. Set up the equation: Total members = (4/7) * Initial members. 
4. Plug in the value of the initial members and calculate the final answer. 

Advice:
- Understand the concept of ratios and how they are used to represent parts of a whole. 
- Recognize that the ratio represents the fractional relationship between boys and girls in the group. 
- Ensure you correctly set up equations involving ratios and proportions. 
- Double-check your calculations and the setup of your equations.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Initially, there are 64 + 40 = 104 members. 
To maintain a 4:3 ratio of boys to girls, for every 4 boys, there are 3 girls, which can be simplified to a ratio of 4:3 or 4/7:3/7 for boys and girls, respectively. 

Using the ratio, the final total number of members can be calculated as: 
Final total = (4/7) * 104 = 64 * 4/7 = 256/7 = 36.57 (rounding to two decimal places)

Converting this back to a fraction, we get 256/7, which equals 288/1.

So, the group now has 288 members.
Action: Answer("B")
