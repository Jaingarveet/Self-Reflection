Explanation:
Error Keywords:
- Calculation error
- Counting error
- Underestimation

Solution: The hollow cube consists of $5^3 = 125$ smaller cubes. Out of these, the smaller cubes on the outer surface, which are $3^3 = 27$ in total, will have some faces painted. Each of these outer smaller cubes has 5 unpainted faces, so the total number of unpainted faces is $27 \times 5 = 135$. 

Solution:
Instructions:
1. Calculate the total number of smaller cubes within the hollow cube. 
2. Determine the number of smaller cubes on each face of the hollow cube that will have one face painted. 
3. Calculate the number of unpainted faces for each smaller cube on the outer surface. 
4. Find the total number of unpainted faces by multiplying the number of outer smaller cubes by the number of their unpainted faces. 

Advice:
 - Pay close attention to the dimensions and sizes provided in the question. 
 - Carefully count the number of elements involved, especially when dealing with three-dimensional shapes. 
 - Double-check your calculations and ensure they align with the context of the problem. 
 - Consider all relevant faces or elements that may contribute to the final count.

The hollow cube consists of $5^3 = 125$ smaller cubes. Out of these, the smaller cubes on the outer surface, which are $3^3 = 27$ in total, will have some faces painted. Each of these outer smaller cubes has 5 unpainted faces, so the total number of unpainted faces is $27 \times 5 = \mathbf{135}$. 

This question requires an understanding of three-dimensional shapes and the ability to visualize the smaller cubes within the larger hollow cube. It also tests attention to detail, as one needs to consider the unpainted faces of the outer layer of smaller cubes.
