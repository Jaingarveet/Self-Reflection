Question: A company produces 420 units of a particular computer component every month, at a production cost to the company of $110 per component, and sells all of the components by the end of each month. What is the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee that the yearly profit (revenue from sales minus production costs) will be at least $626,400 ?
Choices:
  A: 226
  B: 230
  C: 240
  D: 260
  E: 280

You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
Error Keywords:
- Calculation error
- Arithmetic error
- Division error
- Incorrect variable

Solution:

The company produces 420 units of the component monthly, so the yearly production is 420 * 12 = 5040 components. 

To make a profit of at least $626,400, the revenue from sales must exceed the production costs by this amount. 

Total production costs are 5040 * $110 = $554,400 

So, the total sales revenue required is $626,400 + $554,400 = $1,180,800 

Now, to find the minimum selling price per component, we divide the total sales revenue by the number of components produced and sold monthly: 

$1,180,800 / 420 = $[REDACTED]0 / 9 = $311.11 (rounded to the nearest cent) 

So, the correct answer is [REDACTED]. 

Instructions:
1. Identify the given information: monthly production, monthly production cost, and the required yearly profit. 
2. Calculate the total number of components produced in a year. 
3. Determine the total sales revenue required to achieve the desired profit. 
4. Calculate the minimum selling price per component by dividing the total sales revenue by the number of components produced monthly. 
5. Ensure that you are dividing by the correct number (in this case, the monthly production, not the yearly production). 
6. Choose the answer option that matches your calculated result. 

Advice:
 - Read the question carefully and identify the given information. 
 - Pay attention to the units and ensure you are performing calculations with consistent units. 
 - Double-check your calculations and ensure that you are dividing by the correct number. 
 - Always consider the context of the problem and whether your answer makes sense within that context. 
 - Practice similar problems to improve your calculation accuracy and familiarity with the concepts.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
First, calculate the total number of components produced in a year: 420 units/month * 12 months = 5,040 units/year.

Then, find the total sales revenue required to achieve the desired profit: desired profit + total production costs = total sales revenue,
$626,400 + ($110 * 5,040) = $1,180,800.

Now, calculate the minimum selling price per component by dividing the total sales revenue by the number of components produced and sold monthly: $1,180,800 / 420 units/month = $2,811.43, and rounding to the nearest dollar gives $2,811.

So, the company must sell each computer component for at least $2,811 to ensure they make a yearly profit of at least $626,400.
