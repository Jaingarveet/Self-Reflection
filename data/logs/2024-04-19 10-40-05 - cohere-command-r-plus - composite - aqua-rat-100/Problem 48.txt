- Arithmetic error

Solution:
Let X be the total number of students at Daifu University. 
24% of students are members of both the chess club and the swim team, and [REDACTED] of the swim team members are not members of the chess club. 

First, we calculate the percentage of students who are members of only the swim team: 
0.20 * 0.24X = 0.048X are in the swim team but not the chess club. 

The remaining percentage of students who are in both clubs is: 
0.24X - 0.048X = 0.192X 

So, the total number of students in the swim team is: 
0.24X + 0.192X = 0.432X 

Therefore, the percentage of all Daifu students who are members of the swim team is: 
(0.432X / X) * 100 = 43.2%. 

Instructions:
1. Identify the given information: total percentage of students in both clubs, and percentage of swim team members not in the chess club. 
2. Calculate the percentage of students who are in the swim team but not the chess club. 
3. Calculate the total number of students who are in the swim team (both exclusively and as part of both clubs). 
4. Calculate the final percentage of all students who are in the swim team. 
5. Ensure your calculations are correct and choose the appropriate answer. 

Advice:
 - Read the question carefully and identify the given information. 
 - Break down the problem into smaller steps to avoid errors. 
 - Double-check your calculations and ensure you are interpreting the information correctly. 
 - Practice similar types of problems to improve your accuracy and speed.

Thought: 
Let X be the total number of students at Daifu University. 
24% of students are members of both the chess club and the swim team, and 20% of swim team members are not members of the chess club. 

First, we calculate the percentage of students who are in the swim team but not the chess club: 
0.20 * 0.24X = 0.048X 

This means 4.8% of students are in the swim team but not the chess club. 

Now, we find the total percentage of students who are members of the swim team: 
We know that 24% are in both clubs, and we've just calculated that 4.8% are in the swim team only. 

So, the total percentage = 24% + 4.8% = 28.8%. 

Therefore, the answer is C: 40%.

Action: Answer("C")
