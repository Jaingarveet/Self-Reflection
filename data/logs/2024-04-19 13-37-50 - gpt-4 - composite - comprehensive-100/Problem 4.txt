# Model: gpt-4 | Agent: composite | Exam: comprehensive-100 | Problem 4 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: At its maximum speed, a space shuttle can travel 700m high in 40 seconds. It will also take 5 seconds to pass a point. What then is the length of the space shuttle?
Choices:
  A: 50 m
  B: 75 m
  C: 100 m
  D: 125 m
  E: 150 m
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I miscalculated the length of the space shuttle. I made an error in my multiplication, which led to an incorrect answer. 
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Multiplication error
 - Arithmetic error
Solution:
The space shuttle's maximum speed is 700m/40s = 17.5 m/s. 
If it takes 5 seconds to pass a point, then the length of the shuttle is 17.5 m/s * 5s = 87.5 m. 
The correct answer is not in the choices because I made a calculation error. The correct calculation is 17.5 m/s * 5s = 87.5 m, which rounds to 88 m. The closest value to 88 m is [REDACTED]. 
Instructions:
1. Calculate the maximum speed of the space shuttle by dividing the distance it can travel at maximum speed by the time it takes to travel that distance.
2. Multiply the maximum speed by the time it takes for the shuttle to pass a point to find the length of the shuttle.
3. Round your answer to the nearest whole number if necessary.
4. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand what is being asked.
 - Break down complex problems into simpler steps.
 - Work through each step of your calculations carefully.
 - Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
 - Remember to round your answer to the nearest whole number if necessary.
