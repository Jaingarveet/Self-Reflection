Explanation:
I answered the question correctly, but I did not provide the answer in the correct format. The error was not in my mathematical reasoning or calculation, but in the way I presented my answer. 
Error Keywords:
- Formatting error
- Answer presentation error
Solution:
Let's denote the amount each nephew receives as x. 
Then each daughter receives 4x and each son receives 5x. 
The total amount is 8600, so we can set up the equation: 
5 sons * 5x + 4 daughters * 4x + 2 nephews * x = 8600
Solving this equation will give us the value of x, and then we can find out how much each daughter receives.
First, simplify the equation: 
25x + 16x + 2x = 8600
43x = 8600
x = 8600 / 43 = 200
Each daughter receives 4x = 4 * 200 = 800
Action: Answer("[REDACTED]")
Instructions:
