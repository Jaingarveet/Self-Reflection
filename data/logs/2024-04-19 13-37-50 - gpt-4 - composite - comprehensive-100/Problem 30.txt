K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.
Question: If G is placed on the top shelf, then which one of the following could be a complete and accurate list of the books placed on the middle shelf?
Choices:
  A: H, I
  B: I, L
  C: H, I, L
  D: I, K, L

Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I overlooked the condition that O must be placed on a higher shelf than L. This means that L cannot be on the top shelf, and since the bottom shelf is already occupied by F and M, L must be on the middle shelf. 
Error Keywords:
- Overlooking conditions
- Logical reasoning error
- Arrangement problem
Solution:
Given that G is on the top shelf, and K must be on a higher shelf than F, K must also be on the top shelf. Since F and M are on the same shelf and K is on a higher shelf than F, F and M cannot be on the top shelf. Therefore, F and M must be on the middle or bottom shelf. Since more books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, and we already have two books (G and K) on the top shelf, we can only have two books on the middle shelf. Therefore, F and M must be on the bottom shelf. I is on the middle shelf, and since O must be on a higher shelf than L, L must also be on the middle shelf. Therefore, the books on the middle shelf are [REDACTED], and possibly others.
Instructions:
1. Identify the conditions given in the problem.
2. Determine the placement of each book based on these conditions.
3. Remember that each shelf must have at least two books.
4. Consider the condition that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
5. Consider the conditions for each book's placement relative to other books.
6. Double-check each condition to ensure you have not overlooked any.
7. Choose the answer that matches your determined arrangement.
Advice:
- Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
- Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
- Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
- Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
- Always double-check your reasoning and final answer.
- Remember to consider all conditions given in the problem.
