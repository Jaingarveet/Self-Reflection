Explanation:
## Assistant 2:
Self-reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly because I did not carefully consider the statements of the professors. I assumed that Professor Zhao's statement meant that the Tsinghua University team and the Zhejiang University team could not both be the champion. However, this is not necessarily true. Professor Zhao's statement only means that one of these two teams cannot be the champion.
To correctly answer this question, I need to consider all of the professors' statements and identify the team that is mentioned in all three statements. The only team that is mentioned in all three statements is the Tsinghua University team. Therefore, the winner of the football game is the Tsinghua University Team.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
