You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that the given information only allowed for one possible arrangement of the islands. I failed to consider the possibility of different arrangements within the constraints provided.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
We know that G is the northernmost island.
From statement (1), we know that F is adjacent to H and is on the north side of H.
From statement (2), we know that I and E are adjacent.
From statement (3), we know that G is somewhere in the north of F.
Based on this information, we can determine the following possible arrangements:
1. G - F - H - I - E
2. G - F - H - E - I
3. G - H - F - I - E
4. G - H - F - E - I
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
