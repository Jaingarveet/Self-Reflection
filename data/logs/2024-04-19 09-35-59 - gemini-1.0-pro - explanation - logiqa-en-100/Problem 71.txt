Explanation:
I incorrectly focused on the reasons why people might not want to ask college students to be nannies, rather than on the reasons why they might favor them. 
I overlooked the fact that the survey showed that a majority of people favored college students as nannies.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The question asks for a statement that can explain why people favor college students as nannies but are hesitant to hire them.
Option A suggests that people favor college students as tutors or secretaries, which are not nannying roles.
Option B suggests that people are unwilling to pay enough for a nanny, which is not relevant to the question.
Option C suggests that people believe that nannying is good for college students, which is not a reason to avoid hiring them.
Option D suggests that people believe that students should choose a field related to their major, which is not relevant to the question.
Action: Answer("C")
