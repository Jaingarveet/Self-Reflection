My initial analysis was correct in identifying the implications of each statement. However, I failed to consider all possible combinations of these implications, leading to an incorrect conclusion.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
(1) Li was hired by Tianshu.
(2) Li and Zhao were not hired by the same unit.
(3) Liu and Zhao were hired by the same unit.
(4) If Zhang was hired by Tianxuan, then Wang Ye Was hired by Tianxuan.

From (1), we know that Li was not hired by Tianji or Tianxuan.
From (4), we know that if Zhang was hired by Tianxuan, then Wang was also hired by Tianxuan.
Therefore, the following possibilities are correct:
- Zhang and Wang were hired by Tianxuan, and Li, Zhao, and Liu were hired by Tianshu, Tianji, and Tianxuan, respectively.
- Zhang, Wang, and Liu were hired by Tianxuan, and Li and Zhao were hired by Tianshu and Tianji, respectively.
