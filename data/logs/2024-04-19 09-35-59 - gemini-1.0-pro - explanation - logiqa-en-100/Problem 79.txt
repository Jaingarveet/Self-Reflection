Topic: Logic
Context: There must be an outside world, because if there is something outside me that can shine or reflect, shining the light into my eyes, which gives me a visual experience, I ca nâ€™t see the buildings, the crowds and the stars these things.And, not only have visual experience like me, but others also have such visual experience; book knowledge also tells us repeatedly that there is an outside world outside of us.
Question: Which of the following does not constitute doubt or rebuttal to the above argument?
Choices:
  A: To use sensory evidence to explain the existence of the external world requires presupposing the existence of the external world in the mind.
  B: How do you prove that others have similar visual experience to you?
  C: Since the visual experience is reliable, Mirage is not a so-called illusion, but a real existence.
  D: If there is no external world and natural science knowledge is not a true reflection of it, then why does natural science achieve such great success in practice?
