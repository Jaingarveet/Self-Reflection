Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
My initial analysis was correct in considering all the conditions and analyzing each choice. However, I made a mistake in interpreting condition 3. I incorrectly assumed that if X is in sales, then W must be in production. However, the condition only states that if X is in sales, then W must be in production, not the other way around. Therefore, even if X and F are in production, W could still be in a different department, including public relations.
