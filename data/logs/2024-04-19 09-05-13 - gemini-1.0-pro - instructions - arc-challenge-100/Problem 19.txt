## Assistant 2:
I understand. I will use my previous reflection to answer this question correctly.
**Reflection:**
* **Problem:** I incorrectly identified the capital of Maryland as Baltimore instead of Annapolis.
* **Solution:** I need to carefully read the question and consider all possible answers before selecting the best one.
* **Correct Answer:** The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
**Answer:**
**Action: Answer("B")**
**Explanation:**
Glass bottles can be reused many times without losing their quality or integrity. This makes them a more sustainable option compared to other materials that can only be recycled a limited number of times or not at all.
**Additional Information:**
* Steel cans can also be recycled multiple times, but the process is more energy-intensive than recycling glass.
* Paper containers can be recycled, but the fibers become weaker with each cycle, limiting the number of times they can be reused.
* Plastic containers are typically not designed for multiple uses and often end up in landfills or incinerators.
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
