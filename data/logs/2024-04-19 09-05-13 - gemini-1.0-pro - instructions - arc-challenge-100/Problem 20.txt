3. Eliminate options that do not match the specified frequency.
4. Choose the option that best matches the specified frequency.
5. If unsure, double-check your understanding of the concepts involved.
## Assistant 2:
Self-reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly because I did not consider the frequency of each event. I focused on the time it takes for each event to occur, rather than how often it occurs.
Thought:
- High tide occurs twice a day, so it is not the correct answer.
- New moon occurs once a month, so it is not the correct answer.
- New season occurs four times a year, so it is not the correct answer.
- Solar eclipse occurs about every 18 months, so it is not the correct answer.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
