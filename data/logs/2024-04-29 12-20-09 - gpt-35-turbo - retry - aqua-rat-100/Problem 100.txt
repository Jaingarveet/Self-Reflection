## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let's assume the breadth of the rectangular piece is "x".
Then, the length of the rectangular piece is 4x+1.
We know that the area of the rectangular piece is 150 sq m.
So, x(4x+1) = 150.
Solving this equation, we get x = 5 m.
Therefore, the length of the rectangular piece is 4(5)+1 = 21 m.
The perimeter of the rectangular piece is 2(length + breadth).
So, the perimeter is 2(21+5) = 52 m.
Action: Answer("None of the Above") [The correct answer is not listed. The correct answer is 52 m.]
