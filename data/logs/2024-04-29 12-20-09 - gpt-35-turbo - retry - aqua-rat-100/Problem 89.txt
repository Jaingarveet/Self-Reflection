## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The cab charges $3.50 for the first quarter-mile, which means that the remaining distance to be covered is 8.5 - 3.5 = $5.00.
The cab charges 10 cents for each additional quarter mile, which means that for $5.00, the cab can travel 50 quarter-miles.
Therefore, the maximum distance that can be traveled is 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 + ... (50 times) = 12.5 miles.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
