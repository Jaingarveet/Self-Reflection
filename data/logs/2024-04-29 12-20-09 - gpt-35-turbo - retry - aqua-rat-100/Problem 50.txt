## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let's assume the speed of the ship is x.
The speed of the plane is 10x.
Let's assume they meet after t hours.
The distance traveled by the ship = x * t
The distance traveled by the plane = 10x * t
The total distance traveled by both is 180 miles.
Therefore, x * t + 10x * t = 180
Simplifying the equation, we get t = 12.
The distance traveled by the ship = x * t = x * 12
The distance traveled by the plane = 10x * t = 10x * 12
The total distance from the starting point = x * 12 + 10x * 12 = 132x
Action: Answer("C")
