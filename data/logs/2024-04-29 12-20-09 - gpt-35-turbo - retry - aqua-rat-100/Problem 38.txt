## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The outer surface of the cube is of size 5x5x1 = 25 cm^2.
The inner surface of the hollow cube is of size 3x3x1 = 9 cm^2.
So, the total surface area of the smaller cubes is 25 - 9 = 16 cm^2.
The number of smaller cubes that have unpainted faces is equal to the number of cubes that are not on the surface of the larger cube.
There are 3x3x3 = 27 smaller cubes on each face of the larger cube.
There are 6 faces in total, so there are 6x27 = 162 smaller cubes on the surface of the larger cube.
The total number of smaller cubes is 5x5x5 = 125.
Therefore, the number of smaller cubes that have unpainted faces is 125 - 162 = -37, which is not possible.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
