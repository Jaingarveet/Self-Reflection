## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let's start by listing the first five consecutive odd numbers:  1, 3, 5, 7, 9.
We can see that the sum of these numbers is 25, which is a perfect square.
Let's try to generalize this pattern for any five consecutive odd numbers.
Let's assume that the first odd number is n. Then the five consecutive odd numbers are n, n+2, n+4, n+6, and n+8.
The sum of these numbers is 5n+20, which can be simplified to 5(n+4).
Since the sum is divisible by 10, we know that n+4 must be divisible by 2.
Therefore, n must be an odd number that is 2 less than a multiple of 4.
Let's check each answer choice to see which one satisfies this condition:
A: 47 is not an odd number that is 2 less than a multiple of 4.
B: 91 is not an odd number that is 2 less than a multiple of 4.
C: 41 is an odd number that is 2 less than a multiple of 4. Let's check if it works.
If n=41, then the five consecutive odd numbers are 41, 43, 45, 47, and 49.
Their sum is 225, which is 22 squared.
Therefore, C is a possible answer.
D: 67 is not an odd number that is 2 less than a multiple of 4.
E: 44 is not an odd number.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
