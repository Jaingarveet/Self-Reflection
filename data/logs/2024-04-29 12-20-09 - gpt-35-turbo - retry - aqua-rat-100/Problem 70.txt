## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The first train that comes can be either from the harbor line or the main line.
The main line train starts at 5:00 AM and the harbor line train starts at 5:02 AM.
The probability of the man catching the first train depends on which train arrives first.
The probability of the man catching the first train is the probability of the main line train arriving first plus the probability of the harbor line train arriving first.
The probability of the main line train arriving first is 0.5 because it can arrive in the first 10 minutes or the second 10 minutes.
The probability of the harbor line train arriving first is 0.3 because it can arrive in the third 10 minutes, the fourth 10 minutes, or the fifth 10 minutes.
The total probability is 0.5 + 0.3 = 0.8.
Action: Answer("B")
