## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let's say there are 100 chocolates in total.
10% of them are cocoa flavored, which means there are 90 vanilla flavored chocolates.
90% of the vanilla flavored chocolates are squashed, which means only 10% of the vanilla flavored chocolates are not squashed.
So, the percentage of chocolates that are both vanilla flavored and not squashed is 10% of 90, which is 9.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
