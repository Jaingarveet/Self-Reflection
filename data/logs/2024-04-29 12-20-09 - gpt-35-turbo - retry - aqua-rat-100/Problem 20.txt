## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The ratio of boys to girls is 4:3, which means there are 4x boys and 3x girls in the group.
Initially, there were 64 boys and 40 girls, so the total number of members was 64 + 40 = 104.
Let's assume that x boys and x girls joined the group.
So, the total number of boys in the group now is 4x + 64, and the total number of girls is 3x + 40.
The total number of members in the group now is (4x + 64) + (3x + 40) = 7x + 104.
We need to find the value of x to get the total number of members in the group.
The ratio of boys to girls is 4:3, so we can write:
4x/3x = 4/3
Cross-multiplying, we get:
4x * 3 = 3x * 4
12x = 12
x = 1
Substituting x = 1 in the expression for the total number of members, we get:
7x + 104 = 7 + 104 = 111
