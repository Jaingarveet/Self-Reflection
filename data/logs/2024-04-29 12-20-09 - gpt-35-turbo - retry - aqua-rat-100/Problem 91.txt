## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Assistant 2:
Thought:
We can use Pythagoras theorem to find the distance between the starting point and the final point.
The distance travelled towards the north and south will cancel each other out, and the distance travelled towards the east and west will cancel each other out.
So, the distance between the starting point and the final point will be the hypotenuse of the right-angled triangle formed by the remaining distances.
The distance towards the east is greater than the distance towards the west, so the final point will be 2 km towards the east from the starting point.
The remaining distances are 3 km towards the south and 3 km towards the north, which cancel each other out.
So, the remaining distance is the distance between the starting point and the final point, which is the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle with sides 2 km and 5 km.
Using Pythagoras theorem, the distance between the starting point and the final point is sqrt(2^2 + 5^2) = sqrt(29) km.
Action: Answer("E")
