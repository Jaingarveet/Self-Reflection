## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Question: A square piece of cloth is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge to form a rectangular piece, which is then cut diagonally in half to create two triangles. If the area of each of triangle is 70 square feet, what was the perimeter (in feet) of the original piece of square cloth?
Choices:
  A: 56
  B: 58
  C: 60
  D: 62
  E: 64

## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let's assume the original side of the square piece of cloth is x feet.
After trimming 4 feet from one edge, the new dimensions of the rectangular piece are (x-4) feet and x feet.
Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the length of the diagonal of the rectangular piece:
diagonal^2 = (x-4)^2 + x^2
diagonal^2 = 2x^2 - 8x + 16
diagonal = sqrt(2x^2 - 8x + 16)
Each triangle has an area of 70 square feet, so the area of the rectangular piece is 140 square feet:
(x-4)x = 140
x^2 - 4x - 140 = 0
(x-14)(x+10) = 0
x = 14 (since x cannot be negative)
The perimeter of the original square piece of cloth is 4x = 56 feet.
Action: Answer("A")

Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
