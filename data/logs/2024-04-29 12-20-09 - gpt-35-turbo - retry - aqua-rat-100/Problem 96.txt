## Assistant 2:
Let's start by finding the ratio of profit sharing between A, B, and C. 
Total investment = Rs. 40,000 (A) + Rs. 60,000 (B) + Rs. 120,000 (C) = Rs. 220,000
Ratio of profit sharing = (A's investment * time) : (B's investment * time) : (C's investment * time)
Let's assume C joined after t months.
Then, the ratio of profit sharing = (40000*12) : (60000*(12-2-t)) : (120000*(12-t))
150000/375000 = (40000*12) : (60000*(12-2-t)) : (120000*(12-t))
Simplifying this equation, we get t = 4 months.
Therefore, C joined the business 4 months after B joined.
Action: Answer("B")
