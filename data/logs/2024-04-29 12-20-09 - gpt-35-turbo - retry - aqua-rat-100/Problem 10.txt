## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The space shuttle travels 700m in 40 seconds, so its speed is 700/40 = 17.5 m/s.
In the 5 seconds it takes to pass a point, the shuttle will have traveled 17.5 x 5 = 87.5 m.
Therefore, the length of the space shuttle is 700 + 87.5 = 787.5 m.
Action: Answer("None of the Above") [The correct answer is not among the choices provided. The correct answer is 787.5 m.]
