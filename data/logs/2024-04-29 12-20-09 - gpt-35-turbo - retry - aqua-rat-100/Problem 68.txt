## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The prime factorization of 7700 is 2^2 * 5^2 * 7 * 11.
The prime factorization of 350 is 2 * 5^2 * 7.
The greatest common factor of the two integers is 11, which means that the other integer must have a factor of 11 that 350 does not have.
The prime factorization of the other integer must be of the form 2^a * 5^b * 7^c * 11, where a ≤ 2, b ≤ 2, and c ≤ 1.
The least common multiple of the two integers is 7700, which means that the other integer must have a factor of 2^2, a factor of 5^2, a factor of 7, and a factor of 11 that 350 does not have.
The prime factorization of the other integer is 2^2 * 5^2 * 7 * 11 = 7700.
Action: Answer("7700")
## Result:
Agent Answer: 7
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
