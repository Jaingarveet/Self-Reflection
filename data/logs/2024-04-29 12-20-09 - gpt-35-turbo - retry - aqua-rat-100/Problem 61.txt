Question: Kevin drove from A to B at a constant speed of 70 mph. Once he reached B, he turned right around with pause, and returned to A at a constant speed of 90 mph. Exactly 3 hours before the end of his trip, he was still approaching B, only 70 miles away from it. What is the distance between A and B?
Choices:
  A: 180
  B: 90

## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let's call the distance between A and B "d".
We know that Kevin drove at a constant speed of 70 mph from A to B, and then at a constant speed of 90 mph from B to A.
Let's call the time it took Kevin to drive from A to B "t1", and the time it took him to drive from B to A "t2".
We know that t1 + t2 = [REDACTED] (since we know the total time of the trip).
We also know that 70 miles away from B, Kevin had 3 hours left in his trip. Let's call the time it took Kevin to get from B to the point 70 miles away from B "t3". We can use the formula distance = rate x time to find t3.
70 = 90 x t3
t3 = 7/9 hours
We can use t3 to find t2.
t2 = [REDACTED]
We can use t1 and t2 to find d.
d = [REDACTED]
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
