## Assistant 2:
Thought:
First, we need to simplify the expression inside the brackets.
[5 + ? × 19 - 15 - 7] = [? × 19 - 17]
Then, we can substitute this expression into the original equation.
[? × 19 - 17] / [169 - 156] = 6
[? × 19 - 17] / 13 = 6
[? × 19 - 17] = 78
[? × 19] = 95
? = 5
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
