## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let's start with the baguettes and use the information given to find the number of falafels in two baguettes. 
Two baguettes = 5 falafels
Three rolls = 5 falafels
Two rolls = 6 pita breads
So, 6 pita breads = 3 rolls = 5 falafels
Therefore, 2 baguettes = (5 falafels/3 rolls) * (6 pita breads/5 falafels) * 2 baguettes = 24/15 = 8/5
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: C
