## System:
You are an expert in Medicine.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Assistant 2:
  I'm sorry, but you didn't provide any reflection information. Therefore, I cannot use your self-reflection to help you answer this question. However, I can provide you with information on Cicatricial pemphigoid.

Cicatricial pemphigoid, also known as bullous pemphigoid, is a chronic autoimmune disease that affects the skin and mucous membranes. It is caused by the deposition of autoantibodies on the basement membrane zone (BMZ) of the skin, leading to a blistering and scarring process. The autoantibodies in Cicatricial pemphigoid target the BMZ antigens, including collagen XVII, laminin 5, and epiligrin.

In the salt-split skin technique, the skin is split horizontally, and the epidermal side is tested for the presence of IgG antibodies. The choice of antigen bound by IgG on the epidermal side of the salt-split skin technique in Cicatricial pemphigoid would be:

Answer: B Epiligrin

Epiligrin, also known as CD103, is a transmembrane glycoprotein that is expressed on the basal keratinocytes of the epidermis and is a target antigen of autoantibodies in Cicatricial pemphigoid. The autoantibodies against epiligrin are predominantly of the IgG class and are responsible for the blistering and scarring process in the skin.

Therefore, the answer is B: Epiligrin.
