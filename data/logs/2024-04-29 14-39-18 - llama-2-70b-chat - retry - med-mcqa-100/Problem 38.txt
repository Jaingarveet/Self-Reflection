B: Ureterocele - A ureterocele is a narrowing or blockage of the ureter, the tube that connects the kidney to the bladder. It can cause symptoms such as flank pain, nausea, and vomiting, but it does not have a cobra snake head appearance.

C: Posterior urethral valve - A posterior urethral valve is a congenital abnormality that affects the urethra in males. It can cause urinary tract infections, urinary retention, and other symptoms, but it does not have a cobra snake head appearance.

D: Bladder tumor - A bladder tumor can cause symptoms such as hematuria (blood in the urine), dysuria (painful urination), and urinary frequency. However, a cobra snake head appearance is not typically associated with a bladder tumor.
