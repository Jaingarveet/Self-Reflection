## Assistant 2:
  I apologize for my previous mistake. Let's analyze the question again.
A 34-week multigravida with a history of two normal deliveries has an unstable lie with the current pregnancy.
Considering the patient's history and current symptoms, the possible causes of an unstable lie could be:

A) Oligohydramnios: This is a condition where there is a decrease in the amount of amniotic fluid surrounding the fetus. It can cause the fetus to move frequently, making it difficult to determine the fetal lie. However, oligohydramnios is not typically associated with a history of previous normal deliveries.

B) Placenta previa: This is a condition where the placenta partially or completely covers the cervix. It can cause bleeding during pregnancy and may lead to premature birth. However, placenta previa does not typically cause an unstable lie.

C) Pelvic tumor: A pelvic tumor could potentially cause an unstable lie by altering the shape and position of the uterus. However, this is a rare condition and would likely present with other symptoms such as abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding, or urinary problems.

D) Uterine anomalies: This could include conditions such as a bicornuate uterus or a unicornuate uterus, which can cause an unstable lie. However, these conditions are rare and typically present with other symptoms such as recurrent pregnancy loss, abnormal bleeding, or infertility.

After reevaluating the choices, I believe the correct answer is (D) Uterine anomalies.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
