## Assistant 2:
  I apologize for my previous mistake. Let's break down the question again.
Inferior alveolar nerve block is a regional anesthesia technique used to block the inferior alveolar nerve, which is responsible for sensation in the lower teeth, tongue, and surrounding tissues.
The inferior alveolar nerve emerges from the skull through the mandibular foramen, which is located in the posterior portion of the mandible. Therefore, the nerve block is typically performed in the submandibular space, which is located just below the mandible.
