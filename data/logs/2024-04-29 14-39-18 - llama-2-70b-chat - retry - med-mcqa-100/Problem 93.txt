Comedonal acne is a type of acne that occurs when the pores on the skin become clogged with dead skin cells, oil, and other debris. It is often caused by hormonal changes, such as those that occur during pregnancy or menstruation.

The best treatment for comedonal acne depends on the severity of the condition and the individual's skin type and sensitivity. However, based on the given choices, the most appropriate treatment would be:
