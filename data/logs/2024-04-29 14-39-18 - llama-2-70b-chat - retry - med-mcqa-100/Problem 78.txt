Here are some general tips for answering this question:

The facial artery is a branch of the external carotid artery that supplies blood to the face. It terminates in the anastomosis with another artery that supplies blood to the face.

The choices are:

A: Opposite side of the facial artery - This choice is incorrect because the facial artery does not anastomose with itself.

B: Transverse facial artery - This choice is incorrect because the transverse facial artery is a branch of the facial artery that supplies blood to the lower face.

C: Anastomosis with Infra orbital artery - This choice is correct. The facial artery terminates in anastomosis with the infraorbital artery, which supplies blood to the lower eyelid, the lacrimal gland, and the nasal cavity.

D: Branch of the ophthalmic artery - This choice is incorrect because the ophthalmic artery supplies blood to the eye and its surrounding tissues, but it does not anastomose with the facial artery.

Action: Answer("C")
