## Assistant 2:
  I'm sorry, but you haven't provided any reflection information to help you answer this question. Unfortunately, without additional information, I cannot assist you in answering this question.

Here are some general tips that may help you answer this question:

1. Levodopa is converted into dopamine in the brain, which helps replace the dopamine that is lost in Parkinson's disease. It does not affect cholinergic activity.
2. Benserazide is a peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor that blocks the conversion of levodopa to dopamine in the periphery, which helps reduce side effects such as nausea and vomiting. It does not affect cholinergic activity.
3. Selegiline is a selective monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) inhibitor that increases the levels of dopamine and serotonin in the brain. It does not directly affect cholinergic activity.
4. Biperiden is an anticholinergic drug that blocks the action of acetylcholine at muscarinic receptors. It is used to treat Parkinson's disease because it can help reduce tremors, rigidity, and bradykinesia.

Based on the information above, the answer to the question is D: Biperiden. It acts by decreasing brain cholinergic activity by blocking the action of acetylcholine at muscarinic receptors.
