  I'm sorry, but since there is no reflection information provided, I cannot use my self-reflection to help me answer this question. However, I can give you some information about seizures in newborns.

Seizures are a common problem in newborns, and they can be caused by a variety of factors, such as infections, birth trauma, and genetic disorders. The most common type of seizure in newborns is a tonic seizure, which is characterized by a sudden stiffening of the muscles, often accompanied by a cry or other sound.

Tonic seizures are caused by abnormal electrical activity in the brain, and they can be a sign of a serious underlying condition, such as meningitis or encephalitis. It is important to recognize and treat tonic seizures promptly to prevent complications and improve outcomes for the baby.
