Answer: 
The most likely completion to the text is:
The lady and man start to sweep the ice using the broom.

Explanation:
The presence of a broom in the scene suggests that the lady and man are likely preparing to play a game of curling, which involves sweeping the ice to influence the path of the curling stones. Therefore, the most likely action they would take is to start sweeping the ice using the broom.

Reflection:
My previous answer was incorrect because I failed to consider the context of the scene and the purpose of the broom. I realized that the presence of the broom suggests that the scene is likely set in a curling rink, and that the lady and man are preparing to play a game of curling. This led me to the correct answer, which is that they start sweeping the ice using the broom.
