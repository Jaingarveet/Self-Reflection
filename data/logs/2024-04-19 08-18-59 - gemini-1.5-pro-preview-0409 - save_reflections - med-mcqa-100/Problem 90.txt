## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:** My reasoning was flawed. While oligohydramnios can restrict fetal movement, it's not the only factor influencing fetal lie. I failed to consider that placenta previa can also cause an unstable lie by physically obstructing the fetus from settling into a head-down position.
**Error Keywords:**
*   Incorrect reasoning
*   Incomplete knowledge 
*   Misinterpretation of clinical scenario
## Step-by-Step Solution
1. **Understand the problem:** The question asks for the cause of an unstable lie at 34 weeks in a multigravida with previous normal deliveries.
2. **Analyze the options:**
    *   **Oligohydramnios:** Can restrict fetal movement, but not the only cause of unstable lie.
    *   **Placenta previa:** Can physically obstruct the fetus from assuming a head-down position, leading to an unstable lie.
    *   **Pelvic tumor:**  Less likely at this gestation with previous normal deliveries.
    *   **Uterine anomalies:** Less likely with previous normal deliveries.
3. **Choose the most likely cause:** Based on the analysis, placenta previa (B) is the most likely cause of an unstable lie in this scenario. 
## Instructions for Future Problem Solving
1. **Consider all possible causes:** Don't focus on just one factor, even if it seems likely. 
2. **Analyze each option carefully:** Evaluate how each option could contribute to the presented scenario.
3. **Prioritize based on likelihood:** Consider the patient's history and the gestational age when assessing the likelihood of each option.
4. **Review knowledge gaps:** If unsure, research the topic further to improve understanding.
## General Advice for Similar Problems
*   **Think comprehensively:** Consider all aspects of the patient's presentation and history.
*   **Develop differential diagnoses:** List all possible causes and systematically evaluate each one.
*   **Stay updated:** Continuously update medical knowledge to ensure accurate diagnoses.
*   **Consult resources:** Utilize textbooks, medical journals, and colleagues for clarification and support.
