## Reflection on Cicatricial Pemphigoid Question
**Explanation:** I incorrectly associated Cicatricial pemphigoid with BP antigens 1 & 2, which are actually key players in Bullous pemphigoid, a similar but distinct condition. This demonstrates a gap in my knowledge regarding the specific target antigens in different autoimmune blistering diseases.
**Error Keywords:**
*  **Knowledge Gap:** Misidentification of target antigen
*  **Confusion:**  Between similar autoimmune blistering diseases 
*  **Specificity:**  Lack of understanding of subtle differences in disease pathology
**Step-by-Step Solution:**
1. **Recall:** Cicatricial pemphigoid is an autoimmune blistering disease affecting the basement membrane zone.
2. **Differentiate:**  Distinguish it from Bullous pemphigoid, which targets different antigens.
3. **Identify:** The key target antigen in Cicatricial pemphigoid is Collagen XVII (also known as BP180).
4. **Salt Split Skin Technique:** Remember that this technique separates the epidermis from the dermis at the level of the lamina lucida.
5. **Location:** Collagen XVII is located in the lamina lucida, on the epidermal side of the split.
6. **Conclusion:** Therefore, in Cicatricial pemphigoid, IgG autoantibodies bind to Collagen XVII on the epidermal side of the salt split skin.
**Instructions for Future:**
1. **Review:**  Autoimmune blistering diseases and their specific target antigens.
2. **Differentiate:** Clearly distinguish between similar conditions like Bullous pemphigoid and Cicatricial pemphigoid.
3. **Focus:** Pay close attention to the specific details of each disease, including the location and function of target antigens.
4. **Salt Split Skin Technique:** Understand the principles and interpretation of this technique in the context of autoimmune blistering diseases.
**General Advice:**
* **Knowledge Base:** Continuously expand and update your medical knowledge base.
* **Differential Diagnosis:**  Develop strong skills in differential diagnosis to distinguish between similar conditions.
* **Attention to Detail:** Focus on the specific details and nuances of each disease and diagnostic test.
* **Review and Update:** Regularly review and update your understanding of complex topics.
