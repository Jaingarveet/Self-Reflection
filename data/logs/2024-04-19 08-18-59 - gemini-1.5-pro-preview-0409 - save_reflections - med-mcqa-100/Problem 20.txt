## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:**
While both Louis Pasteur and Robert Koch played significant roles in developing and proving the germ theory of disease, the question asks for the individual who *proposed* the theory. My error was in attributing the proposal solely to Koch, neglecting Pasteur's foundational contributions.
**Error Keywords:**
*   Attribution error
*   Historical figure identification error
*   Germ theory of disease knowledge gap
## Solving the Problem
1.  **Recall the key figures in the history of germ theory:** Leeuwenhoek, Koch, Pasteur, and Paré.
2.  **Eliminate options based on their contributions:**
    *   Leeuwenhoek: First to observe microorganisms, but did not link them to disease.
    *   Koch: Developed postulates to establish a causal relationship between a microbe and a disease.
    *   Paré: Pioneer in surgery and battlefield medicine, predating germ theory.
    *   **Pasteur:** Conducted experiments with fermentation and pasteurization, demonstrating the role of microbes in causing disease and spoilage.
3.  **Identify the individual who proposed the theory:** Based on the analysis, Louis Pasteur is the most appropriate answer as he laid the groundwork for the germ theory with his experiments and observations.
## Instructions for Future Problem Solving
1.  **Carefully analyze the question:** Pay attention to keywords like "proposed" to understand the specific requirement.
2.  **Review relevant historical figures and their contributions:** Ensure a comprehensive understanding of each individual's role in the development of the theory.
3.  **Differentiate between observation, experimentation, and proposal:** Recognize the distinct stages in the development of a scientific theory.
4.  **Consider the timeline of events:** Understand the chronological order of discoveries and proposals to accurately attribute the theory.
## General Advice for Similar Problems
*   **Strengthen knowledge base:** Continuously expand your understanding of key scientific figures and their contributions.
*   **Develop critical thinking skills:** Analyze information carefully and avoid jumping to conclusions.
*   **Pay attention to detail:** Focus on specific keywords and requirements within the question.
*   **Learn from mistakes:** Reflect on errors and adjust your approach for future problem-solving.
