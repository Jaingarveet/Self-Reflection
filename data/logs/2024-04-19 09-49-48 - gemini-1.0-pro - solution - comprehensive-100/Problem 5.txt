## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
Let the number of members in the club be n.
Then, the sum of the ages of all the members = 7 + (7 + 3) + (7 + 6) + ... + (7 + 3(n - 1))
= n(7 + 3(n - 1))/2
= [REDACTED]0
=> n(7 + 3n - 3) = 500
=> n(3n + 4) = 500
=> 3n^2 + 4n - 500 = 0
=> 3n^2 + 30n - [REDACTED]n - 500 = 0
=> 3n(n + 10) - [REDACTED](n + 10) = 0
=> (3n - [REDACTED])(n + 10) = 0
=> n = [REDACTED] or n = -10
Since, the number of members cannot be negative, therefore n = [REDACTED].
The sum of the ages of the members is [REDACTED]0.
The average age of the members is [REDACTED]0/[REDACTED] = 9.61 years.
The youngest member is 7 years old.
The oldest member is 7 + 3([REDACTED] - 1) = 80 years old.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The sum of an arithmetic progression is the number of terms multiplied by the average of the first and last terms.
We know the sum of the ages of all the members is 250 and the youngest member is 7 years old.
We can use this information to find the number of terms.
Let the number of terms be n.
Then, the sum of the ages of all the members = n(7 + 3(n - 1))/2 = 250
=> n(7 + 3n - 3) = 500
=> n(3n + 4) = 500
=> 3n^2 + 4n - 500 = 0
=> 3n^2 + 30n - 26n - 500 = 0
=> 3n(n + 10) - 26(n + 10) = 0
=> (3n - 26)(n + 10) = 0
=> n = 26 or n = -10
Since, the number of terms cannot be negative, therefore n = 26.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: C
