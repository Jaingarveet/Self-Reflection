Solution:
1. The two floors of the human resources department and the sales department are not adjacent.
2. The finance department is on the next floor of the planning department.
3. The floor of the administrative department is above the planning department, but below the human resources department.
4. The Human Resources Department is not at the upper level of the Administration Department.
Let's analyze the options:
[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]
This is possible. The sales department could be on the 6th floor, the R&[REDACTED] department on the 5th floor, and the HR department on the 4th floor.
[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]
This is possible. The sales department could be on the 4th floor, the administrative department on the 3rd floor, the planning department on the 2nd floor, and the finance department on the 1st floor.
[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]
This is not possible. If the sales department were above the planning department, then the HR department would have to be adjacent to the sales department, which is not allowed.
