## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
1. Identify the given information:
    - Maximum speed: 700 m/s
    - Time to travel 700 m high: 40 seconds
    - Time to pass a point: 5 seconds
2. Calculate the actual speed:
    - Speed = Distance / Time
    - Speed = 700 m / 40 s
    - Speed = 17.5 m/s
3. Calculate the length of the space shuttle:
    - Length = Speed * Time (to pass a point)
    - Length = 17.5 m/s * 5 s
    - Length = 87.5 m
4. Choose the answer that matches the calculated length:
    - Answer: [REDACTED] ([REDACTED]) - closest to the calculated length of 87.5 m
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The space shuttle travels 700 meters in 40 seconds, which means its speed is 700/40 = 17.5 meters per second.
To pass a point, it takes 5 seconds, so its length must be 17.5 * 5 = 87.5 meters.
Action: Answer("E")
## Result:
Agent Answer: E
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
