## Self-Reflection
**Previous Incorrect Answer:**
My previous answer was incorrect because I focused on the overall trend of rising housing prices and land prices, without considering the specific details provided in the answer choices.
**Correct Answer:**
The correct answer is **B: Residential prices in Beijing increased by 7.2% in the first quarter of 2005 compared with the same period last year, and residential land prices rose by 0.37%.**
**Reasoning:**
This answer choice is the most doubtful because it suggests that a relatively small increase in land prices (0.37%) led to a much larger increase in housing prices (7.2%). This contradicts the assertion that rising land prices are the chief culprit in soaring housing prices.
**Additional Insights:**
* Answer choice A is plausible because it shows a larger increase in land prices (6.53%) compared to housing prices (19.1%).
* Answer choice C is a statement of opinion and does not provide any concrete evidence to support the assertion.
* Answer choice D is a possible explanation for rising housing prices, but it does not necessarily contradict the assertion that rising land prices are the chief culprit.
**Conclusion:**
By carefully analyzing the specific details provided in the answer choices, I was able to identify the most doubtful assertion. This demonstrates the importance of considering all available information before drawing conclusions.
