## Assistant 2:
I apologize for the previous incorrect answer. I have reviewed my solution and identified the error. I will use this experience to improve my accuracy in the future.
Here's the correct solution:
**Step 1: Determine the scale of the map.**
The scale of the map is 1/4 inch = 10 miles. This means that every 1/4 inch on the map corresponds to an actual distance of 10 miles.
**Step 2: Convert the map distance to actual distance.**
The map distance from Town F to Town G is 20 inches. To find the actual distance, we need to multiply the map distance by the scale of the map:
Actual distance = Map distance × Scale
Actual distance = 20 inches × (10 miles/1/4 inch)
**Step 3: Simplify the expression.**
To simplify the expression, we can multiply 20 by 10 and divide by 1/4. Dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by the reciprocal. The reciprocal of 1/4 is 4/1.
Actual distance = 20 × 10 × 4/1
Actual distance = 800 miles
Therefore, the actual distance from Town F to Town G along this road is 800 miles.
**Action: Answer("A")**
