# Model: gemini-1.0-pro | Agent: solution | Exam: comprehensive-100 | Problem 62 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:

Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: $$\begin{array}{r}3 x+4 y=-23 \\2 y-x=-19\end{array}$$What is the solution $(x, y)$ to the system of equations above?
Choices:
  A: $(-5,-2)$
  B: $(3,-8)$
  C: $(4,-6)$
  D: $(9,-6)$
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
1. Identify the system of equations to be solved.
2. Choose a variable to solve for using substitution.
3. Solve for the chosen variable in terms of the other variable.
4. Substitute the solved expression for the chosen variable into the other equation.
5. Solve for the remaining variable.
6. Substitute the value of the solved variable back into the equation from step 3 to solve for the first variable.
7. Double-check all calculations and substitutions.
8. Choose the answer that matches the calculated values of $x$ and $y$.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
I previously answered this question incorrectly because I did not solve for the variables correctly.
I will use the steps I outlined in my reflection to solve for the variables correctly this time.
Step 1: The system of equations is:
$$\begin{array}{r}3 x+4 y=-23 \\2 y-x=-19\end{array}$$
Step 2: I will solve for $x$ in terms of $y$ using the second equation.
$2y-x=-19$
$x=2y+19$
Step 3: I will substitute the expression for $x$ into the first equation.
$3(2y+19)+4y=-23$
$6y+57+4y=-23$
$10y+57=-23$
$10y=-80$
$y=-8$
Step 4: I will substitute the value of $y$ back into the equation from step 3 to solve for $x$.
$x=2(-8)+19$
$x=-16+19$
$x=3$
Step 5: The solution $(x, y)$ is $(3, -8)$.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
