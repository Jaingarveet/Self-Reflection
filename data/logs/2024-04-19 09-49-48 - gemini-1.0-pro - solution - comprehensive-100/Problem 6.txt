**Previous Incorrect Answer:**
My previous answer was incorrect because I made a mistake in my calculations. I incorrectly assumed that the midpoint of a line segment divides the segment into two equal parts. However, this is only true if the line segment is bisected perpendicularly. In this case, the midpoint U divides line segment ST into two segments, RU and UT, with lengths of 6 and 16, respectively.
**Correct Answer:**
To find the length of line segment RU, we can use the following formula:
```
RU = (ST - RT) / 2
```
Substituting the given values, we get:
```
RU = (22 - 17) / 2 = 5 / 2 = 2.5
```
Therefore, the length of line segment RU is 2.5.
**Action:** Answer("E")
