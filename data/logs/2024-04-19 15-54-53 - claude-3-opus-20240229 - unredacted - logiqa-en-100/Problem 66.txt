## System:
You are an expert in Logic.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Topic: Logic
Context: There are five volcanic islands E, F, G, H, and I in the east coast of a country.They are arranged in a straight line from north to south, and they are found? (1) F is adjacent to H and is on the north side of H.(2) I and E are adjacent.(3) G is somewhere in the north of F.
Question: If it is found that G is the northernmost island, how many possible arrangements are there for this group of islands?
Choices:
  A: 2
  B: 3
  C: 4
  D: 5
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I failed to consider all possible arrangements of the islands given the constraints. I correctly identified that G must be the northernmost island and that F must be directly north of H. However, I did not account for the fact that I and E can be arranged in two different ways relative to each other, and these arrangements can occur on either side of the F-H pair.
Error Keywords:
 - Incomplete analysis
 - Overlooked possibilities
 - Combinatorics error
 - Logical reasoning error
Solution:
1. G is the northernmost island.
2. F is adjacent to H and is on the north side of H. So the arrangement of F and H is fixed as: F - H
3. I and E are adjacent, but their relative positions can vary. There are two possible arrangements: I - E and E - I
4. The I-E or E-I pair can be placed either north or south of the F-H pair.
5. Considering all the possibilities, we have the following 4 arrangements:
   - G - I - E - F - H
   - G - E - I - F - H
   - G - F - H - I - E
   - G - F - H - E - I
6. Therefore, there are 4 possible arrangements in total.
Instructions:
1. Identify the fixed positions or arrangements based on the given information.
2. Identify the elements or groups whose positions can vary.
3. Determine the number of possible arrangements for the variable elements or groups.
4. Consider all possible combinations of the fixed and variable components.
5. Count the total number of valid arrangements.
6. Select the answer choice that matches the total count.
Advice:
 - Always consider all possibilities that satisfy the given constraints.
 - Break the problem down into fixed and variable components.
 - Systematically consider the different arrangements of the variable components.
 - Use combinatorial principles when appropriate to determine the number of possible arrangements.
 - Be thorough in your analysis and don't prematurely eliminate potential solutions.
