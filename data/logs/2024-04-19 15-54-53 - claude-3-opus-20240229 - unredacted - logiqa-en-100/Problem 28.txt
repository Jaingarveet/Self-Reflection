## System:
You are an expert in Logic.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## User 2:
Topic: Logic
Context: A provincial Go team coach selects 4 of the 7 players from E, F, G, H, J, K and M to participate in the professional league.The selection must meet the following conditions? E or F has one person to participate, but not both .One of J or K will participate, but not both.If J participates, then G participates.Unless F participates, M does not participate.
Question: Which two of the following players will be selected by the coach to make the four-person team the only choice?
Choices:
  A: F and H
  C: G and M
  B: G and J
  D: H and M
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I made an error in my logical reasoning. I correctly identified some of the constraints, but I failed to consider all possible combinations that would lead to a unique solution. I focused on individual conditions without considering how they interact to limit the possible team compositions.
Error Keywords:
 - Logical reasoning error
 - Incomplete analysis
 - Failure to consider all possibilities
 - Combinatorial reasoning error
Solution:
Let's break this down step-by-step:
1. Either E or F will participate, but not both.
2. Either J or K will participate, but not both.
3. If J participates, then G must participate.
4. M will only participate if F participates.
Now, let's consider the implications:
- If J participates, then G must participate, and K cannot participate. This accounts for 2 slots.
- If K participates, then J cannot participate. This accounts for 1 slot.
- If F participates, then E cannot participate, and M may participate. This accounts for 1 or 2 slots.
- If E participates, then F cannot participate, and thus M cannot participate. This accounts for 1 slot.
The question asks which two players, if selected, would make the four-person team the only choice. This means that these two players, along with the constraints, should uniquely determine the other two players.
The only pair that does this is H and M:
- If H and M are selected, then F must be selected (because of M), and thus E cannot be selected.
- With F selected, either J or K can be selected for the fourth slot, but if J is selected, then G must also be selected, which would exceed the team size. Therefore, K must be selected.
Thus, if H and M are selected, the only possible four-person team is F, H, K, and M.
Instructions:
1. Carefully read the problem and note down all the constraints.
2. Consider the implications of each constraint.
3. Look for combinations of players that, if selected, would uniquely determine the rest of the team.
4. Systematically go through each answer choice, testing if it leads to a unique team composition.
5. Select the answer choice that leads to a unique team composition.
Advice:
 - In combinatorial logic problems, consider all the constraints and their implications.
 - Look for key pieces of information that can significantly limit the possible combinations.
 - Systematically test each possibility, eliminating those that don't fit the constraints.
 - Be careful not to make assumptions; rely only on the given information and the logical implications of that information.
