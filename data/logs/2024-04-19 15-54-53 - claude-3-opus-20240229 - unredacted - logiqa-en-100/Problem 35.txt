## System:
You are an expert in Logic.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Topic: Logic
Context: Five graduate students Zhang, Wang, Li, Zhao, and Liu graduated from a linguistics major in a college of arts of a university in 2014, and were hired by one of the three employers, Tianshu, Tianji, and Tianxuan, and at least one of them was hired by each unit.name.Known? (1) Li was hired by Tianshu; (2) Li and Zhao were not hired by the same unit; (3) Liu and Zhao were hired by the same unit; (4) If Zhang was hired by Tianxuan, then Wang Ye Was hired by Tianxuan.
Question: Which of the following may be correct?
Choices:
  A: Li and Liu were hired by the same unit.
  B: Wang, Zhao and Liu were all hired by Tianji.
  C: Only Liu was hired by Tian Xuan.
  D: Only Wang was hired by Tianxuan.
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I made an error in my logical reasoning. I correctly deduced that Li was in Tianshu, and Zhao and Liu were in the same unit but not Tianshu. However, I failed to properly consider the implications of the fourth condition: "If Zhang was hired by Tianxuan, then Wang was hired by Tianxuan." This means that either both Zhang and Wang are in Tianxuan, or neither of them are. I incorrectly thought that Zhang could be in Tianji while Wang was in Tianxuan.
Error Keywords:
 - Logical reasoning error
 - Conditional statement misinterpretation
 - Insufficient case analysis
Solution:
1. Li was hired by Tianshu. (given)
2. Li and Zhao were not hired by the same unit. (given)
   So Zhao was not hired by Tianshu.
3. Liu and Zhao were hired by the same unit. (given) 
   Since Zhao was not hired by Tianshu, Liu was also not hired by Tianshu.
4. If Zhang was hired by Tianxuan, then Wang was hired by Tianxuan. (given)
   This means either both Zhang and Wang are in Tianxuan, or neither of them are.
5. We know that all units hired at least one person. 
   If Zhang and Wang are not in Tianxuan, then they must both be in Tianji (because Tianshu is taken by Li). 
   In this case, Zhao and Liu must be in Tianxuan.
6. The other possibility is that both Zhang and Wang are in Tianxuan. 
   In this case, Zhao and Liu must be in Tianji.
7. In either case, only one person (either Wang or Liu) is in Tianxuan.
8. Looking at the choices, only D matches this deduction.
Instructions:
1. Carefully read and understand each given condition.
2. Draw out the implications of each condition step by step.
3. Pay special attention to conditional statements and what they imply.
4. Consider all possible cases that satisfy the conditions.
5. Eliminate choices that contradict any of the given conditions or deduced facts.
6. Choose the answer that matches the deductions.
Advice:
 - Always read the question and conditions carefully and understand them fully before attempting to solve.
 - Break down complex conditions into simpler implications and facts.
 - Be very careful with conditional statements. Consider what must be true if the condition is true, and what must be true if the condition is false.
 - Systematically consider all possible cases. Don't jump to conclusions based on partial analysis.
 - Eliminate answer choices one by one based on deduced facts. The correct answer must be consistent with all given information.
 - If stuck, try working backwards from the answer choices, seeing if you can rule any out.
