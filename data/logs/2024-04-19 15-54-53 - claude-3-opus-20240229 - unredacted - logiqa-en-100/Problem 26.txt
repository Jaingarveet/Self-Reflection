## System:
You are an expert in Logic.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## User 2:
Topic: Logic
Context: The late famous logician Jin Yuelin of China heard the words "Money is like dung" and "Friends are worth a thousand dollars" when he was a child, and found that there are logical problems because they can lead to the absurd conclusion of "friends are like dung".
Question: Since the conclusion of "friends like dung" is not true, it can be logically derived?
Choices:
  A: The expression "money is like dung" is false.
  B: If a friend is indeed worth a lot of money, then money is not like dung.
  C: The statement that "friends are valuable" is true.
  D: The words "Money is like dung" and "Friends are worth a thousand dollars" are either true or false.
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I made an error in my logical reasoning. I correctly identified that the two statements together lead to an absurd conclusion, and that at least one of them must be false. However, I failed to recognize the specific logical relationship between the two statements that the question was asking about.
Error Keywords:
 - Logical reasoning error
 - Conditional statement error
 - Implication error
Solution:
The two given statements are:
1. "Money is like dung"
2. "Friends are worth a thousand dollars"
If we assume statement 2 is true, that friends are indeed worth a thousand dollars, then combining it with statement 1 leads to the absurd conclusion that "friends are like dung".
However, if statement 2 is true, then for the conclusion to be false, statement 1 must be false. In other words, if friends are truly worth a lot of money, then it cannot be true that money is like dung.
This is a conditional statement: If friends are worth a thousand dollars, then money is not like dung.
Instructions:
1. Identify the given statements and the absurd conclusion.
2. Assume one statement is true and see what that implies about the other statement.
3. Look for a conditional relationship: if one statement is true, what must be true about the other statement to avoid the absurd conclusion?
4. Choose the answer that best represents this conditional relationship.
Advice:
 - In logical reasoning, always consider the relationships and implications between statements.
 - Pay attention to conditional statements (if-then statements).
 - Consider the consequences of assuming each statement is true or false.
 - Eliminate absurd conclusions by determining what must be true or false for those conclusions to be avoided.
 - Be precise in your logical language and reasoning.
