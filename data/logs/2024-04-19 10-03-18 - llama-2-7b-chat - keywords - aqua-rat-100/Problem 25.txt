## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: A car is being driven, in a straight line and at a uniform speed, towards the base of a vertical tower. The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower?
Choices:
  A: 5(√3 + 1)
  B: 6(√3 + √2)
  C: 7(√3 – 1)
  D: 8(√3 – 2)
  E: None of these

## Assistant 2:
  Thought: 
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand the mistake. The correct solution involves using the formula for the time it takes for an angle to change by a certain amount: θ = (t/2) tan(θ0/2) + (t/2) tan(θ1/2), where θ0 and θ1 are the initial and final angles, respectively, and t is the time.

In this case, the initial angle is 45°, the final angle is 60°, and the time taken is 10 minutes. Therefore, the time taken to reach the base of the tower is:

Action: Answer("B")
