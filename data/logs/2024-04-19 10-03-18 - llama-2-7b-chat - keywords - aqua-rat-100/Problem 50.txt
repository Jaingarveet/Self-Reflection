## Assistant 2:
  Thought: 
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand the mistake now. The problem states that the plane started with 10 times the speed of the ship, which means the plane traveled 10 times the distance the ship traveled. So, if the ship traveled 180 miles, the plane traveled 1800 miles. To find the distance when they meet from the starting point, we need to add the distance traveled by the ship and the plane.

Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: C
