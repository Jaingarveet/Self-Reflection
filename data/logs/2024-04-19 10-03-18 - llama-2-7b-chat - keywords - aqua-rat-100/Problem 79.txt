## Assistant 2:
  Thought: I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I am now reflecting on my solution and the correct answer.

Action: I will use my self-reflection to help me answer the question.

Self-Reflection:

* I previously thought that each daughter would receive Rs 400, but upon further reflection, I realize that this is not the correct answer.
* I understand that each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, so each daughter should receive Rs 4 \* 2 = Rs 8 more than each nephew.
* I also understand that each son receives five times as much as each nephew, so each son should receive Rs 5 \* 2 = Rs 10 more than each nephew.
* Therefore, each daughter receives Rs 8600 / 5 = Rs 1720.

Action: Answer("C")
