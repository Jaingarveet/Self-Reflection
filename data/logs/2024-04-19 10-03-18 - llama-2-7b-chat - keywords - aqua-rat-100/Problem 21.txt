Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.

Question: x men working x hours per day can do x units of a work in x days. How much work can be completed by y men working y hours per day in y days?
Choices:
A: x2/y2 units
B: y3/x2 units
C: x3/y2 units
D: y2/x2 units
E: None of these

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I realized that I made a mistake in my calculation. Here is my self-reflection:

I misunderstood the problem and thought it was asking for the total work done by x men in x days, rather than the work done by y men in y days. I calculated the answer incorrectly and selected option A, which is not the correct solution.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to use the formula:
Work done = Number of men x Hours per day x Work done per hour

So, if x men working x hours per day can do x units of work in x days, then y men working y hours per day can do y units of work in y days.

Therefore, the correct answer is option C: x3/y2 units.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.
