## Assistant 2:
  Thought: 
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand that I made a miscalculation in my reasoning. I will carefully reevaluate the problem to find the correct answer.

Reflection:
Let's break down the problem:

The number of friends who attended the picnic was initially 8.
Four friends did not turn up, so the number of friends who attended the picnic became 8 - 4 = 4.
The remaining friends had to contribute Rs. 4 extra each, so the total amount spent on eatables became Rs. 96 + (4 x Rs. 4) = Rs. 96 + 16 = Rs. 112.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 16.

Action: Answer("C")

Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: A
