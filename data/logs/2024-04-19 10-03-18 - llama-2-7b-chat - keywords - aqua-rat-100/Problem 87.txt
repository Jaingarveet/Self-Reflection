## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Error Keywords: Combinatorics, Permutations, Misapplication of principles

Reflection:

When solving the problem, I mistakenly applied the formula for permutations instead of combinations. I misunderstood the problem and thought it was asking for the number of permutations of 2 oranges chosen from the basket, which would be calculated using the formula n! (n factorial). However, the problem actually asked for the number of combinations of 2 oranges chosen from the basket, which is calculated using the formula nC2 (n choose 2).

To calculate the number of combinations of 2 oranges chosen from a basket of 10 oranges, we need to use the formula nC2 = n! / (n-2)!. Plugging in n = 10, we get:

nC2 = 10! / (10-2)! = 10 x 8 = 80

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 90.

Action: Answer("B")
