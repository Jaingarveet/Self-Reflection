## Assistant 2:
  Thought: 
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand that I made a mistake in my calculation. I will take a closer look at the problem and my solution to determine where I went wrong.

Reflection:
The question asks how many minutes it will take for a cyclist to travel 48 miles at a speed of 12 miles per hour. To solve this problem, I will use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

I mistakenly calculated the time as 240 minutes (B), when in fact it should be 60 minutes (D). My calculation error occurred when I divided the distance by the speed instead of multiplying it.

Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
