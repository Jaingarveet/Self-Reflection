Question: At what price should the Karan mark a sewing machine that costs him Rs. 1200/- so that even after offering a 20% discount, he makes 20% profit?

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand where I went wrong. Here's my reflection:

I calculated the cost price of the sewing machine to be Rs. 1200, and then I calculated the discount as 20% of the cost price, which is Rs. 240. However, I made a mistake in my calculation. I should have calculated the discount as 20% of the selling price, not the cost price.

So, the correct calculation for the selling price is:

Selling price = Cost price + Discount
= Rs. 1200 + Rs. 240
= Rs. 1440

Therefore, the price at which Karan should mark the sewing machine to make a 20% profit is Rs. 1440.

Action: Answer("D")
