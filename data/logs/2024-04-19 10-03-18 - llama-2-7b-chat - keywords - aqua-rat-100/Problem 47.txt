Question: An athlete runs M miles in 4 hours, then rides a bike N miles in the same number of hours. Which of the following represents the average speed, in miles per hour, for these two activities combined?

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly as B: 2M + N / 8. However, upon further reflection, I realized my mistake. The correct answer is C: M + N / 4.

Explanation:
The problem states that the athlete runs M miles in 4 hours, which means they ran at a speed of M / 4 miles per hour. Then, they ride a bike N miles in the same number of hours, which means they rode at a speed of N / 4 miles per hour. To find the average speed for these two activities combined, we need to add their speeds and divide by 2: (M / 4) + (N / 4) = (M + N) / 4. Therefore, the answer is C: M + N / 4.
