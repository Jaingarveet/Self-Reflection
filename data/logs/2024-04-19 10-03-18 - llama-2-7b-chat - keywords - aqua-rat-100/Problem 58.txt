## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Choices:
  A: 1 hour and 31 minutes
  B: 2 hour and 31 minutes
  C: 3 hour and 31 minutes

## Assistant 2:
  Thought: 
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand the mistake. The key to solving this problem is to recognize that both balls are making full rotations, and the time it takes for one ball to make a full rotation is the same as the time it takes for the other ball to make 5 full rotations.

Action: Answer("B")

Self-Reflection:

I reflected on my previous answer and realized that I made a mistake in my calculation. I misunderstood the problem and calculated the time it would take for one ball to make a full rotation, instead of recognizing that both balls are making full rotations. I also failed to consider the fact that the time it takes for one ball to make a full rotation is the same as the time it takes for the other ball to make 5 full rotations.

To solve the problem correctly, I used the information that Ball A makes 2 full rotations in 26 minutes, and Ball B makes 5 full rotations in 35 minutes. I then calculated the time it would take for both balls to be at the same starting point again, and I arrived at the answer "B: 2 hour and 31 minutes".

I learned that it is important to carefully read and understand the problem before starting to calculate the answer. I also learned that it is essential to recognize patterns and relationships in the problem to arrive at the correct solution.
