## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Assistant 2:
  Thought: 
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand the mistake. To solve this problem, I need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 16 and 17, which is 328. Then, I need to multiply the time it takes for Train A to leave by 328 to find the time until they both leave again.

Action: Answer("C")

Reflection:
I reflected on my previous answer and realized that I made a mistake in my calculation. I misunderstood the problem and did not use the correct method to solve it. I should have used the least common multiple (LCM) of 16 and 17 to find the time until both trains leave again. I will make sure to be more careful and accurate in my calculations in the future.
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
