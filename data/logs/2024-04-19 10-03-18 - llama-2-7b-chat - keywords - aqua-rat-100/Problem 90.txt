## Assistant 2:
  Thought: I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I am now reflecting on my solution and the correct answer.

Action: I will re-evaluate the problem using the correct method.

Thought: The cost of a newspaper on Sunday is $4, and the cost for the rest of the days of the week is $1. If a hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week, and it pays $210 per week for newspapers, we can set up the following equation:

Sunday papers = 2 x Monday papers

Substituting the cost of a newspaper on Sunday into the equation, we get:

Sunday papers = 2 x Monday papers = $4 x 2 = $8

So, the hotel buys 8 newspapers on Monday.

Action: Answer("B")
