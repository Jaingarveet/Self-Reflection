## Assistant 2:
  Thought: I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand that the servant wants his monthly income to be 6000 Rupees. To calculate the minimum sale required to achieve this, I will use the formula:

Monthly income = Monthly salary + Commission

Monthly salary = 1500 Rupees
Commission = 15% of monthly sale

So, the minimum sale required to achieve a monthly income of 6000 Rupees is:

Monthly sale = 1500 + (15% of 30000) = 1500 + 4500 = 5950

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 415000 Rupees.
