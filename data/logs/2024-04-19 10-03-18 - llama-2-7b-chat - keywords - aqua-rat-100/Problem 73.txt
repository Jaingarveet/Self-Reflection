## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Assistant 2:
  Thought: I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I need to reassess the problem.

Reflection: I made a mistake in my previous answer by not considering the constraints given in the question. I realized that 20% of the students took physics, and 28% of the students took math. This means that the total number of students who took either physics or math is 100% (20% + 28% = 48%).

Now, I need to find the least possible number of students in the school. Let's assume that the number of students in the school is x.

From the problem statement, we know that at least 20% of the students took physics, which means that the number of students who took physics is at least 20% of x. Similarly, at least 28% of the students took math, which means that the number of students who took math is at least 28% of x.

We can simplify these two inequalities by multiplying both sides of each equation by 100:

20% of x ≥ 20 (physics students)
28% of x ≥ 28 (math students)

Now, we can solve for x by adding the two inequalities:

20% of x + 28% of x ≥ 48

Simplifying the equation, we get:

38% of x ≥ 48

Dividing both sides of the equation by 38%, we get:

x ≥ 48 / 38%

x ≥ 130

Therefore, the least possible number of students in the school is 130.
