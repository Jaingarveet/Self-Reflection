## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

## Assistant 2:
  Thought: 
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand the mistake. The problem is asking for the perimeter of a rectangular piece of land with a length that is 1m more than 4 times the breadth. To find the perimeter, I need to use the formula P = 2(l + 2b), where l is the length and b is the breadth.

Action: Answer("B")

Self-reflection:
I made a mistake in my previous answer by not properly understanding the equation. I misunderstood the problem and used the wrong formula. I also made a calculation mistake by not properly distributing the 1m increase in length. Thankfully, I was able to identify the error and correct it this time around.
