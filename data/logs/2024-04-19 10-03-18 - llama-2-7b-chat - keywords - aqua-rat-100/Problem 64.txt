## Assistant 2:
  Thought: 
When I was 2 years old, my brother was half my age, which means he was 2 years old.
Now, I am 60 years old, and my brother is also 60 years old.
Action: Answer("C")

Self-reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I realized that I made a calculation error. I misunderstood the problem and thought that my brother's age was 59 years old, instead of 60 years old. I also realized that I didn't take into account the time passage error, which is the difference between my current age and my brother's current age. Thank you for providing me with the opportunity to reflect on my mistake and correct it.
