Question: An exam is given in a certain class. The average (arithmetic mean) of the highest score and the lowest score is equal to x. If the average score for the entire class is equal to y and there are z students in the class, where z > 5, then in terms of x, y, and z, what is the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers?
Choices:
  A: (zy – 2x)/z
  B: (zy – 2)/z
  C: (zx – y)/(z – 2)
  D: (zy – 2x)/(z -2)
  E: (zy – x)/(z + 2)

## Assistant 2:
  Thought: I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I am now reflecting on my mistake. I see that I misapplied the formula and made a calculation error.

Action: I will re-evaluate the problem using the correct formula and calculation.

Answer: The correct answer is (zy – 2)/z.

Explanation: The problem states that the average score for the entire class is equal to y, and there are z students in the class. The highest score is x, and the lowest score is also x. We are asked to find the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers.

To do this, we can use the formula (zy – 2)/z, where z is the number of students in the class, y is the average score for the entire class, and x is the highest and lowest scores.

I hope this answer is correct, and I will make sure to double-check my calculations to avoid making the same mistake again.
