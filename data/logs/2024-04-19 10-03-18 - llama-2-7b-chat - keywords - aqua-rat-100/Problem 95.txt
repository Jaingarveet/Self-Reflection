## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

## Assistant 2:
  Thought: 
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand the mistake. To solve this problem, I need to use the concept of proportion.

Step 1: Replace 15% of the original 50% milk tea with milk, resulting in a solution of 45% milk tea and 55% tea.
Action: Replace 15% of the resultant solution with more milk, which is 7% of the original 50% milk tea.

Step 2: Calculate the final concentration of tea by dividing the volume of tea by the total volume of the solution.

Action: Calculate the final concentration of tea by dividing the volume of tea (55% of the original 50% milk tea) by the total volume of the solution (45% milk tea and 55% tea).

Final concentration of tea = 55/95 = 0.58 or 58%

Answer: The final concentration of tea John drinks is 58%.

Reflection: I reflected on my previous mistake and the correct solution. I realized that I misunderstood the problem and calculated the replacement incorrectly. I also learned that using the concept of proportion is essential to solve this type of problem.
