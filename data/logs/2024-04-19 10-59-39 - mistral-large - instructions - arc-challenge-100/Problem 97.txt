# Model: mistral-large | Agent: instructions | Exam: arc-challenge-100 | Problem 97 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Science.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:
Topic: Geography
Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Science
Question: What is the first step of the process in the formation of sedimentary rocks?
Choices:
  A: erosion
  B: deposition
  C: compaction
  D: cementation
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and understand what is being asked.
2. Identify the topic of the question (in this case, sedimentary rock formation).
3. Recall the steps involved in the formation of sedimentary rocks.
4. Identify the first step in the process.
5. Choose the answer that matches the first step in the process.
6. State your answer in the correct format: 'Action: Answer("[ANSWER_CHOICE]")'.
## Assistant 2:
Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly by selecting "B: deposition" as the first step in the formation of sedimentary rocks. However, upon further reflection, I realized that the first step in the process is actually "A: erosion."

Thought:
The formation of sedimentary rocks begins with the weathering and erosion of existing rocks, which breaks them down into smaller particles called sediment. This sediment is then transported by wind, water, or ice to a new location where it is deposited. Over time, the sediment becomes compacted and cemented together to form sedimentary rock.

Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
