# Model: mistral-large | Agent: instructions | Exam: arc-challenge-100 | Problem 79 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Science.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:
Topic: Geography
Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Science
Question: Which of these indicates a physical change that occurs during the process of digestion?
Choices:
  A: the addition of acids to create a ball of food
  B: the secretion of pepsin to change proteins to peptides
  C: the breakdown of food substances by digestive juices
  D: the squeezing of food through the intestines
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and understand what it is asking.
2. Identify the physical and chemical changes that occur during the process of digestion.
3. Determine which of the choices represents a physical change.
4. Eliminate the choices that represent chemical changes.
5. Choose the answer that represents a physical change.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Physical changes involve a change in physical properties, such as shape, size, or state of matter, without changing the chemical composition of the substance.
Chemical changes involve a change in chemical composition, resulting in the formation of new substances.

Choice A: The addition of acids to create a ball of food is a physical change because it changes the physical properties of the food without changing its chemical composition.
Choice B: The secretion of pepsin to change proteins to peptides is a chemical change because it involves breaking down proteins into smaller peptides, resulting in a change in chemical composition.
Choice C: The breakdown of food substances by digestive juices is a chemical change because it involves breaking down complex molecules into simpler ones, resulting in a change in chemical composition.
Choice D: The squeezing of food through the intestines is a physical change because it changes the physical properties of the food without changing its chemical composition.

Action: Answer("D")

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly by choosing choice B, which is a chemical change. I realized that I needed to identify the physical and chemical changes that occur during digestion and eliminate the choices that represent chemical changes. I then chose the answer that represents a physical change, which is choice D.
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
