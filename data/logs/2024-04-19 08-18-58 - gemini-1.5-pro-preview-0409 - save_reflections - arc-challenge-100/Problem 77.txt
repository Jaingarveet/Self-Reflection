## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:** My reasoning was flawed because I focused on the existing trend of increasing light-wool sheep without considering the impact of the new predator. I assumed the existing trend would continue without considering the change in the environment.
**Error Keywords:**
*   Incorrect extrapolation
*   Ignoring environmental change
*   Misinterpretation of trend
**Solution:**
1.  **Analyze the situation:** The introduction of a predator changes the selection pressure on the sheep population.
2.  **Consider the predator's impact:** Predators are more likely to catch and kill weaker, slower prey.
3.  **Apply this to the sheep:** Dark wool sheep are larger and stronger, making them better equipped to escape or defend against predators.
4.  **Predict the outcome:** The population of light wool sheep, being weaker and more vulnerable, will likely decrease first.
**Instructions for Future Similar Problems:**
1.  **Identify the initial conditions and any changes to the environment.**
2.  **Analyze how the environmental change affects the selection pressures on the population.**
3.  **Consider the traits of different individuals and how they relate to the new selection pressures.**
4.  **Predict the population changes based on which traits provide an advantage in the new environment.**
**General Advice:**
*   **Always consider the full context of the situation, including any changes to the environment.**
*   **Avoid assuming that existing trends will continue without considering external factors.**
*   **Focus on the specific selection pressures introduced by the change and how they affect different individuals.**
*   **Think critically about the advantages and disadvantages of different traits in the new context.**
