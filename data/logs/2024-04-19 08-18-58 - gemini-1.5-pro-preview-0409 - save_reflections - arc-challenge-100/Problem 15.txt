## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:**  I focused on the definition of a mixture as containing multiple substances but neglected the key aspect of retaining individual properties. While option A is true, it doesn't fully explain why the snack is a mixture. 
**Error Keywords:**
*   Misinterpretation 
*   Incomplete understanding
*   Focus on definition over application
**Step-by-Step Solution:**
1.  **Analyze the components:** The snack contains peanuts, sunflower seeds, raisins, almonds, and chocolate pieces â€“ all distinct substances.
2.  **Consider their properties:** Each component retains its original properties like taste, texture, and appearance even when mixed.
3.  **Compare to the definition of a mixture:** A mixture is a combination of substances where each retains its own properties and can be separated by physical means.
4.  **Evaluate options:**
    *   Option A is true but incomplete.
    *   Option B is incorrect as components can be separated.
    *   **Option C accurately describes the key characteristic of a mixture.**
    *   Option D describes a compound, not a mixture.
**Instructions for Future:**
1.  **Read the question and all options carefully.**
2.  **Recall the definition of the relevant scientific concept (e.g., mixture).**
3.  **Analyze the specific scenario in the question.**
4.  **Focus on the key characteristics of the concept and how they apply to the scenario.**
5.  **Evaluate each option based on the analysis and choose the most accurate one.**
**General Advice:**
*   **Develop a deeper understanding of scientific concepts beyond just definitions.**
*   **Practice applying concepts to various scenarios and examples.**
*   **Pay attention to keywords and subtle differences in answer choices.**
*   **Don't rush; take time to think through each question thoroughly.**
