You are an expert in Logic.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Topic: Logic
Context: When a team travels to Tibet, in addition to Lhasa, there are 6 cities or scenic spots to choose from? City E, City F, Lake G, Mountain H, Mountain I, Lake J Taking into account factors such as time, funding, plateau environment, and physical condition of the personnel, (1) at least one of Lake G and Lake J should be visited.(2) If you don't go to E city or F city, you can't go to G lake.(3) If you don't go to E city, you can't go to H mountain.(4) Only when I cross the I peak can I reach Lake J.
Question: If this team does not go to I Peak due to climate reasons, which of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: The group went to E city and J lake
  B: The group went to city E instead of city F
  C: The group went to visit G Lake and H Mountain
  D: The group went to F city and G lake tour
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I made a mistake in my reasoning, which led to an incorrect answer.
I misunderstood the information and made incorrect deductions.
Error Keywords:
- Misunderstanding
- Incorrect deduction
- Logical fallacy

Solution:
Let's analyze the given information and constraints:

1. At least one of Lake G and Lake J should be visited.
2. If you don't go to E city or F city, you can't go to G lake.
3. If you don't go to E city, you can't go to H mountain.
4. Only when I cross the I peak can I reach Lake J.

From constraint 1, we know that Lake G or Lake J must be visited.
From constraint 2, we know that if the team doesn't visit E city or F city, they cannot visit Lake G.
From constraint 3, we know that if the team doesn't visit E city, they cannot visit H mountain.
From constraint 4, we know that the team must cross I peak to reach Lake J.

Now, let's consider the given options:

[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]
This option is not possible, as the team cannot visit Lake J if they don't cross I peak.

[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]
This option is possible, as the team can visit City E instead of City F, and still visit Lake G.

[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]
This option is not possible, as the team cannot visit Lake G if they don't visit E city or F city.

[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]
This option is possible, as the team can visit City F and Lake G, and still have the opportunity to visit H mountain.

Therefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED].

Instructions:
1. Read the given information and constraints carefully.
2. Identify the possible options based on the constraints.
3. Evaluate each option and eliminate the impossible ones.
4. Choose the remaining option as the answer.

Advice:
- Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
- Identify the key information and constraints in the problem.
- Use a systematic approach to eliminate impossible options.
- Double-check your answer to ensure it satisfies all the constraints.
- Practice logical reasoning and critical thinking to improve your skills.
