* Double-check your answer by reviewing the information you have.
* Keep up-to-date with the latest medical research and treatments.
## Assistant 2:
  I apologize for my previous mistake. Let's evaluate the options:

A: Topical antibiotic - This would treat bacterial infections, not comedonal acne.
B: Benzoyl peroxide - This is effective in treating comedonal acne by reducing P. acnes bacteria and inflammation.
C: Retinoids - Derivatives of vitamin A, they prevent comedone formation by promoting cell turnover and unclogging pores.
D: Estrogen - Hormonal imbalances can cause acne, but estrogen won't treat comedonal acne directly.

Reflecting on my previous mistake, I realize that I should have considered the root cause of comedonal acne and matched it with the appropriate treatment. Benzoyl peroxide and retinoids are both effective treatments for this type of acne.

Action: Answer("B") - Benzoyl peroxide.
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
