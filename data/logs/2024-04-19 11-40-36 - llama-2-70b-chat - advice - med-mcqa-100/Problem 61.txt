## Assistant 2:
  I apologize for my mistake in the previous answer.
After reflecting on the question, I realized that I misunderstood the type of seizure.
The COMMONEST type of seizure in newborns is actually Tonic seizures.
They are also known as "baby shakes" and are caused by abnormal electrical activity in the brain.
Tonic seizures typically occur in infants under the age of six months and are more common in premature babies.
They usually last for a few seconds to minutes and may occur in clusters.
It's important to note that tonic seizures can be a sign of an underlying medical condition, such as hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, infection, or genetic disorders.
Therefore, it's crucial to evaluate the newborn thoroughly and rule out any underlying conditions.
