## Assistant 2:
  I apologize for my previous mistake. After reflecting on the problem, I realized that I should have researched the safety profile of the medications during pregnancy before answering the question.

The correct answer is C: Methimazole. It is the only antithyroid drug that is safe to use during pregnancy. Propylthiouracil (A) is associated with congenital anomalies and is not recommended for use during pregnancy. I121 (B) is a radioactive isotope and is not used as an antithyroid drug. Carbimazole (D) is the active metabolite of Methimazole and is also safe for use during pregnancy, but Methimazole is the preferred choice because it has a more established safety profile.

Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
