## Assistant 2:
  I apologize for my mistake in the previous answer. I misunderstood the question and answered incorrectly.
In the case of postpartum hemorrhage (PPH), the drug that is not commonly used is Ergotamine (D).
Ergotamine is a medication used to treat migraines and other vascular headaches. It is not typically used to treat PPH.
The three other options - Mifepristone (A), Misoprostol (B), and Oxytocin (C) - are commonly used to treat PPH.
Mifepristone is a medication that blocks the action of progesterone and can help to reduce the amount of bleeding in PPH.
Misoprostol is a medication that helps the uterus contract and can help to reduce bleeding in PPH.
Oxytocin is a hormone that helps the uterus contract and is commonly used to help control bleeding in PPH.
Therefore, the correct answer is (D) Ergotamine.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: A
