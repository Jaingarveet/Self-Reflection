# Model: llama-2-70b-chat | Agent: advice | Exam: med-mcqa-100 | Problem 84 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Medicine.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:

## User 2:
Topic: Medicine
Subtopic: Pharmacology
Question: Which of the trabecular meshwork and effect the aqueous outflow
Choices:
  A: Timolol
  B: Pilocarpine
  C: Brimonidine
  D: Brinzolamide
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Advice:
- Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
- Pay attention to the specific mechanism of action of each medication.
- Consider the specific action of each medication on the aqueous outflow.
- Double-check your answer to ensure it matches the correct mechanism of action.
## Assistant 2:
  I apologize for my previous mistake. Let's evaluate the options carefully:

A: Timolol is a beta-blocker that reduces aqueous humor production. It does not affect the trabecular meshwork or aqueous outflow.

B: Pilocarpine is a cholinergic agent that increases aqueous outflow through the trabecular meshwork. It works by increasing the activity of the ciliary muscles, which helps to open the trabecular meshwork and improve aqueous outflow.

C: Brimonidine is an alpha-agonist that reduces aqueous humor production and increases aqueous outflow through the trabecular meshwork. It works by decreasing the production of aqueous humor and increasing the activity of the ciliary muscles, which helps to open the trabecular meshwork and improve aqueous outflow.

D: Brinzolamide is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor that reduces aqueous humor production. It does not affect the trabecular meshwork or aqueous outflow directly.

Based on the specific mechanism of action of each medication and its effect on the aqueous outflow, the correct answer is (B) Pilocarpine. Pilocarpine increases aqueous outflow through the trabecular meshwork by increasing the activity of the ciliary muscles, which helps to open the trabecular meshwork.

Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
