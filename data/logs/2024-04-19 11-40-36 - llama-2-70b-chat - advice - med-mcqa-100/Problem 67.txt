Question: Major complication of cyst-gastrostomy for pseudo pancreatic cyst is?
Choices:
  A: Infection
  B: Obstruction
  C: Fistula
  D: Hemorrhage

Reflection:
Last time, I mistakenly chose option A: Infection. However, upon further review, I realized that the correct answer is option C: Fistula. A fistula is an abnormal connection between two organs or between an organ and the skin, and it can occur as a complication of cyst-gastrostomy, which is a surgical procedure that creates a connection between a pancreatic cyst and the stomach.

Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
