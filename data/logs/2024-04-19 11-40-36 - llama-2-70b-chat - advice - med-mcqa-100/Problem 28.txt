## Assistant 2:
  I apologize for my mistake in the previous response. I misunderstood the question and answered it incorrectly.
Here's my reflection on the question:
The site of transplantation in Islet cell transplant for Diabetes mellitus is not Skin, injected into the portal vein, or Pelvis.
Islet cell transplantation involves transplanting healthy islet cells from a donor pancreas into a person with type 1 diabetes.
The transplantation site should be able to support the survival and function of the islet cells and allow for efficient glucose sensing and insulin secretion.
The liver is a suitable site for islet cell transplantation because it is a vascular organ with a large blood supply, which provides the necessary oxygen and nutrients for the islet cells to function properly.
Therefore, the correct answer is C: Liver.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
