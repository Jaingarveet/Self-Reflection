## Assistant 2:
  I apologize for my previous mistake. Let's reevaluate the question:
A 34-week multigravida with a history of two normal deliveries has an unstable lie with the current pregnancy.

Option A, oligohydramnios, is a possibility, but it's unlikely given the patient's history of two normal deliveries and the advanced gestational age. Oligohydramnios is typically associated with preterm pregnancies.

Option B, placenta previa, is a possible cause of an unstable lie. The patient's history of two normal deliveries increases the likelihood of placenta previa in the current pregnancy. However, we need to consider other options as well.

Option C, pelvic tumor, is an unlikely cause of an unstable lie in a patient with a history of two normal deliveries. Pelvic tumors are rare, and the patient's history suggests a more common cause.

Option D, uterine anomalies, is a possible cause of an unstable lie. Uterine anomalies, such as a unicornuate uterus or a bicornuate uterus, can cause an unstable lie. The patient's history of two normal deliveries suggests that the anomaly may not have caused issues in previous pregnancies, but it's still a possible cause.

After reevaluating the options, I believe the most likely cause of an unstable lie in this patient is placenta previa (Option B). However, uterine anomalies (Option D) are also a possible cause, and the patient should be evaluated further to determine the underlying reason for the unstable lie.

Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
