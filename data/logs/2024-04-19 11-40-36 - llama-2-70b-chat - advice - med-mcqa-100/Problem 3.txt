* Condensation silicone: It is a type of impression material that sets by a chemical reaction, but it is not elastic.
* Polyether: It is an elastic impression material, but it does not set by a chemical reaction. Instead, it sets by evaporation.
* Polysulfide: It is an elastic impression material that sets by a chemical reaction, but it is not catalyzed by chloroplatinic acid.
* Polyvinyl siloxane (PVS): It is an elastic impression material that sets by a chemical reaction, and it is catalyzed by chloroplatinic acid.

Based on the properties mentioned in the question, the correct answer is (D) Polyvinyl siloxane (PVS).
