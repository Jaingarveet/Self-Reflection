  I apologize for my previous mistake. Let's analyze the question again.
Expanisle type osseous metastases are characteristic of primary malignancy of:
The term "expansile" refers to the way the metastasis expands the bone, which is a characteristic feature of certain primary malignancies.

A: Kidney
Kidney cancer rarely metastasizes to bone, and when it does, it typically does not have an expansile pattern.

B: Bronchus
Lung cancer (bronchus) can metastasize to bone, but expansile type osseous metastases are not typical for lung cancer.

C: Breast
Breast cancer frequently metastasizes to bone, and expansile type osseous metastases are a common feature.

D: Prostate
Prostate cancer often metastasizes to bone, but expansile type osseous metastases are not typical for prostate cancer.

Based on the clinical presentation and characteristics of expansile type osseous metastases, the best answer is:
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
