## System:
You are an expert in Medicine.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Advice:
- Always review the key features of each disease before answering a question.
- Pay close attention to the specific characteristics of each disease, such as the presence of crescent-shaped deposits or the thickening of the glomerular basement membrane.
- Associate the correct pathological features with each disease.
- Double-check your answer by reviewing the question and the available choices.
- Practice, practice, practice! The more you practice, the more familiar you will become with the key features of each disease, and the less likely you are to make mistakes.
## Assistant 2:
  I apologize for my previous mistake. Let's review the key features of each disease:

A. RPGN (Rapidly Progressive Glomerulonephritis): RPGN is a type of glomerulonephritis that progresses rapidly, usually over weeks to months. It is characterized by the presence of crescent-shaped deposits in the glomeruli, which are formed by the accumulation of immune complexes or antibodies. The glomeruli are also enlarged and have an irregular shape.

B. Acute GN (Acute Glomerulonephritis): Acute GN is a type of glomerulonephritis that develops suddenly, usually in response to an infection or injury. It is characterized by the presence of inflammatory cells in the glomeruli, which cause swelling and bleeding. The glomeruli may also have a "coffin lid" shape.

C. Membranous GN (Membranous Glomerulonephritis): Membranous GN is a type of glomerulonephritis that is characterized by the thickening of the glomerular basement membrane and the presence of immune complexes or lipid deposits in the glomeruli. The glomeruli are also enlarged and have a "spiky" appearance.

D. Membranoproliferative GN (Membranoproliferative Glomerulonephritis): Membranoproliferative GN is a type of glomerulonephritis that is characterized by the proliferation of the glomerular epithelial cells, leading to the formation of new membranes and the thickening of the glomerular basement membrane. The glomeruli may also have a "lobulated" appearance.

Based on the information provided, the correct answer is A. RPGN. RPGN is the only disease that shows crescent-shaped deposits under a light microscope.

Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
