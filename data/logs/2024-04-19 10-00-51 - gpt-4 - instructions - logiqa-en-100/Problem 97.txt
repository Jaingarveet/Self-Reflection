## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The argument is that the increase in negative posts indicates a rapidly deteriorating social atmosphere. To weaken this argument, we need to find an alternative explanation for the increase in negative posts. 
A: This is a proverb that suggests bad news spreads faster than good news. It doesn't provide an alternative explanation for the increase in negative posts.
B: If the number of Internet users has quadrupled in the past 5 years, it could explain the increase in negative posts without necessarily indicating a deteriorating social atmosphere. More users could simply mean more posts overall, both positive and negative.
C: This suggests that some people are spreading rumors for profit, but it doesn't explain the overall increase in negative posts.
D: The legality of the forum is irrelevant to the argument.
Action: Answer("B")
