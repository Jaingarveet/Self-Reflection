## System:
You are an expert in Logic.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Logic
Context: There are five volcanic islands E, F, G, H, and I in the east coast of a country.They are arranged in a straight line from north to south, and they are found? (1) F is adjacent to H and is on the north side of H.(2) I and E are adjacent.(3) G is somewhere in the north of F.
Question: If it is found that G is the northernmost island, how many possible arrangements are there for this group of islands?
Choices:
  A: 2
  B: 3
  C: 4
  D: 5
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Understand the given conditions and constraints.
[REDACTED]. Identify the fixed positions based on the conditions.
[REDACTED]. Identify the variables that can change positions.
[REDACTED]. List all possible arrangements considering the conditions and constraints.
[REDACTED]. Count the total number of possible arrangements.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Given that G is the northernmost island, F must be to the south of G, and H must be to the south of F. This gives us GFH as a fixed sequence. I and E are adjacent, but can be in either order, giving us two possibilities: IE or EI. These two can be placed in two positions: either between G and F or at the southernmost end. This gives us a total of 2 (IE or EI) * 2 (positions) = 4 possible arrangements.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
