## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Let's go through each choice and check if it meets all conditions.
A: H and Y are in the same department, F and G are not in the same department, X is not in the sales department so W doesn't have to be in the production department, and F is in the production department. So, choice A meets all conditions.
B: F and G are not in the same department, but H and Y are not in the same department. So, choice B does not meet all conditions.
C: F and G are not in the same department, but H and Y are not in the same department. So, choice C does not meet all conditions.
D: F and G are not in the same department, but H and Y are not in the same department. So, choice D does not meet all conditions.
Action: Answer("A")
