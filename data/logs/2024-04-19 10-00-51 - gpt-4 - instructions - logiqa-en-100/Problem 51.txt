Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Understand the conditions given in the problem.
2. Identify the department where X and F are assigned.
3. Apply the conditions to the given scenario.
4. Determine the possible assignments for each candidate.
5. Identify the statement that contradicts the possible assignments.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Given that X and F are assigned to the same department, and F must be allocated in the production department, it means X is also in the production department. According to condition (3), if X is in the production department, W cannot be in the production department. But there is no restriction on W being in the public relations department. Therefore, the statement that cannot be true is "G is assigned to the sales department" because F and G cannot be in the same department and since F is in the production department, the only other departments for G are sales and public relations. But since we need to assign three people to the sales department and three to the production department, if G is in sales, we would have four people in sales (G, H, Y, and another person because H and Y must be together), which is not allowed.
Action: Answer("A")
