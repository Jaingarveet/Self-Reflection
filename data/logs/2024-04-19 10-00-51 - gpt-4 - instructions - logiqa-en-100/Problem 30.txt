Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and understand what it is asking.
2. Identify the conditions given in the question.
3. Analyze each condition and understand its implications.
4. Apply the conditions to the choices given.
5. Eliminate choices that do not meet the conditions.
6. Choose the answer that best fits the question and the conditions.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The conditions are:
1) At least one person of Bingding is selected.
2) If E is selected, then A and B are also selected.
3) A maximum of 2 people are selected.
The question asks who is not in the fourth. Since a maximum of 2 people are selected, and if E is selected then A and B are also selected, it means E cannot be selected because that would mean 3 people (E, A, and B) are selected which violates condition 3. Therefore, A and B also cannot be selected because they are only selected if E is selected. 
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
