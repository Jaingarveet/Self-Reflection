Subtopic: Playing drums
Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
A guy is sitting with sticks in his hands. A guy is playing the drums. The guy stops and opens his mouth. the guy
Choices:
  A: places the sticks on the drum.
  B: stops drumming and shakes his head and smiles.
  C: writes on a napkin for two minutes.
  D: starts playing so hard his fingers are starting to bleed.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The most likely scenario after a drummer stops playing and opens his mouth is that he is going to say something or express some emotion. The options that involve him continuing to play the drums or writing on a napkin don't make as much sense in this context. The option of him playing so hard his fingers bleed is unlikely and extreme. The most reasonable option is that he stops drumming, shakes his head, and smiles, perhaps in satisfaction or in response to something that happened or was said.
Action: Answer("B")
