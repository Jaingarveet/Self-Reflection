[header] How to make a paper dreidel garland [title] Get six to eight sheets of craft paper. [step] You will need six to eight sheets of craft paper to make the dreidels. Pick craft paper that has an interesting design, such as hebrew letters, or a plain design if you are planning on decorating the dreidels later.

  A: Go for paper that is thick and durable as you will be gluing them together. [substeps] You can also use colored craft paper in a certain color scheme, such as blue and yellow, if you do not plan on decorating them later.
