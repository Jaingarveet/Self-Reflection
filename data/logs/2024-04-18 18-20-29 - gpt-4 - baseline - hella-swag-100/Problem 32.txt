Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to date a short guy as a tall girl [title] Skip the filter. [step] When trying to date online, don't filter out guys based on height. You might be filtering out someone who's actually perfect for you just because he's a few inches shorter than you'd like.
Choices:
  A: However, if you're drawn to the very outer, slightly more than a tall guy, you might want to focus on how his body responds to you. [substeps] Some people find the sensation of others standing in their space bittersweet.
  B: Instead, focus on what's already the picture. You might not want someone half your height who just can't fit in with your skinny friends.
  C: In fact, try not to specifically mention a height you want in your profile, as it can turn some people off. [substeps] For instance, if you mention your height or you say, " only tall guys! " many guys may figure you don't want to date them and move on, even great guys.
  D: If this guy is very tall, you might run into him one of two ways. The first is by not focusing on an anatomical feature: is the head taller than you? The second is by focusing more on the body of this person.
