[header] How to swirl multiple frostings for cupcakes [title] Push your frosting tip into your piping bag. [step] The type of tip you choose will change the style of the frosting. For example, a wilton 2d closed star tip creates a ruffled appearance in the frosting.

  A: A trough tip is best for decorating tall pipe cupcakes. [substeps] The tip, although relatively chewy, may be more stiff.
  B: If you prefer a slightly more conspicuous overall appearance, you can have multiple different cupcake designs in one shot before using one cupcake. [substeps] The width of the top of one cupcake corresponds to the width of the other cupcake base.
  C: Whereas a wilton 1 m open star tip will give you a smoother look. However, the choice is up to you! [substeps] You can also use a coupler, which allows you to change out the frosting tip without having to use a new piping bag.
