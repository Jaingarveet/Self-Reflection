You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Explanation:
I made an error in my calculation of the ratio of W2 to W1.
The gap in my knowledge was not in understanding the concept of work but in basic algebra.
I knew the correct equation for work but made a calculation error.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Algebra error
 - Ratio error
Solution:
The amount of work done is proportional to the number of workers and the number of hours worked per day, and inversely proportional to the number of days taken to complete the work.
Let's denote the amount of work done by W.
Then, we have the equation:
W = (number of workers) x (hours worked per day) x (number of days)
Using this equation, we can find the amount of work done by x men working x hours per day in x days:
W1 = x x x x x = x^3
Similarly, we can find the amount of work done by y men working y hours per day in y days:
W2 = y x y x y = y^3
The question asks for the ratio of W2 to W1, which is:
W2/W1 = y^3 / x^3
The correct answer is [REDACTED]: y^3 / x^2
Instructions:
1. Identify the variables in the problem: number of workers, hours worked per day, and number of days.
2. Write down the equation for work: W = (number of workers) x (hours worked per day) x (number of days)
3. Use the equation to find the amount of work done by x men working x hours per day in x days: W1 = x^3
4. Use the equation to find the amount of work done by y men working y hours per day in y days: W2 = y^3
5. Calculate the ratio of W2 to W1: W2/W1 = y^3 / x^3
6. Simplify the ratio by canceling out common factors: y^3 / x^3 = y^3 / x^2
7. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that the ratio of two quantities is the result of dividing them, not multiplying or adding them.
 - Simplify algebraic expressions by canceling out common factors.
