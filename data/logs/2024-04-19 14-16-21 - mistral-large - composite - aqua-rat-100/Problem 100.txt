## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let's denote the breadth of the rectangle as b. According to the problem, the length of the rectangle is 4b + 1.
The area of the rectangle is given as 150 sq m. Therefore, we have the equation:
b \* (4b + 1) = 150
Expanding the equation, we get:
4b^2 + b - 150 = 0
Solving this quadratic equation, we find that b = 5.
Therefore, the length of the rectangle is 4 \* 5 + 1 = 21.
The perimeter of the rectangle is 2 \* (length + breadth) = 2 \* (21 + 5) = 62.
Action: Answer("C")
