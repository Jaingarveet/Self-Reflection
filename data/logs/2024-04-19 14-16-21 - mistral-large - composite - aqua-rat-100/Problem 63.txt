Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I made a calculation error. I knew the correct city and state but multiplied the number of letters incorrectly.

Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Arithmetic error
 - Multiplication error

Solution:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames.
The city name "Ames" contains 4 letters.
Iowa State University is located in the state of Iowa.
The state name "Iowa" contains 4 letters.
The product of 4*4 is 16.

Instructions:
1. Identify the city where the university is located.
2. Identify the state where the university is located.
[REDACTED]. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.
4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.
[REDACTED]. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.
6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.
[REDACTED]. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.

Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The tennis team won 20 matches, which represents 70% of their total matches.
To find the total number of matches played, we can set up a proportion: 20/x = 70/100
Solving for x, we get x = 20 \* 100 / 70 = 28.57, which we round up to 29 since the number of matches must be a whole number.
The team lost 30% of their matches, so we can calculate the number of matches lost as 30/100 \* 29 = 8.7, which we round up to 9 since the number of matches lost must be a whole number.
Action: Answer("E")

Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly before because I made a calculation error. I knew the correct proportion but calculated the number of matches lost incorrectly.

Error Keywords:

* Calculation error
* Arithmetic error
* Proportion error

Solution:
The tennis team won 20 matches, which represents 70% of their total matches.
To find the total number of matches played, we can set up a proportion: 20/x = 70/100
Solving for x, we get x = 20 \* 100 / 70 = 28.57, which we round up to 29 since the number of matches must be a whole number.
The team lost 30% of their matches, so we can calculate the number of matches lost as 30/100 \* 29 = 8.7, which we round up to 9 since the number of matches lost must be a whole number.

Instructions:

1. Identify the number of matches won and the percentage of matches won.
2. Set up a proportion to find the total number of matches played.
3. Solve for the total number of matches played.
4. Calculate the percentage of matches lost.
5. Calculate the number of matches lost using the percentage and the total number of matches played.
6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.
7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.

Advice:

* Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
* Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
* Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
* Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
* Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
* Remember that the percentage of matches won and lost must add up to 100%.
* Remember that the number of matches won and lost must add up to the total number of matches played.
