## Assistant 2:
Reflection:
I previously made an error in calculating the amount of work done by Mr. Brown and Mr. Black before Mr. Blue started working.

Explanation:
To solve this problem, we need to determine how much work is done by each person and how much work is left for Mr. Blue to complete.

1. Mr. Brown can paint a house in 6 days, so in 8 days, he can paint 8/6 = 1.33 houses (rounded to two decimal places).
2. Mr. Black can paint a house in 8 days, so in 6 days, he can paint 6/8 = 0.75 houses.
3. Together, Mr. Brown and Mr. Black have painted 1.33 + 0.75 = 2.08 houses (rounded to two decimal places).
4. Since there are 3 houses to paint, there is still 3 - 2.08 = 0.92 houses left to paint.
5. Mr. Blue can paint a house in 12 days, so it will take him 0.92 \* 12 = 11.04 days to paint the remaining portion of the house.

Solution:
The correct answer is D: 11 days.

Instructions:
To avoid making the same mistake again, I need to carefully calculate the amount of work done by each person before determining how much work is left for the last person to complete.

Advice:
When solving problems involving work and time, it's important to carefully calculate the amount of work done by each person and to keep track of how much work is left to be done. Double-checking calculations can also help prevent errors.
