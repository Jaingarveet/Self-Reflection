Question: What is the first step of the process in the formation of sedimentary rocks?
Choices:
  A: erosion
  B: deposition
  C: compaction
  D: cementation
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I did not follow the correct format for providing my answer.

Error Keywords:
 - Incorrect format
 - Answer format error
 - Expecting value error

Solution:
The first step in the formation of sedimentary rocks is [REDACTED].
Erosion is the process by which rocks and soil are broken down and transported by natural agents such as wind, water, and ice.
The eroded material is then deposited in a new location, where it can be compacted and cemented together to form sedimentary rock.

Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and understand what is being asked.
2. Identify the topic of the question (in this case, sedimentary rock formation).
3. Recall the steps involved in the formation of sedimentary rocks.
4. Identify the first step in the process.
5. Choose the answer that matches the first step in the process.
6. State your answer in the correct format: 'Action: Answer("[ANSWER_CHOICE]")'.

Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand what is being asked.
 - Always follow the correct format for providing your answer.
 - Always double-check your answer before submitting it.
 - Always review the basic concepts and processes related to the topic of the question.
 - Always break down complex problems into smaller, more manageable steps.
 - Always think through each step of the problem-solving process before choosing an answer.
 - Always double-check your work to ensure accuracy.
