Question: A company produces 420 units of a particular computer component every month, at a production cost to the company of $110 per component, and sells all of the components by the end of each month. What is the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee that the yearly profit (revenue from sales minus production costs) will be at least $626,400 ?
Choices:
  A: 226
  B: 230
  C: 240
  D: 260

Explanation:
I made a rounding error when calculating the required profit per unit. I rounded $124.2857... down to $124.29, leading to an incorrect minimum selling price.
Error Keywords:
 - Rounding error
 - Decimal truncation error
 - Approximation error
Solution:
Annual profit needed: $626,400
Monthly profit needed: $626,400 / 12 = $52,200
Units produced per month: 420
Required profit per unit: $52,200 / 420 = $124.2857... (keep the full decimal for now)
Production cost per unit: $110
Minimum selling price: $110 + $124.2857... = $234.2857...
Since the selling price must be an integer, we round up to the nearest dollar to ensure the profit target is met: $235
Instructions:
1. Calculate the required monthly profit by dividing the annual profit target by 12.
2. Calculate the required profit per unit by dividing the monthly profit by the number of units produced per month.
3. Avoid rounding off the profit per unit prematurely; keep the full decimal value for accuracy.
4. Add the production cost per unit to the required profit per unit to find the minimum selling price.
5. If the minimum selling price is not an integer, round it UP to the nearest dollar to ensure the profit target is met. 
Advice:
 - Be cautious with rounding, especially when dealing with financial calculations.
 - When in doubt, round up to ensure you meet the minimum requirement.
 - Consider using a calculator or spreadsheet software to avoid manual calculation errors. 
 - Always review your calculations and ensure they align with the problem's context.

Thought:
Following the reflection, I will calculate the minimum selling price carefully, avoiding rounding errors.
Annual profit needed: $626,400
Monthly profit needed: $626,400 / 12 = $52,200
Units produced per month: 420
Required profit per unit: $52,200 / 420 = $124.2857... (keeping full decimal)
Production cost per unit: $110
Minimum selling price: $110 + $124.2857... = $234.2857...
Rounding UP to nearest dollar: $235 
Action: Answer("A") 
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
