## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:** My error stemmed from a misinterpretation of the final ratio requirement. I focused on increasing the proportion of girls to match the boys' proportion, rather than adjusting both to reach the desired 4:3 ratio.
**Error Keywords:**
*   Ratio misinterpretation
*   Proportion misunderstanding
*   Goal misalignment 
## Step-by-Step Solution
1.  **Initial Ratio:** The initial ratio of boys to girls is 64/40, which simplifies to 8/5.
2.  **Target Ratio:** We want a final ratio of 4/3. 
3.  **Equivalent Ratios:** To compare, we need equivalent ratios with the same "parts". Multiplying both parts of the target ratio by 2, we get 8/6.
4.  **Difference in Parts:** The difference in "girl parts" between the initial ratio (5 parts) and the desired ratio (6 parts) is 1 part.
5.  **Value of One Part:** Initially, 5 parts correspond to 40 girls, so 1 part represents 40 girls / 5 parts = 8 girls.
6.  **Number to Add:** To achieve the 8/6 ratio, we need to add 1 part to both boys and girls, which means adding 8 boys and 8 girls.
7.  **Final Number of Members:** The group will have 64 (boys) + 8 (boys) + 40 (girls) + 8 (girls) = 120 members. 
**Instructions for Future:**
1.  Always simplify the initial and target ratios to their lowest terms.
2.  Find equivalent ratios with the same "parts" to enable direct comparison.
3.  Identify the difference in "parts" between the initial and target ratios for both boys and girls.
4.  Calculate the value of one "part" based on the initial number of boys or girls.
5.  Multiply the value of one "part" by the difference in "parts" to find the number of boys and girls to add.
6.  Add the calculated number of boys and girls to the initial number to find the final total.
7.  Double-check your calculations and ensure the final ratio matches the target ratio.
**General Advice:**
*   Pay close attention to the wording of the problem and the specific requirements of the target ratio.
*   Focus on adjusting both parts of the ratio proportionally to achieve the desired outcome.
*   Use equivalent ratios to facilitate comparison and avoid misinterpretations.
*   Break down the problem into smaller steps and work through them systematically.
*   Always verify your solution against the problem statement and the target ratio.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The initial ratio is 8:5 (64 boys and 40 girls). 
We want a final ratio of 4:3, which is equivalent to 8:6.
We need to add 1 "part" to the girls' side, which represents 8 girls (40 girls / 5 parts).
Adding 8 girls and 8 boys to maintain the ratio, we get 120 members.
Action: Answer("C")

Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: E
