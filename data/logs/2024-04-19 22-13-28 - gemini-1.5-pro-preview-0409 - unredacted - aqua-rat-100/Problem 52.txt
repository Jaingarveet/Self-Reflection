## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:** My error stemmed from a miscalculation in determining the amount of zinc in alloy Y. I incorrectly calculated it as 70/3 grams instead of the correct value.
**Error Keywords:**
*   Calculation error
*   Ratio misinterpretation
*   Proportionality error
**Step-by-Step Solution:**
1.  **Alloy X Composition:** In a 15g (6+9) sample of alloy X, there are 6g of zinc and 9g of copper. Therefore, in 40g of alloy X:
    *   Zinc: (6g/15g) * 40g = 16g
    *   Copper: (9g/15g) * 40g = 24g
2.  **Alloy Y Composition:** In an 18g (7+11) sample of alloy Y, there are 7g of zinc and 11g of copper. Therefore, in 60g of alloy Y:
    *   Zinc: (7g/18g) * 60g = 70/3 g ≈ 23.33g  **[This was the mistake]**
    *   Copper: (11g/18g) * 60g = 110/3 g ≈ 36.67g
3.  **Alloy Z Composition:** Combining the amounts in alloy X and Y:
    *   Zinc: 16g + 23.33g ≈ 39.33g
    *   Copper: 24g + 36.67g = 60.67g
4.  **Ratio in Alloy Z:** The ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z is approximately 39.33g : 60.67g, which simplifies to roughly 59:91.
**Instructions for Future Similar Problems:**
1.  **Carefully analyze the ratios:** Ensure you understand the proportion of each component within each alloy.
2.  **Calculate component amounts accurately:** Use correct proportions to determine the amount of each metal in the given alloy quantities.
3.  **Double-check calculations:** Verify your calculations to avoid errors in determining component amounts.
4.  **Simplify the final ratio:** Reduce the ratio to its simplest form for the final answer.
**General Advice for Similar Problems:**
*   **Practice ratio and proportion problems:** Strengthen your understanding of ratios and proportions through practice.
*   **Focus on accuracy:** Pay close attention to detail and avoid calculation errors.
*   **Break down complex problems:** Divide complex problems into smaller, manageable steps.
*   **Review your work:** Always take the time to review your calculations and ensure the logic is sound.

I will leverage the insights from my previous error to solve this problem accurately.
Step 1: Calculate the amount of zinc and copper in 40g of alloy X.
Zinc in X: (6/15) * 40g = 16g
Copper in X: (9/15) * 40g = 24g
Step 2: Calculate the amount of zinc and copper in 60g of alloy Y, being careful with the calculations.
Zinc in Y: (7/18) * 60g = 70/3 g ≈ 23.33g 
Copper in Y: (11/18) * 60g = 110/3 g ≈ 36.67g
Step 3: Determine the total amount of zinc and copper in alloy Z.
Total Zinc: 16g + 23.33g ≈ 39.33g
Total Copper: 24g + 36.67g ≈ 60.67g
Step 4: Express the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z and simplify.
Zinc to Copper ratio: 39.33g : 60.67g which simplifies to approximately 59:91
