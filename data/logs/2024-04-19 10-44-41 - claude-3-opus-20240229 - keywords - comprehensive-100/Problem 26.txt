Context: A shopping center has exactly seven spaces—space 1 through space 7—arranged in a straight row. Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
Question: If the shoe store is in space 2, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: The optometrist is in space 5.
  B: The pharmacy is in space 1.
  C: A restaurant is in space 3.

## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step, considering all the constraints and possibilities:
1. The shoe store is in space 2.
2. The pharmacy must be at one end (space 1 or 7) and a restaurant at the other end. 
3. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or veterinarian.
4. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two businesses. 
5. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
If the pharmacy is in space 1, then:
- The optometrist or veterinarian must be in space 2. But space 2 is the shoe store, so this is not possible.
Therefore, the pharmacy must be in space 7. A restaurant must then be in space 1.
With the shoe store in space 2, the optometrist, toy store, second restaurant, and veterinarian must occupy spaces 3-6 in some order, subject to the remaining constraints.
Looking at the answer choices:
A. The optometrist could be in space 5, with the veterinarian in space 6 (satisfying constraint 3), the second restaurant in space 3 or 4 (satisfying constraints 4 and 5), and the toy store in the remaining space (3 or 4). So this is possible.
B. As determined above, the pharmacy must be in space 7, not space 1. So this is not possible.
C. A restaurant cannot be in space 3, as that would violate the constraint that the two restaurants must be separated by at least two businesses. So this is not possible.
D. The toy store could be in space 6, with the veterinarian in space 5 (satisfying constraint 5), the optometrist in space 3 or 4 (satisfying constraint 3), and the second restaurant in the remaining space (3 or 4, satisfying constraint 4). So this is possible.
E. The veterinarian could be in space 4, with the optometrist in space 3 (satisfying constraint 3), the second restaurant in space 5 or 6 (satisfying constraints 4 and 5), and the toy store in the remaining space (5 or 6). So this is possible.
In summary, if the shoe store is in space 2, then A, D, and E could be true, but B and C cannot be true.
Action: Answer("C")
