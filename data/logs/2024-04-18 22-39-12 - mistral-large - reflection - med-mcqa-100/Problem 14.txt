## System:
You are an expert in Medicine.
You have incorrectly answered the following multiple-choice question.
Your task is to reflect on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
You will then use this information help you answer the same question in the future.
First, explain why you answered the question incorrectly.
Second, list the keywords that describe the type of your errors from most general to most specific. 
Third, solve the problem again, step-by-step, based on your knowledge of the correct answer.
Fourth, create a list of detailed instructions to help you correctly solve this problem in the future.
Finally, create a list of general advice to help you solve similar types of problems in the future.  
Be concise in your response; however, capture all of the essential information.  
For guidance, I will provide you with a single generic example problem and reflection (below).

Topic: Geography and Math
Question: What is the product of the number of letters contained in the name of the city where Iowa State University is located multiplied by the number of letters contained in the name of the state?
Choices:
    A: 16
    B: 20
    C: 24
    D: 32
Thought:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
ISU is located in the state of Iowa.
Action: Answer("D")
---
Correct Answer: A
## Assistant 1:
Explanation:
I miscalculated the product of the number of letters in the city and state names. 
The gap in my knowledge was not in geography but in basic arithmetic. 
I knew the correct city and state but made a calculation error.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Arithmetic error
 - Multiplication error
Solution:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
Iowa State University is located in the state of Iowa.
The city name "Ames" contains 4 letters.
The state name "Iowa" contains 4 letters.
The product of 4*4 is 16.
Instructions:
1. Identify the city where the university is located.
2. Identify the state where the university is located.
3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.
4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.
5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.
6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.
7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them.

Subtopic: Biochemistry
Question: In anaerobic glycolysis, end product is -
Choices:
  A: 2 ATP + 2 NAD
  B: 2 ATP
  C: 2 ATP + 2 NADH
  D: 4 ATP + 2 FADH2

Thought:
Anaerobic glycolysis, also known as fermentation, occurs in the absence of oxygen. The end product of anaerobic glycolysis is 2 ATP (adenosine triphosphate) and 2 NADH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, reduced form).
Action: Answer("C")

 --- 
Correct Answer: A
## Assistant 2:
Response:
Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I confused the end products of anaerobic glycolysis with those of aerobic glycolysis.
The gap in my knowledge was in biochemistry, specifically in the differences between anaerobic and aerobic glycolysis.
I knew the correct process but mixed up the end products.
Error Keywords:
 - Confusion error
 - Biochemistry error
 - Anaerobic vs aerobic glycolysis error
Solution:
Anaerobic glycolysis, also known as fermentation, occurs in the absence of oxygen.
The end product of anaerobic glycolysis is 2 ATP (adenosine triphosphate) and 2 NAD (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide).
Instructions:
1. Identify the type of glycolysis being asked about (anaerobic or aerobic).
2. Recall the end products of anaerobic glycolysis.
3. Double-check that the end products are specific to anaerobic glycolysis.
4. Choose the answer that matches the correct end products.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your answer against your knowledge of the topic.
 - Remember that anaerobic glycolysis and aerobic glycolysis have different end products.
