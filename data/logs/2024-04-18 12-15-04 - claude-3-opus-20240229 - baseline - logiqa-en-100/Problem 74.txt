Topic: Logic
Context: A certain class intends to select two of three girls from Fang Rufen, Guo Yanran, He Zhilian, and three from five boys, including Peng Youwen, Qiu Zhijie, Ren Xiangyang, Song Wenkai, and Tang Xiaohua, to form a five-person support group for university students to volunteer teaching in the mountains.Requirements? (1) Guo Yanran and Tang Xiaohua are not selected at the same time; (2) Peng Youwen and Song Kaiwen are not selected at the same time; (3) Qiu Zhijie and Tang Xiaohua are not selected at the same time.
Question: If He Zhilian is not selected, which of the following is not selected?
Choices:
  A: Tang Xiaohua
  B: Peng Youwen
  C: Qiu Zhijie
  D: Song Wenkai
## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. We need to select 2 girls out of 3, and 3 boys out of 5.
2. He Zhilian is not selected, so the 2 girls must be Fang Rufen and Guo Yanran.
3. Now for the boys, we have the following conditions:
   - Peng Youwen and Song Wenkai cannot be selected together
   - Qiu Zhijie and Tang Xiaohua cannot be selected together
4. Since Guo Yanran is selected, Tang Xiaohua can be selected (condition 1 allows this).
5. So we can select these 3 boys: Ren Xiangyang, Tang Xiaohua, and either Peng Youwen or Song Wenkai.
6. This means that Qiu Zhijie cannot be selected, because if he was, then Tang Xiaohua couldn't be (by condition 3), and we would only have 2 boys.
Therefore, if He Zhilian is not selected, Qiu Zhijie must also not be selected.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
