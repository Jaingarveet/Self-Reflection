Context: Due to recent market changes, Green Island must increase productivity by 10% over the next two years, otherwise it will go bankrupt.In fact, from the perspective of Green Island's production and management structure, if it can increase productivity by 10%, then it can achieve the goal of increasing productivity by 20%.
Question: If the above statement is true, which of the following statements must be true?
Choices:
  A: If Green Island cannot achieve its goal of increasing productivity by 20%, it will go bankrupt.
  B: In the next two years, if Green Island increases productivity by 20%, it will not go bankrupt.
  C: If the market does not change, Green Island does not need to increase productivity to prevent bankruptcy.
  D: In the next two years, Green Island may increase productivity by 10%, but it is impossible to achieve the goal of increasing by 20%.
## Assistant 2:
Thought process:
1. The context states that Green Island must increase productivity by 10% over the next two years to avoid bankruptcy.
2. It also states that if Green Island can increase productivity by 10%, it can achieve the goal of increasing productivity by 20%.
3. Choice A: If Green Island cannot achieve a 20% increase, it doesn't necessarily mean it will go bankrupt, as a 10% increase is sufficient to avoid bankruptcy.
4. Choice B: This statement is true. If Green Island increases productivity by 20%, it will have exceeded the 10% requirement to avoid bankruptcy.
5. Choice C: This statement is true. The context implies that the need to increase productivity is due to recent market changes. If the market does not change, Green Island may not need to increase productivity to prevent bankruptcy.
6. Choice D: This statement contradicts the context, which states that if Green Island can increase productivity by 10%, it can achieve a 20% increase.
Action: Answer("C")
