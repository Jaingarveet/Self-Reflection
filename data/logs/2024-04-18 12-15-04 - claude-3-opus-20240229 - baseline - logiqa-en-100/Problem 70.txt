Topic: Logic
Context: All of Zhang Wei â€™s extracurricular assignments are excellent.If her semester papers are also excellent, she can pass the exam even if she does not make a class report.Unfortunately, her semester dissertation did not get an excellent grade, so she had to give a lecture in order to pass the exam.
Question: The reasoning in the above argument is flawed because the argument
Choices:
  A: Ignore this possibility? if Zhang Wei had to give a class report, then her semester papers would not get an excellent result.
  B: This possibility was not taken into account? some students had excellent semester thesis but failed the exam.
  C: Ignore this possibility? Zhang Wei's semester papers must be excellent, otherwise a class report will be required.
  D: Relying on unconfirmed assumptions? If Zhang Wei's semester papers are not excellent, she will fail the exam without giving a lecture.
## Assistant 2:
To determine the flaw in the argument, let's break it down:
1. All of Zhang Wei's extracurricular assignments are excellent.
2. If her semester papers are also excellent, she can pass the exam even if she does not make a class report.
3. Her semester dissertation did not get an excellent grade.
4. Therefore, she had to give a lecture in order to pass the exam.
The argument assumes that if Zhang Wei's semester papers are not excellent, she will fail the exam without giving a lecture. However, this assumption is not explicitly stated or confirmed in the given context.
It's possible that Zhang Wei could still pass the exam without excellent semester papers and without giving a lecture, depending on other factors like her overall performance or the exam's grading criteria. The argument relies on this unconfirmed assumption to conclude that Zhang Wei had to give a lecture to pass the exam.
Therefore, the reasoning in the argument is flawed because it relies on an unconfirmed assumption.
