Topic: Logic
Context: A blogger declared? "My analysis of the future trend of housing prices has received more than 1,000 netizens' follow-up posts.I counted them, and 85% of the follow-up posts agree with my opinion.This shows Most people agree with me."
Question: Which of the following can best question the blogger â€™s conclusion?
Choices:
  A: Although some people agree with his views, they do not agree with his analysis.
  B: The blogger's other articles with higher approval ratings later proved to be wrong.
  C: Some of the objections to the post are more fully justified.
  D: Most people who follow this blogger's article are their loyal fans.
## Assistant 2:
To question the blogger's conclusion that most people agree with their opinion, we should look for a flaw in their reasoning or evidence.
A) This doesn't directly challenge the conclusion that most people agree. Even if they agree for different reasons, they still agree.
B) The accuracy of the blogger's other articles is not directly relevant to whether most people agree with this specific article.
C) The quality or justification of the objections doesn't change the fact that 85% of the responses agreed with the blogger.
D) If most of the responses come from the blogger's loyal fans, that could bias the sample and make it unrepresentative of the general population. Even if 85% of responses agree, that may not reflect the views of "most people" overall if the respondents are a skewed sample.
Therefore, choice D best questions the blogger's conclusion by pointing out a potential sampling bias.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
