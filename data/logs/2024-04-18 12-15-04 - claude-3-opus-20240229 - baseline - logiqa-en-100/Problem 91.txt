## System:
You are an expert in Logic.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")

Topic: Logic
Context: Researchers in a country reported that they found meteorites about 200 million years old in the strata of a certain area, and they were probably traces of flying objects when a huge meteorite hit the present province of Quebec, Canada.The clay layer with a thickness of about 5 cm also contains high concentrations of elements such as iridium and platinum, which are 50 to 2000 times the concentration normally found on the ground.In addition, this rock also contains special minerals in the formation of the late Bacques.Since the upper and lower strata also contain marine plankton fossils, it can be determined that the impact period was about 215 million years ago.
Question: Which of the following, if true, would best support the above research findings?
Choices:
  A: The rock was formed after the accumulation layer of the deep seabed in the ancient times exposed above the ground
  B: In the late Paleozoic Triassic (approximately 200 million to 237 million years ago) ammonite and other species were extinct on a large scale
  C: Elements such as iridium and platinum are peculiar to meteorites and usually only exist in trace amounts on the surface
  D: In ancient times, there have been many incidents of meteorite impacting the earth
## Assistant 2:
To determine which choice best supports the research findings, let's consider each option:
A: The rock being formed from ancient deep seabed accumulation doesn't directly support the presence of meteorites or the impact event.
B: The extinction of ammonites and other species in the late Triassic period is consistent with the timeline of the impact (215 million years ago), but it doesn't specifically support the presence of meteorites or the impact event itself.
C: The high concentrations of iridium and platinum being peculiar to meteorites and rare on Earth's surface strongly supports the presence of meteorites in the clay layer, as the researchers found these elements at 50 to 2000 times their normal concentrations.
D: While the occurrence of many meteorite impacts in ancient times provides general context, it doesn't directly support the specific findings of this research.
Therefore, choice C provides the best support for the research findings, as it directly corroborates the presence of meteorites based on the high concentrations of iridium and platinum found in the clay layer.
Action: Answer("C")
