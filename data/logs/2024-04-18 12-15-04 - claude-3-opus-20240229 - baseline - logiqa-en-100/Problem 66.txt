Topic: Logic
Context: There are five volcanic islands E, F, G, H, and I in the east coast of a country.They are arranged in a straight line from north to south, and they are found? (1) F is adjacent to H and is on the north side of H.(2) I and E are adjacent.(3) G is somewhere in the north of F.
Question: If it is found that G is the northernmost island, how many possible arrangements are there for this group of islands?
Choices:
  A: 2
  B: 3
  C: 4
  D: 5
## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. We know that G is the northernmost island.
2. F is adjacent to H and is on the north side of H. This means that F must be directly north of H.
3. I and E are adjacent, but we don't know which one is north of the other.
4. Given the information in (1), (2), and (3), there are two possible arrangements:
   Arrangement 1: G - F - H - I - E
   Arrangement 2: G - F - H - E - I
5. There are no other possible arrangements that satisfy all the given conditions.
Therefore, there are 2 possible arrangements for this group of islands.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
