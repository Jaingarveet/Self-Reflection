Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.

## User 2:
Topic: Logic
Context: A survey of traffic accidents has found that the incidence of traffic accidents is actually similar in cities where drunk driving is strictly investigated and those who do not.However, most experts believe that strict investigation of drunk driving can indeed reduce the occurrence of traffic accidents.
Question: Which of the following is most helpful in eliminating this inconsistency?
Choices:
  A: Severe investigations of drunk driving have occurred in urban traffic accidents.
  B: The city that implements strict investigation of drunk driving has not eliminated drunk driving.
  C: It is more important to improve drivers' traffic safety awareness than strict management.
  D: In addition to strict investigation of drunk driving, other traffic violations should also be stopped.
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The survey found that the incidence of traffic accidents is similar in cities with strict drunk driving investigations and those without.
2. However, experts believe that strict drunk driving investigations can reduce traffic accidents.
3. This seems inconsistent. We need to find an explanation that resolves this inconsistency.
4. Choice A doesn't help because it just states that strict investigations have occurred in cities with traffic accidents. It doesn't explain the inconsistency.
5. Choice B provides a potential explanation. If cities with strict investigations haven't actually eliminated drunk driving, then the incidence of accidents might still be similar to cities without strict investigations.
6. Choice C suggests improving driver awareness is more important, but this doesn't directly address the inconsistency between the survey and expert opinion.
7. Choice D suggests stopping other traffic violations in addition to drunk driving. While this might help reduce accidents overall, it doesn't specifically explain the inconsistency about drunk driving investigations.
Therefore, Choice B seems most helpful in eliminating the inconsistency. It suggests that even with strict investigations, drunk driving hasn't been eliminated, which could explain why accident rates are still similar.
Action: Answer("B")
