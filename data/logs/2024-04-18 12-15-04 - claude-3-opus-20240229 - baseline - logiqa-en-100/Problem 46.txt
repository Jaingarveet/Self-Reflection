## System:
You are an expert in Logic.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Context: There are 7 candidates hired by Haier? F, G, H, I, W, X and Y.One of them needs to be assigned to the public relations department, three to the production department, and three to the sales department.The personnel allocation of these 7 employees must meet the following conditions? (1) H and Y must be allocated in the same department.(2) F and G cannot be allocated in the same department (3) If X is allocated in the sales department, W is allocated in the production department.(4) F must be allocated in the production department.
Question: Which of the following pairs of employees is unlikely to be assigned to the sales department?
Choices:
  A: G and I
  B: G and X
  C: G and Y
  D: H and W
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. From condition (4), we know that F must be in the production department.
2. From condition (2), since F is in production, G cannot be in production. So G must be in either sales or public relations.
3. From condition (1), H and Y must be in the same department. There are three possibilities:
   - If H and Y are in production, then I, W, and X must be in sales (since F is already in production and G is not in production).
   - If H and Y are in sales, then I, W, and X cannot all be in sales (since there are only 3 spots in sales). So at least one of I, W, or X must be in production or public relations.
   - If H and Y are in public relations, then I, W, and X must be split between production and sales.
4. From condition (3), if X is in sales, then W must be in production. This eliminates the possibility of H and Y being in production (because then X would be in sales and W would also have to be in sales, which is not possible).
5. Looking at the answer choices:
   - G and I could potentially be in sales together (if H and Y are in public relations).
   - G and X could potentially be in sales together (if H and Y are in public relations).
   - G and Y cannot be in sales together, because H and Y must be in the same department, and if H and Y are in sales, then G must be in public relations.
   - H and W could potentially be in sales together (if X is in production or public relations).
Therefore, the pair that is unlikely to be in sales together is G and Y.
Action: Answer("C")
