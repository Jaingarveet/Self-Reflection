## System:
You are an expert in Logic.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Topic: Logic
Context: The members of the printing group and the binding group are mainly from the following seven employees-F, G, H, J, K, L and M.The members of each group must meet the following conditions? (1) Each group has at least 3 employees .(2) F and K cannot be in the same group.(3) If K is in a certain group, J must also be in this group.(4) M is at least one of the members of these two groups.(5) At least one of the same employees in both groups.
Question: If the printing group has only three members, G, H, and L, and under sufficient conditions, the two groups have as many common members as possible, then which of the following statements must be true?
Choices:
  A: The binding group and the printing group happen to have a common member.
  B: The binding group and the printing group have exactly two members in common.
  C: The number of members in the binding and printing groups is the same.
  D: The number of members of the bookbinding group is at least one more than that of the printing group.
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The printing group has G, H, and L as its only members.
2. The binding group must have at least 3 members (condition 1).
3. F and K cannot be in the same group (condition 2), so if K is in the binding group, F cannot be.
4. If K is in the binding group, J must also be in the binding group (condition 3).
5. M must be in at least one of the groups (condition 4).
6. The two groups should have as many common members as possible (given).
7. The printing group does not include F, J, K, or M. So the only possible common members are G, H, and L.
8. To maximize common members, the binding group should include G, H, and L. This satisfies the requirement of at least 3 members.
9. M must also be in the binding group to satisfy condition 4.
Therefore, the binding group has at least 4 members (G, H, L, M), while the printing group has exactly 3 members (G, H, L).
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
