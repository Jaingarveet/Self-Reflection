Context: In recent years, China's housing prices have risen rapidly.In the fourth quarter of 2004, various government departments issued a number of measures to suppress the excessively rapid growth of housing prices, but national housing prices continued to rise in the first quarter of 2005.It was asserted that rising land prices are the chief culprit in soaring housing prices.
Question: Which of the following, if true, is the most doubtful of an assertion?
Choices:
  A: Shanghai's housing prices in the first quarter of 2005 increased by 19.1% over the same period last year, and land prices rose by 6.53%.
  B: Residential prices in Beijing increased by 7.2% in the first quarter of 2005 compared with the same period last year, and residential land prices rose by 0.37%.
  C: The chairman of Huayuan Real Estate believes that as land development costs increase, house prices will definitely increase.
  D: The chairman of Yongtai Development Company said? "The skyrocketing housing prices are because supply has not kept up with demand."
## Assistant 2:
To determine which choice most calls into doubt the assertion that rising land prices are the chief culprit behind soaring housing prices, let's consider each option:
A: If housing prices in Shanghai increased by 19.1% while land prices only rose by 6.53%, this suggests factors other than land prices are significantly contributing to the housing price increase. This choice casts some doubt on the assertion.
B: In Beijing, housing prices increased by 7.2% but land prices only rose by 0.37%. The large disparity between the housing and land price increases suggests land prices are not the primary driver of rising housing prices. This choice strongly questions the assertion.
C: The real estate chairman's belief that increasing land development costs will definitely increase house prices supports the assertion rather than calling it into doubt.
D: The development company chairman's statement that housing prices are skyrocketing due to supply not keeping up with demand points to factors other than land prices as the main reason. This challenges the assertion.
Considering all the choices, B most strongly calls into doubt the assertion by showing a case where housing prices rose much more dramatically than land prices, suggesting other factors besides land prices are the main drivers of housing price increases.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
