Topic: Logic
Context: If a person increases the number of meals per day but does not increase the total amount of meals, his cholesterol level will obviously decrease.However, most people consume more food while increasing the number of meals.
Question: If the above statement is true, which of the following options will it most strongly support?
Choices:
  A: For most people, his daily food intake does not significantly affect his cholesterol level.
  B: For most people, increasing the number of meals a day will not result in a significant reduction in cholesterol levels.
  C: For most people, the amount of food eaten per day will not be affected by the number of foods eaten per day.
  D: For most people, the amount of food consumed is greatly affected by the time taken to eat.
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The context states that if a person increases the number of meals per day without increasing the total amount of food, their cholesterol level will decrease.
2. However, it also states that most people consume more food when they increase the number of meals.
3. This implies that for most people, increasing the number of meals per day will also increase the total amount of food consumed.
4. Therefore, for most people, increasing the number of meals per day will not lead to a decrease in cholesterol levels, because they will also be consuming more food in total.
5. Among the given choices, option B most closely aligns with this conclusion: "For most people, increasing the number of meals a day will not result in a significant reduction in cholesterol levels."
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
