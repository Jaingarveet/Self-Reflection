## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. We know that Fuyi Station is east of Haoyun Station and west of Huyao Station, and is adjacent to Huyao Station.
2. We also know that Jiushang Station is adjacent to Yinling Station.
3. The question states that Jiushang Station is adjacent to Haoyun Station and east of Haoyun Station.
4. If Jiushang is east of Haoyun, and Fuyi is also east of Haoyun, then Fuyi must be further east than Jiushang.
5. Since Fuyi is adjacent to Huyao, Huyao must be the easternmost station.
6. Therefore, from west to east, the order of the stations must be: Haoyun, Jiushang, Yinling, Fuyi, Huyao.
7. Looking at the answer choices, we can conclude that Huyao is the easternmost station.
Action: Answer("A")
