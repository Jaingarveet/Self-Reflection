Context: There are 7 candidates hired by Haier? F, G, H, I, W, X and Y.One of them needs to be assigned to the public relations department, three to the production department, and three to the sales department.The personnel allocation of these 7 employees must meet the following conditions? (1) H and Y must be allocated in the same department.(2) F and G cannot be allocated in the same department (3) If X is allocated in the sales department, W is allocated in the production department.(4) F must be allocated in the production department.
Question: If X and F are assigned to the same department, which of the following statements cannot be true?
Choices:
  A: G is assigned to the sales department
  B: H is assigned to the production department.
  C: I was assigned to the sales department.
  D: W is assigned to the public relations department.
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. We know that F must be allocated to the production department (condition 4).
2. If X and F are assigned to the same department, then X must also be in the production department.
3. If X is in the production department, then W must be in the production department too (condition 3).
4. This means that all three spots in the production department are filled by F, X, and W.
5. H and Y must be in the same department (condition 1), and it can't be production as it's full. So they must be either in sales or public relations.
6. F and G can't be in the same department (condition 2), and F is in production, so G must be in either sales or public relations.
7. If H and Y are in public relations, then G and I must be in sales. But if H and Y are in sales, then one of G or I must be in public relations.
8. Therefore, the statement that cannot be true is "W is assigned to the public relations department", because W must be in production if X is in production with F.
Action: Answer("D")
