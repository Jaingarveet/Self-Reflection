## System:
You are an expert in Logic.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Topic: Logic
Context: A provincial Go team coach selects 4 of the 7 players from E, F, G, H, J, K and M to participate in the professional league.The selection must meet the following conditions? E or F has one person to participate, but not both .One of J or K will participate, but not both.If J participates, then G participates.Unless F participates, M does not participate.
Question: Which two of the following players will be selected by the coach to make the four-person team the only choice?
Choices:
  A: F and H
  C: G and M
  B: G and J
  D: H and M
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. We know that either E or F will participate, but not both. Let's consider both cases:
   Case 1: E participates
   - If E participates, then F does not participate.
   - If F does not participate, then M does not participate.
   Case 2: F participates
   - If F participates, then E does not participate.
   - If F participates, M may or may not participate.
2. We also know that either J or K will participate, but not both. Let's consider both cases:
   Case 1: J participates
   - If J participates, then G must also participate.
   - If J participates, then K does not participate.
   Case 2: K participates
   - If K participates, then J does not participate.
   - If K participates, G may or may not participate.
3. Now, let's look at the answer choices:
   A: F and H - This could be a valid choice, as F can participate, and H is not restricted by any conditions.
   B: G and J - This could also be a valid choice, as if J participates, G must also participate.
   C: G and M - This is not a valid choice, as there is no condition that requires both G and M to participate together.
   D: H and M - This is not a valid choice, as if M participates, F must also participate, but H and F together would exceed the limit of 4 players.
4. Therefore, the only choices that could make the four-person team the only choice are A (F and H) and B (G and J).
Action: Answer("A") and Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
