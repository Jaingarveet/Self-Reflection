Topic: Logic
Context: In today's economic globalization, Western cultural classics and traditions are still alive and continuing.In the United States, the President takes the oath of office under the Bible, and elementary school students recite the oath of "a country under the protection of God" by pressing the chest every week.In China, elementary school students have long ceased reading the Bible, and no one has sworn in according to the Analects.China has become a country that has almost lost its cultural classics and traditions.
Question: Which of the following statements is the assumption upon which the above argument relies?
Choices:
  A: With the rapid advancement of science and technology, Western cultural classics and traditions are declining.
  B: Officials in Chinese history have never handed down the tradition of swearing on a classic.
  C: Primary school reading is a symbol of a country and nation maintaining cultural classics and traditions.
  D: The cultural classics and traditions of a country and nation have an irreplaceable role in science.
## Assistant 2:
To determine the assumption the argument relies on, let's analyze each choice:
A: The argument does not discuss the relationship between science/technology advancement and Western cultural traditions. It only asserts Western traditions are still alive.
B: The argument does not make any claims about historical Chinese officials and their oath-taking traditions. This is not relevant to the main point.
D: The argument does not discuss the role of cultural classics and traditions in relation to science. This is outside the scope of the passage.
C: The argument uses the example of elementary school students in the US reciting oaths and reading the Bible, contrasting this with Chinese students no longer reading classics like the Analects. It then concludes that China has "almost lost its cultural classics and traditions." 
This implies the author sees primary school reading of cultural/religious texts as a key indicator of a society maintaining its cultural heritage and traditions. The argument relies on this assumed connection.
Therefore, the assumption the argument relies upon is best represented by choice C.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
