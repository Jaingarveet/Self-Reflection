Topic: Logic
Context: Five graduate students Zhang, Wang, Li, Zhao, and Liu graduated from a linguistics major in a college of arts of a university in 2014, and were hired by one of the three employers, Tianshu, Tianji, and Tianxuan, and at least one of them was hired by each unit.name.Known? (1) Li was hired by Tianshu; (2) Li and Zhao were not hired by the same unit; (3) Liu and Zhao were hired by the same unit; (4) If Zhang was hired by Tianxuan, then Wang Ye Was hired by Tianxuan.
Question: Which of the following may be correct?
Choices:
  A: Li and Liu were hired by the same unit.
  B: Wang, Zhao and Liu were all hired by Tianji.
  C: Only Liu was hired by Tian Xuan.
  D: Only Wang was hired by Tianxuan.
## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. Li was hired by Tianshu. (given)
2. Li and Zhao were not hired by the same unit. (given)
   So Zhao was not hired by Tianshu.
3. Liu and Zhao were hired by the same unit. (given)
   Since Zhao was not hired by Tianshu, Liu was also not hired by Tianshu.
4. If Zhang was hired by Tianxuan, then Wang was hired by Tianxuan. (given)
Now let's look at each choice:
A. Li and Liu were hired by the same unit. 
   This is false because Li was hired by Tianshu but Liu was not.
B. Wang, Zhao and Liu were all hired by Tianji.
   This could be true. We know Zhao and Liu were hired by the same unit, which could be Tianji.
C. Only Liu was hired by Tianxuan.
   This is false. If only Liu was hired by Tianxuan, then Zhang and Wang would have to be hired by Tianji (because they can't be in Tianshu). But then the condition "If Zhang was hired by Tianxuan, then Wang was hired by Tianxuan" would be violated.
D. Only Wang was hired by Tianxuan.
   This could be true. Zhang could be in Tianji, satisfying the condition.
Therefore, B and D could be correct.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
