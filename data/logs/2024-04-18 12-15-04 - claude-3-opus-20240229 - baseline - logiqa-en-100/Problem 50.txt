Topic: Logic
Context: A heating station has 5 valves to control the delivery of steam to the outside.The following operating rules must be followed when using these valves? (1) If valve No.1 is opened, then valve No.2 must be opened and valve No.5 must be closed.(2) If valve No.2 or valve No.5 is opened, valve No.4 must be closed.(3) No.3 valve and No.4 valve cannot be closed at the same time.
Question: Now we need to open the No.1 valve, which two valves are to be opened at the same time?
Choices:
  A: No.2 valve and No.4 valve.
  C: No.3 valve and No.5 valve.
  B: No.2 valve and No.3 valve.
  D: No.4 valve and No.5 valve.
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. We are told that valve No.1 needs to be opened.
2. According to rule (1), if valve No.1 is opened, then:
   - Valve No.2 must be opened, and
   - Valve No.5 must be closed.
3. Now, according to rule (2), if valve No.2 is opened, then:
   - Valve No.4 must be closed.
4. Rule (3) states that valve No.3 and valve No.4 cannot be closed at the same time. 
   - We know valve No.4 must be closed (from step 3).
   - Therefore, valve No.3 must be open to satisfy rule (3).
5. In summary, when valve No.1 is opened:
   - Valve No.2 must be opened (rule 1)
   - Valve No.3 must be opened (to satisfy rule 3, since valve No.4 is closed)
   - Valve No.4 must be closed (because valve No.2 is open, according to rule 2)
   - Valve No.5 must be closed (rule 1)
Therefore, the two valves that must be opened at the same time as valve No.1 are valve No.2 and valve No.3.
