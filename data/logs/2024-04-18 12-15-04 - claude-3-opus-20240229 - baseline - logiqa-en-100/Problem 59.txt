Context: There are 7 candidates hired by Haier? F, G, H, I, W, X and Y.One of them needs to be assigned to the public relations department, three to the production department, and the other three to the sales department.The personnel allocation of these 7 employees must meet the following conditions? (1) H and Y must be allocated in the same department.(2) F and G cannot be allocated in the same department (3) If X is allocated in the sales department, W is allocated in the production department.(4) F must be allocated in the production department.
Question: Which of the following may list the final distribution of these 7 employees?
Choices:
  A: Public Relations Department? W; Production Department? F, H, Y; Sales Department? G, I, X
  B: Public Relations Department? W; Production Department? G, I, X; Sales Department? F, H, Y
  C: Public Relations Department? X; Production Department? F, G, H; Sales Department? I, Y, W
  D: Public Relations Department? X; Production Department? F, I, W; Sales Department? G, H, Y
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. F must be in the production department (given in condition 4).
2. H and Y must be in the same department (condition 1). 
3. F and G cannot be in the same department (condition 2). Since F is in production, G cannot be in production.
4. If X is in sales, W must be in production (condition 3).
Now, let's look at each choice:
A: This violates condition 2 because G is in sales while F is in production.
B: This violates condition 4 because F is in sales, not production.
C: This satisfies all conditions. X is in public relations, so condition 3 doesn't apply. F is in production, satisfying condition 4. H and Y are together in sales, satisfying condition 1. F and G are in different departments, satisfying condition 2.
D: This violates condition 1 because H and Y are in different departments.
Therefore, the only choice that may list the final distribution is C.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
