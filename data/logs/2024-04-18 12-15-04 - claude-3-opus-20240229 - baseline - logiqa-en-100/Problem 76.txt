You are an expert in Logic.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.

## User 2:
Topic: Logic
Context: Some Taiwan independence elements argue that all people under the jurisdiction of the People ’s Republic of China are Chinese, and Taiwanese are not under the jurisdiction of the People ’s Republic of China.Therefore, Taiwanese are not Chinese.
Question: Which of the following reasoning clearly shows that the above argument is not valid?
Choices:
  A: All successful people have to eat in clothes.I am not a successful person now, so I do n’t have to eat in clothes.
  B: Commodities have use value, and air certainly has use value, so air is of course a commodity.
  C: All technical backbones study hard.Xiao Zhang is a technical backbone.Therefore, Xiao Zhang is a hard-working person.
  D: Criminal behaviors are illegal behaviors, and violations should be condemned by the society, so all criminal behaviors should be condemned by the society.
## Assistant 2:
To determine which reasoning shows the argument is invalid, we need to find a choice that follows the same logical structure but leads to an obviously false conclusion.
The original argument has the form:
- All P are Q
- R are not P
- Therefore, R are not Q
Let's examine each choice:
A) This has the form:
   - All P have to Q
   - I am not P
   - Therefore, I don't have to Q
   This matches the original argument's structure and the conclusion is clearly false, showing the invalidity of the original argument.
B) This does not match the original structure. It has the form "P has Q, R has Q, therefore R is P", which is different.
C) This also does not match. It has the form "All P are Q. R is P. Therefore, R is Q", which is a valid argument form.
D) This also does not match. It just states that criminal behaviors, being illegal, should be condemned by society.
Therefore, choice A is the only one that clearly shows the original argument is invalid by using the same structure to reach a false conclusion.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
