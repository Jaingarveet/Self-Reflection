Context: In the 110-meter hurdles competition at the Olympic Games, Liu Xiang won the championship and broke the Olympic record, tying the world record.He said to reporters? "Who said Asians can't be the sprint king ?! As long as I am there! You believe me!", "Black athletes have been monopolizing this project for many years.Yellow-skinned athletes cannot be old Behind black athletes, from me, a new chapter will be written! "
Question: The fact that Liu Xiang won the championship and his words do not constitute a rebuttal to which of the following assertions?
Choices:
  A: Only black athletes can become track and field champions.
  B: All sprint kings are not yellow-skinned players.
  C: Most track and field champions are black athletes.
  D: If who is the king of sprint, whoever has the African-black descent.
## Assistant 2:
To determine which assertion Liu Xiang's championship and words do not rebut, let's analyze each choice:
A: "Only black athletes can become track and field champions." 
Liu Xiang, an Asian athlete, winning the championship directly contradicts this assertion.
B: "All sprint kings are not yellow-skinned players."
Liu Xiang's victory as a "yellow-skinned" athlete disproves the claim that sprint kings cannot be yellow-skinned.
C: "Most track and field champions are black athletes."
While Liu Xiang's win challenges the dominance of black athletes, it does not necessarily disprove that most champions are still black.
D: "If who is the king of sprint, whoever has the African-black descent."
Liu Xiang's championship as an Asian athlete refutes the idea that only those of African descent can be sprint kings.
Therefore, Liu Xiang's championship and words do not directly rebut assertion C, as his individual victory does not negate the possibility that black athletes still make up the majority of track and field champions.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
