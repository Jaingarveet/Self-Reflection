## User 2:
Topic: Logic
Context: Conne Levi with a "moe" look looks like other newborns.But because it is the world's first test-tube baby screened by next-generation gene sequencing technology, his advent has attracted the attention of experts and scholars.Not long ago, this news detonated the audience at the "European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology Annual Meeting" held in London, England.And ordinary people also believe that humans may usher in the era of "customized babies".
Question: Which of the following, if true, would best refute the views of ordinary people?
Choices:
  A: "Artificial" genetic screening does not rule out that there will be loopholes; in natural conception, the guidelines for survival of the fittest in nature seem to be more subtle and effective
  B: It can be seen from the development history of modern science and technology that technological development is often faster than human cognition, and sometimes technology will go further and deviate from the track of human cognition
  C: Gene screening is mainly to avoid reproductive defects, this technology brings opportunities for human eugenics and eugenics; as for "customized babies", the concept of cloning is more involved, the two should not be confused
  D: "Customized babies" have not been tried globally, this concept also challenges the most controversial human reproductive ethics
## Assistant 2:
To refute the views of ordinary people that we may usher in an era of "customized babies", the best choice is:
C: Gene screening is mainly to avoid reproductive defects, this technology brings opportunities for human eugenics and eugenics; as for "customized babies", the concept of cloning is more involved, the two should not be confused
This choice clarifies the key difference between gene screening, which aims to prevent birth defects, and the concept of "customized babies", which is more related to cloning. It points out that people are confusing these two distinct concepts.
The other choices, while relevant, do not directly refute the idea that gene screening will lead to "customized babies":
A discusses the potential flaws in artificial screening vs. natural selection, but doesn't address customization. 
B notes technology can outpace human understanding, but doesn't specify how this applies here.
D says customized babies haven't been attempted and are ethically controversial, but doesn't explain why gene screening differs from customization.
Therefore, C provides the clearest logical refutation to the stated public perception.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
