## System:
You are an expert in Logic.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

## User 2:
Topic: Logic
Context: Right and wrong and whether they violate the rules are two things.There may be regulations that prohibit things that are not wrong in themselves, such as laws in certain countries that prohibit criticism of the government; there may also be regulations that require things that are inherently wrong, such as laws that require apartheid in public places.And, like evaluating behavior, we can also evaluate some of the prescribed right and wrong.
Question: Which of the following does not weaken, but supports the argument in the question stem?
Choices:
  A: If we do not follow some pre-existing regulations or standards, how can we judge right and wrong?
  B: "People are doing, heaven is watching." Failure to act in accordance with ethical regulations will incur punishment from heaven.
  C: Behind the judgment of right and wrong, you can always find the rules or standards on which people judge.
  D: The basis for judgment of right and wrong lies in pushing oneself and one's moral conscience.It is common and universal; however, the moral regulations on how to act for people vary from person to person and from place to place.
## Assistant 2:
To determine which choice supports the argument in the question stem, let's break down the main points:
1. Right and wrong are distinct from whether they violate rules or regulations.
2. Some regulations may prohibit things that are not inherently wrong.
3. Some regulations may require things that are inherently wrong.
4. We can evaluate the prescribed right and wrong, similar to evaluating behavior.
Now, let's examine each choice:
A. This choice questions how we can judge right and wrong without pre-existing regulations or standards. This weakens the argument by implying that right and wrong are dependent on regulations.
B. This choice suggests that failure to follow ethical regulations will lead to divine punishment. This is not directly related to the argument and does not support it.
C. This choice states that judgments of right and wrong are always based on rules or standards. This weakens the argument by suggesting that right and wrong are inseparable from regulations.
D. This choice asserts that the basis for judging right and wrong lies in one's moral conscience, which is common and universal, while acknowledging that moral regulations vary across individuals and places. This supports the argument by distinguishing between the universal basis for judging right and wrong (moral conscience) and the varying regulations that prescribe how to act.
Action: Answer("D")

Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
