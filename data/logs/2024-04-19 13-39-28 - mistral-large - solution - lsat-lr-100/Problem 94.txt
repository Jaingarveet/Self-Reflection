Context: Most auto mechanics have extensive experience. Furthermore, most mechanics with extensive experience understand electronic circuits. Thus, most auto mechanics understand electronic circuits.
Question: The pattern of flawed reasoning in which one of the following arguments is most similar to that in the argument above?
Choices:
  A: During times of the year when automobile traffic increases, gas prices also increase. Increases in gas prices lead to increases in consumer complaints. Thus, increased automobile traffic causes increased consumer complaints.
  B: The most common species of birds in this region are migratory. Moreover, most migratory birds have left this region by the end of November. Hence, few birds remain in this region during the winter.
  C: It is not surprising that most speeding tickets in this region are issued to drivers of sports cars. After all, most drivers who are not interested in driving fast do not buy sports cars.
  D: Most nature photographers find portrait photography boring. Moreover, most portrait photographers especially enjoy photographing dignitaries. Thus, most nature photographers find photographing dignitaries especially boring.

Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
The original argument assumes that all auto mechanics have extensive experience and that all mechanics with extensive experience understand electronic circuits. However, this does not necessarily mean that all auto mechanics understand electronic circuits. This is an example of the logical fallacy of undistributed middle.
Choice [REDACTED] assumes that all snow-removal companies run lawn-care services during the summer and that all companies that run lawn-care services during the summer hire additional workers in the summer. However, this does not necessarily mean that all snow-removal companies hire additional workers in the summer. This is also an example of the logical fallacy of undistributed middle.
