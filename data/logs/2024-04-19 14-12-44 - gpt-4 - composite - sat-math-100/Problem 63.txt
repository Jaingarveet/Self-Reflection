  B: $300=30 w$
  C: $300=30 w+60$
  D: $300=60 w-30$
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I subtracted the initial payment from the total price before setting up the equation. This led me to choose an incorrect equation. The correct approach is to include the initial payment in the equation.
Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation of problem
- Incorrect equation setup
- Arithmetic error
Solution:
The total price of the television is $300. This includes an initial payment of $60 and the remaining amount to be paid in weekly installments of $30. Therefore, the correct equation to find the number of weekly payments, w, is $300 = 60 + 30w.
Instructions:
1. Identify the total price of the item.
2. Identify the initial payment.
3. Identify the amount of the weekly payments.
4. Set up an equation where the total price is equal to the initial payment plus the product of the weekly payment and the number of weeks.
5. Choose the answer that matches your equation.
Advice:
- Always read the question carefully and understand what is being asked.
- When setting up equations, consider all components of the problem.
- Be careful with arithmetic operations; ensure you are adding, subtracting, multiplying, or dividing as appropriate.
- Double-check your equation before choosing an answer.
