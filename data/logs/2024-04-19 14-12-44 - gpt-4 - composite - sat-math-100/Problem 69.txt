## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Question: Alan drives an average of 100 miles each week. His car can travel an average of 25 miles per gallon of gasoline. Alan would like to reduce his weekly expenditure on gasoline by $\$ 5$. Assuming gasoline costs $\$ 4$ per gallon, which equation can Alan use to determine how many fewer average miles, $m$, he should drive each week?
Choices:
  A: $\frac{25}{4} m=95$
  B: $\frac{25}{4} m=5$
  C: $\frac{4}{25} m=95$
  D: $\frac{4}{25} m=5$

You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I misunderstood the question and incorrectly set up the equation. I calculated the number of miles Alan should reduce instead of setting up an equation to find the number of miles. 
Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation of the question
- Incorrect equation setup
Solution:
Alan wants to reduce his weekly expenditure on gasoline by $5. Since gasoline costs $4 per gallon, this means he wants to use 5/4 = 1.25 gallons less each week. 
Since his car can travel an average of 25 miles per gallon, the equation to find the number of fewer miles he should drive each week is 4/25 * m = 5, where m is the number of miles less he should drive each week.
Instructions:
1. Understand the question and what is being asked.
2. Identify the given values: cost of gasoline, miles per gallon, and the amount Alan wants to reduce his expenditure by.
3. Calculate the number of gallons less Alan should use each week by dividing the amount he wants to reduce his expenditure by the cost of gasoline.
4. Set up the equation to find the number of fewer miles he should drive each week. The equation should be (cost of gasoline / miles per gallon) * m = amount Alan wants to reduce his expenditure by.
Advice:
- Always read the question carefully and understand what is being asked.
- Identify the given values and what you need to find.
- Set up the equation correctly based on the given values and what you need to find.
- Double-check your equation to ensure it is set up correctly.

Since his car can travel an average of 25 miles per gallon, the equation to find the number of fewer miles he should drive each week is 25 * 1.25 = m, where m is the number of miles less he should drive each week.
This equation can be rewritten as 4/25 * m = 5.
