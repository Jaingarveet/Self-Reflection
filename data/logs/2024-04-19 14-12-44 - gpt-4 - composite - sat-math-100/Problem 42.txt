Explanation:
I made a mistake in my calculation when substituting the values of a and b into the equation $7a + 2b = c$. I incorrectly calculated the values of c as 35 and 21, when they should have been 41 and 31.
Error Keywords:
- Calculation error
- Substitution error
- Arithmetic error
Solution:
The equation $(a x+2)(b x+7)=15 x^{2}+c x+14$ can be expanded to $abx^2 + (7a + 2b)x + 14 = 15x^2 + cx + 14$.
Since the equation holds for all values of x, the coefficients on the left side must equal the coefficients on the right side.
Therefore, $ab = 15$ and $7a + 2b = c$.
We also know that $a + b = 8$.
We can solve for a and b using the equations $ab = 15$ and $a + b = 8$.
The solutions are $(a, b) = (5, 3)$ or $(a, b) = (3, 5)$.
Substituting these values into the equation $7a + 2b = c$ gives $c = 41$ or $c = 31$.
Instructions:
1. Expand the given equation.
2. Equate the coefficients on both sides of the equation.
3. Use the given equation $a + b = 8$ and the derived equation $ab = 15$ to solve for a and b.
4. Substitute the values of a and b into the equation $7a + 2b = c$ to find the values of c.
5. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
6. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
- Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
- Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
- Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
- Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
- Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
- Be careful when substituting values into equations.
