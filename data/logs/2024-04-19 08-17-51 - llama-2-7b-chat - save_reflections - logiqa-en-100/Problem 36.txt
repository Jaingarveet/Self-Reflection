## Get Reflection:
  Great job! You have identified the correct answer, which is option B: Magazines that publish violent and pornographic content usually sell well, but have low credibility.

Here's why this option weakens the argument:

The argument suggests that advertisers have ethical responsibilities beyond just economic benefits. However, if violent and pornographic content sells well but has low credibility, it suggests that advertisers may be more interested in short-term financial gains than in ethical considerations. This undermines the idea that advertisers take their ethical responsibilities seriously.

Option A, on the other hand, is irrelevant to the argument, as it does not provide any information that would weaken it. Option C is also irrelevant, as it does not provide any information about the advertising cost of the magazine. Option D provides specific information that weakens the argument, as a higher advertising cost after the name change could suggest that the name change was not as effective as the argument suggests.

Well done!
