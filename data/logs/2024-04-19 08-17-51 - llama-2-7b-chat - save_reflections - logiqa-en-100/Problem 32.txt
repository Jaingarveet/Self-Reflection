## Get Reflection:
  Excellent! You have correctly identified the answer as D: If a person is immoral, he is overbearing and careful.

Here's why:

The sentence highlights the importance of cultural environment in shaping a person's behavior towards themselves, others, and the natural environment. It suggests that if humans plunder nature, there will be no sustainable life. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.

Now, let's analyze the other options:

A: If a person is careful, he has no taste.

This option is false. Being careful does not necessarily mean a person has no taste. A person can be careful and still have taste.

B: If a person is overbearing, he is immoral.

This option is also false. Being overbearing does not necessarily mean a person is immoral. A person can be overbearing without being immoral.

D: If a person is immoral, he is overbearing and careful.

This option is true. If a person is immoral, they may be overbearing and careful, as they may prioritize their own desires and disregard the feelings and needs of others.

In conclusion, the correct answer is D: If a person is immoral, he is overbearing and careful. Great job!
