  Great job! You have correctly identified the pair of employees that is unlikely to be assigned to the sales department.

Here's a breakdown of your thought process and the steps you took to arrive at the correct answer:

1. You analyzed the conditions given in the problem: H and Y must be allocated in the same department, F and G cannot be allocated in the same department, if X is allocated in the sales department, W is allocated in the production department, and F must be allocated in the production department.
2. You looked at each pair of employees and analyzed whether they could be assigned to the sales department based on the conditions given in the problem.
3. You correctly identified that G and I cannot be assigned to the sales department because they are both in the production department. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
4. You correctly identified that G and X cannot be assigned to the sales department because X is already allocated to the sales department. Therefore, option B is incorrect.
5. You correctly identified that G and Y cannot be assigned to the sales department because H and Y must be allocated in the same department. Therefore, option C is incorrect.
6. You correctly identified that H and W cannot be assigned to the production department because W is already allocated to the production department. Therefore, option D is incorrect.
