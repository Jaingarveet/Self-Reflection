## Get Reflection:
 Explanation:
You have correctly analyzed the conditions given in the problem and identified the possible combinations of players and their participation. Great job!

However, there is a small mistake in your reasoning. You have selected answer choice (B) as the correct combination, but you have not considered the possibility of J participating alone.

Here's why:

1. If J participates, then G participates (condition 2).
2. If J participates alone, then M does not participate (condition 4).

Therefore, the possible combinations that satisfy all the conditions are:

A. F and H: F cannot participate, as the condition 1 is violated. H cannot participate alone, as the condition 2 is violated.
B. G and J: This combination satisfies all the conditions. G participates, as J participates. M does not participate, as F does not participate.
C. G and M: This combination satisfies all the conditions. G participates, as M participates. J does not participate, as F participates.
D. H and M: This combination violates condition 2, as both H and M participate. Therefore, this combination is not possible.

So, the correct answer is (D) H and M.

Great job on your analysis! Keep practicing, and you'll become a master of logic in no time!
