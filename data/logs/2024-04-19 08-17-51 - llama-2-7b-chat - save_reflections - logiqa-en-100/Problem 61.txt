## Get Reflection:
  Great job! You have correctly identified the correct answer. Here's a breakdown of your thought process and the reasons why you made the correct choice:

1. You correctly identified the key conditions given in the problem:
	* There is only one assistant to the general manager in charge of three departments at the same time.
	* F and G are not in charge of the same department.
	* H and I are not in charge of the same department.
2. You used the conditions to eliminate the incorrect options:
	* You correctly eliminated option A because F and H are not in charge of the same department, so F and H cannot be in charge of the same department.
	* You correctly eliminated option B because H and I are not in charge of the same department, so H and I cannot be in charge of the same department.
3. You made the correct choice:
	* You chose option C, which states that I and P are in charge of the same department. This is true because I and P are both general manager assistants, and they are in charge of the same department.

Great job! Your thought process and attention to detail were spot on. Keep up the good work!
