## Get Reflection:
 Explanation:
You are correct! Based on the information provided, the third speaker is indeed N.

Here's how we can deduce this:

1. J is the fourth speaker, so the third speaker must be either N or M.
2. Since G must speak before lunch, the second speaker is either G or L.
3. Since F speaks in the first or third place, the first speaker is either F or M.
4. Since only one speaker is between M and N, the second speaker cannot be M.

Therefore, the third speaker is N.

Well done!
