## Get Reflection:

Action: Answer("B")

The most doubtful assertion is Option C, which implies a direct causal relationship between land prices and housing prices without considering other factors that may influence the housing market. While it is true that land prices have increased, it is not the sole cause of rising housing prices. Other factors such as changes in supply and demand, interest rates, and economic conditions also play a role. Therefore, Option C is the most doubtful.
