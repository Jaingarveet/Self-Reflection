## Get Reflection:
  Great job! You have correctly identified the answer that would strengthen the argument most.

The correct answer is indeed (D) Some clients who advertise in other family magazines and so on turn to "Inferno" magazine. This option provides evidence that the loss of advertisers in "Bay" magazine is not solely due to economic considerations, but also reflects a broader ethical shift in the advertising industry.

Here's why the other options do not strengthen the argument:

* (A) The cost and selling price of "Inferno" are lower than that of "Harbour" is irrelevant to the argument. The argument is about the ethical responsibilities of advertisers, not about the pricing strategy of the magazine.
* (B) The above advertisers who refused to renew their contracts have not affected the benefits after switching to other publications is also irrelevant. The argument is about the ethical motivations of the advertisers, not about the benefits of switching to other publications.
* (C) Readers of family magazines are generally not interested in violent and pornographic content is the key point that supports the argument. If readers are not interested in this type of content, then the advertisers who refused to renew their contracts are likely motivated by ethical concerns rather than purely economic benefits.

Great job!
