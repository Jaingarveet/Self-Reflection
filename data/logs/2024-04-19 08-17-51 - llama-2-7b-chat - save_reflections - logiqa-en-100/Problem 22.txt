## Get Reflection:
 Explanation:
The correct answer is (D) High-income groups have little sense of a small price increase.

The passage explains that the people's feelings of a higher increase in prices than the moderate 1.8% CPI rise may be due to the fact that the CPI only measures the overall trend of consumer prices and does not take into account individual experiences and regional differences. However, option (C) suggests that products with a high degree of relevance to people's lives tend to increase prices; those with a low degree of relevance tend to fall prices. This is not the correct explanation for the gap between the statistics and people's feelings, as it does not take into account the individual experiences and regional differences that the passage mentions.

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) High-income groups have little sense of a small price increase. This option suggests that high-income groups may not feel the same impact of small price increases as lower-income groups, which could contribute to the gap between the statistics and people's feelings.
