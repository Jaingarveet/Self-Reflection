## Get Reflection:
 Explanation:

The correct answer is (A) If Green Island cannot achieve its goal of increasing productivity by 20%, it will go bankrupt.

The reasoning is as follows:

* The statement given in the question is "If Green Island can increase productivity by 10%, then it can achieve the goal of increasing productivity by 20%."
* This means that if Green Island increases productivity by 10%, it will be able to achieve its goal of increasing productivity by 20%.
* If Green Island cannot achieve its goal of increasing productivity by 20%, it will not be able to avoid bankruptcy.
* Therefore, the correct answer is (A) If Green Island cannot achieve its goal of increasing productivity by 20%, it will go bankrupt.

The other options are not correct because they do not follow logically from the given statement:

* Option (B) is incorrect because it assumes that increasing productivity by 20% will guarantee that Green Island will not go bankrupt, which is not necessarily true.
* Option (C) is incorrect because it does not take into account the possibility that Green Island may not be able to increase productivity by 10%, which could still lead to bankruptcy.
* Option (D) is incorrect because it assumes that Green Island may increase productivity by 10% in the next two years, which is not necessarily true.
