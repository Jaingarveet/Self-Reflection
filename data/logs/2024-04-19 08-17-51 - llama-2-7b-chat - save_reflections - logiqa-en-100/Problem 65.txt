## Get Reflection:
  Explanation:
The inconsistency between the survey findings and the experts' belief that strict investigation of drunk driving can reduce traffic accidents can be resolved by considering the potential biases in the survey data or the experts' opinions.

The survey findings may have been influenced by various factors, such as sampling biases or non-representative data collection methods. Additionally, the experts' beliefs may be based on incomplete or outdated information. Therefore, it is more important to improve drivers' traffic safety awareness than to rely solely on strict management of drunk driving. By addressing the root causes of traffic accidents, such as driver behavior and awareness, the incidence of accidents can be reduced more effectively.

The correct answer is (C) It is more important to improve drivers' traffic safety awareness than strict management. This answer choice acknowledges that while strict investigation of drunk driving may be important, it is not the only factor that can reduce traffic accidents. Improving drivers' awareness and behavior on the road is also crucial in reducing the incidence of accidents.
