## Get Reflection:
 Explanation:
The argument suggests that the psychological theory is untenable because great painters often spend most of their time in loneliness yet are still able to achieve great things. Therefore, the most likely assumption is that loneliness is necessary for great painting artists.

Option C is the correct answer.

Explanation of the other options:

Option A is not the most likely assumption, as the argument does not reveal any relationship between inner experience and artistic achievement.

Option B is also not the most likely assumption, as the argument does not suggest that people with intimate relationships have little time for loneliness. In fact, the argument suggests that great painters often spend most of their time in loneliness.

Option D is not the most likely assumption, as the argument does not imply that artists who have achieved great things cannot be unhappy. The argument is based on the idea that great painters often spend most of their time in loneliness, which suggests that they may still be unhappy despite their achievements.
