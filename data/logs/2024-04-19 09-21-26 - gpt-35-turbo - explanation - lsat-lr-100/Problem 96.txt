Topic: Law
Context: A recent study shows that those highways that carry the most traffic, and thus tend to be the most congested, have the lowest rate of fatal traffic accidents.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain the phenomenon described above?
Choices:
  A: Drivers have more accidents when they become distracted.
  B: The highways that have the highest rate of fatal accidents have moderate volumes of traffic.
  C: Most of the motorists on very heavily traveled highways tend to be commuting to or from work.
  D: Most serious accidents occur when vehicles are moving at a high rate of speed.
  E: Heavily traveled highways do not always carry a higher proportion of large trucks.
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I incorrectly chose choice [REDACTED] as the answer because it seemed to provide a possible explanation for the phenomenon. However, it is not directly related to the phenomenon described in the question. 
Choice [REDACTED] is the correct answer because it provides a direct explanation for the phenomenon. If most serious accidents occur when vehicles are moving at a high rate of speed, then it makes sense that highways with the most traffic, which tend to have slower-moving traffic, would have a lower rate of fatal accidents.
