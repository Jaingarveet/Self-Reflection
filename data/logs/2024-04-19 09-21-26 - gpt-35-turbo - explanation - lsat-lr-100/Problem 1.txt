Explanation:
I misinterpreted the meaning of the statements above. 
The statements imply that the country is divided into two regions: one where it is easy to grow cacti and the other where it is easy to raise orange trees. 
If half of the country is both humid and cold, then it is not true that in most parts of the country, it is either easy to grow cacti or easy to raise orange trees.
