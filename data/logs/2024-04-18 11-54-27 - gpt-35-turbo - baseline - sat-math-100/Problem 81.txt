## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: If $a^{2}+b^{2}=z$ and $a b=y$, which of the following is equivalent to $4 z+8 y$ ?
Choices:
  A: $(a+2 b)^{2}$
  B: $(2 a+2 b)^{2}$
  C: $(4 a+4 b)^{2}$
  D: $(4 a+8 b)^{2}$
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
We can try to manipulate the given expression using the given equations.
$4z+8y=4(a^2+b^2)+8(ab)=4a^2+8ab+4b^2=4(a^2+2ab+b^2)=(2a+2b)^2$
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
