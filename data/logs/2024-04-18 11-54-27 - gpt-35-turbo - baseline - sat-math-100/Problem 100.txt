## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Topic: Math
Context: $$.a=1,052+1.08 t.$$.The speed of a sound wave in air depends on the air temperature. The formula above shows the relationship between $a$, the speed of a sound wave, in feet per second, and $t$, the air temperature, in degrees Fahrenheit $\left({ }^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\right)$.
Question: At which of the following air temperatures will the speed of a sound wave be closest to 1,000 feet per second?
Choices:
  A: $-46^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$
  B: $-48^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$
  C: $-49^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$
  D: $-50^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
We need to find the value of $t$ that makes $a$ closest to 1,000.
We can solve for $t$ by setting $a$ equal to 1,000 and solving for $t$.
Action: 
Substitute $a=1,000$ into the formula and solve for $t$:
\begin{aligned} 1,000 &=1,052+1.08 t \\ -52 &=1.08 t \\ t &\approx-48.15 \end{aligned}
The temperature closest to $-48.15$ is $-48^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$, so the answer is (B). Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
