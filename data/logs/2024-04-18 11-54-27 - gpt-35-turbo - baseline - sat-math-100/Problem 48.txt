## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: $$\begin{aligned}& 3 x+b=5 x-7 \\& 3 y+c=5 y-7\end{aligned}$$In the equations above, $b$ and $c$ are constants.If $b$ is $c$ minus $\frac{1}{2}$, which of the following is true?
Choices:
  A: $x$ is $y$ minus $\frac{1}{4}$.
  B: $x$ is $y$ minus $\frac{1}{2}$.
  C: $x$ is $y$ minus 1 .
  D: $x$ is $y$ plus $\frac{1}{2}$.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Subtracting $3x$ from both sides of the first equation and $3y$ from both sides of the second equation, we get $b=-4x+7$ and $c=-2y+7$. Substituting $b$ and $c$ in terms of $x$ and $y$ in the equations, we get $3x-4x+7=5x-7$ and $3y-2y+7=5y-7$. Simplifying these equations, we get $x=-7$ and $y=7$. Therefore, $x-y=-14$.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
