## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Question: Shipping Charges\begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}\hline$\begin{array}{c}\text { Merchandise weight } \\ \text { (pounds) }\end{array}$ & $\begin{array}{c}\text { Shipping } \\ \text { charge }\end{array}$ \\\hline5 & $\$ 16.94$ \\\hline10 & $\$ 21.89$ \\\hline20 & $\$ 31.79$ \\\hline40 & $\$ 51.59$ \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}The table above shows shipping charges for an online retailer that sells sporting goods. There is a linear relationship between the shipping charge and the weight of the merchandise. Which function can be used to determine the total shipping charge $f(x)$, in dollars, for an order with a merchandise weight of $x$ pounds?
Choices:
  A: $f(x)=0.99 x$
  B: $f(x)=0.99 x+11.99$
  C: $f(x)=3.39 x$
  D: $f(x)=3.39 x+16.94$
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The function is linear, so it has the form $f(x)=mx+b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept.
We can use the given data to find the slope and y-intercept.
Action: 
The slope is the change in shipping charge divided by the change in merchandise weight, which is $\frac{\$ 21.89-\$ 16.94}{10-5}=\$ 0.99$.
The y-intercept is the shipping charge when the merchandise weight is 0, which is $\$ 16.94$.
Therefore, the function is $f(x)=0.99x+16.94$.
Answer: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
