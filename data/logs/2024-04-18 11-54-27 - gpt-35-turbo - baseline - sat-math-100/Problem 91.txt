## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: \begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|c||c|c|c|c|}\hline$n$ & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\\hline$f(n)$ & -2 & 1 & 4 & 7 \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}The table above shows some values of the linear function $f$. Which of the following defines $f$ ?
Choices:
  A: $f(n)=n-3$
  B: $f(n)=2 n-4$
  C: $f(n)=3 n-5$
  D: $f(n)=4 n-6$
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
To determine the equation of a linear function, we need to find the slope and the y-intercept.
The slope is the difference between the y-coordinates divided by the difference between the x-coordinates.
Action: 
The slope of the function is $\frac{f(2)-f(1)}{2-1}=\frac{1-(-2)}{2-1}=3$.
The y-intercept is $f(1)=-2$.
Therefore, the equation of the function is $f(n)=3n-5$.
Answer: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
