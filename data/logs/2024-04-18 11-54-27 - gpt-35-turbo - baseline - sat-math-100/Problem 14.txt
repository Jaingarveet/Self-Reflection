## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: \begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}\hline$x$ & $a$ & $3 a$ & $5 a$ \\\hline$y$ & 0 & $-a$ & $-2 a$ \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}Some values of $x$ and their corresponding values of $y$ are shown in the table above, where $a$ is a constant. If there is a linear relationship between $x$ and $y$, which of the following equations represents the relationship?
Choices:
  A: $x+2 y=a$
  B: $x+2 y=5 a$
  C: $2 x-y=-5 a$
  D: $2 x-y=7 a$
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
We can use the given table to find the slope of the linear relationship between $x$ and $y$.
The slope of a linear relationship between two variables $x$ and $y$ is given by $\frac{\text{change in }y}{\text{change in }x}$.
Action: 
The change in $y$ when $x$ increases from $a$ to $3a$ is $-a-0=-a$.
The change in $x$ when $x$ increases from $a$ to $3a$ is $3a-a=2a$.
So, the slope of the linear relationship between $x$ and $y$ is $\frac{-a}{2a}=-\frac{1}{2}$.
The equation of a line with slope $m$ that passes through a point $(x_1,y_1)$ is given by $y-y_1=m(x-x_1)$.
Using the point $(a,0)$ and the slope $-\frac{1}{2}$, we get $y-0=-\frac{1}{2}(x-a)$, which simplifies to $x+2y=2a$.
Multiplying both sides by $\frac{5}{2}$, we get $x+2y=5a$.
Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ x+2 y=5 a}$.
