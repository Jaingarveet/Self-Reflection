## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: The equation $\frac{24 x^{2}+25 x-47}{a x-2}=-8 x-3-\frac{53}{a x-2}$ is true for all values of $x \neq \frac{2}{a}$, where $a$ is a constant.What is the value of $a$ ?
Choices:
  A: -16
  B: -3
  C: 3
  D: 16
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
We can start by simplifying the given equation and then try to find the value of $a$.
Action: 
Multiplying both sides of the equation by $a x-2$ gives $24 x^{2}+25 x-47=-8 x(a x-2)-3(a x-2)-53$
Simplifying the right-hand side gives $24 x^{2}+25 x-47=-8 a x^{2}+19 x+107$
Rearranging the terms gives $8 a x^{2}+x(19-25)+47-107=0$
Simplifying the left-hand side gives $8 a x^{2}-6 x-60=0$
Dividing both sides by 2 gives $4 a x^{2}-3 x-30=0$
We know that this equation is true for all values of $x \neq \frac{2}{a}$.
This means that the denominator $a x-2$ cannot be equal to zero, so $x \neq \frac{2}{a}$.
Therefore, we can divide both sides of the equation by $a x-2$.
Doing so gives $24 x^{2}+25 x-47=-8 x^{2}-3(a x-2)-53$
Simplifying the right-hand side gives $24 x^{2}+25 x-47=-8 x^{2}-3 a x+47$
Rearranging the terms gives $8 x^{2}+3 a x-94=0$
We know that this equation is true for all values of $x \neq \frac{2}{a}$.
This means that the discriminant of the equation must be non-negative.
Therefore, $(3 a)^{2}-4(8)(-94) \geq 0$
Simplifying the left-hand side gives $9 a^{2}+3008 \geq 0$
This inequality is true for all values of $a$ except $a=0$.
Therefore, $a$ cannot be equal to zero.
The only answer choice that satisfies both conditions is $a=\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ 16}$.
