Question: Alan drives an average of 100 miles each week. His car can travel an average of 25 miles per gallon of gasoline. Alan would like to reduce his weekly expenditure on gasoline by $\$ 5$. Assuming gasoline costs $\$ 4$ per gallon, which equation can Alan use to determine how many fewer average miles, $m$, he should drive each week?
Choices:
  A: $\frac{25}{4} m=95$
  B: $\frac{25}{4} m=5$
  C: $\frac{4}{25} m=95$
  D: $\frac{4}{25} m=5$

Thought:
Alan drives an average of 100 miles each week.
His car can travel an average of 25 miles per gallon of gasoline.
Gasoline costs $\$ 4$ per gallon.
Alan would like to reduce his weekly expenditure on gasoline by $\$ 5$.
Action: 
Let $x$ be the number of gallons of gasoline Alan uses each week.
Then, the cost of gasoline Alan uses each week is $4x$ dollars.
If Alan drives $m$ fewer miles each week, he will use $\frac{100-m}{25}$ fewer gallons of gasoline each week.
So, the cost of gasoline Alan uses each week after driving $m$ fewer miles is $4\left(x-\frac{4}{25}(100-m)\right)$ dollars.
Alan would like to reduce his weekly expenditure on gasoline by $\$ 5$.
So, we have the equation $4x-4\left(x-\frac{4}{25}(100-m)\right)=5$.
Simplifying the equation, we get $\frac{4}{25}m=5$.
Action: Answer("D")
