## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Question: The volume of right circular cylinder A is 22 cubic centimeters. What is the volume, in cubic centimeters, of a right circular cylinder with twice the radius and half the height of cylinder A?
Choices:
  A: 11
  B: 22
  C: 44
  D: 66
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The formula for the volume of a cylinder is V = πr^2h, where r is the radius and h is the height.
If cylinder A has a volume of 22 cubic centimeters, then we know that πr^2h = 22.
If cylinder B has twice the radius and half the height of cylinder A, then its volume can be calculated as V = π(2r)^2(h/2) = 4πr^2(h/2) = 2πr^2h.
Action: 
Substituting πr^2h = 22 into the expression for the volume of cylinder B, we get V = 2πr^2h = 2(22π) = 44.
Answer: Answer("C")
