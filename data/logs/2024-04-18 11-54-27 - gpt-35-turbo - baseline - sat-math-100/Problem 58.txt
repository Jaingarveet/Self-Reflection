# Model: gpt-35-turbo | Agent: baseline | Exam: sat-math-100 | Problem 58 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: $$\begin{aligned}& y<-x+a \\& y>x+b\end{aligned}$$In the $x y$-plane, if $(0,0)$ is a solution to the system of inequalities above, which of the following relationships between $a$ and $b$ must be true?
Choices:
  A: $a>b$
  B: $b>a$
  C: $|a|>|b|$
  D: $a=-b$
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Substituting $(0,0)$ into the system of inequalities, we get $0<-x+a$ and $0>x+b$. This means $a>0$ and $b<0$.
The slope of the line $y=-x+a$ is $-1$, and the slope of the line $y=x+b$ is $1$. Therefore, the region that satisfies both inequalities is the region between the two lines, as shown in the graph below.

The point $(0,0)$ is in the shaded region, which means $a$ is greater than the $y$-intercept of the red line and $b$ is less than the $y$-intercept of the blue line.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
