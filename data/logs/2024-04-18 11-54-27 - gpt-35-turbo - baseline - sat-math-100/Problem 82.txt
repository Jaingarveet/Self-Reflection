## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Topic: Math
Question: $$y=a(x-2)(x+4)$$In the quadratic equation above, $a$ is a nonzero constant. The graph of the equation in the $x y$-plane is a parabola with vertex $(c, d)$. Which of the following is equal to $d$ ?
Choices:
  A: $-9 a$
  B: $-8 a$
  C: $-5 a$
  D: $-2 a$
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The vertex form of a quadratic equation is given by $y=a(x-h)^2+k$, where $(h,k)$ is the vertex of the parabola.
We can rewrite the given equation in vertex form by completing the square.
$$y=a(x^2+2x(-2)+(-2)^2-(-2)^2-4x+8)$$
$$y=a(x-2)^2-8a$$
Thus, the vertex of the parabola is $(2,-8a)$.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
