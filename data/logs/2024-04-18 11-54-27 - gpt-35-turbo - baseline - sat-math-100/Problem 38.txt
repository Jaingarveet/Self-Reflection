## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: Which of the following is equal to $a^{\frac{2}{3}}$, for all values of $a$ ?
Choices:
  A: $\sqrt{a^{\frac{1}{3}}}$
  B: $\sqrt{a^{3}}$
  C: $\sqrt[3]{a^{\frac{1}{2}}}$
  D: $\sqrt[3]{a^{2}}$
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
We can write $a^{\frac{2}{3}}$ as $(a^{\frac{1}{3}})^2$. 
Option A is equal to $\sqrt{a^{\frac{1}{3}}}$, which is the square root of $a^{\frac{1}{3}}$ and not equal to $(a^{\frac{1}{3}})^2$.
Option B is equal to $\sqrt{a^3}$, which is $a^{\frac{3}{2}}$ and not equal to $(a^{\frac{1}{3}})^2$.
Option C is equal to $\sqrt[3]{a^{\frac{1}{2}}}$, which is $a^{\frac{1}{6}}$ and not equal to $(a^{\frac{1}{3}})^2$.
Option D is equal to $\sqrt[3]{a^{2}}$, which is $(a^{\frac{2}{3}})^{\frac{3}{2}}$ and equal to $(a^{\frac{1}{3}})^2$.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
