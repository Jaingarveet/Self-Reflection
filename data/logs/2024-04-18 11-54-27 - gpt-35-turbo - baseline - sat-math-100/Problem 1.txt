Question: $$h=-16 t^{2}+v t+k$$The equation above gives the height $h$, in feet, of a ball $t$ seconds after it is thrown straight up with an initial speed of $v$ feet per second from a height of $k$ feet. Which of the following gives $v$ in terms of $h, t$, and $k$ ?
Choices:
  A: $v=h+k-16 t$
  B: $v=\frac{h-k+16}{t}$
  C: $v=\frac{h+k}{t}-16 t$
  D: $v=\frac{h-k}{t}+16 t$
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
To solve for $v$, we need to isolate it in the given equation.
Action: 
Rearranging the given equation, we get:
$$h=k+v t-16 t^{2}$$
$$16 t^{2}-v t+(h-k)=0$$
Using the quadratic formula, we get:
$$t=\frac{-(-v)\pm \sqrt{(-v)^{2}-4(16)(h-k)}}{2(16)}$$
Simplifying the expression under the square root:
$$(-v)^{2}-4(16)(h-k)=v^{2}-1024h+1024k$$
Substituting the value of $t$ in the original equation:
$$h=k+v\left(\frac{-v\pm \sqrt{v^{2}-1024h+1024k}}{32}\right)$$
Simplifying the expression inside the parenthesis:
$$\frac{-v\pm \sqrt{v^{2}-1024h+1024k}}{32}=\frac{1}{v}\left(-\frac{v^{2}}{32}\pm \frac{\sqrt{v^{2}-1024h+1024k}}{32}\right)$$
Substituting this value of $t$ in the equation derived from the original equation:
$$h=k-\frac{v^{2}}{32}\pm \frac{v}{32}\sqrt{v^{2}-1024h+1024k}$$
Simplifying the expression inside the square root:
$$v^{4}-64(v^{2})(h-k)+1024(h-k)^{2}=v^{4}-64hv^{2}+1024k^{2}$$
Simplifying the equation:
$$64hv^{2}=1024k^{2}+64(k-h)(h-k)$$
$$v^{2}=\frac{1024k^{2}+64(k-h)(h-k)}{64h}$$
$$v^{2}=16k^{2}+\frac{(h-k)(k-h)}{h}$$
Taking the square root of both sides:
$$v=\sqrt{16k^{2}+\frac{(h-k)(k-h)}{h}}$$
Simplifying the expression:
$$v=\sqrt{16k^{2}+\frac{h^{2}-2hk+k^{2}}{h}}$$
$$v=\sqrt{\frac{16k^{2}h+h^{2}-2hk+k^{2}}{h}}$$
$$v=\sqrt{\frac{(4h-k)^{2}}{h}}$$
$$v=\frac{4h-k}{\sqrt{h}}$$
Action: Answer("D")
