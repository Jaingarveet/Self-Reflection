## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: If $\frac{x-1}{3}=k$ and $k=3$, what is the value of $x ?$
Choices:
  A: 2
  B: 4
  C: 9
  D: 10
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
We can solve for $x$ by substituting $k=3$ into the first equation and solving for $x$.
Action: 
Substituting $k=3$ into $\frac{x-1}{3}=k$, we get $\frac{x-1}{3}=3$. Multiplying both sides by 3, we get $x-1=9$. Adding 1 to both sides, we get $x=10$.
