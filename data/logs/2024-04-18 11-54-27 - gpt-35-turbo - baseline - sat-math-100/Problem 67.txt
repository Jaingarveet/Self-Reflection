## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Topic: Math
Question: Which of the following is an equation of a circle in the $x y$-plane with center $(0,4)$ and a radius with endpoint $\left(\frac{4}{3}, 5\right) ?$
Choices:
  A: $x^{2}+(y-4)^{2}=\frac{25}{9}$
  B: $x^{2}+(y+4)^{2}=\frac{25}{9}$
  C: $x^{2}+(y-4)^{2}=\frac{5}{3}$
  D: $x^{2}+(y+4)^{2}=\frac{3}{5}$
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The center of the circle is $(0,4)$, so the equation of the circle is of the form $x^2+(y-4)^2=r^2$, where $r$ is the radius of the circle.
The radius has endpoint $\left(\frac{4}{3}, 5\right)$, so its length is the distance between $(0,4)$ and $\left(\frac{4}{3}, 5\right)$.
Use the distance formula to find the length of the radius.
Action: Answer("A")
