## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: $$\begin{aligned}& 2 x-3 y=-14 \\& 3 x-2 y=-6\end{aligned}$$If $(x, y)$ is a solution to the system of equations above, what is the value of $x-y$ ?
Choices:
  A: -20
  B: $\quad-8$
  C: -4
  D: 8
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
We can solve the system of equations using elimination or substitution method to find the values of $x$ and $y$. Once we have the values of $x$ and $y$, we can find the value of $x-y$.
Action: 
Elimination method:
Multiplying the first equation by $2$ and the second equation by $3$, we get:
$$\begin{aligned}& 4x-6y=-28 \\& 9x-6y=-18\end{aligned}$$
Subtracting the second equation from the first, we get:
$$\begin{aligned} -5x &= -10 \\ x &= 2 \end{aligned}$$
Substituting $x=2$ in the second equation, we get:
$$\begin{aligned} 3(2)-2y &= -6 \\ -2y &= -12 \\ y &= 6 \end{aligned}$$
Therefore, $x-y=2-6=-4$.
Answer: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
