Question: In planning maintenance for a city's infrastructure, a civil engineer estimates that, starting from the present, the population of the city will decrease by 10 percent every 20 years. If the present population of the city is 50,000, which of the following expressions represents the engineer's estimate of the population of the city $t$ years from now?
Choices:
  A: $50,000(0.1)^{20 t}$
  B: $50,000(0.1)^{\frac{t}{20}}$
  C: $50,000(0.9)^{20 t}$
  D: $50,000(0.9)^{\frac{t}{20}}$
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The population of the city will decrease by 10% every 20 years.
If $t$ is the number of years from now, then the population will decrease by $\frac{t}{20}$ intervals of 10%.
The population will be multiplied by $(0.9)^{\frac{t}{20}}$.
The present population is 50,000.
Action: Answer("D")
