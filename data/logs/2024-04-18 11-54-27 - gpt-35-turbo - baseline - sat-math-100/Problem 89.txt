Context: $$.\begin{aligned}.& S(P)=\frac{1}{2} P+40 \\.& D(P)=220-P.\end{aligned}.$$.The quantity of a product supplied and the quantity of the product demanded in an economic market are functions of the price of the product. The functions above are the estimated supply and demand functions for a certain product. The function $S(P)$ gives the quantity of the product supplied to the market when the price is $P$ dollars, and the function $D(P)$ gives the quantity of the product demanded by the market when the price is $P$ dollars.
Question: Graphene, which is used in the manufacture of integrated circuits, is so thin that a sheet weighing one ounce can cover up to 7 football fields. If a football field has an area of approximately $1 \frac{1}{3}$ acres, about how many acres could 48 ounces of graphene cover?
Choices:
  A: 250
  B: 350
  C: 450
  D: 1,350
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
One ounce of graphene can cover 7 football fields.
One football field has an area of approximately $1 \frac{1}{3}$ acres.
To find the area covered by 48 ounces of graphene, we need to multiply the area of one ounce by 48 and then divide by the area of one football field.
Action: 
Area of one ounce of graphene = $7 \times 1 \frac{1}{3} = \frac{28}{3}$ acres
Area covered by 48 ounces of graphene = $\frac{28}{3} \times 48 \div 7 \approx 192$ acres
Answer: Answer("None of the Above") [The answer is not one of the given choices. The closest option is 250, but the correct answer is approximately 192 acres.]
## Result:
Agent Answer: N
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
