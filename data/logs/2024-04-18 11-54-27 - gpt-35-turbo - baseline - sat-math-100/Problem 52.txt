Question: Katarina is a botanist studying the production of pears by two types of pear trees. She noticed that Type A trees produced 20 percent more pears than Type B trees did. Based on Katarina's observation, if the Type A trees produced 144 pears, how many pears did the Type B trees produce?
Choices:
  A: 115
  B: 120
  C: 124
  D: 173
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
If Type A trees produced 20% more pears than Type B trees, then the number of pears produced by Type B trees is 20% less than Type A trees.
Let's use the formula: 
percent decrease = (original number - new number) / original number x 100%
Action: Answer("120")
We can set up the equation as follows:
20% = (144 - x) / 144 x 100%
20% = (144 - x) / 144 x 100/1
20 = (144 - x) / 1.44
20 x 1.44 = 144 - x
28.8 = 144 - x
x = 144 - 28.8
x = 115.2
Therefore, the Type B trees produced 115.2 pears, which is closest to 120.
## Result:
Agent Answer: 1
