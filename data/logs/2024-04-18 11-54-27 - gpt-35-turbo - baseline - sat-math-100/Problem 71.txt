## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: Survey Results\begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|l|c|}\hlineAnswer & Percent \\\hlineNever & $31.3 \%$ \\\hlineRarely & $24.3 \%$ \\\hlineOften & $13.5 \%$ \\\hlineAlways & $30.9 \%$ \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}The table above shows the results of a survey in which tablet users were asked how often they would watch video advertisements in order to access streaming content for free. Based on the table, which of the following is closest to the probability that a tablet user answered "Always," given that the tablet user did not answer "Never"?
Choices:
  A: 0.31
  B: 0.38
  C: 0.45
  D: 0.69
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
We need to find the probability that a tablet user answered "Always," given that the tablet user did not answer "Never."
We can use the formula for conditional probability: $P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}$, where $A$ and $B$ are events.
Let $A$ be the event that a tablet user answered "Always" and $B$ be the event that a tablet user did not answer "Never."
We can find $P(A \cap B)$ and $P(B)$ from the table.
Action: 
$P(A \cap B) = 30.9 \%$
$P(B) = 100 \% - 31.3 \% = 68.7 \%$
$P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} = \frac{30.9}{68.7} \approx 0.45$
Answer: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
