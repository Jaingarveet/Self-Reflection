## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Context: $$.\begin{aligned}.& S(P)=\frac{1}{2} P+40 \\.& D(P)=220-P.\end{aligned}.$$.The quantity of a product supplied and the quantity of the product demanded in an economic market are functions of the price of the product. The functions above are the estimated supply and demand functions for a certain product. The function $S(P)$ gives the quantity of the product supplied to the market when the price is $P$ dollars, and the function $D(P)$ gives the quantity of the product demanded by the market when the price is $P$ dollars.
Question: At what price will the quantity of the product supplied to the market equal the quantity of the product demanded by the market?
Choices:
  A: $\$ 90$
  B: $\$ 120$
  C: $\$ 133$
  D: $\$ 155$
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
We are given the supply function $S(P) = \frac{1}{2} P + 40$ and the demand function $D(P) = 220 - P$.
To find the price at which the quantity of the product supplied equals the quantity of the product demanded, we set the two functions equal to each other:
$S(P) = D(P)$
$\frac{1}{2} P + 40 = 220 - P$
$P = 120$
## Assistant 2:
  My apologies, I made a mistake in my previous response.
The correct answer is indeed B: $\$ 120$.

Here's my reflection on the problem and the correct answer:

1. What did I do correctly?
I correctly identified the supply and demand functions and set them equal to each other to find the equilibrium price.
2. What did I do incorrectly?
I made a mistake in my calculation and got $\frac{1}{2} P + 40 = 220 - P$ instead of $P = 120$.
3. What did I learn from this mistake?
I learned that I need to be more careful in my calculations and make sure I'm solving the equation correctly.
4. How will I prevent this mistake in the future?
I will double-check my calculations and make sure I'm using the correct formulas and equations.
5. What is the correct answer and why?
The correct answer is B: $\$ 120$. At this price, the quantity of the product supplied equals the quantity of the product demanded.

Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
