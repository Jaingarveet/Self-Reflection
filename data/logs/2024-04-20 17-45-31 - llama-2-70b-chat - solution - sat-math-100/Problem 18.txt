## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: Which of the following is equivalent to $9^{\frac{3}{4}}$ ?
Choices:
  A: $\sqrt[3]{9}$
  B: $\sqrt[4]{9}$
  C: $\sqrt{3}$
  D: $3 \sqrt{3}$
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
$9^{\frac{3}{4}}$ can be expressed as $3\sqrt{3}$ since $\frac{3}{4}$ is equal to $\frac{3}{3}$.
## Assistant 2:
  Action: Answer("D")

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, choosing option A.
Upon reflection, I realized that $9^{\frac{3}{4}}$ can be simplified by recognizing that $\frac{3}{4}$ is equal to $\frac{3}{3}$, which gives us $3\sqrt{3}$.
Therefore, the correct answer is option D: $3\sqrt{3}$.
I will make sure to carefully consider the given choices and reflect on my solution to avoid similar mistakes in the future.
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
