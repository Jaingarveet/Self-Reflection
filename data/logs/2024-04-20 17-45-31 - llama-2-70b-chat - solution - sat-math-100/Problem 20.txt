## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: $$\begin{aligned}& 2.4 x-1.5 y=0.3 \\& 1.6 x+0.5 y=-1.3\end{aligned}$$The system of equations above is graphed in the $x y$-plane. What is the $x$-coordinate of the intersection point $(x, y)$ of the system?
Choices:
  A: -0.5
  B: -0.25
  C: 0.8
  D: 1.75
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
We can solve the system of equations by substitution or elimination.
By substitution, we have:
$$\begin{aligned}
2.4 x - 1.5 y &= 0.3 \\
1.6 x + 0.5 y &= -1.3
\end{aligned}$$
Substituting the second equation into the first equation, we get:
$$2.4 x - 1.5(1.6 x + 0.5 y) = 0.3$$
Expanding and simplifying, we get:
$$2.4 x - 2.4 x - [REDACTED] y = 0.3$$
$$-[REDACTED] y = -2.1$$
$$y = 2.625$$
Now, substituting $y = 2.625$ into one of the original equations, we get:
$$1.6 x + 0.5(2.625) = -1.3$$
$$1.6 x + 1.3125 = -1.3$$
$$1.6 x = -2.6125$$
$$x = -1.695$$
Therefore, the $x$-coordinate of the intersection point is -1.695.
