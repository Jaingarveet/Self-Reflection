## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: $$C=\frac{5}{9}(F-32)$$The equation above shows how a temperature $F$, measured in degrees Fahrenheit, relates to a temperature $C$, measured in degrees Celsius. Based on the equation, which of the following must be true?I. A temperature increase of 1 degree Fahrenheit is equivalent to a temperature increase of $\frac{5}{9}$ degree Celsius.II. A temperature increase of 1 degree Celsius is equivalent to a temperature increase of 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit.III. A temperature increase of $\frac{5}{9}$ degree Fahrenheit is equivalent to a temperature increase of 1 degree Celsius.
Choices:
  A: I only
  B: II only
  C: III only
  D: I and II only

## Assistant 2:
  Sure, I'll do my best to answer the question based on my reflection.

From my previous attempt, I realized that I misunderstood the equation and mistook the Celsius temperature for the Fahrenheit temperature.

The equation is:
C = (F - 32) / 9

From this equation, we can see that:

I. A temperature increase of 1 degree Fahrenheit is equivalent to a temperature increase of $\frac{5}{9}$ degree Celsius.

This means that choice A is correct.

However, we can also see that:

II. A temperature increase of 1 degree Celsius is equivalent to a temperature increase of 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit.

This means that choice B is also correct.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

D: I and II only

I hope this answer is correct. Please let me know if there's anything else I can help with.
## Result:
Agent Answer: None
Correct Answer: D
