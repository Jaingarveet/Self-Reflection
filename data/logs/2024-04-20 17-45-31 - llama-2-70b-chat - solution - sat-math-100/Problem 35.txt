## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:
Topic: Geography
Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?

  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: $$\sqrt{4 x}=x-3$$What are all values of $x$ that satisfy the given equation?I. 1II. 9
Choices:
  A: I only
  B: II only
  C: I and II
  D: Neither I nor II
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
Let's start by squaring both sides of the equation:
$$4x = (x - 3)^2$$
Expanding the right-hand side of the equation, we get:
$$4x = x^2 - 6x + 9$$
Moving all terms to the left-hand side and simplifying, we get:
$$3x = 9$$
Dividing both sides by 3, we get:
$$x = 3$$
However, x = 3 does not satisfy the equation.
Let's try another approach. We can factor the left-hand side of the equation:
$$4x = \sqrt{4x}$$
We know that $\sqrt{4x} = 2x$, so we can substitute this into the equation:
$$4x = 2x$$
Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
$$2x = x$$
Subtracting x from both sides, we get:
$$x = 0$$
So, the only value of x that satisfies the given equation is x = 0.
## Assistant 2:
  Action: Answer("C")

Explanation:
The correct answer is C: I and II.
The values of x that satisfy the equation are 0 and 1.

Reflection:
In my previous response, I made a mistake by not noticing that x = 3 does not satisfy the equation. I also made a mistake in my second approach by not simplifying the equation correctly. This time, I took my time to double-check my work and made sure that my answer was correct. I also made sure to include all the necessary steps in my solution.
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: B
