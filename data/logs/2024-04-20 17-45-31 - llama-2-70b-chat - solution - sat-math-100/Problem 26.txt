## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: $$\begin{aligned}& 3 x^{2}-5 x+2 \\& 5 x^{2}-2 x-6\end{aligned}$$Which of the following is the sum of the two polynomials shown above?
Choices:
  A: $8 x^{2}-7 x-4$
  B: $8 x^{2}+7 x-4$
  C: $8 x^{4}-7 x^{2}-4$
  D: $8 x^{4}+7 x^{2}-4$
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
First polynomial: 3x^2 - 5x + 2
Second polynomial: 5x^2 - 2x - 6

1. Add the corresponding terms:
3x^2 + 5x^2 = 8x^2
-5x + 2x = -3x
2 + (-6) = -4

2. Combine like terms:
8x^2 - 3x - 4
## Assistant 2:
  Action: Answer("B")

Explanation:
I reflected on my previous answer and realized that I made a mistake in combining the like terms. The correct answer is indeed $8 x^{2}+7 x-4$.

The first polynomial is $3 x^{2}-5 x+2$.
The second polynomial is $5 x^{2}-2 x-6$.
When adding the corresponding terms, we get:

$3 x^{2}+5 x^{2}=8 x^{2}$
$-5 x+2 x=-3 x$
$2+(-6)=-4$

Therefore, the sum of the two polynomials is $8 x^{2}-3 x-4$.

I apologize for my previous mistake and I'm confident that my new answer is correct.
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
