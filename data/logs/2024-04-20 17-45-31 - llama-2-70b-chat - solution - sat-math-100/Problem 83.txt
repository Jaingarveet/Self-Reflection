Which of the following sampling methods is most appropriate to estimate the proportion of all employees of the company who are satisfied with their job?
Choices:
  A: Selecting one of the 50 stores at random and then surveying each employee at that store
  B: Selecting 10 employees from each store at random and then surveying each employee selected
  C: Surveying the 25 highest-paid employees and the 25 lowest-paid employees

Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
To estimate the proportion of all employees of the company who are satisfied with their job, we need to select a sample that is representative of the population of all employees.
Option [REDACTED] is the best choice because it selects 10 employees from each store at random, which provides a more representative sample of the population.
## Assistant 2:
  Action: Answer("B")

Reflection:
Previously, I selected option A, which only surveys employees from one store, making it difficult to generalize the results to the entire population of employees.
However, option B selects 10 employees from each store at random, ensuring that the sample is more representative of the population.
Therefore, option B is the best choice.
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
