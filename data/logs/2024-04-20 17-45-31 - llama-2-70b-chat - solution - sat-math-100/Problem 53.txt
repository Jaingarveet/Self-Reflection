## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:

Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: A line in the $x y$-plane passes through the origin and has a slope of $\frac{1}{7}$. Which of the following points lies on the line?
Choices:
  A: $(0,7)$
  B: $(1,7)$
  C: $(7,7)$
  D: $(14,2)$
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
[REDACTED] line with a slope of $\frac{1}{7}$ and passes through the origin will have the equation $y = \frac{1}{7}x$.
We can substitute the coordinates of the given points into this equation to determine which point lies on the line.

* [REDACTED]: [REDACTED] - Substituting $x=0$ and $y=7$ into the equation, we get $7 = \frac{1}{7}(0) \cdot 7$, which is not true.
* [REDACTED]: [REDACTED] - Substituting $x=1$ and $y=7$ into the equation, we get $7 = \frac{1}{7}(1) \cdot 7$, which is true.
* [REDACTED]: [REDACTED] - Substituting $x=7$ and $y=7$ into the equation, we get $7 = \frac{1}{7}(7) \cdot 7$, which is not true.
* [REDACTED]: [REDACTED] - Substituting $x=14$ and $y=2$ into the equation, we get $2 = \frac{1}{7}(14) \cdot 2$, which is true.

Therefore, the point that lies on the line is [REDACTED].
