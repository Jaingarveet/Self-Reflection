## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:
Topic: Geography
Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: If $\frac{5}{x}=\frac{15}{x+20}$, what is the value of $\frac{x}{5} ?$
Choices:
  A: 10
  B: 5
  C: 2
  D: $\frac{1}{2}$
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:

$$\frac{[REDACTED]}{x} = \frac{1[REDACTED]}{x+[REDACTED]0}$$

$$[REDACTED]x = 1[REDACTED](x+[REDACTED]0)$$

$$[REDACTED]x = 1[REDACTED]x + 300$$

$$x = 300$$
## Assistant 2:
  I apologize for my previous mistake. Let's try to solve this question again.

We are given the equation:

$$\frac{5}{x} = \frac{15}{x+20}$$

We can start by cross-multiplying:

$$\frac{5x}{x+20} = 15$$

Now, we can simplify:

$$5x = 15(x+20)$$

Expanding the right-hand side, we get:

$$5x = 15x + 300$$

Subtracting 15x from both sides gives us:

$$-10x = 300$$

Dividing both sides by -10, we get:

$$x = -30$$

However, this cannot be the correct answer since the choices are all positive numbers. Therefore, we can conclude that the given equation has no solution.

Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: C
