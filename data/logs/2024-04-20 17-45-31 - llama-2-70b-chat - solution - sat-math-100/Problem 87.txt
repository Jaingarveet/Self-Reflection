Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
The parabola and the line intersect at two points, so we can find the x-coordinates of these points by setting the equations equal to each other and solving for x.

$y = (x - 11)^2$
$y = 25$

$ (x - 11)^2 = 25$
$x - 11 = ±√25$
$x = 11 ± √25$

Now we can find the distance between the two points:

$A[REDACTED] = √((11 + √25) - (11 - √25))^2$
$A[REDACTED] = √(2(11 + √25)) = 2(11 + √25)$

$A[REDACTED] = 2(11) + 2(√25) = 22 + 2(5√5) = 22 + [REDACTED]√5$

$A[REDACTED] = 22 + [REDACTED]√5 = [REDACTED](2 + 5√5)$

$A[REDACTED] = [REDACTED](2 + 5√5) = [REDACTED](7) = 70$
## Assistant 2:
  Action: Answer("B")

Explanation:
The length of $\overline{A B}$ can be found by using the distance formula, which is given by:

distance = $\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$

In this case, we have:

$x_1 = 11 + √25$
$x_2 = 11 - √25$
$y_1 = 25$
$y_2 = 25$

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

distance = $\sqrt{(11 + √25 - 11 + √25)^2 + (25 - 25)^2}$
= $\sqrt{2(11 + √25)^2}$
= $\sqrt{2(22 + 2(5√5))}$
= $\sqrt{2(22 + 10√5)}$
= $\sqrt{44 + 20√5}$

Since the choices are given as integers, we can simplify the expression further:

distance = $\sqrt{44 + 20√5} \approx 12$

Therefore, the length of $\overline{A B}$ is approximately 12 units. The correct answer is (B) 12.
