# Model: llama-2-70b-chat | Agent: solution | Exam: sat-math-100 | Problem 41 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: \begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}\hline$x$ & $f(x)$ \\\hline0 & 3 \\\hline2 & 1 \\\hline4 & 0 \\\hline5 & -2 \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}The function $f$ is defined by a polynomial. Some values of $x$ and $f(x)$ are shown in the table above. Which of the following must be a factor of $f(x)$ ?
Choices:
  A: $x-2$
  B: $x-3$
  C: $x-4$
  D: $x-5$
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
The given table shows some values of $x$ and $f(x)$.
We can observe that $f(x)$ is a polynomial function of degree $3$.
The factors of a polynomial of degree $3$ are binomials of the form $(x-a)$, where $a$ is a constant.
We can compare the given choices with the values in the table to find the factor of $f(x)$.

The correct answer is $C$, [REDACTED], because $f(x)$ has a zero at $x=4$.
