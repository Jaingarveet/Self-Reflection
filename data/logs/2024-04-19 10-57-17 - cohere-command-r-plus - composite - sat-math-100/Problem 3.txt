# Model: cohere-command-r-plus | Agent: composite | Exam: sat-math-100 | Problem 3 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:
Topic: Geography
Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore

Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: If $\frac{3}{5} w=\frac{4}{3}$, what is the value of $w ?$
Choices:
  A: $\frac{9}{20}$
  B: $\frac{4}{5}$
  C: $\frac{5}{4}$
  D: $\frac{20}{9}$

Explanation:
Error Keywords:
- Algebraic error
- Multiplication error
- Simplification error

Solution:

$$\frac{3}{5} w = \frac{4}{3}$$

To solve for $w$, we multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of $\frac{3}{5}$, which is $\frac{5}{3}$:

$$w = \frac{4}{3} \cdot \frac{5}{3} = \frac{20}{9}.$$

Therefore, the correct answer is $w = \frac{20}{9}$, which is choice [REDACTED]. 

Instructions:
1. Identify the given equation.
2. Recognize that you need to isolate $w$.
3. Multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of the coefficient of $w$.
4. Simplify the resulting expression step-by-step.
5. Choose the answer that matches your simplified result. 

Advice:
 - Always read and understand the given equation. 
 - Clearly identify the variable you need to solve for. 
 - Know the properties of fractions, including reciprocals and multiplication. 
 - Simplify expressions step-by-step, checking each step for accuracy. 
 - Double-check your final answer and ensure it satisfies the original equation.

Thought: 
To solve for $w$, we multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of $3/5$, which is $5/3$:

$$w = \frac{4}{3} \cdot \frac{5}{3} = \frac{20}{9}.$$

So, the value of $w$ is $20/9$.
Action: Answer("D")
