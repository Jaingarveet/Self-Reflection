Question: A television with a price of $\$ 300$ is to be purchased with an initial payment of $\$ 60$ and weekly payments of $\$ 30$. Which of the following equations can be used to find the number of weekly payments, $w$, required to complete the purchase, assuming there are no taxes or fees?
Choices:
  A: $300=30 w-60$
  B: $300=30 w$
  C: $300=30 w+60$
  D: $300=60 w-30$

Explanation:
Error Keywords:
- Equation formation
- Sign error
- Algebraic manipulation

Solution:

Given: 
- Total cost of television ($T$) = $\$300$
- Initial payment ($I$) = $\$60$
- Weekly payment ($P$) = $\$30$
- Number of weekly payments ($w$) is what we need to find. 

We know that the total cost of the television is the sum of the initial payment and the weekly payments multiplied by the number of weeks: 
$T = I + P \times w$ 

Plugging in the values: 
$300 = 60 + 30w$ 

Now, we need to isolate $w$ to find the number of weekly payments. 

$240 = 30w$ 

Dividing both sides by $30$, we get: 
$w = 8$ 

Therefore, the correct equation is $300 = 60 + 30w$, which can be rearranged to $300 = 30w + 60$, choice [REDACTED]. 

Instructions:
1. Identify the given values: total cost, initial payment, weekly payment, and unknown number of weekly payments. 
2. Understand the relationship between these values: total cost equals initial payment plus weekly payments multiplied by the number of weeks. 
3. Form an equation using the given values and their relationship. 
4. Simplify the equation and isolate the unknown variable. 
5. Solve for the unknown variable to find the number of weekly payments. 
6. Compare the formed equation with the options provided to choose the correct answer. 

Advice:
 - Always identify the given values and the relationships between them. 
 - Form equations directly based on the relationships, ensuring that all values are accounted for correctly. 
 - Double-check that the formed equation aligns with the problem's context. 
 - Simplify and solve the equation step-by-step, checking each step for accuracy. 
 - Ensure you correctly isolate the unknown variable. 
 - Verify that your final answer makes sense in the context of the problem.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
To find the number of weekly payments, we need to consider the total cost of the television, the initial payment, and the weekly payment amount. 

The equation representing this situation is: 
Total cost = Initial payment + (Weekly payment x Number of weekly payments) 

Plugging in the values, we get: 
$300 = 60 + 30w$ 

Now, we can isolate $w$ to find the number of weekly payments: 
$240 = 30w$ 
$w = 8$ 

So, the correct equation is $300 = 60 + 30w$, which can be rearranged to $300 = 30w + 60$.

Choice C is the correct answer.
