## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:

Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")

Topic: Math
Context: $$.a=1,052+1.08 t.$$.The speed of a sound wave in air depends on the air temperature. The formula above shows the relationship between $a$, the speed of a sound wave, in feet per second, and $t$, the air temperature, in degrees Fahrenheit $\left({ }^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\right)$.
Question: At which of the following air temperatures will the speed of a sound wave be closest to 1,000 feet per second?
Choices:
  A: $-46^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$
  B: $-48^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$
  C: $-49^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$
  D: $-50^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$

Explanation:
Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation
- Calculation error
- Approximation error

Solution: We are looking for the value of $t$ that makes $a$ closest to $1,000$. Let's plug in the given values and solve:

$$1,000=1,052+1.08 t$$

Subtract $1,052$ from both sides:

$$-52=1.08 t$$

Divide both sides by $1.08$ to solve for $t$:

$$t \approx -48.15$$

Given the choices, [REDACTED] is the closest value to $-48.15^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$.

Solution:
Instructions:
1. Understand the relationship between the speed of sound and air temperature.
2. Recognize that we are looking for an approximate value, not an exact match.
3. Plug in the given values and solve for $t$.
4. Compare each answer choice to the calculated value of $t$ and choose the closest match.

Advice:
- Pay close attention to the specific values and units provided in the question.
- Understand the difference between finding an exact match and finding the closest value.
- Practice solving equations and approximating values.
- Always double-check your calculations and interpretations.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
We want to find the value of $t$ that makes $a$ closest to $1,000$.

$1,000 = 1,052 + 1.08t$
$-52 = 1.08t$
$t \approx -48.15$

Out of the given choices, $-48^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$ is the closest to $-48.15^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
