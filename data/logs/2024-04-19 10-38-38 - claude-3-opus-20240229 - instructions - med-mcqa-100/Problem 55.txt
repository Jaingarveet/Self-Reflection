## System:
You are an expert in Medicine.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Instructions:
1. Carefully assess the location and extent of disease to determine the lung cancer stage.
2. Consider surgery as the primary treatment if the tumor is localized to the lung without distant metastases.
3. Remember that separate tumor nodules in the same lung may still be resectable and should not automatically rule out surgery.
4. Evaluate the patient's overall health and lung function to determine if they can tolerate surgery.
5. Recommend adjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiation after surgery to reduce recurrence risk.
## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The patient has a 5x5 cm primary tumor in the right upper lobe and a separate 2x2 cm tumor nodule in the right middle lobe. There is no mention of lymph node involvement or distant metastases.
2. Separate tumor nodules in the same lung (different lobes) is classified as T4 disease. However, in the absence of lymph node involvement (N0) and metastases (M0), this is still considered stage IIIA non-small cell lung cancer.
3. For stage IIIA NSCLC, surgery is often the primary treatment modality if the disease is resectable and the patient can tolerate the operation. The presence of the second tumor nodule in this case does not automatically rule out surgery.
4. The patient's age (60 years) does not preclude surgery, assuming he has adequate lung function and no major comorbidities that would significantly increase surgical risk. More information would be needed to fully assess his fitness for surgery.
5. If the patient undergoes complete resection of both tumor nodules, adjuvant chemotherapy would be recommended to reduce the risk of recurrence. Post-operative radiation may also be considered.
Therefore, assuming the patient is medically fit for surgery, the primary treatment modality in this case would be surgical resection of both the primary tumor and the separate tumor nodule, likely followed by adjuvant chemotherapy +/- radiation.
