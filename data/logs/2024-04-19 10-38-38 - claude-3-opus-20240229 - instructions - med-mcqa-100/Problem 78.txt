  A: Opposite side of the facial artery
  B: Transverse facial artery
  C: Anastomosis with Infra orbital artery
  D: Branch of the ophthalmic artery
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Identify the origin of the facial artery (external carotid).
2. Trace the course of the facial artery along the face.
3. Identify the named branches of the facial artery.
4. Follow the terminal branch of the facial artery (angular artery).
5. Determine what the angular artery anastomoses with at its terminal end.
6. Identify the origin of the artery that the angular artery anastomoses with (ophthalmic artery from internal carotid).
## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The facial artery originates from the external carotid artery.
2. It courses along the side of the face, deep to the platysma muscle, and along the side of the nose. 
3. Named branches of the facial artery include the superior and inferior labial arteries, lateral nasal artery, and angular artery.
4. The terminal branch of the facial artery is the angular artery, which courses along the side of the nose up to the medial corner of the eye.
5. At its terminal end near the medial corner of the eye, the angular artery anastomoses with a branch of the ophthalmic artery. 
6. The ophthalmic artery originates from the internal carotid artery, which is a terminal branch of the common carotid artery.
Therefore, the facial artery terminates by anastomosing with a branch of the ophthalmic artery, which originates from the internal carotid artery.
Action: Answer("D")
