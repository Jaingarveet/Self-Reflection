## System:
You are an expert in Medicine.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:

  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")

Question: In anaerobic glycolysis, end product is -
Choices:
  A: 2 ATP + 2 NAD
  B: 2 ATP
  C: 2 ATP + 2 NADH
  D: 4 ATP + 2 FADH2
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Identify the metabolic pathway in question (glycolysis).
2. Determine whether the conditions are aerobic or anaerobic.
3. Recall the net production of ATP in glycolysis ([REDACTED]).
4. Identify the steps in glycolysis where NAD+ is reduced to NADH.
5. In anaerobic conditions, remember that NADH must be oxidized back to NAD+ to continue glycolysis.
6. Recognize that the oxidation of NADH to NAD+ is coupled with the reduction of pyruvate to lactate.
7. Conclude that the end products in anaerobic glycolysis are [REDACTED] and 2 NAD+.
## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The question is asking about anaerobic glycolysis specifically.
2. Glycolysis is a metabolic pathway that breaks down glucose and produces pyruvate. It occurs in the cytoplasm of the cell.
3. In glycolysis, glucose is converted to pyruvate through a series of enzymatic reactions. This process produces a net of 2 ATP molecules.
4. During glycolysis, NAD+ is reduced to NADH at the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase step. 
5. Under anaerobic conditions, the NADH produced must be oxidized back to NAD+ in order for glycolysis to continue, since NAD+ is required as an electron acceptor. 
6. To regenerate NAD+, NADH reduces pyruvate to lactate via the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase. This allows glycolysis to proceed in the absence of oxygen.
7. Therefore, in anaerobic glycolysis, the end products are 2 ATP molecules and 2 molecules of NADH which get oxidized back to NAD+.
Action: Answer("C")
