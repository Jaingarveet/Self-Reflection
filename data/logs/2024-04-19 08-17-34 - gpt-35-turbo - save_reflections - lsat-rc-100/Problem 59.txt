## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I incorrectly answered that the test case strategy developed by Marshall was necessary. However, the passage does not explicitly state that the author views the strategy as necessary. Instead, the passage describes the strategy as "meticulously crafted and carefully coordinated" and "an innovation that forever changed the landscape of public interest law." These descriptions suggest that the author views the strategy as unprecedented. 
Error Keywords:
 - Misinterpretation
 - Inference error
 - Assumption error
Solution:
The author views the test case strategy developed by Marshall as unprecedented. The strategy was an innovation that changed the landscape of public interest law.
