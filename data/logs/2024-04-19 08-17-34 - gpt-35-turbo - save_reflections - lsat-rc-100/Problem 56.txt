## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I incorrectly chose answer choice C because I did not pay close attention to the context of the reference to railroads. The passage discusses how the Pin Factory concept was difficult to represent mathematically and how economists failed to bring it into the mainstream of economic thought. The reference to railroads is used to point to an industry that illustrates the shortcomings of economists' emphasis on the Invisible Hand. Railroads were an industry that was dominated by a few players, which is a result of increasing returns to scale. This domination of the industry by a few players is an example of the shortcomings of economists' emphasis on the Invisible Hand, which assumes that there are many competitors in each industry, so that nobody can exert monopoly power. 
Error Keywords:
