Explanation:
I misinterpreted the question and did not pay close attention to the details in the passage. 
The question asks which of the following would be most consistent with the ideas about identity that the author attributes to pre-contact Native American cultures. The author suggests that pre-contact Native American cultures had a markedly inclusive idea of self, which was not merely individual but also relational to a society, a specific landscape, and the cosmos. The expression of life experiences tended to be oriented toward current events, and autobiography was conveyed through various modes such as songs, chants, stories, and even the process whereby one repeatedly took on new names to reflect important events and deeds in one's life.

Option B is the most consistent with the ideas about identity that the author attributes to pre-contact Native American cultures.
