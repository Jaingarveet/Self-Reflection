## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I incorrectly chose answer choice D, which states that the size a business must reach in order to achieve increasing returns to scale varies widely from industry to industry. This answer choice does not undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power. 
The correct answer is E, which states that if a business has very specialized workers, any gains in productivity achieved by making workers even more specialized are offset by other factors such as higher training costs and increased turnover. This answer choice undermines the idea that increasing returns to scale always lead to greater efficiency and productivity. 
Error Keywords:
- Misunderstanding of the concept of increasing returns to scale
- Misapplication of the concept of increasing returns to scale
- Misinterpretation of the answer choices
