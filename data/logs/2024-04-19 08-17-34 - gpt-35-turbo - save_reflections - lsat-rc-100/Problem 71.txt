## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I incorrectly chose answer choice B because I misunderstood the argument made in Passage B. The author of Passage B is not arguing against the idea that behavior is orchestrated by genes, but rather against the idea that a particular interest (such as the proliferation of genes) can be inferred as the sole explanation for a particular behavior. 
Error Keywords:
 - Misunderstanding
 - Misinterpretation
 - Overgeneralization
Solution:
The author of Passage A argues that human behavior can be explained by examining how it contributes to the reproductive success of individuals exhibiting the behavior, and thereby to the proliferation of the genetic material responsible for causing that behavior. The author of Passage B criticizes the idea that a particular interest (such as the proliferation of genes) can be inferred as the sole explanation for a particular behavior. The author argues that there are often multiple interests that could explain any given behavior, and that not all motives can be instrumental.
