## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I did not read the passage carefully. I assumed that the passage was discussing the issue of most water customers in the city being late paying their water bills, but the passage only mentions that 231,000 water customers in the city are late paying their bills. 
Error Keywords:
 - Misreading
 - Assumption
 - Careless reading
Solution:
The passage mentions that 231,000 water customers in the city are late paying their bills. It also mentions that officials plan to target only high-income neighborhoods to make examples of a few privileged residents who will be in no position to complain since they were caught stiffing the system. The passage does not provide any information about the frequency of turning off the water of customers who were late paying their water bills.
