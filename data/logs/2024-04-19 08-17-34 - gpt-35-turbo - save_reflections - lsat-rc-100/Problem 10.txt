## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I incorrectly chose answer choice C, "contain receptor molecules," as the phrase "defined categories of neurons" is used in the context of designing drugs targeted to specific receptors on these neurons. However, the author is referring to neurons that influence particular brain functions. 
Error Keywords:
 - Misinterpretation
 - Contextual misunderstanding
 - Logical error
Solution:
The author uses the phrase "defined categories of neurons" in lines 55-56 to refer to neurons that influence particular brain functions. The author mentions that as the precise effect on behavior of every variety of each neurotransmitter-gated ion channel is deciphered, pharmacologists may be able to design drugs targeted to specific receptors on defined categories of neurons that will selectively impede or enhance these effects. Therefore, the phrase "defined categories of neurons" refers to neurons that have a specific function or influence on behavior.
