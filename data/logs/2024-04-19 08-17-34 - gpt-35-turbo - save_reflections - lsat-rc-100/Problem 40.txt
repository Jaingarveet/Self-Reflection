Explanation:
I misinterpreted the structural analogy between Jazz and Duke Ellington's compositional style.

 - Structural analogy
 - Compositional style
Solution:
The passage discusses how Toni Morrison used jazz as the structuring principle for her novel Jazz. The narration of the novel is similar to the playing of a jazz hand, where individual musicians' improvisations are performed within the composer's frame. The narrator of Jazz is both generous with the characters' voices and protective of his or her mastery over the narrative as a whole. The central characters are given the responsibility of relating their parts of the overarching story, but their sections are set off by quotation marks, reminders that the narrator is allowing them to speak. The structural analogy between Jazz and Duke Ellington's compositional style involves more than simply the technique of shifting between first-person and third-person narrators.
