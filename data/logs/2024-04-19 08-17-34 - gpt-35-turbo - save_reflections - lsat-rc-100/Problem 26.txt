## Get Reflection:
Reflection:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misinterpreted the main idea of the passage. I focused too much on the economic principle and did not pay enough attention to the overall organization of the passage. 
Error Keywords:
 - Misinterpretation
 - Focusing on details instead of the big picture
 - Lack of attention to the overall organization
Solution:
The passage describes two sides of a debate on how to deter deliberate crimes, and then introduces an economic principle to reconcile the two positions. The economic principle is used to analyze the decision to commit a crime as a rational economic choice, and to show that the two deterrence methods have the same overall effect. Therefore, the most accurate description of the organization of the passage is that two sides of a debate are described and a general principle is used to resolve the conflict between them.

1. Read the passage carefully and pay attention to the overall organization.
2. Identify the main idea of the passage.
3. Look for the key points that support the main idea.
4. Eliminate answer choices that do not accurately reflect the main idea and organization of the passage.
