## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I did not fully understand the argument presented in Passage A. While I recognized that Passage A discussed the technique of discretionary nonenforcement, I did not fully grasp its implications for the plan described in Passage B. 
Error Keywords:
 - Misunderstanding
 - Failure to grasp implications
 - Insufficient knowledge
Solution:
The author of Passage A argues that discretionary nonenforcement is a technique that can be used to reduce the costs of overinclusion without increasing underinclusion. The plan described in Passage B involves selectively cutting water to residences with outstanding bills, which could be seen as an example of overenforcement. While the author of Passage A does not explicitly comment on this plan, they would likely agree with the statement that the plan has a lower social cost than turning off the water of all 231,000 households that have not paid on time. However, the author would also likely argue that a better plan would have been to place liens on the properties owned by those who are late paying their bills, as this would be a more effective method of collecting debts and would not involve the social costs of turning off water to households. 
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and make sure you understand the argument presented in each passage.
2. Identify the key points of each passage and how they relate to the question.
