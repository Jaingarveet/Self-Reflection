Error Keywords:
 - Misinterpretation
 - Focusing on the wrong aspect
 - Ignoring specific details
Solution:
The author's primary purpose in the passage is to describe a particular aspect of Toni Morrison's novel Jazz. 
The author uses the example of Jazz to demonstrate how literature can be structured like a jazz composition, with individual voices improvising within a fixed frame. 
The passage discusses the connection between music and literature, but the main focus is on how Morrison's novel uses the structure of jazz to redefine the possibilities of narrative point of view.
