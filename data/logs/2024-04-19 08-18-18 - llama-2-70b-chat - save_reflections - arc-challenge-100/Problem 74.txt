## Get Reflection:
  Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I confused thermal energy with chemical energy. Thermal energy is a type of kinetic energy, not potential energy. Chemical energy is the potential energy stored in the bonds of atoms and molecules.

Error Keywords:

* Confusion
* Misclassification
* Energy types

Solution:
Elisa was classifying types of energy as either potential or kinetic.
Potential energy is the energy an object has due to its position or state.
Chemical energy is a type of potential energy.

Instructions:

1. Review the types of energy: kinetic, potential, sound, radiant, thermal, chemical.
2. Understand the definition of potential energy: energy an object has due to its position or state.
3. Identify the type of energy that is stored in the bonds of atoms and molecules: chemical energy.
4. Choose the answer that matches the correct type of energy: D - chemical energy.

Advice:

* Always review and understand the concepts before answering a question.
* Be careful when distinguishing between similar terms, such as thermal and chemical energy.
* Use a systematic approach to identify the correct answer.
* Double-check your answer by reviewing the question and the options.
* Practice, practice, practice to build your knowledge and confidence.
