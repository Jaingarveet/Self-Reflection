## Get Reflection:
  Explanation:
I incorrectly described a liquid sample's properties.
My mistake was in the statement "It keeps its shape when transferred to a larger container."
Liquids take the shape of their container, so their shape can change depending on the container's size and shape.
Error Keywords:
- Incorrect description
- Liquid properties
Solution:
A liquid sample's volume changes depending on the surrounding pressure and temperature. It takes the shape of its container.
The correct statement describing a liquid sample is:
"It will retain its volume if transferred to a larger container."
Instructions:
1. Identify the properties of a liquid sample.
2. Consider how a liquid's volume and shape change based on its surroundings.
3. Choose the statement that accurately describes a liquid sample's properties.
Advice:
- Review the properties of different states of matter, including liquids.
- Consider the behavior of liquids in different situations, such as pouring water from a bottle into a cup.
- Pay attention to the given choices and eliminate any obviously incorrect options.
- Double-check your answer by re-reading the question and your chosen statement.
