## Get Reflection:
  Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I misunderstood the question stem. I thought the question was asking for an example of animal instinct, whereas it was actually asking for an exception.

Error Keywords:

* Misunderstanding the question stem
* Failure to carefully read the options

Solution:

1. Reread the question stem and ensure understanding.
2. Carefully read each option and determine if it is an example of animal instinct.
3. Identify the option that is not an example of animal instinct.

Instructions:

1. Read the question stem carefully and ensure understanding.
2. Evaluate each option and determine if it is an example of animal instinct.
3. Eliminate any options that are examples of animal instinct.
4. Select the remaining option as the answer.

Advice:

* Always read the question stem carefully and ensure understanding.
* Evaluate each option carefully and avoid making assumptions.
* Use the process of elimination to narrow down the options.
* Double-check your answer to ensure it is correct.

In this case, the correct answer is "C: hunting skills" because hunting skills are not an example of animal instinct. Migrating, hibernating, and building nests are all examples of animal instincts.
