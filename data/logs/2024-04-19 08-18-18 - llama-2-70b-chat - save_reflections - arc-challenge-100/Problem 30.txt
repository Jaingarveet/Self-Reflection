## Get Reflection:
  Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I misunderstood the process of condensation. I thought that the water vapor in the air would condense into liquid water, not realizing that it would actually sublimate (change directly from a gas to a solid) and form frost.

Error Keywords:

* Misunderstanding of condensation
* Sublimation vs. condensation
* Water vapor vs. liquid water

Solution:
When moist air comes in contact with a cold surface in the winter, the water vapor in the air changes directly from a gas to a solid, forming frost. This process is called sublimation.

Instructions:

1. Recognize that frost forms when moist air meets a cold surface.
2. Understand that the water vapor in the air sublimates (changes directly from a gas to a solid) to form frost.
3. Identify the correct answer, "B: It has sublimated."

Advice:

* Pay attention to the specific process described in the question.
* Understand the difference between condensation and sublimation.
* Be careful not to confuse liquid water with water vapor.
* Double-check your answer by reviewing the process described in the question.
