## Get Reflection:
  Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I misunderstood the term "sample" and thought it referred to the number of atoms in a substance, which remains constant regardless of its size or state. However, the question was asking about the physical properties of a small, solid sample of aluminum and a large, liquid sample of aluminum.

Error Keywords:

* Misunderstanding of the term "sample"
* Misconception about the properties of matter

Solution:
A small, solid sample of aluminum and a large, liquid sample of aluminum both have a definite volume.

Instructions:

1. Read the question carefully and understand the terms used.
2. Identify the physical properties of a small, solid sample of aluminum and a large, liquid sample of aluminum.
3. Determine which property is common to both samples.
4. Choose the correct answer based on your analysis.

Advice:

* Always read the question carefully and understand the terms used.
* Make sure you understand the properties of matter and their differences in different states.
* Double-check your answer by reviewing the properties of the samples in question.
* Remember that a sample can refer to a small portion of a substance, not necessarily the number of atoms it contains.
