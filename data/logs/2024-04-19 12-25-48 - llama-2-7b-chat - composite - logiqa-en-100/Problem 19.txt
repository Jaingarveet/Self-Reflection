Topic: Logic
Context: A blogger declared? "My analysis of the future trend of housing prices has received more than 1,000 netizens' follow-up posts.I counted them, and 85% of the follow-up posts agree with my opinion.This shows Most people agree with me."
Question: Which of the following can best question the blogger â€™s conclusion?
Choices:
  A: Although some people agree with his views, they do not agree with his analysis.
  B: The blogger's other articles with higher approval ratings later proved to be wrong.
  C: Some of the objections to the post are more fully justified.
  D: Most people who follow this blogger's article are their loyal fans.
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
The correct answer is (C) [REDACTED]

The blogger's conclusion that "Most people agree with me" is based on the fact that 85% of the follow-up posts agree with their opinion. However, this does not necessarily mean that the remaining 15% of posts are unjustified or incorrect. It is possible that some of the objections to the post are more fully justified, and therefore, the conclusion that "Most people agree with me" is not entirely accurate.

The other options do not challenge the blogger's conclusion:

Option (A) suggests that some people may agree with the blogger's views but not with their analysis, but this does not necessarily mean that the blogger's conclusion is incorrect.

Option (B) is irrelevant, as it mentions the blogger's other articles being wrong, but this does not affect the conclusion drawn from the follow-up posts.

Option (D) is incorrect, as it suggests that the blogger's loyal fans are the ones making the follow-up posts, which is not the case.

Therefore, the best option to question the blogger's conclusion is (C) [REDACTED]

## Assistant 2:
  Reflection:

I previously answered this question incorrectly by selecting option (A) "Although some people agree with his views, they do not agree with his analysis." However, upon further reflection, I realize that this option does not challenge the blogger's conclusion that "Most people agree with me." It is possible that some people may agree with the blogger's views but not with their analysis, but this does not necessarily mean that the blogger's conclusion is incorrect.

The correct answer is option (C) "Some of the objections to the post are more fully justified." This option challenges the blogger's conclusion by suggesting that there may be more to the objections than what is initially apparent. It is possible that some of the objections are more fully justified, and therefore, the conclusion that "Most people agree with me" is not entirely accurate.

I have learned that it is important to carefully consider the options and to reflect on my previous answers to ensure that I provide the correct solution. I will continue to practice critical thinking and reflection to improve my problem-solving skills.
