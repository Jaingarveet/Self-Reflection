Self-Reflection:

I previously answered this question incorrectly, and upon reflection, I realized that I made a mistake in my reasoning. Here is my self-reflection:

Error Keywords:

* I mistakenly assumed that F was adjacent to H, when in fact, F is not adjacent to H.
* I also assumed that I and E were adjacent, when in fact, they are not adjacent.

Solution:

To correctly solve the problem, I will use the information provided in the question:

* G is the northernmost island.
* F is not adjacent to H.
* I and E are not adjacent.

Using these facts, I can deduce the possible arrangements for the group of islands:

* G, I, E, F, H
* G, F, I, E, H
* G, H, I, E, F
* G, H, F, I, E

Therefore, the answer is (C) 4 possible arrangements.

Advice:

When solving this type of problem, it is essential to carefully read and understand the question, paying attention to the keywords and any given information. It is also crucial to use logical reasoning and deduction to arrive at the correct answer. Reflecting on one's mistakes and using self-reflection to improve problem-solving skills can also be helpful.
