## Assistant 2:
  Topic: Logic
Context: The members of the printing group and the binding group are mainly from the following seven employees-F, G, H, J, K, L and M. The members of each group must meet the following conditions:

(1) Each group has at least 3 employees.
(2) F and K cannot be in the same group.
(3) If K is in a certain group, J must also be in this group.
(4) M is at least one of the members of these two groups.
(5) At least one of the same employees in both groups.

Question: If the printing group has only three members, G, H, and L, and under sufficient conditions, the two groups have as many common members as possible, then which of the following statements must be true?

Choices:

A: The binding group and the printing group happen to have a common member. [INCORRECT]
B: The binding group and the printing group have exactly two members in common. [CORRECT]
C: The number of members in the binding and printing groups is the same. [INCORRECT]
D: The number of members of the bookbinding group is at least one more than that of the printing group. [INCORRECT]

Reflection:

I previously answered this question incorrectly, and then I reflected on my solution and the correct answer.

Error Keywords:

* I mistakenly chose option A, which states that the binding group and the printing group happen to have a common member. However, the correct answer is option B, which states that the binding group and the printing group have exactly two members in common.

Solution:

To solve the problem, I realized that the printing group has only three members, G, H, and L. Under sufficient conditions, the two groups have as many common members as possible. Therefore, the number of common members between the binding group and the printing group is two.

Advice:

When solving this problem, it is essential to carefully read the conditions given in the problem statement. In this case, I overlooked the condition that the binding group and the printing group have exactly two members in common. Additionally, it is important to pay attention to the keywords in the question and to choose the correct answer based on the information provided.
