Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
The correct answer is (B) [REDACTED]

The sentence "Do not do what you don't want to do to others" does not imply that if you want to do something, you should give it to others. It simply states that you should not do something undesirable to others.

Option (A) is a logical inference from the sentence, as it implies that only those who want to do something can do it to others. However, this is not the correct interpretation of the sentence.

Option (C) is also not a logical inference from the sentence, as it implies that one should not treat others unless they want to. The sentence does not suggest that treating others is conditional on their willingness.

Option (D) is also not a logical inference from the sentence, as it implies that whatever is applied to people should be what they want. The sentence does not suggest that the desires of others should be the basis for what is applied to them.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) [REDACTED]
