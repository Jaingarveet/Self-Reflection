Context: If I debate with you, can we distinguish between true and false? You and I do nâ€™t know, and everyone else has prejudices.Who can we judge? Please judge with someone who shares your opinion.Since he has the same opinion as you, how can he judge? Please judge by someone who has the same opinion as me.Since he has the same opinion as me, how can he judge? Please judge with people who have different opinions from you and me.Since he has different opinions from you and me, how can he judge? Therefore, "invincible".

Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
The argument in the passage is flawed because it assumes the existence of an objective standard for judging the validity of arguments, but it does not provide any such standard. The argument relies on the circular reasoning of assuming that there is a standard for judging arguments without providing one. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) [REDACTED]

The argument is trying to make a point about the subjectivity of judgment in debates, but it is flawed because it does not consider the implementation standards and logical standards beyond the debaters and commentators. The argument is confusing the concept of subjectivity with the concept of objectivity, and it is trying to use subjectivity as a basis for objectivity. This is a logical error known as "confused concept" (B).

The reasons in the argument are also inconsistent with each other, as the argument is trying to use the concept of subjectivity to make a point about the objectivity of judgment, but it is not providing any consistent or coherent reasoning to support this claim. Therefore, the argument is untrue and inconsistent (C).

Finally, the argument is guilty of a "mis-problem" logical error, which occurs when an argument is trying to solve the wrong problem or address the wrong issue. The argument is trying to address the issue of subjectivity in judgment, but it is not solving the problem of how to determine the validity of arguments in a objective manner (D).
