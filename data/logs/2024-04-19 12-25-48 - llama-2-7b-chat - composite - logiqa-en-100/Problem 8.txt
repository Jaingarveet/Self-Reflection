When answering questions that involve comparing two or more entities, it is important to carefully evaluate the information provided in the question stem and to consider all possible options. In this case, I initially overlooked the fact that the information provided allowed us to compare the difference between Xiao Qiang and Xiao Gang in other aspects beyond just their intelligence. By taking the time to reflect on the problem and consider all possible options, I was able to arrive at the correct answer.
