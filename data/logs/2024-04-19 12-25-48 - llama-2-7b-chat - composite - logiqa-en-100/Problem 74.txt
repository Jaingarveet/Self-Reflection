## Assistant 2:
  Thought:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand the mistake. Let me re-evaluate the problem and find the correct solution.

Action: Answer("D")

Reflection:
I analyzed the problem again, and I realized that if He Zhilian is not selected, then Peng Youwen cannot be selected at the same time as Tang Xiaohua, since the requirement states that Peng Youwen and Song Kaiwen are not selected at the same time. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) Song Wenkai.

Explanation:
The correct answer is Song Wenkai, as he cannot be selected if He Zhilian is not selected. The other options are not possible based on the given requirements.
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
