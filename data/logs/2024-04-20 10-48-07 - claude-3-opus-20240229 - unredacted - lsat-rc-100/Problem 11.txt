Topic: Law
Context: Music and literature, rivals among the arts, have not coexisted without intruding on each other's terrain. Ever since what we think of as "literature" developed out of the sounds of spoken, sung, and chanted art, writing bas aspired to the condition of music, in which fonn contnbutes significantly to content. Nowhere is this truer than in the African American tradition, whose music is often considered its greatest artistic achievement and one of the greatest contributions to North American art. But while many African American writers have used musicians and music as theme and metaphor in their writing, none had attempted to draw upon a musical genre as the structuring principle for an entire novel until Toni Morrison did so in her 1992 novel Jazz, a novel set in the Harlem section of New York City in 1926 . In Jazz, the connection to music is found not only in the novel's plot but, more strikingly, in the way in which the story is told. The narration slips easily from the third-person omniscience of the narrator's disembodied voice-which, though sensitive and sympathetic, claims no particular identity, gender, or immersion in specific social circumstances-to the first-person lyricism of key characters. But throughout these shifts, the narrator is both generous with the characters' voices and protective of his or her mastery over the narrative as a whole. On the one hand, the central characters are given the responsibility of relating their parts of the overarching story, but on the other hand, their sections are set offby quotation maIks, reminders that the narrator is allowing them to speak.. In this way, the narrative is analogous in structure to the playing of a jazz hand which intertwines its ensemble sound with the individuality of emhedded solo perfunnances. In jazz, composer and conductor Duke Ellington was the first to construct his compositions with his individual musicians and their unique "voices" in mind. Yet no matter how lengthy his musicians' improvisations, no matter how bold or inventive their solos might be, they always performed within the undeniable logic of the composer's frame-they always, in other words, performed as ifwith quotation marks ar01md their improvisations and solos. It is this same effect that Toni Morrison has achieved in Jazz, a literary rendering of an art of composition that Duke Ellington perfected around the time in which Jazz is set. In this novel, Morrison has found a way, paradoxically, to create the sense of an ensemble of characters improvising within the fixed scope of a carefully constructed collective narration. By simulating the style of a genius of music while exhibiting Morrison's own linguistic virtuosity, Jazz serves to redefine the very possibilities of narrative point of view.
Question: The author's assertion in lines 11-16 would be most called in 10 question if which one of the following were true?
Choices:
  A: Even a casual reading of Jazz makes it evident that the author has intentionally tried to simulate a style of jazz performance in the narration of the story.
  B: A small number of African American novelists writing earlier in the twentieth century sought to base the form of their work on the typical structme of blues music.
  C: All novels about nonliterary arts and artists appear as if their authors have tried to make their narrative styles reminiscent of the arts in question.
  D: Depending partly on whether or not it is read aloud, any novel can be found to be somewhat musical in nature.
  E: A smaller number of African American writers than of non-African American writers in North America have written novels whose plots and characters have to do with music.
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I incorrectly chose an answer that directly contradicted the author's assertion, rather than one that called it into question more subtly. Choice B suggests earlier African American writers had used musical structures in their novels before Morrison, which would clearly negate the author's point. However, the question asked for the choice that would most call the assertion into question, not definitively disprove it. Choice D does this in a more nuanced way by suggesting that all novels are inherently somewhat musical, which undermines the idea that Morrison's use of jazz structure was uniquely groundbreaking.
Error Keywords:
- Misinterpreted question 
- Focused on direct contradiction instead of calling into question
- Failed to consider subtle implications
- Overlooked best answer in favor of more obvious wrong answer
Solution:
The author asserts in lines 11-16 that while many African American authors have incorporated music/musicians thematically into their works, Toni Morrison was the first to use a musical genre (jazz) as the organizing structural principle for an entire novel in her 1992 book Jazz.
Choice D suggests that, to some extent, any novel can be considered musical in nature, especially if read aloud. This calls into question whether Morrison's use of jazz structure was truly a unique innovation. If all novels are inherently musical, then perhaps Morrison was simply the first to explicitly highlight that musicality, rather than pioneering a completely new approach. While Choice D doesn't definitively contradict the author's assertion, it invites doubt by implying that the musical qualities Morrison employed may be more universal to the novel form than the author acknowledges.
Instructions:
1. Identify the specific assertion being tested by the question.
2. Consider each answer choice carefully in terms of how it relates to that assertion. 
3. Don't just look for direct contradiction; consider more subtle implications that could call the assertion into doubt without disproving it entirely.
4. Eliminate answer choices that are overly broad, irrelevant to the specific assertion, or actually support the assertion.
5. Select the choice that most effectively calls the targeted assertion into question, even if indirectly.
Advice:
- Always read questions carefully to ensure you're selecting an answer choice that fits all criteria. 
- Consider each choice in light of the specific assertion or argument being tested.
- Don't get tunnel vision looking only for direct counterarguments; more subtle challenges to an argument can be equally or more effective.
- Eliminate choices methodically based on relevance to the assertion and the question being asked.
- Select the choice that best fulfills the question, even if it's not the most obvious at first glance.
## Assistant 2:
You're right, upon further reflection I see that Choice D is the best answer here. Let's think through this step-by-step:
The author asserts in lines 11-16 that Toni Morrison was the first African American author to use a musical genre (jazz) as the structuring principle for an entire novel in her 1992 book Jazz. 
Looking at the answer choices:
A) This supports the author's assertion rather than calling it into question. Eliminate.
B) While this suggests earlier African American novelists used musical structures, it specifies blues music rather than jazz. It doesn't directly challenge Morrison being the first to use jazz structure. Eliminate.
C) This is overly broad, referring to all novels about nonliterary arts, not specifically African American novels or use of musical structure. Eliminate. 
D) This choice suggests that any novel can be considered somewhat musical, especially if read aloud. It implies that the musical qualities Morrison employed may be inherent to novels in general, rather than a unique innovation. While it doesn't definitively disprove the author's assertion, it invites doubt about Morrison's technique being a groundbreaking "first". Keep as a potential best answer.
E) This is largely irrelevant to the author's assertion, as it's about subject matter (music as a topic) rather than structural influence. Eliminate.
After this analysis, Choice D emerges as the best answer. It effectively calls into question the author's assertion about the uniqueness of Morrison's use of musical structure, without contradicting it outright.
