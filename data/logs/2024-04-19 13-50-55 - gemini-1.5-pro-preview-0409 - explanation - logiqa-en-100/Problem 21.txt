Context: Xiao Chen? At present, part of the orbit of Comet 1996D3 is far from the sun, but recently it can be found to emit flickering light through the solar telescope.In the past, people never observed such flashes of comets far away from the sun, so this flicker must be an unusual scene.Xiao Wang? Normally people don't observe comets far away from the sun.The 1996D3 comet flicker light discovered this time was obtained by continuous and careful tracking observation.
Question: Which of the following most accurately summarizes the method Xiao Wang used to refute Xiao Chen's views?
Choices:
  A: Point out that the key concepts used by Xiao Chen are ambiguous.
  B: pointed out that Xiao Chen's argument is clearly lacking in persuasion.
  C: pointed out that Xiao Chen's arguments contradict themselves.
  D: Disagree with Xiao Chen's conclusion, and put forward another explanation for Xiao Chen's argument.E.Agree with Xiao Chen's conclusion, but put forward another explanation for Xiao Chen's argument.

Explanation:
## Assistant 2:
## Reflection on Previous Error:
My previous answer likely failed to accurately identify the core of Xiao Wang's refutation. Instead of focusing on ambiguities, persuasiveness, or contradictions, Xiao Wang offered an alternative explanation for the observed phenomenon. This aligns with option D or E.  
## Analysis of the Current Situation:
Xiao Chen argues the flickering light is "unusual" because such phenomena were not observed before. Xiao Wang counters by stating that the lack of prior observations is due to the limitations of past observation methods, not the inherent uniqueness of the phenomenon itself. 
## Choosing the Correct Action:
While both options D and E involve offering an alternative explanation, only option D accurately reflects the disagreement on the conclusion. Xiao Chen believes the flickering is "unusual," while Xiao Wang implies it might be a normal occurrence that was simply undetectable before. 
Therefore, the correct action is: 
Action: Answer("D") 
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
