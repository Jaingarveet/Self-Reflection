You are an expert in Logic.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Explanation:
## Assistant 2:
## Reflection on Previous Attempt:
While I don't have access to the specific details of my previous error, I can analyze the problem and choices to ensure a correct response this time. 
## Reasoning:
1. **E or F, but not both:** This eliminates options with both E and F or neither. 
2. **J or K, but not both:** This eliminates options with both J and K or neither.
3. **J implies G:** If J is chosen, G must be chosen as well.
4. **F implies M:** If F is chosen, M must be chosen as well.
## Analysis of Choices:
* **A: F and H:** This option implies M is also chosen (due to rule 4). This violates rule 1 (E or F, but not both) as we would have both F and M. 
* **B: G and J:** This option satisfies rules 2 and 3. We can have E or F (but not both) and H or M (or neither) to complete the team of 4. 
* **C: G and M:** This option implies F is also chosen (due to rule 4). This violates rule 1 (E or F, but not both) as we would have both F and M.
* **D: H and M:** This option implies F is also chosen (due to rule 4). This violates rule 1 (E or F, but not both) as we would have both F and M.
## Conclusion:
Only option B satisfies all the given conditions without causing any contradictions. 
**Action: Answer("B")** 
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
