  Thought:
Liu Xiang's statement does not constitute a rebuttal to Assertion C: Most track and field champions are black athletes.

Action: Answer("C")

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and upon further reflection, I realized that Liu Xiang's statement does not address or refute Assertion C. His statement focuses on challenging the dominance of black athletes in the sport and asserting the potential of yellow-skinned athletes, but it does not directly address the percentage of track and field champions who are black athletes. Therefore, the correct answer is Assertion C.
