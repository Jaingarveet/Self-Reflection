## Assistant 2:
  Thought: 
After reflecting on my previous answer, I realized that I made a mistake in my reasoning. The correct explanation for the contradictions in the statement is:

B: Toxic chemicals gather in the parts of the fish that seals eat but people don't.

Explanation: The statement mentions that even small amounts of the chemical can poison mammals, including seals. However, some people have not been poisoned after eating the same fish. This is because the toxic chemicals are concentrated in the parts of the fish that seals eat, such as the liver and fatty tissues. People, on the other hand, typically eat leaner cuts of fish that have lower levels of these toxic chemicals. Therefore, the contradiction can be explained by the difference in the way seals and people consume the fish.
