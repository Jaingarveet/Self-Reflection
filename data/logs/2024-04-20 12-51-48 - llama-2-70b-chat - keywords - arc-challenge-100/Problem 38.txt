## System:
You are an expert in Science.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Error Keywords:

* Misunderstanding of density and mass relationship
* Incorrect application of density to mass
## Assistant 2:
  My apologies for my previous mistake. I misunderstood the relationship between density and mass and incorrectly applied density to mass.
To find the lowest mass, we need to calculate the mass of each option.
The mass of an object is equal to its density multiplied by its volume.
The density of red-clay bricks is 2000 kg/m^3, and the density of air is 1 kg/m^3.

Option A: 2 m^3 of bricks
Mass = density x volume
Mass = 2000 kg/m^3 x 2 m^3
Mass = 4000 kg

Option B: 4 m^3 of bricks
Mass = density x volume
Mass = 2000 kg/m^3 x 4 m^3
Mass = 8000 kg

Option C: 6000 m^3 of air
Mass = density x volume
Mass = 1 kg/m^3 x 6000 m^3
Mass = 6000 kg

Option D: 10,000 m^3 of air
Mass = density x volume
Mass = 1 kg/m^3 x 10,000 m^3
Mass = 10,000 kg

The lowest mass is Option C: 6000 m^3 of air, with a mass of 6000 kg.

Action: Answer("C")
