## System:
You are an expert in Science.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: A pan of soup is being heated on an electric stove. A metal spoon is used to occasionally stir the soup. Which of the following is an example of heat being transferred by convection?
Choices:
  A: heating the pan
  B: heating the soup
  C: heating the spoon
  D: heating the stove burner
Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, selecting option A, "heating the pan." However, upon reflection, I realized that this answer is incorrect because the pan is being heated through direct contact with the electric stove burner, which is an example of heat transfer through conduction.

The correct answer is option C, "heating the spoon." When the spoon is stirring the soup, it is being heated through convection, as the hot soup molecules are moving and colliding with the spoon, transferring heat energy to it.

Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
