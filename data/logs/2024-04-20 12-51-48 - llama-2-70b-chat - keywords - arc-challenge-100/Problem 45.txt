## Assistant 2:
  My apologies for my previous mistake. I realized that I misunderstood the question and made a calculation error. The weight of the astronaut on the Moon is 31 pounds, which is equivalent to 14 kilograms. The mass of the astronaut, however, remains constant and is equal to 84 kilograms.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 31 pounds and 14 kilograms.

I made sure to double-check my calculations and conversions to ensure that my answer is correct this time.
