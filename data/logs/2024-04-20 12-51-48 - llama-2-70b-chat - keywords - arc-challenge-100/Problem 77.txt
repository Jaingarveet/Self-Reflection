Question: Sheep Challenge Evolution A species of sheep lives on the Scottish island of Hirta. Hirta has plenty of grass for the sheep to eat, and no natural predators of the sheep live on the island. Some sheep have dark wool, and some have light wool. The sheep with dark wool tend to be much larger and stronger than the sheep with light wool. However, researchers have found that in the last 20 years, the sheep with light wool have increased in number. Usually, strength and size help animals survive and breed. A new sheep predator is introduced to the island. Which change to the sheep population will most likely occur first?
Choices:
  A: a decrease in the population of sheep with dark wool
  B: a decrease in the population of sheep with light wool
  C: an increase in the population of sheep with dark wool
  D: an increase in the population of sheep with light wool

Error Keywords:

* Misunderstanding of the relationship between traits and survival
* Incorrect assumption about the effect of a new predator
* Failure to consider the advantage of smaller size in escaping predators
## Assistant 2:
  My apologies for my previous mistake. I misunderstood the relationship between the traits and survival, and made an incorrect assumption about the effect of a new predator. I failed to consider the advantage of smaller size in escaping predators.

The correct answer is B: a decrease in the population of sheep with light wool.

The introduction of a new predator will put pressure on the sheep population, and the sheep with light wool, which are smaller and weaker, will be more vulnerable to predation. As a result, their population will likely decrease.

Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
