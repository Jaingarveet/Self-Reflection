## Get Reflection:
## Explanation:
My initial response was partially correct, but I failed to consider the complete duration of viral shedding. While the highest shedding does occur one week before symptoms, it continues for two weeks after their onset. 
## Error Keywords:
* Incomplete information
* Misinterpretation of symptom timeline
* Failure to consider full duration of shedding
## Solution:
1. **Identify the key information:** 
    * Hepatitis A virus sheds in feces.
    * Shedding is highest one week before symptoms appear.
2. **Analyze the information:** 
    * The question asks for the **total duration** of shedding, not just the peak.
3. **Apply knowledge:** 
    * Based on medical knowledge, shedding continues for two weeks after symptoms appear.
4. **Calculate the total duration:** 
    * One week before + two weeks after = three weeks total.
5. **Choose the answer that matches the calculated duration:** 
    * Answer D: Two weeks before the symptoms and two weeks thereafter.
