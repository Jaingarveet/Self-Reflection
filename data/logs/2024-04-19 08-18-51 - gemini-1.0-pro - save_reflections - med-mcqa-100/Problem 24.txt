## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I incorrectly identified Carbimazole as a safe antithyroid drug for use during pregnancy. 
My knowledge gap was in the specific safety profiles of antithyroid drugs during pregnancy. 
I knew that some antithyroid drugs are not safe for use during pregnancy, but I did not know which ones.
Error Keywords:
 - Medication error
 - Pregnancy safety error
 - Antithyroid drug error
Solution:
Propylthiouracil is considered the safest antithyroid drug for use during pregnancy.
I121 is radioactive iodine and is contraindicated in pregnancy.
Methimazole is not recommended for use during pregnancy due to potential teratogenicity.
Carbimazole is converted to methimazole in the body and therefore also carries the same risks as methimazole during pregnancy.
Instructions:
1. Identify the class of medication being considered.
2. Research the safety profiles of each medication within that class during pregnancy.
3. Identify the medication with the most favorable safety profile for use during pregnancy.
4. Choose the answer that matches the medication with the most favorable safety profile.
Advice:
 - Always consider the specific context of the patient when making medication recommendations.
 - Always consult reliable sources of drug information, such as textbooks, peer-reviewed journals, and reputable online resources.
 - Always prioritize patient safety when making medication recommendations.
 - Be aware of the potential risks and benefits of all medications, especially during pregnancy.
 - When in doubt, consult with a healthcare professional with expertise in the area.
