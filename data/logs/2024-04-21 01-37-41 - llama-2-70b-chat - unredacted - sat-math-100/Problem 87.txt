Explanation:
I made a mistake in my calculation of the distance between the two points.
I incorrectly calculated the distance as 32, when in fact it is 10.
The mistake was in my calculation of the square root.
I mistakenly calculated √25 as 5, when in fact it is 5√5.
Error Keywords:
- Calculation error
- Square root error
- Distance error

Solution:
The parabola and the line intersect at two points, so we can find the x-coordinates of these points by setting the equations equal to each other and solving for x.

$y = (x - 11)^2$
$y = 25$

$ (x - 11)^2 = 25$
$x - 11 = ±√25$
$x = 11 ± √25$

Now we can find the distance between the two points:

$AB = √((11 + √25) - (11 - √25))^2$
$AB = √(2(11 + √25)) = 2(11 + √25)$

$AB = 2(11) + 2(√25) = 22 + 2(5√5) = 22 + 10√5$

$AB = 22 + 10√5 = 10(2 + 5√5)$

$AB = 10(2 + 5√5) = 10(7) = 70$

Instructions:
1. Solve the equation $y = (x - 11)^2$ for $x$.
2. Solve the equation $y = 25$ for $x$.
3. Find the distance between the two points using the distance formula.
4. Simplify your answer.

Advice:
- Always double-check your calculations, especially when working with square roots.
- Make sure to simplify your answer to the correct number of significant figures.
- Use the correct formula for the distance between two points in the plane.
## Assistant 2:
  Action: Answer("A")

Explanation:
The distance between the two points $A$ and $B$ can be found using the distance formula:

$AB = √((x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2)$

where $(x_1, y_1) = (11, 25)$ and $(x_2, y_2) = (11 + √25, 25)$.

Plugging in these values, we get:

$AB = √((11 + √25 - 11)^2 + (25 - 25)^2)$
$AB = √(2(11 + √25)) = 2(11 + √25)$

$AB = 2(11) + 2(√25) = 22 + 2(5√5) = 22 + 10√5$

$AB = 22 + 10√5 = 10(2 + 5√5)$

$AB = 10(2 + 5√5) = 10(7) = 70$

Therefore, the length of $\overline{A B}$ is 70.

The correct answer is choice A: 10.
