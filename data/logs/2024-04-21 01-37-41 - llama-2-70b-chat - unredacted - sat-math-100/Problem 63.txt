## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Question: A television with a price of $\$ 300$ is to be purchased with an initial payment of $\$ 60$ and weekly payments of $\$ 30$. Which of the following equations can be used to find the number of weekly payments, $w$, required to complete the purchase, assuming there are no taxes or fees?
Choices:
  A: $300=30 w-60$
  B: $300=30 w$
  C: $300=30 w+60$
  D: $300=60 w-30$
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I misunderstood the equation that represents the total amount paid so far.
I thought the total amount paid so far was $30w$, but it should be $30w + 60$, since the initial payment of $60$ is included in the total amount paid.
Therefore, the correct equation to find the number of weekly payments required to complete the purchase is:
$300 = 30w + 60$
Error Keywords:
- Misunderstanding of the equation
- incorrect representation of the total amount paid so far
Solution:
The correct equation is:
$300 = 30w + 60$
We can solve for $w$ by subtracting $60$ from both sides:
$240 = 30w$
Dividing both sides by $30$:
$8 = w$
Therefore, the number of weekly payments required to complete the purchase is 8.
Instructions:
1. Write the equation for the total cost of the television.
2. Represent the weekly payment and initial payment.
3. Write the equation that represents the total amount paid so far.
4. Solve for the number of weekly payments required to complete the purchase.
5. Check your answer by plugging it into the original equation.
Advice:
- Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
- Always represent the given information accurately.
- Always check your answer by plugging it into the original equation.
- Be careful when working with equations and ensure that all calculations are correct.
- Take your time and work step-by-step through the problem.
