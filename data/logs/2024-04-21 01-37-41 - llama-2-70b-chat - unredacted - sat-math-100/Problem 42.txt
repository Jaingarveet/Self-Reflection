## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Explanation:
I made a mistake in my calculation of the values of $a$ and $b$.
I incorrectly solved for $a$ and $b$ as $a=3$ and $b=5$.
The correct solution for $a$ and $b$ is $a=5$ and $b=3$.
Error Keywords:

- Algebraic error
- Solution error

Solution:
We can start by expanding the given expression:

$(a x+2)(b x+7) = a b x^{2} + (a+b) x + 2 b x + 14$

Since $a+b=8$, we can substitute this into the expression above:

$a b x^{2} + (8) x + 2 b x + 14 = 15 x^{2} + c x + 14$

Now, equating the coefficients of the two expressions, we get:

$a b = 15$
$2 b = c$

Solving for $a$ and $b$, we get:

$a = 5$
$b = 3$

Therefore, the two possible values for $c$ are:

$c = 2 \times 3 = 6$
$c = 5 \times 3 = 15$

Action: Answer("B")

Instructions:

1. Expand the given expression: $(a x+2)(b x+7) = a b x^{2} + (a+b) x + 2 b x + 14$
2. Substitute $a+b=8$ into the expression: $a b x^{2} + (8) x + 2 b x + 14 = 15 x^{2} + c x + 14$
3. Equate the coefficients of the two expressions: $a b = 15$, $2 b = c$
4. Solve for $a$ and $b$: $a = 5$, $b = 3$
5. Determine the two possible values for $c$: $c = 2 \times 3 = 6$, $c = 5 \times 3 = 15$
6. Choose the correct answer: Answer("B")

Advice:

- Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
- Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
- Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
- Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
- Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
- Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them.
