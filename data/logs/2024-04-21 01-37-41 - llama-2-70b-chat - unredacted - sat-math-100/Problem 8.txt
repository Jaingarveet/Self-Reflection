Question: Alma bought a laptop computer at a store that gave a 20 percent discount off its original price. The total amount she paid to the cashier was $p$ dollars, including an 8 percent sales tax on the discounted price. Which of the following represents the original price of the computer in terms of $p$ ?
Choices:
  A: $0.88 p$
  B: $\frac{p}{0.88}$
  C: $(0.8)(1.08) p$
  D: $\frac{p}{(0.8)(1.08)}$

Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I made a mistake in my calculation. I misunderstood the problem and wrote the equation for the original price of the laptop incorrectly.

Error Keywords:

* Misunderstanding of the problem
* Incorrect equation
* Calculation error

Solution:
Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The laptop's discounted price = $p$
2. The amount Alma paid, including tax = $p$
3. The tax rate = 8%
4. The original price of the laptop = $p$ / (1 + 0.08)

Now, we can simplify the options:

A: $0.88p$ = ($1 - 0.20)($1 + 0.08)p = 0.88p

B: $\frac{p}{0.88}$ = $\frac{p}{1 - 0.20}$ = $\frac{p}{0.80}$

C: $(0.8)(1.08)p$ = $0.8p$ + $0.08p$ = $0.88p$

D: $\frac{p}{(0.8)(1.08)}$ = $\frac{p}{0.80}$ = $\frac{p}{0.88}$

Therefore, the correct answer is D: $\frac{p}{(0.8)(1.08)}$.

Instructions:

1. Read the problem carefully and understand the given information.
2. Identify the known variables and their values.
3. Write the equation for the original price of the laptop.
4. Simplify the equation and compare it with the given options.
