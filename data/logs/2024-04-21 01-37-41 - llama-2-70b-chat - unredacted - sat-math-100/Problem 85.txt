## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Topic: Math
Question: $$C=\frac{5}{9}(F-32)$$The equation above shows how a temperature $F$, measured in degrees Fahrenheit, relates to a temperature $C$, measured in degrees Celsius. Based on the equation, which of the following must be true?I. A temperature increase of 1 degree Fahrenheit is equivalent to a temperature increase of $\frac{5}{9}$ degree Celsius.II. A temperature increase of 1 degree Celsius is equivalent to a temperature increase of 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit.III. A temperature increase of $\frac{5}{9}$ degree Fahrenheit is equivalent to a temperature increase of 1 degree Celsius.
Choices:
  A: I only
  B: II only
  C: III only
  D: I and II only

Action: Answer("D")

Explanation:
The correct answer is option D: I and II only.

The equation $$C = \frac{5}{9}(F-32)$$ shows that a temperature increase of 1 degree Fahrenheit is equivalent to a temperature increase of $\frac{5}{9}$ degrees Celsius. Therefore, option I is true.

Additionally, a temperature increase of 1 degree Celsius is equivalent to a temperature increase of 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit, as we can see by rearranging the equation:

$$F = \frac{9}{5}C + 32$$

Therefore, option II is also true.

Option III is false, as a temperature increase of $\frac{5}{9}$ degrees Fahrenheit is equivalent to a temperature increase of less than 1 degree Celsius.

Therefore, the correct answer is option D: I and II only.
## Assistant 2:
  Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly by selecting option C: III only.
Upon reflection, I realized that my mistake was in misunderstanding the relationship between degrees Celsius and degrees Fahrenheit.
I incorrectly believed that a temperature increase of $\frac{5}{9}$ degrees Fahrenheit was equivalent to a temperature increase of 1 degree Celsius.
However, rearranging the equation shows that a temperature increase of 1 degree Celsius is equivalent to a temperature increase of 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit.
Therefore, option III is false, and options I and II are true.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
