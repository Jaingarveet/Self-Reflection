## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

  C: 2
  D: $\frac{1}{2}$
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I made a mistake in my calculation. I misunderstood the sign of the result when dividing both sides of the equation by 15. The correct calculation is:

$$\frac{5}{x} = \frac{15}{x+20}$$

$$5x = 15(x+20)$$

$$5x = 15x + 300$$

$$x = 300$$

Therefore, the value of $\frac{x}{5}$ is 60.

Error Keywords:

* Calculation error
* Sign error
* Division error

Solution:

$$\frac{5}{x} = \frac{15}{x+20}$$

$$5x = 15(x+20)$$

$$5x = 15x + 300$$

$$x = 300$$

Instructions:

1. Rewrite the given equation as a equation with x on one side.
2. Multiply both sides by x to eliminate the fraction.
3. Expand the right-hand side.
4. Solve for x.
5. Check your answer to ensure it is correct.

Advice:

* Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
* Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
* Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
* Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
* Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
* Pay attention to signs and units in your calculations.
## Assistant 2:
  Action: Answer("B")

Explanation:
The given equation can be rewritten as:

$$\frac{5}{x} = \frac{15}{x+20}$$

We can multiply both sides by x to eliminate the fraction:

$$5x = 15(x+20)$$

Expanding the right-hand side, we get:

$$5x = 15x + 300$$

Subtracting 15x from both sides gives us:

$$3x = 300$$

Dividing both sides by 3 gives us:

$$x = 100$$

Therefore, the value of $\frac{x}{5}$ is 20.

Error Keywords:

* None

Solution:

$$\frac{5}{x} = \frac{15}{x+20}$$

$$5x = 15(x+20)$$

$$5x = 15x + 300$$

$$3x = 300$$

$$x = 100$$

1. Rewrite the given equation as an equation with x on one side.
