# Model: llama-2-70b-chat | Agent: unredacted | Exam: sat-math-100 | Problem 2 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:
Topic: Geography
Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?

  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: $$\left(x^{2} y-3 y^{2}+5 x y^{2}\right)-\left(-x^{2} y+3 x y^{2}-3 y^{2}\right)$$Which of the following is equivalent to the expression above?
Choices:
  A: $4 x^{2} y^{2}$
  B: $8 x y^{2}-6 y^{2}$
  C: $2 x^{2} y+2 x y^{2}$
  D: $2 x^{2} y+8 x y^{2}-6 y^{2}$
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I made a mistake in my calculation. I misunderstood the expression and combined the like terms incorrectly.
The correct solution is:

$$\left(x^{2} y-3 y^{2}+5 x y^{2}\right)-\left(-x^{2} y+3 x y^{2}-3 y^{2}\right)$$

$$= x^{2} y-3 y^{2}+5 x y^{2}-x^{2} y+3 x y^{2}-3 y^{2}$$

$$= 2 x^{2} y+2 x y^{2}-2 y^{2}$$

The expression is equivalent to choice C: $2 x^{2} y+2 x y^{2}$.

Error Keywords:
