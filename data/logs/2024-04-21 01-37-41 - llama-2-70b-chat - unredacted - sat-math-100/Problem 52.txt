Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I made a mistake in my calculation. I misunderstood the question and used the wrong variables. I used X to represent the number of pears produced by Type B trees, but the question actually asks for the number of pears produced by Type A trees.

Error Keywords:

* Misunderstanding the question
* Incorrect variables
* Calculation error

Solution:
Let's X be the number of pears produced by Type A trees.
Since Type A trees produced 20% more pears than Type B trees, Type A trees produced (1 + 0.2) * X = 1.2X pears.
We know that Type A trees produced 144 pears, so we can set up the equation:
1.2X = 144

Now, divide both sides by 1.2 to solve for X:
X = 120

Therefore, the answer is B: 120.

Instructions:

1. Read the question carefully and understand the variables.
2. Use the correct variables in your calculation.
3. Check your calculation to ensure accuracy.
4. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.

Advice:

* Always read the question carefully and understand the variables.
* Always use the correct variables in your calculation.
* Always check your calculation to ensure accuracy.
* Never assume you know the answer without going through the calculation.
* Always double-check your final answer.
