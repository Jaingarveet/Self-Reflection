## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: $$\sqrt{4 x}=x-3$$What are all values of $x$ that satisfy the given equation?I. 1II. 9
Choices:
  A: I only
  B: II only
  C: I and II
  D: Neither I nor II
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I failed to check if the solutions obtained by squaring both sides of the equation actually satisfy the original equation. This oversight led me to include an extraneous solution.
Error Keywords:
 - Extraneous solution
 - Verification error
 - Squaring both sides
Solution:
1. **Solve for $x$ by squaring both sides:**
$(\sqrt{4x})^2 = (x-3)^2$
$4x = x^2 - 6x + 9$
$0 = x^2 - 10x + 9$
$0 = (x-1)(x-9)$
Therefore, $x=1$ or $x=9$.
2. **Check for extraneous solutions:**
- For $x=1$: $\sqrt{4(1)} = 2$, but $1-3 = -2$. So, $x=1$ is not a valid solution.
- For $x=9$: $\sqrt{4(9)} = 6$, and $9-3 = 6$. So, $x=9$ is a valid solution.
Instructions:
1. Solve the equation algebraically, keeping in mind that squaring both sides might introduce extraneous solutions.
2. Once you have potential solutions, substitute each one back into the original equation.
3. Verify if the equation holds true for each potential solution.
4. Discard any solution that does not satisfy the original equation.
5. Select the answer choice that includes only the valid solutions.
Advice:
- Always be cautious when squaring both sides of an equation, as it can introduce extraneous solutions.
- Always check your solutions by substituting them back into the original equation to ensure they are valid. 
- Remember that extraneous solutions may satisfy the derived equation but not the original one.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Following the reflection, I need to solve for $x$ and then check for extraneous solutions.
Solving:
1. Squaring both sides: 
$(\sqrt{4x})^2 = (x-3)^2$
$4x = x^2 - 6x + 9$
$0 = x^2 - 10x + 9$
$0 = (x-1)(x-9)$
Potential solutions: $x=1$ or $x=9$
2. Checking for extraneous solutions:
- For $x=1$: $\sqrt{4(1)} = 2$, but $1-3 = -2$. So, $x=1$ is NOT a valid solution.
- For $x=9$: $\sqrt{4(9)} = 6$, and $9-3 = 6$. So, $x=9$ is a valid solution.
Therefore, only II (9) is a valid solution.
Action: Answer("B")
