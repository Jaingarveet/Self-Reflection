Context: A software company employs exactly seven sales representatives—Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall—to work in its three sales zones—Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3. Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

Choices:
  A: Kim works in Zone 2.
  B: Mahr works in Zone 2.

## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Since there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, and more sales representatives working in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, Zone 1 must have the most sales representatives.
If Parra works in Zone 3, then Tiao cannot work in Zone 1, and Udall cannot work in Zone 2. This means that Zone 1 would have only one sales representative, which contradicts the condition that Zone 1 has the most sales representatives.
If Tiao works in Zone 1, then Parra cannot work in Zone 1, and Udall cannot work in Zone 2. This means that Zone 2 would have only one sales representative, which contradicts the condition that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Therefore, the only possible answer is that Kim or Mahr works in Zone 2.
Action: Answer("A" or "B")

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly because I did not consider all the conditions carefully. I did not realize that Zone 1 must have the most sales representatives, and I did not consider the implications of Parra and Tiao working in different zones.
To avoid making the same mistake again, I should carefully read and analyze all the conditions before selecting an answer. I should also consider the implications of each condition and how they affect the other conditions.
The correct answer is either "A" or "B".
The error keywords are "more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2" and "more sales representatives working in Zone 1 than in Zone 3".
The solution is to carefully consider all the conditions and their implications, and to eliminate the answers that contradict the conditions.
The instructions are to answer the question using the format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'.
The advice is to carefully read and analyze all the conditions before selecting an answer, and to consider the implications of each condition.
