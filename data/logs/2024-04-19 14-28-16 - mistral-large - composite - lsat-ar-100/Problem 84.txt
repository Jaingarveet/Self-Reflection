Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Law
Context: Exactly eight books—F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O—are placed on a bookcase with exactly three shelves—the top shelf, the middle shelf, and the bottom shelf. At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.
Question: Which one of the following could be a complete and accurate list of the books placed on the bottom shelf?
Choices:
  A: F, M
  B: F, H, M
  C: G, H, K
  D: F, G, M, O
  E: G, H, L, M
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I made an incorrect assumption about the placement of book F.
The gap in my knowledge was not in the law but in logical reasoning.
I knew the conditions but made an incorrect assumption about the placement of one of the books.
Error Keywords:
 - Incorrect assumption
 - Logical reasoning error
 - Placement error
Solution:
More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, so there must be at least three books on the bottom shelf.
F and M are placed on the same shelf, so they cannot be the only books on the bottom shelf.
K is placed on a higher shelf than F, so F can be on the bottom shelf if there is at least one other book between them.
O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so L cannot be on the bottom shelf.
Therefore, the only option that satisfies all the conditions is [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Identify the conditions that must apply to the placement of the books.
2. Determine the minimum number of books that must be placed on each shelf.
3. Consider the placement of each book based on the given conditions.
4. Eliminate any options that do not satisfy all the conditions.
5. Work step-by-step through your logical reasoning.
6. Double-check your reasoning to ensure accuracy.
7. Choose the answer that satisfies all the conditions.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never make assumptions without considering all the possibilities.
 - Always double-check your reasoning and final answer.
 - Remember that logical reasoning is a critical skill in law and other fields.
