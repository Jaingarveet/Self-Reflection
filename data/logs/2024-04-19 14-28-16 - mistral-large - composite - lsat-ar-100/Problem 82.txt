The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Topic: Law
Context: A software company employs exactly seven sales representatives—Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall—to work in its three sales zones—Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3. Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Question: Which one of the following could be an accurate matching of the sales representatives to the sales zones in which they work?
Choices:
  A: Zone 1: Kim, Parra Zone 2: Stuckey, Udall Zone 3: Mahr, Quinn, Tiao
  B: Zone 1: Kim, Tiao Zone 2: Stuckey, Udall Zone 3: Mahr, Parra, Quinn
  C: Zone 1: Parra, Quinn Zone 2: Kim, Udall Zone 3: Mahr, Stuckey, Tiao
  D: Zone 1: Stuckey, Udall Zone 2: Kim, Tiao Zone 3: Mahr, Parra, Quinn
  E: Zone 1: Tiao Zone 2: Kim, Parra, Quinn Zone 3: Stuckey, Udall
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I made an error in evaluating the conditions given in the question.
The gap in my knowledge was not in the law but in my understanding of the conditions and my evaluation of the choices.
I incorrectly evaluated choice [REDACTED] as violating condition 3, but it actually satisfies all conditions.

Error Keywords:
 - Evaluation error
 - Condition analysis error
 - Choice evaluation error

Solution:
Let's analyze the conditions given:

1. Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
2. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
3. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
4. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
5. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

Now let's evaluate each choice:

[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]

* This choice violates condition 4 (Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other).

[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]

* This choice satisfies all conditions.

[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]

* This choice violates condition 4 (Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other).

[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]

* This choice violates condition 2 (Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2) and condition 4 (Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other).

[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]

* This choice violates condition 5 (There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2).

Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and understand the conditions.
2. Analyze each condition and its implications.
3. Evaluate each choice against the conditions.
4. Work step-by-step through your evaluation of each choice.
5. Double-check your evaluation to ensure accuracy.
6. Choose the answer that satisfies all conditions.

Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your evaluation and final answer.
 - Remember that each condition must be satisfied by the correct answer.
