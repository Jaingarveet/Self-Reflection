Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I misinterpreted the requirement that "at least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected" to mean that the number of French novels must always be greater than or equal to the number of Russian novels. However, this requirement only applies to novels, not to the total number of works selected.

Error Keywords:
 - Misinterpretation of requirements
 - Misunderstanding of conditional statements
 - Misapplication of rules

Solution:
The organizer must select at least five and at most six works.
Three French novels have already been selected, so no more than one additional French work can be selected.
At least three but no more than four novels have been selected, so one more novel or one play can be selected.
If both French plays are selected, then the Russian play is not selected.

Choice [REDACTED]: One Russian novel. This is possible, as it would bring the total number of works to five, with three French novels and [REDACTED].
Choice [REDACTED]: Two French plays. This is not possible, as it would exceed the maximum number of French works allowed (four).
Choice [REDACTED]: One Russian novel, one Russian play. This is possible, as it would bring the total number of works to five, with three French novels, [REDACTED], and one Russian play.
Choice [REDACTED]: One Russian novel, [REDACTED]. This is not possible, as it would exceed the maximum number of French works allowed (four).
Choice [REDACTED]: Two Russian novels, one French play. This is not possible, as it would result in more Russian novels than French novels being selected.

Instructions:
1. Identify the minimum and maximum number of works that must be selected.
2. Identify the number of works that have already been selected.
3. Identify the maximum number of additional works that can be selected from each category (e.g., French works, novels, plays).
4. Identify any conditional requirements that apply to the selection of works (e.g., if both French plays are selected, then the Russian play is not selected).
5. Evaluate each answer choice to determine whether it meets all of the requirements.
6. Double-check your evaluation of each answer choice to ensure accuracy.
7. Choose the answer that meets all of the requirements.
