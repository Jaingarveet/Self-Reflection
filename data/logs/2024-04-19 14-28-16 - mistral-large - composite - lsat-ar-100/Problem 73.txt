Topic: Law
Context: For the school paper, five students—Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, Megregian, and O'Neill—each review one or more of exactly three plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation, but do not review any other plays. The following conditions must apply: Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
Question: If exactly three of the students review Undulation, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Megregian does not review Undulation.
  B: O'Neill does not review Undulation.
  C: Jiang reviews Undulation.
  D: Lopez reviews Tamerlane.
  E: O'Neill reviews Sunset.
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I made an incorrect assumption about the number of plays Megregian reviews.
The gap in my knowledge was not in the legal domain but in logical reasoning.
I knew the correct conditions but made an incorrect assumption.
Error Keywords:
 - Incorrect assumption
 - Logical reasoning error
 - Misinterpretation of conditions
Solution:
We know that exactly three of the students review Undulation.
Since neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews, Jiang must be one of the three students who review Undulation.
Since Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, they cannot both review Undulation as well, since they each review fewer plays than Megregian.
However, Megregian could review all three plays, so it is possible that Megregian reviews Undulation.
Since exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other, and Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, O'Neill must review Sunset as well.
Instructions:
1. Identify the number of students who review each play.
2. Identify the conditions that apply to each student.
3. Consider all possible scenarios that satisfy the conditions.
4. Eliminate scenarios that violate the conditions.
5. Choose the answer that corresponds to a possible scenario.
6. Work step-by-step through your logical reasoning.
7. Double-check your reasoning to ensure accuracy.
8. Choose the answer that matches your logical conclusion.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never make assumptions without evidence.
 - Always consider all possible scenarios that satisfy the conditions.
 - Always double-check your reasoning and final answer.
 - Remember that logical reasoning is a critical skill in law.
