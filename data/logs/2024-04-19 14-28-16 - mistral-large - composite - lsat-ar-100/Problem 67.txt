Context: A bakery makes exactly three kinds of cookieâ€”oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar. Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day. The following conditions apply: No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.

Choices:
  A: Exactly three batches of cookies are made on Tuesday.
  B: Exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday.

Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I made an incorrect assumption about the maximum number of batches that can be made per day.
The gap in my knowledge was not in the legal domain but in the interpretation of the given conditions.
I misinterpreted the condition "No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day" as "At most two batches of cookies can be made on the same day."
Keywords:
 - Incorrect assumption
 - Misinterpretation of conditions
 - Maximum number of batches per day
Error Keywords:
Solution:
Since no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, the nine batches must be distributed among the other four days.
The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
Therefore, at least two batches of cookies are made on Thursday.
Instructions:
1. Identify the total number of batches of cookies that need to be distributed among the days.
2. Identify the conditions that apply to the distribution of the batches.
3. Consider the implications of the condition "No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day."
4. Consider the implications of the condition "The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies."
5. Consider the implications of the condition "The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday."
6. Work step-by-step through the distribution of the batches, considering the implications of each condition.
7. Double-check your reasoning and final answer.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never make assumptions that are not explicitly stated in the problem.
 - Always consider the implications of each condition in the problem.
 - Always double-check your reasoning and final answer.
 - Remember that the conditions in the problem may have implications that are not immediately obvious.
