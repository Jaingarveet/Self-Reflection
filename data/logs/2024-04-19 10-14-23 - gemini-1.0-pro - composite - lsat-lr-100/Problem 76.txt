## System:
You are an expert in Law.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Topic: Law
Context: A diet whose protein comes from fish is much healthier than one whose protein comes from red meat. Yet if everyone were to adopt this healthier diet, most of the marine species on which it is based would become extinct, making it impossible. Hence, we should not recommend the universal adoption of such a diet.
Question: The reasoning in which one of the following arguments most closely resembles that in the argument above?
Choices:
  A: Some studies have provided evidence that taking a vitamin E supplement every day reduces one's risk of heart attack. However, it has not been conclusively established that vitamin E supplements are safe for all people. So we should not recommend that everyone take vitamin E supplements every day.
  B: Governments are within their rights to tax tobacco heavily and spend this tax revenue on education. If these taxes become too high, however, people might smoke less, thereby reducing the funding thus generated for education. So such taxes might eventually have to be supplemented by other sources of revenue.
  C: A consumer is better off when limiting purchases to what he or she truly needs and saving or investing any remaining income. If everyone did this, however, the economy would be thrown into a severe recession, thereby making saving and investing impossible for most people. So we should not recommend this spending pattern to everyone.
  D: If legislators spent less time campaigning, they would have more time to do the jobs for which they were elected. But if they did not spend so much time campaigning, they probably would not get reelected. So it is not surprising that legislators spend so much time campaigning.
  E: If we restrict land development in wilderness areas, we help preserve many of the species that now inhabit these areas. But we also thereby reduce the proliferation of the admittedly smaller number of species, such as deer, that flourish in developed areas. So it is not always clear which areas should be designated as wilderness areas.
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I incorrectly identified the argument that most closely resembled the original argument. 
My error was in failing to recognize that the original argument was about the desirability of a certain action (adopting a fish-based diet) and the undesirable consequences of its universal adoption. 
Only two of the answer choices shared this structure: [REDACTED] and [REDACTED]. 
I chose [REDACTED] because it was the first answer choice that seemed to fit this structure, but I failed to consider the other answer choices carefully enough.
Error Keywords:
 - Inattentive reading
 - Failure to consider all options
 - Jumping to conclusions
Solution:
The original argument states that a certain action (adopting a fish-based diet) is desirable but would have undesirable consequences if universally adopted.
Choice [REDACTED]: This argument is similar in structure to the original argument. It states that taking vitamin [REDACTED] supplements is desirable but could have undesirable consequences if universally adopted.
Choice [REDACTED]: This argument is not similar in structure to the original argument. It discusses the potential need for alternative sources of revenue if tobacco taxes are increased.
Choice [REDACTED]: This argument is similar in structure to the original argument. It states that limiting purchases to what one truly needs is desirable but would have undesirable consequences if universally adopted.
Choice [REDACTED]: This argument is not similar in structure to the original argument. It discusses the reasons why legislators spend so much time campaigning.
Choice [REDACTED]: This argument is not similar in structure to the original argument. It discusses the trade-offs involved in designating certain areas as wilderness areas.
The correct answer is [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Carefully read the original argument and identify its structure.
2. Identify the answer choices that share the same structure as the original argument.
3. Carefully consider each of the answer choices that share the same structure as the original argument.
4. Choose the answer choice that most closely resembles the original argument in terms of its reasoning.
5. Do not jump to conclusions; consider all of the answer choices carefully.
Advice:
 - Always read the question and answer choices carefully.
 - Identify the structure of the original argument.
 - Identify the answer choices that share the same structure as the original argument.
 - Carefully consider each of the answer choices that share the same structure as the original argument.
 - Choose the answer choice that most closely resembles the original argument in terms of its reasoning.
 - Do not jump to conclusions; consider all of the answer choices carefully.
