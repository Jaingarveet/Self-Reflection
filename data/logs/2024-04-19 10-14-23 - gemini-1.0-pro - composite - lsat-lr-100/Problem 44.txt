Topic: Law
Context: Most people who shop for groceries no more than three times a month buy prepared frozen dinners regularly. In Hallstown most people shop for groceries no more than three times a month. Therefore, in Hallstown most people buy prepared frozen dinners regularly.
Question: Which one of the following arguments has a flawed pattern of reasoning most like the flawed reasoning in the argument above?
Choices:
  A: It is clear that most drivers in West Ansland are safe drivers since there are very few driving accidents in West Ansland and most accidents there are not serious.
  B: It is clear that John cannot drive, since he does not own a car and no one in his family who does not own a car can drive.
  C: It is clear that Fernando's friends usually drive to school, since all of his friends can drive and all of his friends go to school.
  D: It is clear that most people in Highland County drive sedans, since most people who commute to work drive sedans and most people in Highland County commute to work.
  E: It is clear that most of Janine's friends are good drivers, since she accepts rides only from good drivers and she accepts rides from most of her friends.

## Self-Reflection
**Error:** I previously identified the flawed reasoning in the original argument as being due to the fact that it assumes that because most people who shop for groceries no more than three times a month buy prepared frozen dinners regularly, then most people in Hallstown who shop for groceries no more than three times a month must also buy prepared frozen dinners regularly. This is a flawed assumption because it ignores the possibility that the people in Hallstown who shop for groceries no more than three times a month might be different from the people who shop for groceries more often.
**Solution:** The correct answer is **A**. The argument in choice A is flawed in the same way as the original argument. It assumes that because most drivers in West Ansland are safe drivers, then most people who drive in West Ansland must also be safe drivers. This is a flawed assumption because it ignores the possibility that the people who drive in West Ansland might be different from the people who do not drive there.
**Instructions:** To avoid making the same mistake again, I will pay close attention to the assumptions that are being made in the arguments. I will also try to identify any potential alternative explanations for the observations that are being made.
**Advice:** When evaluating arguments, it is important to be critical of the assumptions that are being made. It is also important to consider alternative explanations for the observations that are being made. By doing so, you can avoid making flawed inferences.
## Applying the Self-Reflection to the Current Question
Using the insights from my self-reflection, I will now analyze the answer choices for the current question:
* **A:** This argument is flawed because it assumes that because most drivers in West Ansland are safe drivers, then most people who drive in West Ansland must also be safe drivers. This is a flawed assumption because it ignores the possibility that the people who drive in West Ansland might be different from the people who do not drive there. This is the same flawed reasoning as the original argument.
* **B:** This argument is not flawed. It correctly concludes that John cannot drive because he does not own a car and no one in his family who does not own a car can drive.
* **C:** This argument is not flawed. It correctly concludes that Fernando's friends usually drive to school because all of his friends can drive and all of his friends go to school.
* **D:** This argument is not flawed. It correctly concludes that most people in Highland County drive sedans because most people who commute to work drive sedans and most people in Highland County commute to work.
* **E:** This argument is not flawed. It correctly concludes that most of Janine's friends are good drivers because she accepts rides only from good drivers and she accepts rides from most of her friends.
Therefore, the answer to the current question is **A**.
