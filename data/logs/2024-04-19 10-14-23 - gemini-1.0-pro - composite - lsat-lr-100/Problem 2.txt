## Self-Reflection
**Error:** I previously answered this question incorrectly, selecting "A" as the answer.
**Reasoning:** My initial reasoning was flawed. I focused on the fact that most of the films that won prizes at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival also won prizes at international film festivals. However, I overlooked the crucial information that only Canadian films are shown at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival. This means that all the films shown at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival are Canadian films.
**Solution:** To arrive at the correct answer, I need to consider the following:
* All films shown at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival are Canadian.
* Most of the films that won prizes at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival also won prizes at international film festivals.
Therefore, the correct answer must be a statement that reflects these two facts.
**Correct Answer:**
**C: Some of the films that won prizes at international film festivals this year were Canadian films.**
