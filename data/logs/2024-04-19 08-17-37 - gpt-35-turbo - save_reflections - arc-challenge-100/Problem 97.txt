Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I did not recall the correct order of the steps in the formation of sedimentary rocks. 
The correct first step in the formation of sedimentary rocks is erosion, not deposition. 
Error Keywords:
 - Recall error
 - Order error
 - Misinterpretation error
Solution:
The correct first step in the formation of sedimentary rocks is erosion. 
Erosion is the process by which rocks and minerals are broken down into smaller pieces by wind, water, or ice. 
These smaller pieces are then transported and deposited in a new location, which is the second step in the formation of sedimentary rocks.

1. Read the question carefully and understand the problem.
2. Recall the steps involved in the formation of sedimentary rocks.
3. Identify the correct first step in the process.
4. Choose the answer that matches your knowledge of the correct order of the steps.
