## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I incorrectly chose option B, "It is near the end of its life cycle." 
The correct answer is D, "It has consumed approximately one-half of its expendable energy."
My mistake was due to a lack of knowledge about the Sun's energy consumption.
Error Keywords:
 - Lack of knowledge
 - Misunderstanding
 - Misinterpretation
Solution:
The Sun is a star that has been shining for about 4.6 billion years.
It is not infinite and will eventually run out of fuel.
However, it has not yet reached the end of its life cycle.
Option D is the most accurate statement because the Sun has consumed approximately one-half of its expendable energy.
