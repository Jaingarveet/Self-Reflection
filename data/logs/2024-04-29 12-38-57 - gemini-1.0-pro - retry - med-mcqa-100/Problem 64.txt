## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Ovarian torsion is a condition in which an ovary twists on its supporting ligament, cutting off its blood supply. This can be a serious condition, as it can lead to tissue damage and even loss of the ovary.
Of the choices given, dermoid cysts are the most prone to undergo torsion during pregnancy. This is because they are typically larger and heavier than other types of ovarian cysts, and they are also more likely to have a pedicle, which is a stalk that connects the cyst to the ovary.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
