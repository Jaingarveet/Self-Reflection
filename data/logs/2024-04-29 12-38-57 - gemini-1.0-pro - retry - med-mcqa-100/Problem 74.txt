Thought: 
The vagus nerve is responsible for swallowing and sensation of the pharynx. Injury to the vagus nerve can cause recurrent aspirations.
The glossopharyngeal nerve is responsible for taste sensation of the posterior tongue and gag reflex. Injury to the glossopharyngeal nerve would not cause recurrent aspirations.
The SLN nerve is responsible for sensation of the larynx. Injury to the SLN nerve would not cause recurrent aspirations.
The RLN nerve is responsible for movement of the vocal cords. Injury to the RLN nerve would cause hoarseness of voice.
