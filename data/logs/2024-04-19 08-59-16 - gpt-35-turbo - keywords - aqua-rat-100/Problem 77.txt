## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let's start by finding the sum of the 5 consecutive odd numbers.
Let x be the smallest odd number, then the next four consecutive odd numbers are x+2, x+4, x+6, and x+8.
The sum of these numbers is 5x+20.
When we divide 5x+20 by 10, we get (1/2)x+2.
For (1/2)x+2 to be a perfect square, x must be even.
Therefore, we can eliminate choices A, C, and D since they are odd numbers.
Let's check the remaining choices.
For choice B, x=87, then 5x+20=445, and (1/2)x+2=45.5, which is not a perfect square.
For choice E, x=42, then 5x+20=230, and (1/2)x+2=23, which is a perfect square.
Action: Answer("E")
## Result:
Agent Answer: E
Correct Answer: C
