## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let x be the length of the original square piece of cloth.
The area of the original square piece of cloth is x^2.
After trimming 4 feet from one edge, the rectangular piece has dimensions (x-4) by x.
The area of the rectangular piece is (x-4)x = x^2 - 4x.
The area of each triangle is 70 square feet, so the area of both triangles is 140 square feet.
The area of a triangle is (1/2)bh, where b is the base and h is the height.
Let y be the height of each triangle.
Then, (1/2)(x-4)y = 70, so y = 140/(x-4).
The base of each triangle is the hypotenuse of the right triangle with legs x-4 and y.
By the Pythagorean theorem, (x-4)^2 + y^2 = x^2.
Substituting y = 140/(x-4), we get (x-4)^2 + (140/(x-4))^2 = x^2.
Expanding and simplifying, we get x^4 - 8x^3 + 2320x - 62720 = 0.
We can solve this equation using synthetic division or a graphing calculator to get x = 32 or x = 70.
Since we are looking for the perimeter of the original square piece of cloth, we choose x = 70.
The perimeter of the original square piece of cloth is 4x = 280.
