## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let's assume C joined the business after x months of B joining.
Then, A invested for 12 months, B invested for (12-2) = 10 months, and C invested for (12-x) months.
The ratio of their investments will be (40,000 x 12) : (60,000 x 10) : (120,000 x (12-x))
Simplifying the ratio, we get 6:6:8-x
Let's calculate C's share of the profit using the ratio.
C's share = (8-x)/(6+6+8-x) x 375,000 = 150,000
Solving for x, we get x = 4
Therefore, C joined the business after 4 months of B joining.
Action: Answer("B")
