## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let's assume that Alex and Jacob worked for x hours each.
Alex takes 7 hours to make a toy, so he can make 1/7 of a toy in an hour.
Jacob takes 9 hours to make a toy, so he can make 1/9 of a toy in an hour.
Together, they can make 1/7 + 1/9 = 16/63 of a toy in an hour.
Let's say they made y toys in x hours.
So, y = (16/63) * x.
We know that they made 35 toys in total.
So, y = 35.
Therefore, 35 = (16/63) * x.
Solving for x, we get x = 138.6.
Since both of them worked for almost similar number of hours, let's assume that they worked for 69 hours each.
Jacob can make 1/9 of a toy in an hour.
So, in 69 hours, Jacob can make 69 * (1/9) = 7.67 toys.
Action: Answer("D")
