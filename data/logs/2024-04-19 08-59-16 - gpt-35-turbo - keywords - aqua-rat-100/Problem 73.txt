## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Assistant 2:
Self-reflection:
To find the least possible number of students in the school, we need to find the smallest number that satisfies both conditions. 
Let's assume that there are 501 students in the school. 
Then, the number of students who took physics is 20% of 501 = 100.2 (which is not possible as it should be a whole number). 
Similarly, the number of students who took math is 28% of 501 = 140.28 (which is also not possible). 
Therefore, the minimum number of students in the school should be more than 501. 
To find the least possible number of students, we can assume that all the students who took physics also took math. 
Then, the number of students who took math or physics = 20% + (28%-20%) = 24%. 
So, 24% of the total number of students should be more than 501. 
Let x be the total number of students in the school. 
Then, 24% of x > 501. 
0.24x > 501. 
x > 501/0.24. 
x > 2087.5. 
Therefore, the least possible number of students in the school is 2088.
