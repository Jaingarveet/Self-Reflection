## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let's first calculate the rate of work of each painter.
Mr.Brown's rate of work = 1/6
Mr.Black's rate of work = 1/8
Mr.Blue's rate of work = 1/12
The combined rate of work of all three painters = 1/6 + 1/8 + 1/12 = 6/24 + 3/24 + 2/24 = 11/24
In 8 days, the work done by all three painters = 8 * 11/24 = 11/3
After 8 days, only Mr. Black is working. In 6 days, Mr. Black will complete = 6 * 1/8 = 3/4 of the work.
The total work done = 11/3 + 3/4 = 44/12 + 9/12 = 53/12
The remaining work = 1 - 53/12 = 11/12
Mr. Blue's rate of work = 1/12
The time taken by Mr. Blue to complete the remaining work = (11/12) / (1/12) = 11
