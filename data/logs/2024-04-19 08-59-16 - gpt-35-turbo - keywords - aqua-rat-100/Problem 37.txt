## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let's assume that Sachin played 'x' matches in the season.
Then, the total runs he scored in the season = 51x.
After playing the final match, the total runs he scored in the season = 51x + 78.
According to the question, his new batting average is 54.
So, (51x + 78) / (x + 1) = 54.
Solving the above equation, we get x = 9.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
