## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let's assume John has 100 ml of 50% strong milk tea.
He replaces 15% of it with milk twice, which means he replaces 15 ml of tea with milk twice.
After the first replacement, he has 85 ml of 50% strong milk tea and 15 ml of milk.
After the second replacement, he has 72.25 ml of 50% strong milk tea and 27.75 ml of milk.
Then, he replaces 10% of the resultant solution with more milk.
So, he replaces 7.225 ml of tea with milk.
After the third replacement, he has 64.5325 ml of tea and 33.4675 ml of milk.
Therefore, the final concentration of tea John drinks is (64.5325/100) * 100 = 64.5325%.
Action: Answer("None of the Above") [The correct answer is not among the choices given. The correct answer is 64.5325%.]
