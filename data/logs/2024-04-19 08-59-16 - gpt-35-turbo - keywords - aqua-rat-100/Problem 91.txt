## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Assistant 2:
Thought:
To solve this problem, we need to find the net displacement of A from home.
A travels 3km south and then 3km north, which means A is back where they started.
A then travels 5km east and 2km west, which means A is 3km east of their starting point.
We can use Pythagoras theorem to find the distance between A's final position and their starting point.
The distance is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs of length 3km and 3km.
The distance is sqrt(3^2 + 3^2) = sqrt(18) = 3sqrt(2) km.
Action: Answer("C")
