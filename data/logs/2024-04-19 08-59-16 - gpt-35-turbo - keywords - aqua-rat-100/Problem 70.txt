Self-Reflection:
The two trains have a frequency of 10 minutes, which means that they arrive every 10 minutes. The main line starts at 5 o'clock, and the harbor line starts at 5.02 A.M. The man wants to catch the first train that comes. 
To calculate the probability of the man catching the first train, we need to find the time interval between the first train's arrival and the time the man arrives at the station. 
Let's assume that the man arrives at the station at a random time between 5.00 A.M. and 5.10 A.M. 
If the man arrives between 5.00 A.M. and 5.02 A.M., he will catch the harbor line train. 
If the man arrives between 5.02 A.M. and 5.10 A.M., he will catch the main line train. 
Therefore, the probability of the man catching the first train is the probability of him arriving between 5.00 A.M. and 5.02 A.M. (for the harbor line train) plus the probability of him arriving between 5.02 A.M. and 5.10 A.M. (for the main line train). 
The time interval between 5.00 A.M. and 5.02 A.M. is 2 minutes. The time interval between 5.02 A.M. and 5.10 A.M. is 8 minutes. 
The probability of the man arriving between 5.00 A.M. and 5.02 A.M. is 2/10 or 0.2. 
The probability of the man arriving between 5.02 A.M. and 5.10 A.M. is 8/10 or 0.8. 
Therefore, the probability of the man catching the first train is 0.2 + 0.8 = 1.
