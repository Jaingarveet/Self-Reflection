## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let's use the formula distance = speed x time.
Let's assume the speed of the jeep in the forward journey is S.
Then, the speed of the jeep in the return journey is S + 12 km/hr.
Let's assume the distance travelled by the jeep is D.
From the problem, we know that:
D = S x 6 (distance = speed x time for the forward journey)
D = (S + 12) x 4 (distance = speed x time for the return journey)
We can solve for S by equating the two equations above:
S x 6 = (S + 12) x 4
6S = 4S + 48
2S = 48
S = 24 km/hr
Substituting S into the first equation:
D = 24 x 6 = 144 km
Action: Answer("B")
