## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let's call the distance between A and B "d".
Let's call the time it takes Kevin to travel from A to B "t1".
Let's call the time it takes Kevin to travel from B to A "t2".
We know that Kevin drove at a constant speed of 70 mph from A to B, and at a constant speed of 90 mph from B to A.
We also know that 3 hours before the end of his trip, he was still approaching B, only 70 miles away from it.
This means that at that point, he had already traveled a distance of d - 70 miles.
We can use the formula distance = rate x time to create two equations:
d = 70t1 + 90t2
d - 70 = 90(t2 - 3)
We can use substitution to solve for t1 in terms of t2:
70t1 = d - 90t2
t1 = (d - 90t2) / 70
We can substitute this expression for t1 into the first equation:
d = 70[(d - 90t2) / 70] + 90t2
Simplifying this equation, we get:
d = d - 90t2 + 90t2
d = d
This equation is true for any value of d, which means that we can't solve for d using these equations alone.
However, we can use the second equation to solve for t2:
d - 70 = 90(t2 - 3)
d - 70 = 90t2 - 270
d = 90t2 - 200
We can substitute this expression for d into the first equation:
90t2 - 200 = 70t1 + 90t2
20t2 = 70t1 + 200
t2 = (7/2)t1 + 10
We can substitute this expression for t2 into the second equation:
d - 70 = 90(t2 - 3)
d - 70 = 90[((7/2)t1 + 10) - 3]
d - 70 = 315/2t1 + 630
d = 315/2t1 + 700
We can substitute this expression for d into the first equation:
d = 70t1 + 90t2
315/2t1 + 700 = 70t1 + 90[((7/2)t1 + 10)]
315t1 + 140000 = 980t1 + 6300
665t1 = 133700
t1 = 201
We can substitute this value of t1 into the expression we derived for t2:
t2 = (7/2)t1 + 10
t2 = (7/2)(201) + 10
t2 = 715/2
Now we can substitute these values of t1 and t2 into the expression we derived for d:
d = 70t1 + 90t2
d = 70(201) + 90(715/2)
d = 14175
Action: Answer("D")
