## Assistant 2:
Self-reflection:
Let's assume the speed of the ship is "s" and the time it takes to meet the plane is "t". 
Then, the distance traveled by the ship before meeting the plane is "d=st". 
The distance traveled by the plane is "d=10s(t)". 
We know that the total distance traveled by both is 180 miles. 
Therefore, "d+d=180" or "11st=180". 
We need to find "d=st". 
We can solve for "t" and then substitute it back to find "d". 
"11st=180" or "t=180/11s". 
Substituting "t" back, "d=st" or "d=1800s/11". 
Action: Answer("A") 
Calculation: 
Substituting "s=20" (let's assume the speed of the ship is 20 mph), we get "d=1800(20)/11=327.27". 
Therefore, the answer is closest to 238.
