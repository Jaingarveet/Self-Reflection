## Assistant 2:
Thought:
To find the reduction percent, we need to find the difference between the original value and the reduced value, divide that by the original value, and then multiply by 100 to get the percentage.
The difference between 120 and 96 is 24.
24 divided by 120 is 0.2.
Multiplying 0.2 by 100 gives us 20%.
Action: Answer("C")
