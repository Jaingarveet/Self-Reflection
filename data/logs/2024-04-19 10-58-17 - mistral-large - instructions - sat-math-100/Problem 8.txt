## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Question: Alma bought a laptop computer at a store that gave a 20 percent discount off its original price. The total amount she paid to the cashier was $p$ dollars, including an 8 percent sales tax on the discounted price. Which of the following represents the original price of the computer in terms of $p$ ?
Choices:
  A: $0.88 p$
  B: $\frac{p}{0.88}$
  C: $(0.8)(1.08) p$
  D: $\frac{p}{(0.8)(1.08)}$
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:

1. Identify the city where the university is located.
2. Identify the state where the university is located.
3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.
4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.
5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.
6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.
7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The original price of the computer can be found by working backwards from the final price paid, $p$.
First, we need to account for the 8 percent sales tax that was added to the discounted price.
To do this, we can divide $p$ by 1.08 (which represents 100% + 8%).
This will give us the discounted price of the computer before tax.
Next, we need to account for the 20 percent discount that was applied to the original price.
To do this, we can divide the discounted price by 0.8 (which represents 100% - 20%).
This will give us the original price of the computer.
Action: Answer("D")

Self-reflection:
Previously, I made a mistake in my calculation by not accounting for the sales tax correctly.
I realized that I needed to divide by 1.08 instead of subtracting 8%.
I also made sure to double-check my calculations to ensure accuracy.
In the future, I will be more careful when working with percentages and make sure to follow each step of the problem carefully.
## Result:
