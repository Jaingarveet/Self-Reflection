Question: \begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}\hline\multicolumn{7}{|c|}{Lengths of Fish (in inches)} \\\hline8 & 9 & 9 & 9 & 10 & 10 & 11 \\\hline11 & 12 & 12 & 12 & 12 & 13 & 13 \\\hline13 & 14 & 14 & 15 & 15 & 16 & 24 \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}The table above lists the lengths, to the nearest inch, of a random sample of 21 brown bullhead fish. The outlier measurement of 24 inches is an error. Of the mean, median, and range of the values listed, which will change the most if the 24 -inch measurement is removed from the data?
Choices:
  A: Mean
  B: Median
  C: Range
  D: They will all change by the same amount.
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Identify the mean, median, and range of the original data set.
2. Remove the outlier from the data set.
3. Calculate the mean, median, and range of the new data set.
4. Compare the mean, median, and range of the original data set to the new data set.
5. Determine which measure has changed the most.
6. Choose the answer that corresponds to the measure that has changed the most.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:

1. The mean of the original data set is (8+9+9+9+10+10+11+11+12+12+12+12+13+13+13+14+14+15+15+16+24)/21 = 12.81 inches.
2. The median of the original data set is the 11th value, which is 12 inches.
3. The range of the original data set is 24 - 8 = 16 inches.
4. Removing the outlier, the new data set is {8, 9, 9, 9, 10, 10, 11, 11, 12, 12, 12, 12, 13, 13, 13, 14, 14, 15, 15, 16}.
5. The mean of the new data set is (8+9+9+9+10+10+11+11+12+12+12+12+13+13+13+14+14+15+15+16)/20 = 12.25 inches.
6. The median of the new data set is still the 11th value, which is 12 inches.
7. The range of the new data set is 16 - 8 = 8 inches.
8. Comparing the original and new data sets, the mean has changed by 0.56 inches, the median has not changed, and the range has changed by 8 inches.
9. Therefore, the range has changed the most.

Action: Answer("C")
