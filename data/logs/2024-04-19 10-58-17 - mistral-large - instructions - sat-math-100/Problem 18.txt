# Model: mistral-large | Agent: instructions | Exam: sat-math-100 | Problem 18 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:
Topic: Geography
Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")

Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Identify the city where the university is located.
2. Identify the state where the university is located.
3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.
4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.
5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.
6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.
7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The expression $9^{\frac{3}{4}}$ can be rewritten as $\sqrt[4]{9^3}$.
The fourth root of 9 is 3, so $\sqrt[4]{9^3} = \sqrt[4]{3^4 \cdot 3} = 3 \sqrt[4]{3}$.
However, this is not one of the answer choices.
The question asks for an equivalent expression, not necessarily a simplified one.
Since $\frac{3}{4} = \frac{6}{8}$, we can rewrite $9^{\frac{3}{4}}$ as $9^{\frac{6}{8}}$.
This can be further rewritten as $\sqrt[8]{9^6}$.
The eighth root of 9 is $\sqrt{3}$, so $\sqrt[8]{9^6} = \sqrt{3^6} = 3 \sqrt{3}$.
Action: Answer("D")

Self-reflection:
I initially made a mistake by simplifying the expression instead of finding an equivalent one.
I also realized that I could rewrite the exponent as a fraction with a larger denominator to make it easier to work with.
In the future, I will be more careful to read the question carefully and consider all possible ways to approach it.
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
