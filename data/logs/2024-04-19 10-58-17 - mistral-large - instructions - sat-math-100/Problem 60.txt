## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: Mr. Kohl has a beaker containing $n$ milliliters of solution to distribute to the students in his chemistry class. If he gives each student 3 milliliters of solution, he will have 5 milliliters left over. In order to give each student 4 milliliters of solution, he will need an additional 21 milliliters. How many students are in the class?
Choices:
  A: 16
  B: 21
  C: 23
  D: 26
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Denote the number of students in the class as x.
2. Set up an equation based on the information given in the question.
3. Simplify the equation to solve for x.
4. Double-check your calculations and simplification steps.
5. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let x be the number of students in the class.
According to the problem, Mr. Kohl has n milliliters of solution. When he gives each student 3 milliliters, he has 5 milliliters left over. So, we can write the equation:
n = 3x + 5
In order to give each student 4 milliliters of solution, he will need an additional 21 milliliters. So, we can write another equation:
n + 21 = 4x
Now, we can solve this system of equations.
Subtract the first equation from the second equation:
(n + 21) - (3x + 5) = 4x - 3x
n + 21 - 3x - 5 = x
n - 3x + 16 = x
Substitute the first equation into this equation:
3x + 5 - 3x + 16 = x
21 = x
Action: Answer("B")

Reflection:
Previously, I made a mistake in setting up the equations. I incorrectly subtracted the first equation from the second equation, which led to an incorrect result. After reflecting on the problem, I realized my mistake and corrected it. Now, I have the correct answer, which is choice B: 21.
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
