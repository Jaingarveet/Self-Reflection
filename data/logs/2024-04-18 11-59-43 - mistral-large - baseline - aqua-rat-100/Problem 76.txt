# Model: mistral-large | Agent: baseline | Exam: aqua-rat-100 | Problem 76 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: If n is such that 36 ≤ n ≤ 72, then x = (n2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16) / (n+ 4√n+ 4) satisfies
Choices:
  A: 20 < x < 54
  B: 23 < x < 58
  C: 25 < x < 64
  D: 28 < x < 60
  E: None of these
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
First, let's simplify the expression for x:
x = (n^2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16) / (n + 4√n + 4)

Notice that the numerator is a perfect square trinomial:
x = (n + √n + 4)^2 / (n + 4√n + 4)

Now, let's cancel out the common factor of (n + 4√n + 4) from the numerator and denominator:
x = n + √n + 4

Now, we can substitute the minimum and maximum values of n to find the range of x:

For n = 36:
x = 36 + √36 + 4 = 46

For n = 72:
x = 72 + √72 + 4 = 82

So, the range of x is 46 ≤ x ≤ 82.

Action: Answer("None of these")

(Note: The question states that "None of the Above" cannot be selected, but the given choices do not cover the correct range of x. In this case, the best option is to explain the correct range and indicate that none of the given choices are correct.)
