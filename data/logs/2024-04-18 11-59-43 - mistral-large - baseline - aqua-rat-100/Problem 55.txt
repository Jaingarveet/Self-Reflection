Question: If a man rows at the rate of 4 kmph in still water and his rate against the current is 2 kmph, then the man's rate along the current is:
Choices:
  A: 15 kmph
  B: 6 kmph
  C: 12 kmph
  D: 14 kmph
  E: 6 kmph
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The man's rate in still water is 4 kmph.
His rate against the current is 2 kmph, which means the current is reducing his speed by 2 kmph.
Therefore, the speed of the current is 4 kmph - 2 kmph = 2 kmph.
The man's rate along the current would be his speed in still water plus the speed of the current, which is 4 kmph + 2 kmph = 6 kmph.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: E
Score: 0
