Topic: Math
Question: Mark told John "If you give me half your money I will have Rs.75. John said, "if you give me one third of your money, I will have Rs.75/-. How much money did John have ?
Choices:
  A: 22
  B: 60
  C: 28
  D: 26
  E: 18
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let's assume John has x amount of money.
If Mark gives John one third of his money, John will have x + (1/3)M = 75, where M is the amount of money Mark has.
If John gives Mark half of his money, Mark will have M + (1/2)x = 75.

We can solve these two equations simultaneously to find the value of x.

First, let's isolate M in the second equation: M = 75 - (1/2)x

Now, substitute M in the first equation: x + (1/3)(75 - (1/2)x) = 75

Simplifying the equation, we get: x + 25 - (1/6)x = 75

Combining like terms, we get: (5/6)x = 50

Solving for x, we get: x = 60

Action: Answer("B")
