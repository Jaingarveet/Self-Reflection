Question: At what price should the Karan mark a sewing machine that costs him Rs. 1200/- so that even after offering a 20% discount, he makes 20% profit?
Choices:
  A: 1,879
  B: 1,875
  C: 1,876
  D: 1,872
  E: 1,800
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
To make a 20% profit on the cost price of Rs. 1200, Karan needs to sell the sewing machine for Rs. 1200 + 0.20 \* Rs. 1200 = Rs. 1440.
To find the marked price that would result in a 20% discount and still give Karan a 20% profit, we need to find the price that is 20% higher than Rs. 1440.
This can be calculated as Rs. 1440 / (1 - 0.20) = Rs. 1800.
However, none of the available choices match this answer.
Therefore, we need to round up the answer to the nearest available choice.
The closest available choice is "E: 1,800".
Action: Answer("E")
## Result:
Agent Answer: E
Correct Answer: E
Score: 1
