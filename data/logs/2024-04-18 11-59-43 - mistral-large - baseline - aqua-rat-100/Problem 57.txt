Question: A point on the edge of a fan blade that is rotating in a plane 10 centimeters from the center of the fan. What is the distance traveled, in centimeters, by this point after 30 seconds when the fan runs at the rate of 300 revolutions per minutes?
Choices:
  A: 750pi
  B: 1500pi
  C: 1875pi
  D: 3000pi
  E: 7500pi
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The distance traveled by a point on the edge of a fan blade is equal to the circumference of the circle formed by the rotation of the blade. The circumference of a circle is given by the formula C = 2πr, where r is the radius of the circle. In this case, the radius is 10 centimeters.

First, we need to find the number of revolutions in 30 seconds. Since the fan runs at 300 revolutions per minute, in 30 seconds (which is half a minute), it will make 300/2 = 150 revolutions.

The distance traveled by the point in one revolution is the circumference of the circle, which is 2π(10) = 20π centimeters.

Since the fan makes 150 revolutions in 30 seconds, the total distance traveled by the point is 150 * 20π = 3000π centimeters.

Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
