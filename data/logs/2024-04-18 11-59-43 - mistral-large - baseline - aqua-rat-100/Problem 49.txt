Question: In a large forest, 300 deer were caught, tagged, and returned during 2001. During 2002, 500 deer were caught at random, of which only 20 had tags from the previous year. If the percent of deer in the forest that had tags during the second year and were caught in the 500 deer sample is representative of the percent of the total deer population in the forest with tags, what is the total deer population in the forest (assuming no change in population between 2001 and 2002)?
Choices:
  A: 300
  B: 500
  C: 5000
  D: 6000
  E: 7500
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The problem is asking for the total deer population in the forest, given that the percentage of tagged deer caught in the second year is representative of the total deer population.

We know that 20 out of 500 deer caught in the second year had tags, which represents a ratio of 20/500 = 1/25.

We also know that 300 deer were tagged in the first year.

Therefore, we can set up a proportion to find the total deer population:

300 / x = 1/25

Cross-multiplying, we get:

300 \* 25 = x

x = 7500
