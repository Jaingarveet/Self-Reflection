Question: While selling a watch, a shopkeeper gives a discount of 5%. If he gives a discount of 7%, he earns Rs. 15 less as profit. The marked price of the watch is:
Choices:
  A: Rs. 697.50
  B: Rs. 712.50
  C: Rs. 787.50
  D: Rs. 750
  E: Rs. 780
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let's denote the marked price of the watch as x.
The profit earned by the shopkeeper when giving a discount of 5% is 0.95x - 0.93x = 0.02x.
The profit earned by the shopkeeper when giving a discount of 7% is 0.95x - 0.02x - 15 = 0.93x - 15.
Since the profit earned by the shopkeeper when giving a discount of 5% is Rs. 15 more than the profit earned when giving a discount of 7%, we have:
0.02x = 15
x = 15 / 0.02
x = 750
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
