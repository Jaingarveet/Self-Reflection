Question: In a chocolate store, all chocolates are either vanilla or cocoa flavored only. 10% of the chocolates are cocoa flavored, 90% of the rest are squashed. What percentage of the chocolates are both vanilla flavored and not squashed?
Choices:
  A: 1%
  B: 2%
  C: 5%
  D: 9%
  E: 10%
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The question states that 10% of the chocolates are cocoa flavored, so 90% of the chocolates are vanilla flavored.
Then, 90% of the rest (which means 90% of the 90% vanilla flavored chocolates) are squashed.
So, we need to find the percentage of vanilla flavored chocolates that are not squashed.

Calculation:
90% of 90% = 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81 or 81%

This means that 81% of the chocolates are both vanilla flavored and squashed.
Since we want to find the percentage of vanilla flavored chocolates that are not squashed, we subtract 81% from the total percentage of vanilla flavored chocolates (90%).

Calculation:
90% - 81% = 9%

Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
