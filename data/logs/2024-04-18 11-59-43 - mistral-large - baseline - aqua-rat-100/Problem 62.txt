Topic: Math
Question: On a normal day Bill usually averages about 15 mph when riding his bicycle. On a windy day, his speed is reduced by 4 mph. How far can Bill travel on a windy day in 21 minutes? Round to the nearest hundredth.
Choices:
  A: 2 miles
  B: 2.25 miles
  C: 3.25 miles
  D: 3.85 miles
  E: 2.85 miles
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
On a windy day, Bill's speed is reduced by 4 mph, so his speed is 15 - 4 = 11 mph.
To find out how far Bill can travel in 21 minutes, we need to convert the time to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 21 minutes is 21/60 = 0.35 hours.
Then, we can use the formula distance = speed × time to calculate the distance Bill can travel.
Distance = 11 mph × 0.35 hours = 3.85 miles.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
