Question: Jack buys 18 sharpeners (white and brown) for rs. 100. If he pays 1 rupee more for each white than brown sharpeners. How many of white and how many brown sharpeners did he buy?
Choices:
  A: 10,8

  D: 5,6
  E: 11,12
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let's assume the number of white sharpeners is x and the number of brown sharpeners is y.
We know that x + y = 18 (total number of sharpeners) and x + x + y = 100 (total cost of sharpeners).
Solving these equations simultaneously, we get x = 9 and y = 8.
Action: Answer("B")
