## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: A paper is in a square form whose one side is 20 cm. Two semi circles are drawn on its opposites as diameters. If these semi circles are cut down what is the area of the remaining paper?
Choices:
  A: 8.75
  B: 8.79
  C: 8.75
  D: 8.71
  E: 8.72
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The area of the square is 20cm x 20cm = 400cm^2
The diameter of the semi-circles is 20cm, so the radius is 10cm.
The area of one semi-circle is (1/2) x pi x r^2 = (1/2) x pi x 10^2 = 50pi cm^2
Since there are two semi-circles, the total area of the semi-circles is 2 x 50pi = 100pi cm^2
The area of the remaining paper is the area of the square minus the area of the semi-circles: 400cm^2 - 100pi cm^2
Using a calculator, 100pi is approximately 314.16
So, the area of the remaining paper is 400cm^2 - 314.16cm^2 = 85.84cm^2
None of the choices match this answer, so I will round to the nearest option.
85.84 rounds to 85.8, which is closest to choice "C"
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
