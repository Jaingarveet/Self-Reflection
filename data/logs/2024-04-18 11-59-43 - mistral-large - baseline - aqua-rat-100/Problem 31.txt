Question: Last year, a Home Appliance Store sold an average(arithmetic mean) of 42 microwave ovens per month. In the first 10 months of this year,the store has sold an average(arithmetic mean) of only 20 microwave ovens per month. What was the average number of microwave ovens sold per month during the entire 22 months period ?
Choices:
  A: 21
  B: 30
  C: 31
  D: 32
  E: None of the above
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
To find the average number of microwave ovens sold per month during the entire 22 months period, we need to find the total number of microwave ovens sold during the entire period and divide it by 22.

Last year, the store sold an average of 42 microwave ovens per month for 12 months, so the total number of microwave ovens sold last year was 42 \* 12 = 504.

In the first 10 months of this year, the store sold an average of 20 microwave ovens per month, so the total number of microwave ovens sold during this period was 20 \* 10 = 200.

The total number of microwave ovens sold during the entire 22 months period was 504 + 200 = 704.

The average number of microwave ovens sold per month during the entire 22 months period was 704 / 22 = 32.
