Question: Alex and Jacob works at a toy shop that make toys. Alex takes 7 hours to make a toy, and Jacob takes 9 hours to make a toy. During a month, both of them makes 35 toys in total. If both of them have worked for almost similar number of hours how many toys have been prepared by Jacob?
Choices:
  A: 15
  B: 16
  C: 17
  D: 18
  E: 19
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let's assume that Alex made x toys and Jacob made y toys.
Since both of them made 35 toys in total, we have:
x + y = 35

Since both of them worked for almost similar number of hours, we can assume that the time taken by both of them is the same.
Let's assume that Alex worked for t hours.
Then, Jacob worked for t hours as well.

We know that Alex takes 7 hours to make a toy and Jacob takes 9 hours to make a toy.
So, we have:
7x = 9y

Now, we have two equations and two variables.
We can solve for x and y using substitution or elimination method.

Using substitution method, we can substitute y from the first equation into the second equation:
7x = 9(35 - x)
7x = 315 - 9x
16x = 315
x = 19.6875

Since the number of toys made by Alex must be a whole number, we can round it to the nearest whole number, which is 20.

Then, we can substitute x = 20 into the first equation to find y:
20 + y = 35
y = 15

Therefore, Jacob made 15 toys.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
