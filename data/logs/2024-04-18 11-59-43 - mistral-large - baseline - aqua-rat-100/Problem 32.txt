Question: A cyclist travels at 12 miles per hour. How many minutes will it take to travel 48 miles?
Choices:
  A: 1
  B: 240
  C: 30
  D: 60
  E: 120
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
To find out how long it takes to travel 48 miles at a speed of 12 miles per hour, we can use the formula time = distance/speed.
Time = 48 miles / 12 miles per hour = 4 hours.
Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 4 hours to minutes by multiplying by 60.
4 hours x 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes.
Action: Answer("B")
