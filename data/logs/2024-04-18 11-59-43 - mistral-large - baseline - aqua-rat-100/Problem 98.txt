Question: At 6% per annum simple interest, Rahul borrowed Rs. 500. What amount will he pay to clear the debt after 4 years
Choices:
  A: 750
  B: 700
  C: 620
  D: 600
  E: None of these
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
To calculate the amount Rahul will pay to clear the debt after 4 years, we need to use the formula for simple interest:

Amount = Principal + Interest
Interest = Principal x Rate x Time

In this case, the principal is Rs. 500, the rate is 6% per annum, and the time is 4 years.

Interest = 500 x 6/100 x 4 = Rs. 120

Amount = 500 + 120 = Rs. 620

Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
