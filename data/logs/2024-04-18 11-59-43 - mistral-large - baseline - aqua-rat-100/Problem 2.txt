Question: The average (arithmetic mean) of the weight of 10 vehicles is 12.2 tons. The average weight of the group of vehicles increased by 2.6 tons after a new heavy duty truck was added to the group? What is the weight in tons of the heavy duty truck?
Choices:

  D: 43.5
  E: 44.8
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The total weight of the 10 vehicles is 12.2 tons \* 10 = 122 tons.
The new average weight of the 11 vehicles is 12.2 tons + 2.6 tons = 14.8 tons.
The total weight of the 11 vehicles is 14.8 tons \* 11 = 162.8 tons.
The weight of the heavy duty truck is 162.8 tons - 122 tons = 40.8 tons.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
