Question: A square piece of cloth is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge to form a rectangular piece, which is then cut diagonally in half to create two triangles. If the area of each of triangle is 70 square feet, what was the perimeter (in feet) of the original piece of square cloth?
Choices:
  A: 56
  B: 58
  C: 60
  D: 62
  E: 64
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The area of each triangle is 70 square feet, so the total area of the rectangular piece is 140 square feet.
Since the rectangular piece was formed by trimming 4 feet from one edge of the square, the dimensions of the rectangle are (x-4) by x, where x is the length of a side of the original square.
The area of the rectangle is (x-4)x = 140.
Expanding this equation gives x^2 - 4x = 140.
Rearranging the equation to form a quadratic equation gives x^2 - 4x - 140 = 0.
Factoring this equation gives (x-14)(x+10) = 0.
The positive root of this equation is x = 14, which is the length of a side of the original square.
The perimeter of the original square is 4x = 4(14) = 56.
Action: Answer("A")
