Question: Silu and Meenu were walking on the road.
Silu said, "I weigh 51 Kgs. How much do you weigh?"
Meenu replied that she wouldn't reveal her weight directly as she is overweight.
But she said, "I weigh 29 Kgs plus half of my weight. "How much does Meenu weigh?
Choices:
  A: 12
  B: 28
  C: 27
  D: 58
  E: 91
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Meenu's weight can be represented by the equation:
x = 29 + 0.5x

To solve for x, we can subtract 0.5x from both sides of the equation:
0.5x = 29

Then, we can divide both sides by 0.5 to get x:
x = 29 / 0.5
x = 58

Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
