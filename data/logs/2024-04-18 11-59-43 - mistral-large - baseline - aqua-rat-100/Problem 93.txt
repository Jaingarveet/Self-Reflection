Topic: Math
Question: [5 + ? × 19 - 15 - 7]/[13 × 13 - 156] = 6
Choices:
  A: 4
  B: 4.5
  C: 5
  D: 5.5
  E: 6.5
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let's denote the unknown number as x.
The equation can be rewritten as:
[5 + 19x - 15 - 7]/[169 - 156] = 6
Simplifying the equation, we get:
[19x - 17]/13 = 6
Multiplying both sides by 13, we get:
19x - 17 = 78
Adding 17 to both sides, we get:
19x = 95
Dividing both sides by 19, we get:
x = 5
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
