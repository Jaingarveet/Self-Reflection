Question: A shopkeeper employed a servant at a monthly salary of 1500. In addition to it, he agreed to pay him a commission of 15% on the monthly sale. How much sale in Rupees should the servant do if he wants his monthly income as 6000?
Choices:
  A: 30000
  B: 415000
  C: 31500
  D: 50000
  E: None of these
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let's denote the monthly sale as x.
The servant's monthly income is equal to his salary plus his commission on the monthly sale.
The commission is 15% of the monthly sale, which can be written as 0.15x.
The servant wants his monthly income to be 6000, so we can set up the following equation:
1500 + 0.15x = 6000

To solve for x, we can first subtract 1500 from both sides of the equation:
0.15x = 4500

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 0.15:
x = 30000

Action: Answer("A")

Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
