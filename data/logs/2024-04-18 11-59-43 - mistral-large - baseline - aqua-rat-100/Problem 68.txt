## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: The greatest common factor of two positive integers is 11. The least common multiple of these two integers is 7700. If one of the integers is 350, what is the other?
Choices:
  A: 242
  B: 308
  C: 352
  D: 412
  E: 456
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The greatest common factor (GCF) of two positive integers is 11, and one of the integers is 350.
Since 11 is a prime number, the other integer must also be divisible by 11.
The least common multiple (LCM) of these two integers is 7700.
Since 7700 = 11 x 700, the other integer must be a factor of 700.
Let's check each of the answer choices to see which one is a factor of 700 and is also divisible by 11.

A: 242 is not divisible by 11, so it cannot be the other integer.
B: 308 is divisible by 11, and it is a factor of 700 (700 = 2 x 2 x 5 x 5 x 7 x 11).
C: 352 is not divisible by 11, so it cannot be the other integer.
D: 412 is not divisible by 11, so it cannot be the other integer.
E: 456 is not divisible by 11, so it cannot be the other integer.

Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
