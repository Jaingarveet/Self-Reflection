Question: A jeep travels a certain distance taking 6 hours in the forward journey. During the return journey, it increased its speed by 12km/hr and took 4 hours. What is the distance travelled by the jeep?
Choices:
  A: 126km
  B: 144km
  C: 127km
  D: 228km
  E: 128km
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let's denote the distance travelled by the jeep as "d" and the speed of the jeep during the forward journey as "s".
Then, we have:
d = s \* 6 (forward journey)
d = (s + 12) \* 4 (return journey)

We can equate these two expressions for "d" and solve for "s":
s \* 6 = (s + 12) \* 4
6s = 4s + 48
2s = 48
s = 24 km/hr

Now that we have the speed of the jeep during the forward journey, we can calculate the distance travelled:
d = s \* 6 = 24 \* 6 = 144 km
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
