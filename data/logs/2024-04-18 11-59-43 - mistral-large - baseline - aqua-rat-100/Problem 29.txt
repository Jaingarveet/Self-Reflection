Question: There is well of depth 30m and frog is at bottom of the well. He jumps 3m up one day and falls back 2m down the same day. How many days will it take for the frog to come out of the well?
Choices:
  A: 25 days
  B: 26 days
  C: 27 days
  D: 28 days
  E: 29 days
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The frog makes a net gain of 1m per day (jumps 3m up and falls back 2m down).
However, on the last day when the frog reaches the top, it won't fall back down.
So, for the first 27m, it will take 27 days (27m / 1m per day).
On the 28th day, the frog will jump 3m to reach the top and won't fall back down.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
