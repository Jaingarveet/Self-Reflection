Question: There are 10 oranges in a basket. Find the no. of ways in which 2 oranges are chosen from the basket?
Choices:
  A: 45
  B: 90
  C: 120
  D: 150
  E: 180
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The number of ways to choose 2 oranges from a basket of 10 oranges can be calculated using the combination formula, which is nCr = n! / (r!(n-r)!), where n is the total number of items and r is the number of items to choose.

In this case, n = 10 and r = 2.

So, the number of ways to choose 2 oranges from a basket of 10 oranges is 10C2 = 10! / (2!(10-2)!) = 45.

Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
