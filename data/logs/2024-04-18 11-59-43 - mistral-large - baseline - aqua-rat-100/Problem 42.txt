Question: A straight picket fence is composed of x pickets each of which is 1/2 inch wide. If there are 6 inches of space between each pair of pickets, which of the following represents the length of fence in feet?
Choices:
  A: 13x/2
  B: 13x/2 - 6
  C: 13x/24
  D: (13x+1)/24
  E: (13x-12)/24
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The length of the fence is the sum of the widths of all the pickets and the spaces between them.
The width of each picket is 1/2 inch, and there are 6 inches of space between each pair of pickets.
So, the total length of the fence in inches is (1/2)x + 6(x-1), where x is the number of pickets.
To convert this length to feet, we divide by 12.
So, the length of the fence in feet is [(1/2)x + 6(x-1)]/12.
Simplifying this expression, we get (13x-12)/24.
Action: Answer("E")
