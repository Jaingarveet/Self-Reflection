## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: Amy is organizing her bookshelves and finds that she has 10 different types of books. She then codes each book with either a single letter or a pair of two different letters. If each type of book is uniquely represented by either a single letter or pair of letters, what is the smallest number of letters Amy will need to create the codes for all 10 types of books? (Assume the order of letters in a pair does not matter.)
Choices:
  A: 3
  B: 4
  C: 5
  D: 10
  E: 20
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Amy can use single letters to code for some of the books and pairs of letters to code for the rest.
If she uses single letters, she can code for up to 26 books (assuming she uses all the letters of the alphabet).
However, since she only has 10 types of books, she can use single letters for some and pairs of letters for the rest.
If she uses only single letters, she can code for at most 4 books (since the smallest number of letters she can use is 4).
To code for the remaining 6 types of books, she can use pairs of letters.
Since the order of letters in a pair does not matter, she can use the combination formula to calculate the number of ways she can choose 2 letters from 4: C(4,2) = 4! / (2!(4-2)!) = 6
Therefore, she can code for all 10 types of books using only 4 letters.
Action: Answer("B")
