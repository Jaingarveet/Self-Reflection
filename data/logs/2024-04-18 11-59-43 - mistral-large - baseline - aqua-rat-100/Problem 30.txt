Question: Roy was suffering from severe headaches. He went to see his doctor and the doctor gave him 5 tablets asking him to take one tablet every 15 minutes.
How much time will it take Roy to consume all the 5 tablets?
Choices:
  A: 45 Min
  B: 75 Min
  C: 90 Min
  D: 120 Min
  E: 60 Min
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Roy takes one tablet every 15 minutes.
To find out how much time it takes for him to consume all 5 tablets, we need to multiply the number of tablets by the time it takes to consume one tablet.

Action: Answer("E")

Explanation:
5 tablets \* 15 minutes/tablet = 75 minutes

However, since Roy starts taking the tablets immediately, the time it takes for him to consume all 5 tablets is actually 4 intervals of 15 minutes each, which is equal to 60 minutes or 1 hour.

Therefore, the correct answer is E: 60 Min.
## Result:
Agent Answer: E
Correct Answer: E
Score: 1
