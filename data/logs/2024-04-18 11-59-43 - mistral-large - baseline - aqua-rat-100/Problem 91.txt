## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: A starts travel towards south 3km, then travel 5 km towards east, and again travels 3 km to north, and finally travels 2km towards west. In the end how far from is A from home?
Choices:
  A: 3km
  B: 2km
  C: 4km
  D: 5km
  E: 6km
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
A travels 3km south, then 5km east, then 3km north, and finally 2km west.
To find the distance from home, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs of length 3km (south and north) and 3km (east and west).
The distance from home is the square root of (3^2 + 3^2) = sqrt(18) = 4.24km (rounded to two decimal places).
However, none of the answer choices match this value.
Therefore, we need to look for the closest answer choice.
The closest answer choice is "C: 4km".
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
