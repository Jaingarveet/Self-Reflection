Question: A hollow cube of size 5cm is taken, with the thickness of 1cm. It is made of smaller cubes of size 1cm .If the outer surface of the cube is painted how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted?
Choices:
  A: 438
  B: 550
  C: 500
  D: 450
  E: 498
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The total number of smaller cubes in the hollow cube is (5^3) - (3^3) = 125 - 27 = 98.
Each smaller cube has 6 faces, so there are a total of 98 \* 6 = 588 faces.
The outer surface of the cube has 6 faces, and each face has 25 smaller cubes, so there are a total of 6 \* 25 = 150 smaller cubes on the outer surface.
Each smaller cube on the outer surface has one face painted, so there are a total of 150 painted faces.
Therefore, the number of unpainted faces is 588 - 150 = 438.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
