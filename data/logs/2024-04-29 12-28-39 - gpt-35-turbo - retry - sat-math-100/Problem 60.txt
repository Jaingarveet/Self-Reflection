## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let's use algebra to solve the problem.
Let's call the number of students in the class "x".
From the problem, we know that:
n = 3x + 5 (since he has 5 milliliters left over when giving each student 3 milliliters)
n + 21 = 4x (since he needs an additional 21 milliliters when giving each student 4 milliliters)
We can solve for "n" in the first equation: n = 3x + 5
Then, we can substitute that expression for "n" in the second equation: 3x + 5 + 21 = 4x
Simplifying that equation, we get: x = 16
Action: Answer("A")
