## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The problem can be translated into an equation: $16+4x=14+10$. 
Simplifying the right side of the equation, we get $16+4x=24$.
Subtracting 16 from both sides, we get $4x=8$.
Dividing both sides by 4, we get $x=2$.
The problem asks for the value of $8x$, which is $8\times2=16$.
Action: Answer("C")
