## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Assistant 2:
Thought:
To solve the equation, we need to isolate the variable $x$.
First, we square both sides of the equation to eliminate the square root.
$$\begin{aligned} \sqrt{4 x}&=x-3 \\ (\sqrt{4 x})^2&=(x-3)^2 \\ 4x&=x^2-6x+9 \end{aligned}$$
Then, we move all the terms to one side of the equation and solve for $x$.
$$\begin{aligned} x^2-10x+9&=0 \\ (x-1)(x-9)&=0 \end{aligned}$$
Therefore, the solutions are $x=1$ and $x=9$.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: B
