Question: \begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}\cline { 2 - 3 }\multicolumn{1}{c|}{} & \multicolumn{2}{c|}{Handedness} \\\hlineGender & Left & Right \\\hline\hlineFemale &  &  \\\hlineMale &  &  \\\hline\hlineTotal & 18 & 122 \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}The incomplete table above summarizes the number of left-handed students and right-handed students by gender for the eighth-grade students atKeisel Middle School. There are 5 times as many right-handed female students as there are left-handed female students, and there are 9 times as many right-handed male students as there are left-handed male students. If there is a total of 18 left-handed students and 122 right-handed students in the school, which of the following is closest to the probability that a right-handed student selected at random is female? (Note: Assume that none of the eighth-grade students are both right-handed and left-handed.)
Choices:
  A: 0.410
  B: 0.357
  C: 0.333
  D: 0.250

## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The total number of students is 18 + 122 = 140.
Let's assume there are L left-handed female students, R right-handed female students, M left-handed male students, and N right-handed male students.
From the table, we know that L + R = 18 and M + N = 122.
Also, R = 5L and N = 9M.
Therefore, L + 5L = 6L and M + 9M = 10M.
So, the total number of female students is 6L and the total number of male students is 10M.
Thus, the probability that a right-handed student selected at random is female is (6L) / (R + N) = (6L) / (5L + 9M).
We need to find the value of (6L) / (5L + 9M) when L + R + M + N = 140 and L + 5L + M + 9M = 140.
Simplifying the second equation, we get 6L + 10M = 140, or 3L + 5M = 70.
We can substitute 5M = 70 - 3L into (6L) / (5L + 9M) to get (6L) / (5L + 9M) = (6L) / (5L + 9(70 - 3L)/5).
Simplifying this expression, we get (6L) / (5L + 126 - 27L/5) = (30L) / (99 - 2L).
We want to find the value of (6L) / (5L + 9M) when L + R + M + N = 140 and L + 5L + M + 9M = 140.
This is equivalent to finding the value of (30L) / (99 - 2L) when 6L + 10M = 140.
We can solve for M in terms of L from 6L + 10M = 140 to get M = (70 - 3L) / 5.
Substituting this into 3L + 5M = 70, we get 3L + 5(70 - 3L)/5 = 70, or L = 10.
Therefore, M = (70 - 3(10)) / 5 = 14.
Finally, we can substitute L = 10 and M = 14 into (30L) / (99 - 2L) to get (30(10)) / (99 - 2(10)) = 300 / 79.
