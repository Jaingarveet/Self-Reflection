## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Assistant 2:
Thought:
We can solve the system of equations using substitution or elimination method.
Let's use the elimination method to solve the system of equations.
Multiplying the second equation by 3, we get $-3x+6y=-57$.
Adding this equation to the first equation, we get $10y=-80$.
Therefore, $y=-8$.
Substituting $y=-8$ in the second equation, we get $x=3(-8)+19=-17$.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
