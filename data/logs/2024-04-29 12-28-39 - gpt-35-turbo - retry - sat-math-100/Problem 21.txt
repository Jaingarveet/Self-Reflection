## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Assistant 2:
Thought:
This is a quadratic equation in standard form, $a x^{2}+b x+c=0,$ where $a=3, b=12,$ and $c=6$.
We can solve this equation using the quadratic formula, which states that the solutions are given by:
$$
x=\frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^{2}-4 a c}}{2 a}
$$
Substituting the values of $a, b,$ and $c,$ we get:
$$
x=\frac{-12 \pm \sqrt{12^{2}-4 \cdot 3 \cdot 6}}{2 \cdot 3}=\frac{-12 \pm \sqrt{96}}{6}=-2 \pm \frac{2 \sqrt{6}}{3}
$$
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
