## Assistant 2:
Thought:
To solve for $a$, we can start by multiplying both sides of the equation by $(a x-2)$ to eliminate the denominator.
After simplifying, we can use the quadratic formula to solve for $x$.
However, we notice that the equation is in the form $\frac{A}{B}=\frac{C}{B}$, which implies that $A=C$ as long as $B\neq0$.
Therefore, we can set the numerators equal to each other and solve for $a$.
Action: Answer("C")
