## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The initial payment of $\$ 60$ is subtracted from the total price of $\$ 300$.
The remaining balance is divided by the weekly payment of $\$ 30$.
The equation that represents this is $300-60=30w$.
Simplifying this equation gives $240=30w$.
Dividing both sides by 30 gives $w=8$.
