## Assistant 2:
Reflection: I made a logic error here. I focused too much on the fact that land prices were rising, which is mentioned in choices A, B, and C, and did not consider the relationship between supply and demand, which is the correct answer choice D. 

Supply and demand are fundamental factors in determining housing prices, and if supply cannot keep up with demand, prices will rise. This statement casts doubt on the assertion that rising land prices are the chief culprit, as it suggests another primary factor at play.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
