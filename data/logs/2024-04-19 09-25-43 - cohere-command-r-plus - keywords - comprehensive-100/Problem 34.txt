Topic: Law
Context: The chairperson of Acme Corporation has decided to move the company from its current location in Milltown to Ocean View. Most Acme employees cannot afford housing within a 30-minute commute of Ocean View. So once the company has moved, most Acme employees will have a commute of more than 30 minutes.
Question: The argument requires assuming which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: All Acme employees can afford housing within a 30-minute commute of Milltown.
  B: The chairperson of Acme has good financial reasons for wanting to move the company to Ocean View.
  C: None of Acme's employees except the chairperson are in favor of moving the company to Ocean View.
  D: Currently, most Acme employees have a commute of less than 30 minutes.
  E: Acme's move to Ocean View will not be accompanied by a significant pay raise for Acme employees.

## Assistant 2:
Reflection: I missed the critical keyword "most," and my focus was too narrow. I should have considered that "most" employees couldn't afford housing near Ocean View, indicating that their current housing is likely cheaper, and thus inferred that their current commutes are likely shorter. This also implies that the move will likely result in longer commutes for these employees, providing the context for the correct answer.

Thought: 
The argument assumes that currently, most Acme employees have a commute of less than 30 minutes. This is because the issue of housing affordability in the new location is only relevant if the current commute times are being compared to potential future commute times. The fact that most employees cannot afford housing near the new location implies that their current housing may be cheaper and, therefore, likely farther from Milltown, resulting in shorter commute times.
Action: Answer("D")
