## Assistant 2:
Reflection: I made a calculation error in my previous answer. I incorrectly calculated the total amount received by the nephews and then further erred in calculating the share for the daughters. I will need to be more careful with my calculations and double-check my work to avoid similar mistakes in the future.

Thought: 
First, calculate the share for each nephew. 

There are 11 family members in total, so the number of nephews = 2/11 * 8600 = Rs. 1563.64 (rounded to two decimal places). 

Now, we can find the amount for each daughter, which is four times the amount for each nephew. 

Amount for each daughter = 4 * 1563.64 = Rs. 6254.56

Answer: Rs. 6254.56, which is closest to Rs. 6000, so the answer is C: Rs. 600.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: E
Score: 0
