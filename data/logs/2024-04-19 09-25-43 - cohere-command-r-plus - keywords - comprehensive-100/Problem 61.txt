## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

## Assistant 2:
Reflection: I made a distribution error in expanding the left side of the equation. The correct expansion of the left side is $abx^2+7ax+2bx+14$. Setting this equal to $15x^2+cx+14$ and comparing coefficients, I get $ab=15, 7a+2b=c$, and $c=119$. Substituting the value of $ab$ into the second equation, I get $7a+2b=119$. Using the fact that $a+b=8$, I can substitute and solve for the two possible values of $c$.

Thought: 
From the equation $a + b = 8$, we know that $a = 8 - b$. Substituting this into the equation $7a + 2b = 119$ and simplifying, we get $56 - 7b + 2b = 119$, which becomes $-5b = 63$. Therefore, $b = -63/5$. Substituting this value of $b$ and the value of $a$ into the equation $7a + 2b = c$, we get $c = 31$ for the first possible value. 

For the second possible value, we can substitute the value of $a$ back into the equation $a + b = 8$ to find a second value for $b$. This gives us $8 - b = 8$, so $b = 0$. Substituting these values of $a$ and $b$ into the equation for $c$, we get $c = 41$ as the second possible value. 

Therefore, the two possible values for $c$ are $31$ and $41$.
Action: Answer("D")
