Question: A straight picket fence is composed of x pickets each of which is 1/2 inch wide. If there are 6 inches of space between each pair of pickets, which of the following represents the length of fence in feet?
Choices:
  A: 13x/2
  B: 13x/2 - 6
  C: 13x/24
  D: (13x+1)/24
  E: (13x-12)/24

## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The total width of the pickets is $x \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{x}{2}$ inches.
The total width of the spaces is $6 \times (x-1) = 6x - 6$ inches.
The total width of the fence is the sum of the widths of the pickets and the spaces:
$$\frac{x}{2} + (6x - 6) = \frac{13x}{2} - 6$$
The width is asked for in feet, so we need to convert inches to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so we divide by 12:
$$\frac{\frac{13x}{2} - 6}{12} = \frac{13x/2 - 6}{12}$$
This can be simplified to $\frac{13x}{2} - \frac{1}{2}$ feet, which equals $\frac{13x}{2} - 6$ feet since there are 6 inches in half a foot.

Therefore, the answer is B: $13x/2 - 6$.

Reflection:
I made a simplification error in my previous attempt. I correctly found the total width of the fence in inches, but then I incorrectly simplified the expression when converting it to feet. I divided both the numerator and denominator by 12, but I should have only divided the numerator by 6 since there are 6 inches in half a foot. This correction yields the correct answer, choice B.
