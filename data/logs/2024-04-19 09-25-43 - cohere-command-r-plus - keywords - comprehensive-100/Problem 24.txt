## User 2:
Topic: Law
Context: Of the eight students—George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert—in a seminar, exactly six will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
Question: If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, could be given by

## Assistant 2:
Reflection: I made an assumption that Nina, Helen, and Irving must give consecutive reports, when in fact this is only true if Nina's report is not on Wednesday.

Thought: 
Tuesday is the only day George can give a report, so he must give the afternoon report, with Helen or Irving giving the morning report.

If Nina gives a morning report on Monday, Helen and Irving must give the Tuesday and Wednesday morning reports, respectively.

Therefore, the correct answer is B: Irving, Robert, and Helen.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: D
