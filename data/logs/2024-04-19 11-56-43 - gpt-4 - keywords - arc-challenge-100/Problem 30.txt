# Model: gpt-4 | Agent: keywords | Exam: arc-challenge-100 | Problem 30 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Science.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines

## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Science
Question: When moist air comes in contact with a cold surface in the winter, one result can be frost. What has happened to the water vapor in the air to cause frost?
Choices:
  A: It has melted.
  B: It has sublimated.
  C: It has evaporated.
  D: It has condensed.

## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Frost is formed when water vapor in the air comes into contact with a cold surface and changes directly from a gas (water vapor) to a solid (ice) without becoming a liquid first. This process is known as deposition, which is a type of phase transition. However, deposition is not an option in the choices. The closest option to deposition is sublimation, but sublimation is the transition from solid to gas, not gas to solid. Therefore, the correct answer should be the process where gas turns into a solid or liquid, which is condensation.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
