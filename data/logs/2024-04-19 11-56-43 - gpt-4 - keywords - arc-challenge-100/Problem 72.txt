## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Inherited traits are those that are passed down from parents to their offspring through genes. Height, hair color, skin color, and intelligence are all traits that can be influenced by genetics. However, all of these traits can also be influenced by environmental factors. For example, a person's height can be influenced by their diet and nutrition during their growing years. Hair color can be changed artificially. Skin color can change based on sun exposure. Intelligence can be influenced by a person's environment and experiences. Therefore, all of these traits are both inherited and influenced by the environment.
