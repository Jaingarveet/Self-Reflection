Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to set a table [title] Put down the placemat. [step] Put a placemat in front of each of the chairs you've set up for your guests. [substeps] For a true formal dinner setting, you should have enough matching placemats for all of the guests, and the placemats should also match the tablecloth.
Choices:
  A: [title] Place more cloth napkins around the table. [step] Depending on your guests' tastes and how formal the event is, and what your menu calls for, you may need more napkins to help hold the tablecloth together.
  B: [title] Place the napkin on the left side of the placemat. [step] Fold the napkin in halves or fourths, depending on the napkin.
  C: You should also have enough placemats that are about 2 feet (0.91 m) off the ground. [title] Set the tablecloth right next to the chairs.
  D: For a fancier dinner setting, you may want to ask for some placemats that have even more flair. These include boutonnieres, bold colored napkins and other embellishments.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The text is about setting a table, specifically placing the placemat.
The next logical step would be to place something on the placemat. 
Out of the choices, only placing the napkin makes sense.
