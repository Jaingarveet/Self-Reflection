Which of the following represents the original price of the computer in terms of $p$ ?
Choices:
  A: $0.88 p$
  B: $\frac{p}{0.88}$
  C: $(0.8)(1.08) p$
  D: $\frac{p}{(0.8)(1.08)}$

Solution:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames.
The city name "Ames" contains 4 letters.
The state name "Iowa" contains 4 letters.
The product of 4*4 is 16.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The original price of the computer can be found by first finding the discounted price before tax, and then finding the original price before the discount.
The discounted price before tax is 8% less than the discounted price after tax, so it is 92% of the discounted price after tax.
The discounted price after tax is the total amount paid, $p$.
So the discounted price before tax is $0.92p$.
The original price before the discount is 20% more than the discounted price before tax, so it is 120% of the discounted price before tax.
So the original price before the discount is $1.2(0.92p) = (1.2)(0.92)p = (0.8)(1.08)^{-1}p$.
To isolate $p$, we can multiply both sides by $(0.8)(1.08)$, giving us $p = (0.8)(1.08)(0.8)(1.08)^{-1}p = (0.8)(1.08)p$.
Therefore, the original price of the computer in terms of $p$ is $\frac{p}{(0.8)(1.08)}$.
