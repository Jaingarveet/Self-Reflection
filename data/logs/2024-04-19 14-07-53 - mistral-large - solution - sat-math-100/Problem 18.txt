## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: Which of the following is equivalent to $9^{\frac{3}{4}}$ ?
Choices:
  A: $\sqrt[3]{9}$
  B: $\sqrt[4]{9}$
  C: $\sqrt{3}$
  D: $3 \sqrt{3}$

Solution:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
Iowa State University is located in the state of Iowa.
The city name "Ames" contains 4 letters.
The state name "Iowa" contains 4 letters.
The product of 4*4 is 16.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The given question is asking for the equivalent expression of $9^{\frac{3}{4}}$.
To solve this, we need to understand that $a^{\frac{m}{n}}$ is equivalent to $\sqrt[n]{a^m}$.
Therefore, $9^{\frac{3}{4}}$ is equivalent to $\sqrt[4]{9^3}$.
Now, let's evaluate the given choices:
A: $\sqrt[3]{9}$ is equivalent to $9^{\frac{1}{3}}$, which is not equal to $9^{\frac{3}{4}}$.
B: $\sqrt[4]{9}$ is equivalent to $9^{\frac{1}{4}}$, which is not equal to $9^{\frac{3}{4}}$.
C: $\sqrt{3}$ is equivalent to $3^{\frac{1}{2}}$, which is not equal to $9^{\frac{3}{4}}$.
D: $3 \sqrt{3}$ is equivalent to $3 \cdot 3^{\frac{1}{2}}$, which is not equal to $9^{\frac{3}{4}}$.

None of the given choices are equivalent to $9^{\frac{3}{4}}$. However, since I must select one of the available choices, I will re-evaluate the question and the choices.

Thought:
Let's simplify $9^{\frac{3}{4}}$ further:
$9^{\frac{3}{4}} = \sqrt[4]{9^3} = \sqrt[4]{729}$
Now, let's evaluate the given choices again:
A: $\sqrt[3]{9}$ is not equal to $\sqrt[4]{729}$.
B: $\sqrt[4]{9}$ is not equal to $\sqrt[4]{729}$.
C: $\sqrt{3}$ is not equal to $\sqrt[4]{729}$.
D: $3 \sqrt{3}$ is not equal to $\sqrt[4]{729}$.

I still cannot find the correct answer among the given choices. However, since I must select one of the available choices, I will make an educated guess.

Action: Answer("B") (since it is closer to the correct answer than the other choices)
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
