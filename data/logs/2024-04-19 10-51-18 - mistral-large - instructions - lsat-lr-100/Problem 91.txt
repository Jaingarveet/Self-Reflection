Context: People who are allergic to cats are actually allergic to certain proteins found in the animals' skin secretions and saliva; which particular proteins are responsible, however, varies from allergy sufferer to allergy sufferer. Since all cats shed skin and spread saliva around their environment, there is no such thing as a cat incapable of provoking allergic reactions, although it is common for a given cat to cause an allergic reaction in some-but not all-people who are allergic to cats.
Question: Which one of the following statements is most strongly supported by the information above?
Choices:
  A: Any particular individual will be allergic to some breeds of cat but not to others.
  B: No cat is capable of causing an allergic reaction in all types of allergy sufferers.
  C: Not all cats are identical with respect to the proteins contained in their skin secretions and saliva.
  D: The allergic reactions of some people who are allergic to cats are more intense than the allergic reactions of other allergy sufferers.
  E: There is no way to predict whether a given cat will produce an allergic reaction in a particular allergy sufferer.

## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The main point being asked is which statement is most strongly supported by the information provided.
The context provided states that people who are allergic to cats are actually allergic to certain proteins found in the animals' skin secretions and saliva, and that it varies from allergy sufferer to allergy sufferer. It also states that all cats shed skin and spread saliva around their environment, so there is no such thing as a cat incapable of provoking allergic reactions. However, it is common for a given cat to cause an allergic reaction in some-but not all-people who are allergic to cats.
Answer choice A is not supported by the information provided, as it is not stated that any particular individual will be allergic to some breeds of cat but not to others.
Answer choice B is supported by the information provided, as it is stated that it is common for a given cat to cause an allergic reaction in some-but not all-people who are allergic to cats.
Answer choice C is not supported by the information provided, as it is not stated that not all cats are identical with respect to the proteins contained in their skin secretions and saliva.
Answer choice D is not supported by the information provided, as it is not stated that the allergic reactions of some people who are allergic to cats are more intense than the allergic reactions of other allergy sufferers.
Answer choice E is not supported by the information provided, as it is not stated that there is no way to predict whether a given cat will produce an allergic reaction in a particular allergy sufferer.
Action: Answer("B")

Self-reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly by choosing answer choice C. I realized that the information provided does not support the statement that not all cats are identical with respect to the proteins contained in their skin secretions and saliva. I also realized that answer choice B is supported by the information provided, as it is stated that it is common for a given cat to cause an allergic reaction in some-but not all-people who are allergic to cats. Therefore, I have corrected my answer to choice B.
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
