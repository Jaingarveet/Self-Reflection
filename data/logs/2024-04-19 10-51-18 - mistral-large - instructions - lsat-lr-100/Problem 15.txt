## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Morgenstern's argument assumes that the only risk involved in quitting a job is not finding another one, and that Brooks' current unhappiness is equivalent to the potential unhappiness of not finding another job. However, there may be other risks involved in quitting a job, such as financial instability, loss of benefits, or damage to professional reputation. Additionally, the intensity or significance of Brooks' current unhappiness may not be equivalent to the potential unhappiness of not finding another job.
