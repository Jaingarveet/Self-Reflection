Topic: Law
Context: Editorial: This political party has repeatedly expressed the view that increasing spending on education is a worthy goal. On other occasions, however, the same party has claimed that the government should not increase spending on education. So this party's policy is clearly inconsistent.
Question: The argument in the editorial depends on assuming which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: It is inconsistent for a legislator both to claim that increasing spending on education is a worthy goal and to vote against increasing spending on education.
  B: A consistent course of action in educational policy is usually the course of action that will reduce spending on education in the long run.
  C: Even if a goal is a morally good one, one should not necessarily try to achieve it.
  D: A consistent political policy does not hold that an action that comprises a worthy goal should not be performed.
  E: Members of one political party never have inconsistent views on how to best approach a political issue.
Reflection:

Instructions:
1. Identify the argument in the editorial.
2. Determine the assumption underlying the argument.
3. Evaluate each answer choice to determine which one best represents the assumption underlying the argument.
4. Choose the answer that best represents the assumption underlying the argument.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The argument in the editorial is that the political party's policy is inconsistent because they have expressed the view that increasing spending on education is a worthy goal, but have also claimed that the government should not increase spending on education.
The assumption underlying the argument is that it is inconsistent for a political party to hold both of these views.

Evaluation of answer choices:
A: This choice correctly identifies the assumption underlying the argument.
B: This choice is not relevant to the argument.
C: This choice is not relevant to the argument.
D: This choice is not relevant to the argument.
E: This choice is not relevant to the argument.

Action: Answer("A")

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly because I did not carefully evaluate each answer choice to determine which one best represented the assumption underlying the argument. I have now corrected my mistake by carefully evaluating each answer choice and choosing the one that best represents the assumption underlying the argument.
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: D
