  B: Generally one should tell the truth, but there are cases in which it is permissible not to.
  C: If people have used your property without your permission, it is not wrong for you to use their property without their permission.
  D: It is permissible to treat people in a way that is siruilar to the way in which they have treated others.
  E: Using another person's property is wrong if the person is harmed by that use.
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and identify the reasoning that needs to be justified.
2. Consider the broader principles that could justify this reasoning, rather than focusing too narrowly on specific examples.
3. Evaluate each answer choice in light of these broader principles.
4. Choose the answer that most closely aligns with the broader principle that could justify the reasoning.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The reasoning that needs to be justified is Mike's belief that it is not wrong for him to use Tom's computer without permission because Tom used Mary's bicycle without permission.
The broader principle that could justify this reasoning is that it is permissible to treat people in a way that is similar to the way in which they have treated others.
Action: Answer("D")

Self-reflection:
Previously, I incorrectly answered this question by focusing too narrowly on the specific example of using someone's property without permission. I chose answer choice "A" because it seemed to align with Mike's reasoning that using Tom's computer without permission was not necessarily wrong. However, upon reflection, I realized that this answer choice was too narrow and did not address the broader principle that could justify Mike's reasoning. The correct answer is "D" because it aligns with the broader principle that it is permissible to treat people in a way that is similar to the way in which they have treated others. This principle could justify Mike's belief that it is not wrong for him to use Tom's computer without permission because Tom used Mary's bicycle without permission.
