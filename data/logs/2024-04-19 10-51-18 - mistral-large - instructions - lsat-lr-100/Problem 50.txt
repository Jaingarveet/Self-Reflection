Topic: Law
Context: Cigarette companies claim that manufacturing both low-and high-nicotine cigarettes allows smokers to choose how much nicotine they want. However, a recent study has shown that the levels of nicotine found in the blood of smokers who smoke one pack of cigarettes per day are identical at the end of a day's worth of smoking, whatever the level of nicotine in the cigarettes they smoke.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain the finding of the nicotine study?
Choices:
  A: Blood cannot absorb more nicotine per day than that found in the smoke from a package of the lowest-nicotine cigarettes available.
  B: Smokers of the lowest-nicotine cigarettes available generally smoke more cigarettes per day than smokers of high-nicotine cigarettes.
  C: Most nicotine is absorbed into the blood of a smoker even if it is delivered in smaller quantities.
  D: The level of tar in cigarettes is higher in low-nicotine cigarettes than it is in some high-nicotine cigarettes.
  E: When taking in nicotine by smoking cigarettes is discontinued, the level of nicotine in the blood decreases steadily.

Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and understand the finding of the study.
2. Consider the possible explanations for the finding.
3. Evaluate each answer choice based on its relevance to the finding.
4. Focus on the physiological mechanism of nicotine absorption rather than the behavior of smokers.
5. Consider the possibility of a physiological limit to nicotine absorption.
6. Choose the answer that best explains the finding based on the physiological mechanism of nicotine absorption.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The finding of the study is that the levels of nicotine found in the blood of smokers who smoke one pack of cigarettes per day are identical at the end of a day's worth of smoking, whatever the level of nicotine in the cigarettes they smoke.
The possible explanations for this finding could be related to the physiological mechanism of nicotine absorption or the behavior of smokers.
Answer choice A suggests that there is a physiological limit to nicotine absorption, which could explain why the levels of nicotine in the blood are identical regardless of the level of nicotine in the cigarettes.
Answer choice B suggests that smokers of low-nicotine cigarettes smoke more cigarettes per day, which could explain why the levels of nicotine in the blood are identical. However, this explanation is related to the behavior of smokers rather than the physiological mechanism of nicotine absorption.
Answer choice C suggests that most nicotine is absorbed into the blood even if it is delivered in smaller quantities, which could explain why the levels of nicotine in the blood are identical regardless of the level of nicotine in the cigarettes. However, this explanation does not account for the possibility of a physiological limit to nicotine absorption.
Answer choice D suggests that the level of tar in cigarettes is higher in low-nicotine cigarettes than it is in some high-nicotine cigarettes, which is not relevant to the finding of the study.
Answer choice E suggests that when taking in nicotine by smoking cigarettes is discontinued, the level of nicotine in the blood decreases steadily, which is not relevant to the finding of the study.
Action: Answer("A")
