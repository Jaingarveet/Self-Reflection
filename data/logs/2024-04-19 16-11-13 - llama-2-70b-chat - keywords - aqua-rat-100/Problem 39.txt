## Assistant 2:
  My apologies for my previous mistake. Let's reflect on the problem and the correct answer.
The correct answer is 720.
The formula to arrange objects in a row is (n+1)! / (n! x 1!).
In this case, we have 6 subjects: English, Hindi, Mathematics, History, Geography, and Science.
So, n = 6.
Plugging in n = 6 into the formula, we get:
(6+1)! / (6! x 1!) = 720

Therefore, the answer is B: 720.

Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
