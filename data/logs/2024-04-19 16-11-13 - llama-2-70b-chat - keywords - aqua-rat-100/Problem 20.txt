## Assistant 2:
  My apologies for my previous mistake. Let's reflect on the problem and the correct answer.
The question states that the ratio of boys to girls is 4:3, and the same number of boys and girls joined the group during the membership drive. This means that the number of boys who joined the group is 4/7 of the total number of members, and the number of girls who joined the group is 3/7 of the total number of members.
The total number of members in the group is 64 boys + 40 girls = 104.
The number of boys who joined the group is 4/7 \* 104 = 40.
The number of girls who joined the group is 3/7 \* 104 = 30.
Now, the total number of members in the group is 64 + 40 + 30 = 134.
The correct answer is B: 288.
Action: Answer("B")

Agent Answer: B
