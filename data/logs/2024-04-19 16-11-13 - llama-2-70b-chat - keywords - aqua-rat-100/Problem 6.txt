## Assistant 2:
  My apologies for my previous response. I made a mistake in my calculation.
Let's break down the problem step by step:
1. Mr. Brown paints a house in 6 days.
2. Mr. Brown goes on vacation after 8 days.
3. Mr. Black begins to work for a period of 6 days.
4. Mr. Blue will complete the contract.

We can calculate the total number of days Mr. Brown and Mr. Black worked together:
8 days - 6 days = 2 days

Now, we can calculate the number of days Mr. Blue will take to complete the contract:
12 days - 2 days = 10 days

Therefore, the correct answer is:
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
