Error Keywords:

* Misunderstanding of least common multiple (LCM)
* Calculation error
## Assistant 2:
  My apologies for my previous mistake. I misunderstood the least common multiple (LCM) concept and made a calculation error.
To solve this problem, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 16 and 17.
The multiples of 16 are: 16, 32, 48, 64, 80, ...
The multiples of 17 are: 17, 34, 51, 68, 85, ...
The first number that appears in both lists is 80, which is the least common multiple of 16 and 17.
Therefore, it will take 80 minutes for Train A and Train B to leave the station simultaneously again.
Action: Answer("D") 80 minutes.
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
