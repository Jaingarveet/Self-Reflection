## Assistant 2:
  My apologies for my previous mistake. Let's reflect on the question and the correct answer.
The question states that the man saves 12 1/2% of his income, which means he spends 87 1/2% of his income.
The amount he spends is given as Rs. 3500.
To find his monthly income, we can set up the following equation:
Income = 3500 / (1 - 0.125)
= 3500 / 0.875
= 4000

So, the correct answer is C: Rs. 4000.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
