## Assistant 2:
  Sure, I'll do my best to answer the question.

Here's my reflection on the previous solution:

Previously, I incorrectly answered this question as 58.
Upon reviewing the solution, I realized that I made a calculation error.
I mistakenly added 4 feet to the length of the square cloth instead of subtracting it.
The correct calculation for the perimeter of the original square cloth is:
P = 4s, where s is the length of each side.
Since the square cloth is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge, the length of each side is 4 feet less than the original length.
Therefore, the perimeter of the original square cloth is:
P = 4(s - 4) = 4s - 16.
Given that the area of each triangle is 70 square feet, the length of each side of the square cloth must be 10 feet (since the area of a triangle is equal to half the base times the height, and the base of each triangle is half the length of the side of the square).
Thus, the perimeter of the original square cloth is:
P = 4(10 - 4) = 4(6) = 24 feet.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
Action: Answer("E") 24
