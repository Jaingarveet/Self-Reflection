## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Assistant 2:
  My apologies for my previous mistake. Let's analyze the question again.
The given expression x = (n2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16) / (n + 4√n + 4) can be simplified as follows:

x = (n2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16) / (n + 4√n + 4)
x = (n2 + 2n(n + 4) + 16) / (n + 4)
x = (n2 + 2n2 + 8n + 16) / (n + 4)
x = (n2 + 2n2 + 8n + 16) / (n + 4)

Now, we can see that the numerator and denominator have a common factor of n + 4, which cancels out:

x = (n2 + 2n2 + 8n + 16) / (n + 4)
x = (n2 + 2n2 + 8n + 16) / (n + 4)
x = (n2 + 2n2 + 8n + 16 - 4n - 4) / (n + 4 - 4)
x = (n2 + 2n2 + 8n + 12) / n + 4 - 4
x = (n2 + 2n2 + 8n + 12) / n

Since n is between 36 and 72, n is always positive. Therefore, the expression inside the parentheses is always positive:

n2 + 2n2 + 8n + 12 > 0

So, x is always positive, and we can conclude that:

20 < x < 54

Therefore, the correct answer is option A.
