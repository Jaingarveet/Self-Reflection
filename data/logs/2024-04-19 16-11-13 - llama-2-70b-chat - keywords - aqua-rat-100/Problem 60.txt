## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Assistant 2:
  My apologies for my previous response. After reflecting on the problem, I realized that my mistake was in the reasoning process. I misapplied the concept of angle bisectors.

To solve this problem, we can draw a line from point B to the center of the circle, which will bisect the minor arc AC.

Using the properties of angle bisectors, we can say that:

* Angle BAC = Angle BDA
* Angle BAD = Angle BCD

We know that Angle BAC = 160° and Angle BCD = 150°. Therefore, we can conclude that:

* Angle BAD = 150° - 160° = -10°

Since minor arc AD is the sum of Angle BAD and Angle BDA, we have:

* Minor arc AD = Angle BAD + Angle BDA = -10° + 160° = 150°

Therefore, the correct answer is:

Action: Answer("C")

I hope this answer is correct. Please let me know if there is any further mistake.
