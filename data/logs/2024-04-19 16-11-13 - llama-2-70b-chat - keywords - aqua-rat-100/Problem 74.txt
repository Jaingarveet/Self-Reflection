## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

## Assistant 2:
  My apologies for my previous mistake. I misunderstood the question and incorrectly interpreted the concept of "different" quadrilaterals.

To find the number of different quadrilaterals that can be formed by joining 4 of the points A, B, C, D, E, and F, we need to consider the following:

* The number of ways to choose 4 points from 6 points (A, B, C, D, E, and F)
* The number of ways to form a quadrilateral with 4 points

There are 6C4 ways to choose 4 points from 6 points:

6C4 = 15

Now, we need to find the number of ways to form a quadrilateral with 4 points. We can form a quadrilateral by joining any 4 points in a cycle. There are 4! ways to arrange 4 points in a cycle:

4! = 24

However, we need to divide this number by 4, since we don't want to count the orientation of the quadrilateral.

24/4 = 6

Therefore, the total number of different quadrilaterals that can be formed by joining 4 of the points A, B, C, D, E, and F is:

15 x 6 = 90

Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: D
