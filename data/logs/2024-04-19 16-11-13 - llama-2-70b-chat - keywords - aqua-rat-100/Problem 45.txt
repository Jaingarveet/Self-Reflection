## Assistant 2:
  My apologies for my previous mistake. I realize that I misunderstood the question and confused profit and discount.
To find the selling price that will give Karan a 20% profit after offering a 20% discount, we need to first find 20% of the cost price, which is Rs. 1200 x 20% = Rs. 240.
Then, we add the profit to the cost price: Rs. 1200 + Rs. 240 = Rs. 1440.
Finally, we find 20% of the selling price and subtract it from the selling price to get the discounted price: Rs. 1440 x 20% = Rs. 288.
Therefore, the selling price that will give Karan a 20% profit after offering a 20% discount is Rs. 1440 - Rs. 288 = Rs. 1152.
