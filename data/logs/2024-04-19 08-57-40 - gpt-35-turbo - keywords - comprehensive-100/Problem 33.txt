## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The argument states that violent crime is becoming a serious problem in the town and that the average citizen is more likely than ever to become a victim of a violent crime. To weaken this argument, we need to find a statement that contradicts this claim.
Option A does not contradict the argument, as it states that the overall crime rate has risen slightly this year compared to the same period last year, which could include violent crimes.
Option B is irrelevant to the argument, as it talks about the likelihood of different age groups becoming victims of violent crimes, but it does not address the claim that violent crime is becoming a serious problem in the town.
Option C strengthens the argument, as it suggests that the increase in reported violent crimes could be due to more people being willing to report them, rather than an actual increase in the number of violent crimes.
Option D is irrelevant to the argument, as it talks about a community center providing supervised activities for teenagers, but it does not address the claim that violent crime is becoming a serious problem in the town.
Option E weakens the argument, as it suggests that a relatively small number of repeat offenders commit the majority of violent crimes in the town, which means that the average citizen is not necessarily more likely than ever to become a victim of a violent crime.
Action: Answer("E")
