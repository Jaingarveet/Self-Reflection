Context: Editorial: Painting involves a sequential application of layers, each of which adheres satisfactorily only if the underlying layer has been properly applied. Education is, in this respect, like the craft of painting. Since the most important steps in painting are preparation of the surface to be painted and application of the primer coat, it makes sense to suppose that .
Question: Which one of the following most logically completes the editorial's argument?
Choices:
  A: in the educator's initial contact with a student, the educator should be as undemanding as possible
  B: students who have a secure grasp of the fundamentals of a subject are likely to make progress in that subject
  C: educators who are not achieving the goals they intended should revise their teaching methods
  D: teaching new students is rewarding but much more difficult than teaching more advanced students
  E: the success of a student's overall educational experience depends above all upon that student's initial educational experience

## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The editorial compares education to painting, stating that both require proper preparation and application of foundational layers. The missing statement should complete this analogy. 
Choice A is irrelevant to the analogy between painting and education. 
Choice B is relevant to the analogy, but it does not complete the argument. 
Choice C is not relevant to the analogy between painting and education. 
Choice D is not relevant to the analogy between painting and education. 
Choice E completes the analogy by stating that the success of a student's overall educational experience depends on their initial educational experience, just as the success of a painting depends on the proper application of foundational layers. 
Action: Answer("E")
## Result:
Agent Answer: E
Correct Answer: E
Score: 1
