Comedonal acne is a type of acne that is characterized by blackheads and whiteheads. It is usually treated with topical retinoids, which help to unclog pores and prevent the formation of new comedones. Topical antibiotics are used to treat inflammatory acne, while benzoyl peroxide is used to treat mild to moderate acne. Estrogen is not used to treat acne.
