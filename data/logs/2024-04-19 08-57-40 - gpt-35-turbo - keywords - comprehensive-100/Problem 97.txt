## Assistant 2:
Reflection:
I misremembered the mode of inheritance for Hypophosphatemic Vitamin D Resistant Rickets. I previously answered that it was X-linked dominant, but the correct answer is X-linked recessive. I need to remember that this condition is caused by mutations in the PHEX gene, which is located on the X chromosome. X-linked recessive conditions are more common in males because they only have one X chromosome, while females have two X chromosomes and can be carriers without showing symptoms.
