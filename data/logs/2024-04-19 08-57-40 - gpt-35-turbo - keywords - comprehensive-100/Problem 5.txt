## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let the number of members in the club be n.
The youngest member is 7 years old, so the sum of their ages is n(7).
The sum of an arithmetic progression is given by the formula S = n/2(2a + (n-1)d), where a is the first term, d is the common difference, and n is the number of terms.
In this case, a = 7, d = 3/12 = 1/4, and S = 250.
Substituting these values into the formula, we get 250 = n/2(2(7) + (n-1)(1/4)).
Simplifying the equation, we get 2n^2 + 13n - 1400 = 0.
Factoring the quadratic equation, we get (n-25)(2n+56) = 0.
Since n cannot be negative, n = 25.
Action: Answer("C")
