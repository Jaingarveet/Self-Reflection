## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let's use the formula: time = distance / speed
Let's call the time they meet as "t".
The total distance they travel is 50 miles.
The first car's speed is 12 mph, so it travels 12t miles.
The second car's speed is 13 mph, so it travels 13t miles.
The sum of the distances traveled by both cars is 50 miles.
So, 12t + 13t = 50
25t = 50
t = 2
