## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Question: $$h=-16 t^{2}+v t+k$$The equation above gives the height $h$, in feet, of a ball $t$ seconds after it is thrown straight up with an initial speed of $v$ feet per second from a height of $k$ feet. Which of the following gives $v$ in terms of $h, t$, and $k$ ?
Choices:
  A: $v=h+k-16 t$
  B: $v=\frac{h-k+16}{t}$
  C: $v=\frac{h+k}{t}-16 t$
  D: $v=\frac{h-k}{t}+16 t$

## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The equation is in the form of a quadratic equation, where $h$ is the dependent variable, $t$ is the independent variable, and $v$ and $k$ are the coefficients.
To solve for $v$, we need to isolate it in the equation.
We can start by moving the constant term $k$ to the other side of the equation:
$$h-k=-16 t^{2}+v t$$
Next, we can factor out $t$ from the right side of the equation:
$$h-k=t(-16 t+v)$$
Finally, we can solve for $v$ by dividing both sides of the equation by $-16 t+v$:
$$v=\frac{h-k}{t}+16 t$$
Action: Answer("D")
