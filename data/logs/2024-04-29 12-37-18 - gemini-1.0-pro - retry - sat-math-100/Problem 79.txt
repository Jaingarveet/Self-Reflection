## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: A helicopter, initially hovering 40 feet above the ground, begins to gain altitude at a rate of 21 feet per second. Which of the following functions represents the helicopter's altitude above the ground $y$, in feet, $t$ seconds after the helicopter begins to gain altitude?
Choices:
  A: $y=40+21$
  B: $y=40+21 t$
  C: $y=40-21 t$
  D: $y=40 t+21$

## Assistant 2:
## Reflecting on the previous mistake:
My previous answer was incorrect because I misinterpreted the problem. I thought the helicopter was descending instead of ascending. This led me to choose the wrong function.
## Analyzing the problem:
The helicopter is initially hovering at 40 feet and then starts ascending at a rate of 21 feet per second. This means that its altitude is increasing by 21 feet every second. We can represent this with the following equation:
```
y = 40 + 21t
```
where:
* `y` is the helicopter's altitude in feet
* `t` is the time in seconds since the helicopter started ascending
* `40` is the initial altitude of the helicopter
* `21` is the rate of ascent
## Choosing the correct answer:
The equation that represents the helicopter's altitude is:
```
y = 40 + 21t
```
Therefore, the correct answer is:
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
