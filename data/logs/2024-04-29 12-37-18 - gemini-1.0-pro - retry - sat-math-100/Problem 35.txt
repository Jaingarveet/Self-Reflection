## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Assistant 2:
## Reflection on Previous Incorrect Answer
**My previous answer:** I incorrectly answered that the solution to the equation was x = 1.
**Reasoning behind my incorrect answer:** I made a mistake in my algebraic manipulation. I squared both sides of the equation without considering the possibility of introducing extraneous solutions.
**Correct solution:**
1. Square both sides of the equation:
$$(\sqrt{4x})^2 = (x-3)^2$$
$$4x = x^2 - 6x + 9$$
2. Move all terms to one side:
$$0 = x^2 - 10x + 9$$
3. Factor the quadratic:
$$0 = (x-1)(x-9)$$
4. Solve for x:
$$x = 1 \text{ or } x = 9$$
**Analysis of the correct answer:**
- Both solutions, x = 1 and x = 9, satisfy the original equation.
- The solution x = 1 does not introduce an extraneous solution because it satisfies the original equation.
- The solution x = 9 does not introduce an extraneous solution because it also satisfies the original equation.
**Conclusion:**
The correct answer is **C: I and II**. Both solutions, x = 1 and x = 9, satisfy the given equation.
**Action:** Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: B
