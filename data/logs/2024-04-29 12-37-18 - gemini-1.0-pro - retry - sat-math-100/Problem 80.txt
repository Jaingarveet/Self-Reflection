## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Assistant 2:
## Step-by-step solution:
1. **Rewrite both equations in slope-intercept form:**
    - Equation 1: $kx - 3y = 4$
        - Subtract $kx$ from both sides: $-3y = -kx + 4$
        - Divide both sides by $-3$: $y = \dfrac{k}{3}x - \dfrac{4}{3}$
    - Equation 2: $4x - 5y = 7$
        - Subtract $4x$ from both sides: $-5y = -4x + 7$
        - Divide both sides by $-5$: $y = \dfrac{4}{5}x - \dfrac{7}{5}$
2. **For the system to have no solution, the lines must be parallel.**
3. **Parallel lines have the same slope but different y-intercepts.**
4. **Therefore, the slope of the first equation must be equal to the slope of the second equation.**
5. **Set the slopes equal to each other and solve for k:**
    $\dfrac{k}{3} = \dfrac{4}{5}$
    $5k = 12$
    $k = \dfrac{12}{5}$
Therefore, the value of $k$ for which the system of equations has no solution is $\dfrac{12}{5}$.
Action: Answer("A")
