## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The function is linear, so it can be represented by an equation of the form $f(n) = mn + b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept.
We can find the slope by taking the difference of any two outputs and dividing by the difference of the corresponding inputs. For example, using the first two rows of the table, we get: $m = \frac{f(2) - f(1)}{2 - 1} = \frac{1 - (-2)}{2 - 1} = 3$.
We can find the y-intercept by plugging in any point from the table and solving for $b$. For example, using the first row of the table, we get: $-2 = 3 \cdot 1 + b$, so $b = -5$.
Therefore, the equation of the function is $f(n) = 3n - 5$.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
