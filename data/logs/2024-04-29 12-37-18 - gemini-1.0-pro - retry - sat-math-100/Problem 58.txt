## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Assistant 2:
I understand. I will try my best to answer the question correctly this time.
**Step 1: Understanding the inequalities**
The first inequality, $y<-x+a$, represents the region below the line $y=-x+a$. The second inequality, $y>x+b$, represents the region above the line $y=x+b$.
**Step 2: Finding the solution region**
The solution to the system of inequalities is the intersection of the two regions. Since $(0,0)$ is a solution, it must lie in this intersection.
**Step 3: Analyzing the lines**
The line $y=-x+a$ has a slope of $-1$ and a y-intercept of $a$. The line $y=x+b$ has a slope of $1$ and a y-intercept of $b$.
**Step 4: Determining the relationship between a and b**
Since $(0,0)$ lies on both lines, we have the following equations:
$$0=-0+a$$
$$0=0+b$$
Solving for $a$ and $b$, we get:
$$a=0$$
$$b=0$$
Therefore, the relationship between $a$ and $b$ is $a=b$.
**Answer: D**
