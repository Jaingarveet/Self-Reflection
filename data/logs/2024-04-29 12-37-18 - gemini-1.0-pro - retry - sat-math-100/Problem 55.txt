## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: $$y=-(x-3)^{2}+a$$In the equation above, $a$ is a constant. The graph of the equation in the $x y$-plane is a parabola. Which of the following is true about the parabola?
Choices:
  A: Its minimum occurs at $(-3, a)$.
  B: Its minimum occurs at $(3, a)$.
  C: Its maximum occurs at $(-3, a)$.
  D: Its maximum occurs at $(3, a)$.

## Assistant 2:
I understand. I will try my best to answer the question correctly this time.
**Step 1: Identify the key features of the equation.**
The equation is in the form of a quadratic function, specifically a vertical parabola. The coefficient of the leading term is negative, which means the parabola opens downwards. The vertex of the parabola is at the point $(3, a)$.
**Step 2: Analyze the effect of the constant term.**
The constant term, $a$, shifts the entire parabola vertically. If $a$ is positive, the parabola is shifted upwards. If $a$ is negative, the parabola is shifted downwards.
**Step 3: Determine the maximum or minimum point.**
Since the parabola opens downwards, its vertex is the maximum point. Therefore, the maximum value of the function occurs at $(3, a)$.
**Answer: D**
**Reflection:**
In my previous attempt, I incorrectly identified the vertex as the minimum point. I have now corrected my understanding and provided the correct answer.
## Result:
Agent Answer: None
