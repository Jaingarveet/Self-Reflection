## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Question: A line in the $x y$-plane passes through the origin and has a slope of $\frac{1}{7}$. Which of the following points lies on the line?
Choices:
  A: $(0,7)$
  B: $(1,7)$
  C: $(7,7)$
  D: $(14,2)$

## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The line passes through the origin, so its equation is of the form $y = mx$, where $m$ is the slope.
Since the slope is $\frac{1}{7}$, the equation of the line is $y = \frac{1}{7}x$.
The only point that satisfies this equation is $(7,1)$.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
