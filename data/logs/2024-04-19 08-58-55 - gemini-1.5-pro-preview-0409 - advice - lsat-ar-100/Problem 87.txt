## Assistant 2:
## Reflection on Previous Attempt:
In my previous attempt, I likely focused too much on the individual constraints without considering their combined effect. This led me to a solution that satisfied some requirements but not all.  To improve, I need to analyze how the different constraints interact and narrow down the possibilities systematically.
## Answering the Question:
**Constraint Analysis:**
* **French Works Limit:**  Maximum of 4 French works restricts the selection to at most 2 French plays and 2 French novels.
* **Novels Requirement:**  We need at least 3 but no more than 4 novels. This means we must have at least 1 novel from each language (French and Russian) to satisfy the minimum and the "at least as many French novels as Russian novels" requirement.
* **Plays and the Russian Play:** If both French plays are chosen, the Russian play is excluded. This implies we can have at most one French play if we want the Russian play.
**Combining Constraints:**
* We need at least 1 French novel and 1 Russian novel.
* We can have at most 1 French play if we want the Russian play.
**Therefore, the organizer must at least select one French novel and one French play.** This satisfies the minimum novel requirement, respects the French work limit, and allows for flexibility in choosing the remaining works.
