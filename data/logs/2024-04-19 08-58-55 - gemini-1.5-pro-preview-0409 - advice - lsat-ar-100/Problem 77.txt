Context: An administrator must assign parking spaces to six new employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young. Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
Question: For how many of the six new employees is the assignment of a parking space limited to one of only two possible spaces?
Choices:
  A: none
  B: two
  C: three

## Assistant 2:
## Reflection on Previous Attempt:
In my previous attempt, I likely made an error in interpreting the constraints and their implications on the possible parking space assignments for each employee.  I need to carefully analyze each rule and consider how they interact to limit the options for each person.
## Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Robertson:** Must be in spaces #1-4 and above Young. This leaves only two options: **#3 or #4**.
2. **Young:** Must be above Togowa and below Robertson. Since Robertson is limited to #3 or #4, Young can only be in **#2** (if Robertson is in #4) or **#3** (if Robertson is in #3).
3. **Togowa:** Must be below Young. So, Togowa can only be in **#1** (if Young is in #2) or **#2** (if Young is in #3).
4. **Xu:** Must be above Souza. This leaves several possibilities for both Xu and Souza depending on the remaining spaces.
5. **Souza:** Must be below Xu. Similar to Xu, multiple possibilities exist depending on the remaining spaces.
6. **Vaughn:**  Has no specific constraints, so their space will be determined by the remaining options after placing the others.
## Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, **three employees (Robertson, Young, and Togowa) have only two possible parking space assignments each**. 
**Action: Answer("C")** 
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: D
