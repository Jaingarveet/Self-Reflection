Context: A shopping center has exactly seven spaces—space 1 through space 7—arranged in a straight row. Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
Question: If the veterinarian is in space 5, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: The optometrist is in space 2.
  B: The pharmacy is in space 7.

## Assistant 2:
## Reflection on Previous Attempt:
In my previous attempt, I focused too much on the placement of the restaurants and overlooked the constraint related to the toy store and veterinarian. This led me to an incorrect conclusion.
## Reasoning:
1. **Veterinarian in space 5:** This means the toy store cannot be in space 4 or 6.
2. **Pharmacy placement:** The pharmacy must be at one end (space 1 or 7) and next to the optometrist or veterinarian. Since the veterinarian is in space 5, the pharmacy cannot be next to it. Therefore, the pharmacy must be at the opposite end, which is space 1, and next to the optometrist.
3. **Optometrist placement:**  Since the pharmacy is in space 1 and must be next to the optometrist, the optometrist must be in space 2.
Therefore, based on the given constraints and the veterinarian being in space 5, the optometrist must be in space 2.
**Action: Answer("A")** 
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
