K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.

## Assistant 2:
## Reflection on Previous Attempt:
In my previous attempt, I likely focused too much on the placement of G on the top shelf and neglected the other conditions, leading to an incorrect deduction about the middle shelf arrangement.  It's crucial to consider all given conditions and their implications systematically.
## Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Bottom Shelf has the most books:** This leaves fewer books for the top and middle shelves.
2. **I is on the middle shelf:** This is a fixed condition.
3. **K is above F:** This means K cannot be on the bottom shelf (most books) and F cannot be on the top shelf (G is there).
4. **O is above L:** Similar to point 3, O cannot be on the bottom shelf.
5. **F and M are together:**  Since F cannot be on the top shelf (due to G) and K is above F, both F and M must be on the middle shelf.
Therefore, the middle shelf must contain I, F, and M.
