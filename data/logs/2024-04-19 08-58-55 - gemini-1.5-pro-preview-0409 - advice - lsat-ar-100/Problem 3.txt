Topic: Law
Context: An administrator must assign parking spaces to six new employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young. Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
Question: If Robertson is assigned parking space #3, then which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Souza is assigned parking space #4.
  B: Togowa is assigned parking space #2.

## Assistant 2:
## Reflection on Previous Attempt:
In my previous attempt, I made an error by focusing too much on the specific parking space assignments and not enough on the relationships between the employees' parking spaces. This led me to a conclusion that wasn't necessarily true based on the given rules.
## Applying the Learning:
This time, I will focus on the order imposed by the rules rather than specific parking space numbers. 
**Rule Analysis:**
1. **Young > Togowa:** Young must have a higher number than Togowa.
2. **Xu > Souza:** Xu must have a higher number than Souza.
3. **Robertson > Young:** Robertson must have a higher number than Young.
4. **Robertson:** Must be in space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
**Given:** Robertson is in space #3.
**Deductions:**
* From rule 3, **Young must be in space #1 or #2** (lower than Robertson's #3).
* From rule 1, **Togowa must be in space #1** (lower than Young). 
* We don't have enough information to determine the exact positions of Souza, Xu, and Vaughn, only that they must be in spaces #4, #5, and #6 in some order.
Therefore, the only option that **must be true** is:
**Action: Answer("B")** (Togowa is assigned parking space #2) 
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: E
Score: 0
