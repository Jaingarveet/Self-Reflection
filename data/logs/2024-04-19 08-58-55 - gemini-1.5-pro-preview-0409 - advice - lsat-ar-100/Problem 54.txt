## Assistant 2:
## Reflection on Previous Attempt:
In my previous attempt, I focused too much on the constraint that exactly two students review the same plays, leading me to a wrong conclusion. I should have analyzed each condition more systematically and considered all possibilities before reaching an answer.
## Answering the Question:
**Given:**
* Jiang doesn't review Tamerlane.
* Kramer and O'Neill review Tamerlane.
* Megregian reviews more plays than Kramer and Lopez.
* Lopez and Megregian don't review the same plays as Jiang.
* Exactly two students review the same plays.
**Analysis:**
1. **Jiang's Plays:** Since Jiang doesn't review Tamerlane and cannot share plays with Lopez or Megregian, Jiang must review **Sunset and Undulation**.
2. **Kramer and O'Neill:** They both review Tamerlane and cannot share plays with Jiang. So, one of them must review Sunset and the other Undulation. This fulfills the condition of exactly two students sharing the same plays.
3. **Lopez and Megregian:** They cannot review the same plays as Jiang (Sunset and Undulation) and Megregian reviews more plays than Lopez. Therefore, **Megregian must review Tamerlane and one of the other plays (Sunset or Undulation)**. 
**Conclusion:**
Based on the analysis, the only option that must be true is **D: Megregian reviews Tamerlane.** 
Action: Answer("D")
