Topic: Law
Context: During a recital, two pianists—Wayne and Zara—will perform solos. There will be five solos altogether, performed one immediately after another. Each solo will be either a modern piece or a traditional piece. The choice of pianist and type of piece for the solos must conform to the following conditions: The third solo is a traditional piece. Exactly two of the traditional pieces are performed consecutively. In the fourth solo, either Wayne performs a traditional piece or Zara performs a modern piece. The pianist who performs the second solo does not perform the fifth solo. No traditional piece is performed until Wayne performs at least one modem piece.
Question: What is the minimum number of solos in which Wayne performs a traditional piece?
Choices:
  A: zero
  B: one
  C: two
  D: three
  E: four

## Assistant 2:
## Reflection on Previous Attempt:
In my previous attempt, I likely focused too much on the individual conditions and failed to consider the combined implications of all conditions simultaneously. This led to overlooking a possible scenario that met all requirements with a lower number of Wayne's traditional solos. 
## New Approach:
1. **Start with fixed points:** We know the 3rd solo is traditional and two traditional pieces are consecutive. This creates a block of two traditional pieces, either as 2nd & 3rd or 3rd & 4th.
2. **Condition analysis:**
    - **Wayne's modern piece before traditional:** This implies Wayne cannot be in the first block of traditional pieces.
    - **4th solo condition:** This suggests exploring scenarios where Zara does the 4th solo (modern) as it opens up possibilities for Wayne.
    - **2nd & 5th solo pianist difference:** This limits options for the 5th solo depending on who plays the 2nd.
3. **Scenario building:**
    - **Scenario 1 (Zara - 4th modern):**
        - If Zara plays 4th (modern), the traditional block is 2nd & 3rd. 
        - Wayne must play 1st (modern) due to the "modern before traditional" condition.
        - This leaves the 5th solo, which cannot be the same pianist as the 2nd, so Wayne plays the 5th (and it must be traditional).
        - **Result: Wayne plays one traditional piece (5th).**
    - **Scenario 2 (Wayne - 4th traditional):**
        - If Wayne plays 4th (traditional), the traditional block is 3rd & 4th.
        - This implies Zara plays 2nd (and it must be modern due to the "modern before traditional" condition for Wayne).
        - Wayne must play 1st (modern) due to the same condition.
        - The 5th solo goes to Wayne as it cannot be the same pianist as the 2nd. 
        - **Result: Wayne plays two traditional pieces (4th & 5th).**
4. **Minimizing Wayne's traditional solos:** Scenario 1 achieves the minimum with Wayne playing only one traditional piece (the 5th).
