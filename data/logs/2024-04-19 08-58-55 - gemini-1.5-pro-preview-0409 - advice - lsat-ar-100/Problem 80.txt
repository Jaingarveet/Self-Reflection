## Assistant 2:
## Reflection on Previous Attempt:
In my previous attempt, I likely focused on individual rules without considering the combined implications. This led to overlooking conflicts and inconsistencies between assignments and the given rules. 
## Approach for this Attempt:
1. **Analyze each option systematically:** I will evaluate each choice against all the given rules to ensure no contradictions exist.
2. **Prioritize interconnected rules:**  I will pay close attention to rules that influence the placement of multiple employees, such as the order of Young, Togowa, and Robertson.
3. **Eliminate options with conflicts:**  If any rule is violated within an option, I will immediately discard it.
## Applying the Approach:
* **Option A:** Violates the rule that Robertson must have a higher-numbered space than Young. (Eliminated)
* **Option B:** Violates the rule that Robertson must have a higher-numbered space than Young. (Eliminated)
* **Option C:** Violates the rule that Xu must have a higher-numbered space than Souza. (Eliminated)
* **Option D:**  Satisfies all given rules:
    * Young has a higher-numbered space than Togowa.
    * Xu has a higher-numbered space than Souza.
    * Robertson has a higher-numbered space than Young and is assigned #2 (within the range of #1-4).
* **Option E:** Violates the rule that Robertson must have a higher-numbered space than Young. (Eliminated)
Therefore, based on the analysis, the only option that satisfies all the given rules is D. 
Action: Answer("D") 
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
