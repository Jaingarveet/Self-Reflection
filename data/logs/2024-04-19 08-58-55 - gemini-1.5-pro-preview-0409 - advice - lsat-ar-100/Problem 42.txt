Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Topic: Law
Context: A panel of five scientists will be formed. The panelists will be selected from among three botanists—F, G, and H—three chemists—K, L, and M—and three zoologists—P, Q, and R. Selection is governed by the following conditions: The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types. If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. F and K cannot both be selected. K and M cannot both be selected. If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
Question: Which one of the following is an acceptable selection of scientists for the panel?
Choices:
  A: F, G, K, P, Q
  B: G, H, K, L, M
  C: G, H, K, L, R
  D: H, K, M, P, R
  E: H, L, M, P, Q

## Reflection on Previous Attempt:
**Error Analysis:**
In my previous attempt, I likely overlooked or misapplied one or more of the given conditions, leading to the selection of an invalid panel.  It's crucial to meticulously consider each constraint to ensure the chosen scientists meet all requirements.
**Approach Improvement:**
1. **Systematic Evaluation:** I will systematically evaluate each option against all conditions to avoid overlooking any restrictions.
2. **Condition Cross-Checking:**  I will pay close attention to interconnected conditions, such as the limitations on selecting botanists and zoologists and the dependencies involving M, P, and R.
3. **Elimination Strategy:** I will use the process of elimination, discarding options that violate any of the given conditions. 
**Applying the Improved Approach:**
Let's analyze each option:
* **A: F, G, K, P, Q:**  This violates the condition that if more than one botanist is selected (F and G), then at most one zoologist can be chosen (P and Q are present). 
* **B: G, H, K, L, M:** This violates the condition that K and M cannot both be selected.
* **C: G, H, K, L, R:** This option seems valid as it has one from each type and doesn't violate any conditions. However, we should check all options to be sure.
* **D: H, K, M, P, R:** This option fulfills the requirement of selecting both P and R if M is chosen. It also has one from each type and doesn't violate any other conditions.
* **E: H, L, M, P, Q:** This violates the condition that if M is selected, both P and R must be selected (only P is present).
**Conclusion:**
Options C and D both satisfy all given conditions. However, since I must select only one answer, I will choose the one I evaluated first:
Action: Answer("C") 
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
