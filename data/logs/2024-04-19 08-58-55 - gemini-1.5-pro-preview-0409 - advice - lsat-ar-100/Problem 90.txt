Topic: Law
Context: A maintenance company that takes service requests from three clients—Image, Solide, and Truvest—plans to set targets for its average service response times. Service targets will be set at 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day. Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail. The six targets are set according to the following conditions: None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
Question: Which one of the following targets CANNOT be set for more than one of the clients?
Choices:
  A: a 1-day website target
  B: a 2-day voicemail target
  C: a 2-day website target
  D: a 3-day voicemail target
  E: a 3-day website target

## Assistant 2:
## Reflection on Previous Attempt:
In my previous attempt, I focused too much on the individual constraints and failed to consider the combined implications of all conditions. This led me to neglect the possibility of certain targets being shared among clients while still satisfying all constraints.
## Deductions from Constraints:
1. **Image's voicemail target is the shortest:** This leaves 2-day and 3-day voicemail targets for Solide and Truvest.
2. **Solide's website target is shorter than Truvest's:** This means Solide cannot have the longest (3-day) website target.
3. **Website targets are never longer than voicemail targets:** Combining this with point 2, Solide cannot have a 3-day voicemail target either (as it would necessitate a 3-day website target).
## Conclusion:
Therefore, the only target that **cannot be assigned to more than one client** is the **3-day voicemail target**. Solide cannot have it due to point 3, and Image cannot have it due to point 1. This leaves only Truvest with the possibility of a 3-day voicemail target.
