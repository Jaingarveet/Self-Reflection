Topic: Law
Context: Patricia: During Japan's Tokugawa period, martial arts experts known as ninjas were trained for the purposes of espionage and assassination. Yet at that time there was actually very little ninja activity in Japan, and most Japanese did not fear ninjas. Tamara: That is not true. Many wealthy Japanese during the Tokugawa period had their houses constructed with intentionally squeaky floors so that they would receive warning if a ninja were in the house.
Question: Of the following, which one, if true, is the strongest counter Patricia can make to Tamara's objection?
Choices:
  A: Many poor Japanese during the Tokugawa period also had houses constructed with intentionally squeaky floors.
  B: As part of their secret training, ninjas learned to walk on squeaky floors without making a sound.
  C: The wealthy made up a small portion of Japan's population during the Tokugawa period.
  D: The fighting prowess of ninjas was exaggerated to mythic proportions in the years following the Tokngawa period.
  E: There were very few ninjas at any time other than during the Tokugawa period.

Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I did not focus on the main point of Tamara's objection. Tamara's objection is that wealthy Japanese during the Tokugawa period had their houses constructed with intentionally squeaky floors so that they would receive warning if a ninja were in the house. Answer A does not address this point. Answer C is the strongest counter because it points out that the wealthy made up a small portion of Japan's population during the Tokugawa period, which means that the majority of Japanese did not fear ninjas. 
Error Keywords:
 - Misunderstanding the main point of the objection
 - Failing to address the main point of the objection
 - Not focusing on the key issue
Solution:
Tamara's objection is that wealthy Japanese during the Tokugawa period had their houses constructed with intentionally squeaky floors so that they would receive warning if a ninja were in the house. To counter Tamara's objection, Patricia needs to provide evidence that the squeaky floors were not necessarily due to fear of ninjas. Answer C is the strongest counter because it points out that the wealthy made up a small portion of Japan's population during the Tokugawa period, which means that the majority of Japanese did not fear ninjas.
