Context: Microbiologist: Because heavy metals are normally concentrated in sewage sludge during the sewage treatment process, the bacteria that survive in the sludge have evolved the unusual ability to resist heavy-metal poisoning. The same bacteria also show a strong resistance to antibiotics. This suggests that the bacteria's exposure to the heavy metals in the sewage sludge has somehow promoted their resistance to antibiotics.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the microbiologist's argument?
Choices:
  A: Most bacteria that are not resistant to antibiotics are not resistant to heavy-metal poisoning either.
  B: Bacteria that live in sewage sludge that is free of heavy metals, but is in other respects similar to normal sewage, are generally resistant to neither heavy-metal poisoning nor antibiotics.
  C: Antibiotic resistance of bacteria that survive in sewage sludge in which heavy metals are concentrated contributes to their resistance to heavy-metal poisoning.
  D: Sewage sludge that contains high concentrations of heavy metals almost always contains significant concentrations of antibiotics.
  E: Many kinds of bacteria that do not live in sewage sludge are resistant to both heavy-metal poisoning and antibiotics.

Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I misinterpreted the argument and chose an option that was not relevant to the argument. 
The argument is that exposure to heavy metals in sewage sludge has promoted bacteria's resistance to antibiotics. 
Option C is not relevant to the argument. 
Option B supports the argument by stating that bacteria that live in sewage sludge that is free of heavy metals, but is in other respects similar to normal sewage, are generally resistant to neither heavy-metal poisoning nor antibiotics. 
Error Keywords:
 - Misinterpretation
