Topic: Law
Context: Medical researcher: Scientists compared a large group of joggers who habitually stretch before jogging to an equal number of joggers who do not stretch before jogging. Both groups of joggers incurred roughly the same number of injuries. This indicates that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would most weaken the medical researcher's argument?
Choices:
  A: For both groups of joggers compared by the scientists, the rate of jogging injuries during the study was lower than the overall rate of jogging injuries.
  B: Among the joggers in the groups compared by the scientists, many of those previously injured while jogging experienced difficulty in their efforts to perform stretches.
  C: Most jogging injuries result from falls, collisions, and other mishaps on which the flexibility resulting from stretching would have little if any effect.
  D: The more prone a jogger is to jogging injuries, the more likely he or she is to develop the habit of performing stretches before jogging.
  E: Studies have found that, for certain forms of exercise, stretching beforehand can reduce the severity of injuries resulting from that exercise.
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I misread the question and did not pay attention to the keyword "weaken." Instead, I chose an option that strengthens the argument. 
Error Keywords:
 - Misreading
 - Inattention
 - Misunderstanding
Solution:
The medical researcher's argument is that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries. We need to find an option that weakens this argument.
Option A is irrelevant to the argument.
Option B is also irrelevant to the argument.
Option C supports the argument.
Option D weakens the argument by suggesting that the habit of performing stretches before jogging is more likely to be developed by joggers who are prone to jogging injuries.
Option E is irrelevant to the argument.
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and understand the problem.
2. Identify the argument being made.
3. Identify the keyword that describes the task.
4. Evaluate each option in terms of its impact on the argument.
5. Choose the option that weakens the argument the most.
6. Double-check your answer to ensure that it weakens the argument.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Pay attention to the keywords that describe the task.
 - Evaluate each option in terms of its impact on the argument.
