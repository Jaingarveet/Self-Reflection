Topic: Law
Context: Figorian Wildlife Commission: The development of wetlands in industrialized nations for residential and commercial uses has endangered many species. To protect wildlife we must regulate such development in Figoria: future wetland development must be offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats. Thus, development would cause no net reduction of wetlands and pose no threat to the species that inhabit them. Figorian Development Commission: Other nations have flagrantly developed wetlands at the expense of wildlife. We have conserved. Since Figorian wetland development might not affect wildlife and is necessary for growth, we should allow development. We have as much right to govern our own resources as countries that have already put their natural resources to commercial use.
Question: Which one of the following principles, if accepted, would most strongly support the Figorian Development Commission's position against the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position?
Choices:
  A: National resources should be regulated by international agreement when wildlife is endangered.
  B: The right of future generations to have wildlife preserved supersedes the economic needs of individual nations.
  C: Only when a reduction of populations of endangered species by commercial development has been found should regulation be implemented to prevent further damage.
  D: Environment regulation must aim at preventing any further environmental damage and cannot allow for the different degrees to which different nations have already harmed the environment.
  E: It is imprudent to allow further depletion of natural resources.
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I incorrectly chose answer choice D because it emphasizes the prevention of any further environmental damage and does not allow for different degrees of harm already done by different nations. However, this principle does not support the Figorian Development Commission's position because it does not address the issue of Figoria's right to govern its own resources. Answer choice C is the correct answer because it supports the Figorian Development Commission's position by suggesting that regulation should only be implemented when a reduction of populations of endangered species by commercial development has been found. This principle implies that Figoria should be allowed to develop wetlands for growth unless there is evidence that endangered species are being harmed.
Error Keywords:
 - Misinterpretation of the question
 - Incorrect assumption
 - Incorrect reasoning
Solution:
The Figorian Development Commission believes that Figoria should be allowed to develop wetlands for growth, and that they have the right to govern their own resources. Therefore, the principle that would most strongly support their position would be one that emphasizes the right of individual nations to govern their own resources. Answer choice C is the correct answer because it supports the Figorian Development Commission's position by suggesting that regulation should only be implemented when a reduction of populations of endangered species by commercial development has been found. This principle implies that Figoria should be allowed to develop wetlands for growth unless there is evidence that endangered species are being harmed.
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and understand the positions of both sides.
2. Identify the principle that would most strongly support the Figorian Development Commission's position.
3. Consider each answer choice and evaluate whether it supports the Figorian Development Commission's position.
4. Eliminate answer choices that do not support the Figorian Development Commission's position.
5. Choose the answer choice that most strongly supports the Figorian Development Commission's position.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the positions of both sides.
 - Always evaluate each answer choice in relation to the question and the positions of both sides.
 - Never assume that an answer choice is correct without evaluating it carefully.
 - Always eliminate answer choices that do not support one side or the other.
 - Remember that the correct answer is the one that most strongly supports one side or the other.
