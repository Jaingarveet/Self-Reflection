Topic: Law
Context: Cigarette companies claim that manufacturing both low-and high-nicotine cigarettes allows smokers to choose how much nicotine they want. However, a recent study has shown that the levels of nicotine found in the blood of smokers who smoke one pack of cigarettes per day are identical at the end of a day's worth of smoking, whatever the level of nicotine in the cigarettes they smoke.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain the finding of the nicotine study?
Choices:
  A: Blood cannot absorb more nicotine per day than that found in the smoke from a package of the lowest-nicotine cigarettes available.
  B: Smokers of the lowest-nicotine cigarettes available generally smoke more cigarettes per day than smokers of high-nicotine cigarettes.
  C: Most nicotine is absorbed into the blood of a smoker even if it is delivered in smaller quantities.
  D: The level of tar in cigarettes is higher in low-nicotine cigarettes than it is in some high-nicotine cigarettes.
  E: When taking in nicotine by smoking cigarettes is discontinued, the level of nicotine in the blood decreases steadily.

Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I did not read the options carefully and did not think through each option's implications. 
I chose option C because it seemed to make sense, but it did not directly explain the study's findings. 
The correct answer is A because it directly explains why the levels of nicotine found in the blood of smokers who smoke one pack of cigarettes per day are identical at the end of a day's worth of smoking, whatever the level of nicotine in the cigarettes they smoke. 
Error Keywords:
 - Careless reading
 - Insufficient analysis
 - Incorrect reasoning
Solution:
The study found that the levels of nicotine found in the blood of smokers who smoke one pack of cigarettes per day are identical at the end of a day's worth of smoking, whatever the level of nicotine in the cigarettes they smoke. 
Option A explains that blood cannot absorb more nicotine per day than that found in the smoke from a package of the lowest-nicotine cigarettes available. This means that even if a smoker smokes high-nicotine cigarettes, they will absorb the same amount of nicotine as a smoker who smokes low-nicotine cigarettes, resulting in the same level of nicotine in the blood.
