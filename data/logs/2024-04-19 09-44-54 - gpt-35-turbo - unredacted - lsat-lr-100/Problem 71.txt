The museum displays only twentieth-century works.
The works are either on loan from private collectors or in the museum's permanent collection.
Prints of all of the latter works are available in the museum store.
The museum store also sells prints of some works that are not part of the museum's permanent collection, such as Hopper's Nighthawks.
Therefore, prints of works that are displayed in the museum and not on loan from a private collector are available in the museum store.

## Assistant 2:
Action: Answer("B") 
Explanation: 
The curator stated that the museum displays only twentieth-century works, and prints of all of the latter works are available in the museum store. Therefore, every print that is sold in the museum store is a copy of a twentieth-century work. However, the curator did not state that every print in the museum store is of a work that is either on loan to the museum from a private collector or part of the museum's permanent collection. Choice A is not necessarily true. Choice C is not necessarily true because the curator did not state that prints of every work that is displayed in the museum and not on loan from a private collector are available in the museum store. Choice D is not necessarily true because the curator did not state that Hopper's Nighthawks is on loan to the museum from a private collector. Choice E is not necessarily true because the curator did not state whether Hopper's Nighthawks is displayed in the museum.
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
