Context: The number of tornadoes recorded annually in North America has more than tripled since 1953. Yet meteorologists insist that the climatic factors affecting the creation of tornadoes are unchanged.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to resolve the apparent discrepancy described above?
Choices:
  A: The factors affecting the creation of tornadoes were not well known to meteorologists before 1953.
  B: The intensity of the average tornado is greater now than it was in 1953.
  C: The number of tornadoes recorded annually has increased only slightly in the last five years.
  D: The amount of property damage done by tornadoes has grown substantially since 1953.
  E: Many more citizens are helping authorities detect tornadoes now than in 1953.

Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I incorrectly chose option A as the answer to the question. Option A does not help to resolve the discrepancy between the increase in the number of tornadoes and the unchanged climatic factors affecting their creation. 
The correct answer is option E because it provides a possible explanation for the increase in the number of tornadoes recorded annually. The increase in the number of citizens helping authorities detect tornadoes now than in 1953 could explain the increase in the number of tornadoes recorded annually. 
Error Keywords:
 - Misunderstanding the question

Solution:
The correct answer is option E because it provides a possible explanation for the increase in the number of tornadoes recorded annually.
