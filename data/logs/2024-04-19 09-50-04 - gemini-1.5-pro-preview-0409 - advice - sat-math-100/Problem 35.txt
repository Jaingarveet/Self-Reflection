## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Advice:
- Always be cautious when squaring both sides of an equation, as it can introduce extraneous solutions.
- Always check your solutions by substituting them back into the original equation to ensure they are valid. 
- Remember that extraneous solutions may satisfy the derived equation but not the original one.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
I recall making a mistake on this problem before. The advice reminds me to be cautious when squaring equations and to check for extraneous solutions.
Let's solve the equation step-by-step:
1. **Square both sides:**  Squaring both sides gives us $4x = (x-3)^2$ which simplifies to $x^2 - 10x + 9 = 0$.
2. **Factor the quadratic:** This factors to $(x-1)(x-9) = 0$.
3. **Solve for x:** This gives us two possible solutions, $x=1$ and $x=9$.
4. **Check for extraneous solutions:** 
    - Substituting $x=1$ into the original equation gives $\sqrt{4} = -2$, which is not true. So, $x=1$ is extraneous.
    - Substituting $x=9$ into the original equation gives $\sqrt{36} = 6$, which is true.
Therefore, only $x=9$ is a valid solution.
Action: Answer("B")
