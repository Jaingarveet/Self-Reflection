Question: A book was sold for Rs 27.50 with a profit of 10%. If it were sold for Rs. 25.75, then would have been percentage of profit and loss ?
Choices:
  A: 2% Profit

  E: 4% Loss
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
1. Find the cost price: If selling at Rs 27.50 gives a 10% profit, then 27.50 is 110% of the cost. So, cost price = 27.50 / 1.10 = Rs 25.
2. Calculate the profit/loss at Rs 25.75: Selling at Rs 25.75 means a profit of 25.75 - 25 = Rs 0.75.
3. Calculate the percentage: Profit percentage = (0.75 / 25) * 100 = 3%.
Action: Answer("B") 
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
