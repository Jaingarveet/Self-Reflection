Question: At what price should the Karan mark a sewing machine that costs him Rs. 1200/- so that even after offering a 20% discount, he makes 20% profit?
Choices:
  A: 1,879
  B: 1,875
  C: 1,876
  D: 1,872
  E: 1,800
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
1.  **Calculate the desired selling price:** 
    *   Karan wants a 20% profit on his cost price of Rs. 1200.
    *   So, the desired selling price = 1200 + 20% of 1200 = 1200 + 240 = Rs. 1440.
2.  **Account for the discount:**
    *   He wants to offer a 20% discount on the marked price.
    *   This means the customer will pay 80% of the marked price.
    *   We need to find the marked price (let's call it 'M') such that 80% of M is equal to the desired selling price of Rs. 1440.
3.  **Set up the equation and solve for M:**
    *   0.8 * M = 1440
    *   M = 1440 / 0.8
    *   M = 1800
Therefore, Karan should mark the sewing machine at Rs. 1800.
