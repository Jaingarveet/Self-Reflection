Question: The price of a product is reduced by 30% . By what percentage should it be increased to make it 100%
Choices:
  A: 41.86%
  B: 42.86%

  D: 44.86%
  E: 45.86%
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let the original price be 100.
After a 30% reduction, the price becomes 70.
To get back to 100, we need to find what percentage of 70 is 30.
(30/70) * 100 = 42.86%
Action: Answer("B") 
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
