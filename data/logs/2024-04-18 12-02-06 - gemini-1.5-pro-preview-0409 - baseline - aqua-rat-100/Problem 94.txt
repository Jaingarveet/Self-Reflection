## Assistant 2:
Thought:
We need to find the number of ways to choose 2 distinct letters out of 26, and then 2 digits out of 10. 
This involves combinations, not permutations, as the order of the letters and numbers doesn't matter.
Number of ways to choose 2 distinct letters = 26C2 = (26 * 25) / (2 * 1) = 325
Number of ways to choose 2 digits = 10C2 = (10 * 9) / (2 * 1) = 45
Total number of distinct bike numbers = 325 * 45 = 14625
Action: Answer("None of the Above") 
## Result:
Agent Answer: N
Correct Answer: D
