Question: Six pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as do two rolls. Three rolls contain the same amount of falafel as five baguettes do. Two baguettes contain the same amount of falafel as how many pita breads?
Choices:
  A: 12/25
  B: 3/2
  C: 3
  D: 2
  E: 25/3
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
*   6 pitas = 2 rolls
*   3 rolls = 5 baguettes
*   Therefore, 6 pitas = 5/3 baguettes (substituting rolls from the second equation)
*   So, 1 baguette = 18/5 pitas
*   Hence, 2 baguettes = (18/5) * 2 = 36/5 = 7.2 pitas 
Action: Answer("None of the Above") 
## Result:
Agent Answer: N
