*   The sum of 5 consecutive odd numbers will be a multiple of 5. 
*   For the sum to be a perfect square after dividing by 10, the sum itself must be a multiple of 50 (10 times a perfect square).
*   Only option C, 41, falls within a range that could sum to a multiple of 50 when considering the four surrounding odd numbers (39, 43, 45, 47). 
Action: Answer("C")
