Question: 64 boys and 40 girls form a group for social work. During their membership drive, the same number of boys and girls joined the group. How many members does the group have now, if the ratio of boys to girls is 4:3?
Choices:
  A: 277
  B: 288
  C: 200
  D: 277
  E: 168
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
*   The initial ratio of boys to girls is 64/40 = 8/5.
*   We want a final ratio of 4/3, which is equivalent to 8/6.
*   This means we need to add the same number of boys and girls to get from 5 parts girls to 6 parts girls.
*   The difference between 5 parts and 6 parts is 1 part, which corresponds to 40 girls (since initially 5 parts = 40 girls).
*   Therefore, we add 40 boys and 40 girls.
*   The total number of members becomes 64 (boys) + 40 (boys) + 40 (girls) + 40 (girls) = 184.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
