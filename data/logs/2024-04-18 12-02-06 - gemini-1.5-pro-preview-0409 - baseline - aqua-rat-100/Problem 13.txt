## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: A student instead of finding the value of 7/8 of a number, found the value of 7/18 of the number. If his answer differed from the actual one by 770, find the that number.
Choices:
  A: 1584
  B: 2520
  C: 1728
  D: 1656
  E: None
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let x be the number. 
The difference between 7/8x and 7/18x is 770.
This translates to (7/8 - 7/18) * x = 770
Solving for x: x = 770 * (8 * 18) / (7 * 10) 
x = 1584
Action: Answer("A") 
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
