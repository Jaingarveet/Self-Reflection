## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Question: A paper is in a square form whose one side is 20 cm. Two semi circles are drawn on its opposites as diameters. If these semi circles are cut down what is the area of the remaining paper?
Choices:
  A: 8.75
  B: 8.79
  C: 8.75
  D: 8.71
  E: 8.72
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
1. **Area of the square paper:** Side^2 = 20^2 = 400 cm^2
2. **Area of each semi-circle:** (1/2) * pi * (diameter/2)^2 = (1/2) * pi * (20/2)^2 = 50pi cm^2 
3. **Combined area of both semi-circles:** 2 * 50pi = 100pi cm^2
4. **Area of the remaining paper:** Area of square - Area of both semi-circles = 400 - 100pi â‰ˆ 85.84 cm^2
5. **Comparing to the available choices, the closest value is 8.75 cm^2** 
Action: Answer("A") 
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
