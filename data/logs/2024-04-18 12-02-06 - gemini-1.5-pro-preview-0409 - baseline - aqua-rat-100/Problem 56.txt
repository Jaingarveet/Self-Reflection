Topic: Math
Question: A man borrows Rs.360 If he pays it back in 12 monthly installments of Rs.31.50, what is his interest rate?
Choices:
  A: 1.5%
  B: 4.5%
  C: 10%
  D: 5%
  E: 12%
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Total amount paid = 12 * 31.50 = Rs. 378
Interest paid = 378 - 360 = Rs. 18
Interest rate = (Interest / Principal) * (100 / Time) 
              = (18 / 360) * (100 / 1)
              = 0.05 * 100
              = 5% 
Action: Answer("D") 
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
