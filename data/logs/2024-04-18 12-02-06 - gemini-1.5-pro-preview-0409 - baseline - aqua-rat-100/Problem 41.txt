Question: A number of friends decided to go on a picnic and planned to spend Rs. 96 on eatables. Four of them, however, did not turn up. As a consequence, the remaining ones had to contribute Rs. 4 extra, each. The number of those who attended the picnic was
Choices:
  A: 8
  B: 12
  C: 16
  D: 24
  E: 25
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let the number of friends initially be $x$.
They planned to contribute $\frac{96}{x}$ each.
When 4 didn't turn up, the contribution became $\frac{96}{x-4}$ each, which is Rs. 4 more than the initial plan.
So, we can set up the equation: $\frac{96}{x-4} = \frac{96}{x} + 4$.
Solving for $x$, we get $x = 8$ or $x = -24$. Since the number of people cannot be negative, the initial number of friends is 8.
Therefore, the number of those who attended the picnic is $8 - 4 = 4$. 
Action: Answer("A") 
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
