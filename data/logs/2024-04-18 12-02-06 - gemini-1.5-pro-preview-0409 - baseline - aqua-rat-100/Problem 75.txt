Question: If the population of a city increases by 5 % annually, what will be the population of the city in 2 years time if its current population is 78000?
Choices:
  A: 81900
  B: 85995

## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Increase in population after 1 year = 5% of 78000 = 3900.
Population after 1 year = 78000 + 3900 = 81900.
Increase in population after 2 years = 5% of 81900 = 4095.
Population after 2 years = 81900 + 4095 = 85995.
Action: Answer("B")
