Question: Alex and Jacob works at a toy shop that make toys. Alex takes 7 hours to make a toy, and Jacob takes 9 hours to make a toy. During a month, both of them makes 35 toys in total. If both of them have worked for almost similar number of hours how many toys have been prepared by Jacob?
Choices:
  A: 15
  B: 16
  C: 17
  D: 18
  E: 19
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
1. **Combined Rate:** Alex makes 1 toy in 7 hours, Jacob in 9 hours. So, their combined rate is 1/7 + 1/9 = 16/63 toys per hour.
2. **Total Time:** They made 35 toys. To find the total time, we divide the total toys by their combined rate: 35 toys / (16/63 toys/hour) = 137.81 hours.
3. **Jacob's Time:** Since they worked similar hours, Jacob worked approximately half of the total time: 137.81 hours / 2 = 68.9 hours.
4. **Jacob's Toys:** To find how many toys Jacob made, we multiply his time by his rate: 68.9 hours * (1/9 toys/hour) = 7.65 toys.
5. **Rounding:** Since Jacob can't make a fraction of a toy, we round to the nearest whole number. 
Action: Answer("C") 
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
