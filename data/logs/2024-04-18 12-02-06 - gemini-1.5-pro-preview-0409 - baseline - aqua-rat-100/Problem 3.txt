Question: A square piece of cloth is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge to form a rectangular piece, which is then cut diagonally in half to create two triangles. If the area of each of triangle is 70 square feet, what was the perimeter (in feet) of the original piece of square cloth?
Choices:
  A: 56
  B: 58
  C: 60
  D: 62
  E: 64
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
*   The area of each triangle is 70 sq ft, so the area of the rectangle is 140 sq ft (70 * 2).
*   Let x be the side length of the original square. 
*   The rectangle has sides of x and (x-4) feet.
*   So, x(x-4) = 140.
*   This simplifies to x^2 - 4x - 140 = 0.
*   Factoring gives (x-14)(x+10) = 0.
*   Therefore, x = 14 (discarding the negative value).
*   The perimeter of the original square is 4 * 14 = 56 feet. 
Action: Answer("A")
