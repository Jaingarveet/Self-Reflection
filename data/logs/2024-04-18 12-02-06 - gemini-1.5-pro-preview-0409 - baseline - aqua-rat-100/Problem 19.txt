Question: A jeep travels a certain distance taking 6 hours in the forward journey. During the return journey, it increased its speed by 12km/hr and took 4 hours. What is the distance travelled by the jeep?
Choices:
  A: 126km
  B: 144km
  C: 127km
  D: 228km
  E: 128km
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let x be the speed in the forward journey.
The distance is 6x (distance = speed * time).
The return speed is x + 12 km/hr, and the distance is 4(x+12).
Since the distance is the same, 6x = 4(x+12).
Solving for x, we get x = 24 km/hr.
The distance is 6 * 24 = 144 km.
Action: Answer("B") 
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
