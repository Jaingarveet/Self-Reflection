Question: A cow is tethered in the middle of a field with a 14 feet long rope. If the cow grazes 10 sq.ft. per day, then approximately what time will be taken by the cow to graze the whole field?
Choices:
  A: 51 days
  B: 61 days
  C: 71 days
  D: 81 days
  E: 91 days
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The cow can graze in a circular area with a radius equal to the rope's length (14 feet).
Area of a circle = π * r^2 = 3.14 * 14^2 ≈ 615.44 sq.ft.
Time to graze the whole field = Total area / Grazing rate per day = 615.44 sq.ft. / 10 sq.ft./day ≈ 61.54 days
Action: Answer("B") 
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
