Question: John likes to have lightly flavored tea every evening. In a 50% strong milk tea, he replaces 15% of it with milk twice. Then, he replaces 10 percent of the resultant solution with more milk.
What is the final concentration of tea John drinks?
Choices:
  A: 15.38%
  B: 42%
  C: 39.86%
  D: 22.35%
  E: 32.51%
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let's assume John starts with 100 ml of 50% strong milk tea.
*   **First replacement:** He replaces 15 ml of tea with milk. The amount of tea remaining is 85 ml * 50% = 42.5 ml. 
*   **Second replacement:** He replaces another 15 ml. The amount of tea remaining is now 70 ml * 50% = 35 ml.
*   **Third replacement:** He replaces 10 ml. The amount of tea remaining is 60 ml * 50% = 30 ml.
The final concentration of tea is 30 ml / 90 ml * 100% = 33.33...% 
This is closest to option E.
Action: Answer("E")
