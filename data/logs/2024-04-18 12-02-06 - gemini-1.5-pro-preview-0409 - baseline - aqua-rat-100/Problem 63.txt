Question: During one season, a tennis team won 20 matches and lost 30% of their matches. What was the number of matches that the team lost?
Choices:
  A: 70
  B: 30
  C: 3
  D: 7
  E: 5
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
First find the total number of matches by dividing the number of wins by the percentage of wins: 20 matches / 0.7 = 28.57 matches. Since a team can't play a fraction of a match, round this up to 29 matches.
Then subtract the number of wins from the total number of matches to find the number of losses: 29 matches - 20 matches = 9 matches. 
Action: Answer("None of the Above") 
## Result:
Agent Answer: N
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
