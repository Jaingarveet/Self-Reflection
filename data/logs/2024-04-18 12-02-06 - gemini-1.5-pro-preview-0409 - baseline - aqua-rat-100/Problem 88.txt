Question: A train running at a speed of 100 miles/hour, takes 10 hours to reach its destination. After covering quarter of the distance, it starts raining and the train has to be slowed to speed of 75 miles/hour. What is the total journey duration?
Choices:
  A: 10
  B: 11.5
  C: 12.5
  D: 13.5
  E: 15
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
*   First, calculate the total distance: 100 miles/hour * 10 hours = 1000 miles.
*   Calculate the distance of the first quarter: 1000 miles * 0.25 = 250 miles.
*   Calculate the time taken to cover the first quarter: 250 miles / 100 miles/hour = 2.5 hours.
*   Calculate the remaining distance: 1000 miles - 250 miles = 750 miles.
*   Calculate the time taken to cover the remaining distance at the slower speed: 750 miles / 75 miles/hour = 10 hours.
*   Add the time for both parts of the journey: 2.5 hours + 10 hours = 12.5 hours. 
Action: Answer("C")
