Question: Jack buys 18 sharpeners (white and brown) for rs. 100. If he pays 1 rupee more for each white than brown sharpeners. How many of white and how many brown sharpeners did he buy?
Choices:
  A: 10,8
  B: 9,8
  C: 7,8
  D: 5,6
  E: 11,12
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let x be the number of brown sharpeners. 
Then, the number of white sharpeners is 18 - x.
The total cost for brown sharpeners is x * (price of a brown sharpener).
The total cost for white sharpeners is (18 - x) * (price of a brown sharpener + 1).
The total cost is 100, so we have the equation: x * (price of a brown sharpener) + (18 - x) * (price of a brown sharpener + 1) = 100.
Simplifying the equation, we get: 18 * (price of a brown sharpener) + 18 - x = 100.
This equation has two variables, so we need another equation to solve for x.
We know that x must be a positive integer and less than 18.
By trying the answer choices, we find that only option A (10, 8) satisfies the equation and the conditions.
Action: Answer("A") 
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
