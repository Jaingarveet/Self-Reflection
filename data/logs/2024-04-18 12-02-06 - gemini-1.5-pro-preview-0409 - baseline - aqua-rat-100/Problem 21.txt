## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: x men working x hours per day can do x units of a work in x days. How much work can be completed by y men working y hours per day in y days?
Choices:
  A: x2/y2 units
  B: y3/x2 units
  C: x3/y2 units
  D: y2/x2 units
  E: None of these
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The work done is proportional to the number of men, hours per day, and the number of days. So, the work done by y men working y hours per day in y days would be proportional to y * y * y = y^3. 
The original work done by x men is proportional to x * x * x = x^3.
To find the new work relative to the original work, we divide the new work by the original work: y^3 / x^3.
Action: Answer("B") 
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
