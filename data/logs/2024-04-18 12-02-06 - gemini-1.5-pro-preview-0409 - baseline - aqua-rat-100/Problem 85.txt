## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Question: Consider there is an staircase elevator and you are coming down. If you walk 20 steps and stop, then you reach bottom in 10 minutes. If you walk 10 steps and stop, you reach to the ground in 20 minutes. What is the speed of the elevator?
Choices:
  A: 1 step/minute
  B: 2 step/minute
  C: 3 step/minute
  D: 4 step/minute
  E: None of the above
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let x be the number of steps on the staircase and y be the speed of the elevator. 
From the given information, we can set up the following equations:
*   **Scenario 1:** (x - 20) / y = 10 minutes (since you walk 20 steps, the elevator covers x-20 steps)
*   **Scenario 2:** (x - 10) / y = 20 minutes (since you walk 10 steps, the elevator covers x-10 steps)
Solving these equations simultaneously:
*   From equation 1: x - 20 = 10y
*   From equation 2: x - 10 = 20y
Subtracting equation 1 from equation 2:
*   10 = 10y
*   Therefore, y = 1 step/minute
Action: Answer("A") 
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
