Topic: Law
Context: Many educators in Canada and the United States advocate multicultural education as a means of achieving multicultural understanding. There are, however, a variety of proposals as to what multicultural education should consist of. The most modest of these proposals holds that schools and colleges should promote multicultural understanding by teaching about other cultures, teaching which proceeds from within the context of the majority culture. Students should learn about other cultures, proponents claim, but examination of these cultures should operate with the methods, perspectives, and values of the majority culture. These values are typically those of liberalism: democracy, tolerance, and equality of persons. Critics of this first proposal have argued that genuine understanding of other cultures is impossible if the study of other cultures is refracted through the distorting lens of the majority culture's perspective. Not all cultures share liberal values. Their value systems have arisen in often radically different social and historical circumstances, and thus, these critics argue, cannot be understood and adequately appreciated if one insists on approaching them solely from within the majority culture's perspective. In response to this objection, a second version of multicultural education has developed that differs from the first in holding that multicultural education ought to adopt a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures. The values of one culture should not be standards by which others are judged; each culture should be taken on its own terms. However, the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in this second version of multicultural education are still identifiably Western. They are the methods of anthropology, social psychology, political science, and sociology. They are, that is, methods which derive from the Western scientific perspective and heritage. Critics of this second form of multicultural education argue as follows: The Western scientific heritage is founded upon an epistemological system that prizes the objective over the subjective, the logical over the intuitive, and the empirically verifiable over the mystical. The methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are thus already value laden; the choice to examine and understand other cultures by these methods involves a commitment to certain values such as objectivity. Thus, the second version of multicultural education is not essentially different from the first. Scientific discourse has a privileged place in Western cultures, but the discourses of myth, tradition, religion, and mystical insight are often the dominant forms of thought and language of non-Western cultures. To insist on trying to understand nonscientific cultures by the methods of Western science is not only distorting, but is also an expression of an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism: the chauvinism of science. According to this objection, it is only by adopting the (often nonscientific) perspectives and methods of the cultures studied that real understanding can be achieved.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would provide the strongest objection to the criticism in the passage of the second version of multicultural education?
Choices:
  A: It is impossible to adopt the perspectives and methods of a culture unless one is a member of that culture.
  B: Many non-Western societies have value systems that are very similar to one another.
  C: Some non-Western societies use their own value system when studying cultures that have different values.
  D: Students in Western societies cannot understand their culture's achievements unless such achievements are treated as the subject of Western scientific investigations.
  E: Genuine understanding of another culture is necessary for adequately appreciating that culture.

## Reflection on Previous Error:
**Error Analysis:**
My previous attempt at this question was incorrect because I focused on finding an answer choice that supported the criticism of the second version of multicultural education, rather than one that objected to it. I misinterpreted the task and ended up reinforcing the argument against the neutrality of the second approach.
**Understanding the Correct Approach:**
To find the strongest objection to the criticism, I need to identify a choice that weakens the argument against the second version. This means finding a statement that challenges the claim that using Western scientific methods inherently imposes Western values and prevents genuine understanding of other cultures.
**Lessons Learned:**
* **Read the question carefully:** Pay close attention to keywords like "objection" and "criticism" to ensure I understand what the question is asking.
* **Focus on the task:**  Don't get sidetracked by information that reinforces existing arguments; instead, actively seek information that counters them.
* **Consider all answer choices:** Evaluate each option in relation to the specific task, eliminating those that don't address the core issue.
## Answering the Question:
Let's analyze each choice:
* **A:** This supports the criticism by highlighting the difficulty of truly adopting another culture's perspective.
* **B:** This is irrelevant as it doesn't address the issue of Western scientific methods.
* **C:** This **weakens the criticism** by showing that non-Western cultures can also use their own values to study others, suggesting that using one's own framework for understanding is not exclusive to Western cultures.
* **D:** This is irrelevant as it focuses on understanding one's own culture, not others.
* **E:** This is irrelevant as it discusses the importance of understanding, not the methods for achieving it.
Therefore, the choice that provides the strongest objection to the criticism is: 
**Action: Answer("C")**
