# Model: llama-2-7b-chat | Agent: solution | Exam: med-mcqa-100 | Problem 84 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Medicine.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:
Topic: Geography
Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Medicine
Subtopic: Pharmacology
Question: Which of the trabecular meshwork and effect the aqueous outflow
Choices:
  A: Timolol
  B: Pilocarpine
  C: Brimonidine
  D: Brinzolamide
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
The trabecular meshwork is a structure in the eye that regulates aqueous outflow. [REDACTED] increases aqueous outflow through the trabecular meshwork by increasing the number of channels between the trabecular cells, allowing aqueous humor to flow more easily. [REDACTED], brimonidine, and brinzolamide decrease aqueous outflow through the trabecular meshwork by reducing the number of channels between the trabecular cells, thereby decreasing the flow of aqueous humor.
## Assistant 2:
  Thought: I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I need to reflect on my solution and the correct answer.

Action: I will review the information provided in the question and my previous answer.

Reflection: I see that the question asks which of the following drugs increase aqueous outflow through the trabecular meshwork. The options are Timolol, Pilocarpine, Brimonidine, and Brinzolamide. I previously selected Brimonidine as the correct answer, but upon further reflection, I realize that it is actually Brinzolamide that increases aqueous outflow through the trabecular meshwork. Brimonidine, on the other hand, decreases aqueous outflow through the trabecular meshwork.

Action: I will answer the question correctly by selecting Brinzolamide as the drug that increases aqueous outflow through the trabecular meshwork.

Answer: Brinzolamide
## Result:
Agent Answer: None
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
