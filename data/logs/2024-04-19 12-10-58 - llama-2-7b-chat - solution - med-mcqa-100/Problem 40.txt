## System:
You are an expert in Medicine.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

## Assistant 2:
  Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand that I need to approach it more carefully this time. The question asks for the biochemical test that is not raised in liver disorder, and I need to use my knowledge of biochemistry to identify the correct answer.

From my understanding, ALP (Alanine Transaminase) and AST (Aspartate Transaminase) are both liver enzymes that are elevated in liver disorders. Therefore, options B and C are incorrect.

On the other hand, lipase is an enzyme that is produced in the pancreas and is involved in digestion. It is not related to liver disorders, so option A is also incorrect.

The correct answer is option D: ALT (Alanine Aminotransferase), which is also a liver enzyme but is not elevated in liver disorders.

Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
