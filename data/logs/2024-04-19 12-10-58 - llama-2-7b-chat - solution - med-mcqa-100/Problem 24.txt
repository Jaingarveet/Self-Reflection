## Assistant 2:
  Thought: I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I need to reflect on my solution and the correct answer.

Reflection: I mistakenly selected option A, Propylthiouracil, as the safe antithyroid drug for use in pregnancy. However, upon further review, I realize that Propylthiouracil can cross the placenta and may cause fetal goiter and cretinism. Therefore, it is not a safe option for use in pregnancy.

The correct answer is option C, Methimazole. Methimazole is the safest antithyroid drug to use in pregnancy, as it has a lower risk of fetal exposure and toxicity compared to Propylthiouracil. Methimazole can be used to treat hyperthyroidism during pregnancy, and it has been shown to be effective in reducing thyroid hormone levels while minimizing the risk of fetal harm.

Action: Answer("C")
