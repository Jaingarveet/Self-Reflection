Question: For an epidemiological study, every 10th person is selected from a population. This type of sampling is known as:
Choices:
  A: Simple random sampling
  B: Statified random sampling
  C: Systemic random sampling
  D: Cluster random sampling
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
For an epidemiological study, every 10th person is selected from a population. This type of sampling is known as systemic random sampling.

In systemic random sampling, every member of the population has an equal chance of being selected, regardless of their location or any other characteristic. This method is suitable for studying the prevalence of a disease or condition in a population.

Question: For an epidemiological study, every 10th person is selected from a population. This type of sampling is known as:
Choices:
  A: Simple random sampling
  B: Statified random sampling
  C: Systemic random sampling
  D: Cluster random sampling

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly. I selected option A, simple random sampling, which is not the correct answer. Upon further reflection, I realized that the correct answer is option C, systemic random sampling.

Systemic random sampling involves selecting every 10th person from the population, ensuring that each member of the population has an equal chance of being selected. This method is suitable for studying the prevalence of a disease or condition in a population.

In contrast, simple random sampling involves selecting a fixed number of individuals from the population, without any regard for their location or any other characteristic. This method may not provide an accurate representation of the population, especially if the population is not evenly distributed.

Therefore, the correct answer is option C, systemic random sampling.

Answer: C
