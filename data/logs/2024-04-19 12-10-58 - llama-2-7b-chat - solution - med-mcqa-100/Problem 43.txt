Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
Antisera is obtained from the blood of horses.
The correct answer is option [REDACTED], "[REDACTED]."
## Assistant 2:
  Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, stating that antisera is obtained from guinea pigs. Upon further reflection, I realized that antisera is actually obtained from the blood of horses. This is because antisera is a serum that is used to treat diseases in animals, and it is typically produced by injecting a small amount of a specific disease-causing agent into a horse's bloodstream. The horse's immune system will then produce antibodies against the disease agent, which are collected and used to create the antisera.

Therefore, the correct answer is option [REDACTED], "[REDACTED]."
## Result:
Agent Answer: None
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
