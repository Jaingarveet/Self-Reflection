Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.

## Assistant 2:
  My apologies for my previous mistake. I'll re-evaluate the problem, taking into account all the given information and possible scenarios.

The question asks us to determine which statement must be true if Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target. We can start by analyzing the given conditions:

1. None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
2. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
3. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.

From condition 1, we know that Truvest's website target cannot be longer than its voicemail target. Thus, if Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, it means that Truvest's website target is 1 day, and its voicemail target is 2 days or 3 days.

Now, let's consider the possible scenarios:

Scenario 1: Truvest's website target is 1 day, and its voicemail target is 2 days.
In this scenario, Image's voicemail target must be 2 days (since it's shorter than Truvest's voicemail target). Image's website target cannot be 2 days (since it's shorter than Image's voicemail target), so it must be 1 day. Solide's website target cannot be 2 days (since it's longer than Truvest's website target), so it must be 1 day.

Scenario 2: Truvest's website target is 1 day, and its voicemail target is 3 days.
In this scenario, Image's voicemail target must be 3 days (since it's shorter than Truvest's voicemail target). Image's website target cannot be 2 days (since it's shorter than Image's voicemail target), so it must be 1 day. Solide's website target cannot be 2 days (since it's longer than Truvest's website target), so it must be 1 day.

In both scenarios, Image's website target is 1 day, which means choice C: Image's website target is 1 day, must be true.

Therefore, the answer is C: Image's website target is 1 day.

Action: Answer("C")
