## Assistant 2:
  My apologies for my previous mistake. I overlooked the requirement that at least one witness must testify on Monday.

The correct answer is B: Hong is scheduled to testify on Tuesday.

Since Jackson is the only witness scheduled to testify on Monday, Hong cannot testify on Monday. Therefore, Hong must testify on Tuesday.

The other options are not valid:

A: Franco is scheduled to testify on Wednesday. This would violate the condition that Franco does not testify on the same day as Garcia.

C: Garcia is scheduled to testify on Tuesday. This would violate the condition that exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.

D: Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong. This would violate the condition that Franco does not testify on the same day as Hong.

E: Garcia is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong. This would violate the condition that Garcia does not testify on the same day as Hong.

Therefore, the correct answer is B: Hong is scheduled to testify on Tuesday.
