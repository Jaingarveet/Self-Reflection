Context: An administrator must assign parking spaces to six new employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young. Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
Question: If Robertson is assigned parking space #3, then which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Souza is assigned parking space #4.
  B: Togowa is assigned parking space #2.
  C: Vaughn is assigned parking space #5.

## Assistant 2:
  My apologize for my previous response, where I incorrectly answered the question. Upon reflection, I realized that my mistake was due to a logical reasoning error. I overlooked the possibility that Souza could be assigned parking space #5, which would satisfy all the rules given in the problem.

Now, let's re-evaluate the question:
If Robertson is assigned parking space #3, then we know that Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Therefore, Togowa must be assigned either #1, #2, or #4.

Since Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, Souza must be assigned either #4 or #5. If Souza is assigned #4, then Xu must be assigned #6, which violates the rule that Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Therefore, Souza must be assigned #5.

Now, we can see that the correct answer is choice A: Souza is assigned parking space #4.

Action: Answer("A")
