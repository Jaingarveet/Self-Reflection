  My apologies for my previous mistake. I misunderstood the condition and incorrectly interpreted the information.

The correct answer is B: Garcia is scheduled to testify on Monday.

2. Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
3. Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
4. Hong does not testify on Monday.
5. At least one witness testifies on Monday.

If Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong, then Franco must testify on Tuesday, and Hong must testify on Monday. Therefore, Garcia must testify on Monday to satisfy condition 1.
