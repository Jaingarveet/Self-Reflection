Context: Of the eight students—George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert—in a seminar, exactly six will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.

## Assistant 2:
  Sure, I'll do my best to answer the question. Here's my reflection on the problem:

The problem states that exactly six students will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. The question asks what must be true if Helen, Kyle, and Lenore give the three morning reports.

My initial answer was choice A: Helen gives a report on Monday. However, upon reflection, I realized that this answer is not necessarily true. Even if Helen gives a report on Monday, it's possible that Kyle and Lenore give their reports on Tuesday and Wednesday morning, respectively.

Therefore, the correct answer must be choice B: Irving gives a report on Monday. Since Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report, and neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report, it means that Irving must give a report on Monday.

Action: Answer("B")
