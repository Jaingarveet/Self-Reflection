## Assistant 2:
  Sure, I'll do my best to answer the question.

Here's my reflection on the problem:

When I first encountered this question, I mistakenly assumed that the given conditions were sufficient to determine the sales representatives' zones. I incorrectly chose answer B, thinking that Mahr must work in Zone 1.

However, upon further review, I realized that the given conditions do not provide enough information to determine the sales representatives' zones. In particular, we cannot infer the zone of Mahr or Stuckey based on the given conditions.

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) Stuckey works in Zone 2, as this statement is not ruled out by the given conditions.

Now, let's evaluate the other choices:

A. Kim works in Zone 2: This choice is incorrect because we cannot determine Kim's zone based on the given conditions.

B. Mahr works in Zone 1: This choice is incorrect because, as mentioned earlier, we cannot determine Mahr's zone based on the given conditions.

C. Parra works in Zone 3: This choice is incorrect because Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone, and we know that Quinn works in Zone 2. Therefore, Parra cannot work in Zone 3.

E. Tiao works in Zone 1: This choice is incorrect because Tiao could work in either Zone 1 or Zone 2, and we cannot determine Tiao's zone based on the given conditions.

In summary, the correct answer is (D) Stuckey works in Zone 2, as it is the only statement that is not ruled out by the given conditions.
