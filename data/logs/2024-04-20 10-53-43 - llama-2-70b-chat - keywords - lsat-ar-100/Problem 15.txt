Context: A shopping center has exactly seven spaces—space 1 through space 7—arranged in a straight row. Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.

## Assistant 2:
  My previous answer was incorrect because I made a placement error. I placed the pharmacy next to the veterinarian, which violates the constraint that the pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.

Let's analyze the question again:

* The shoe store is in space 4.
* The pharmacy must be at one end of the row, so it cannot be in space 4.
* One of the restaurants must be at the other end of the row, so it cannot be in space 4.
* The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, so the restaurant that is not at the end of the row must be in space 2 or space 6.
* The optometrist cannot be next to the veterinarian, so it must be in space 1 or space 5.
* The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so it must be in space 3 or space 7.

Now, let's evaluate the choices:

* A: The optometrist is next to a restaurant. This is not necessarily true, as the optometrist could be in space 1 or space 5, and the restaurant could be in space 2 or space 6.
* B: The pharmacy is next to the veterinarian. This is false, as the pharmacy cannot be next to the veterinarian.
* C: A restaurant is next to the toy store. This is false, as the toy store is in space 3 or space 7, and the restaurant is in space 2 or space 6.
* D: The shoe store is next to the toy store. This is true, as the shoe store is in space 4, and the toy store is in space 3 or space 7.
* E: The shoe store is next to the veterinarian. This is false, as the shoe store is in space 4, and the veterinarian is in space 7.

Therefore, the correct answer is D: The shoe store is next to the toy store.
