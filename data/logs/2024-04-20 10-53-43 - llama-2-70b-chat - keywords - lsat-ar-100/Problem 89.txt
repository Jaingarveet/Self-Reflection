## Assistant 2:
  My apologies for my previous mistake. I misunderstood the question and made an incorrect assumption. I failed to consider all possible scenarios.

Let's analyze the given information:

* The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
* The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
* The number of batches made on Friday is exactly one.

From the given information, we can deduce that the schedule for the three types of cookies is:

* Monday: First batch of oatmeal cookies, first batch of peanut butter cookies
* Tuesday: Second batch of oatmeal cookies, second batch of peanut butter cookies
* Thursday: Second batch of sugar cookies
* Friday: Third batch of oatmeal cookies (since the number of batches made on Friday is exactly one)

Now, let's evaluate the choices:

A: The first batch of sugar cookies is made on Monday.
This is incorrect, as the first batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.

B: The first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Tuesday.
This is incorrect, as the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Monday.

C: The third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Friday.
This is correct, as we deduced that the third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Friday.

D: The first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Wednesday.
This is incorrect, as the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Monday.

E: The second batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday.
This is incorrect, as the second batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Thursday.

Therefore, the correct answer is C: The third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Friday.

Action: Answer("C")
