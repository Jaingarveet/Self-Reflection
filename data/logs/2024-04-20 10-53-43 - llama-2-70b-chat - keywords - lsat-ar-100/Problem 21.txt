If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.

Topic: Law

One ambassador will be assigned to each country, and no ambassador will be assigned to more than one country. The assignment of the ambassadors must meet the following constraints: Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships. If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne. If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.

  A: Jaramillo and Landon
  B: Jaramillo and Novetzke
  C: Kayne and Landon
  D: Kayne and Novetzke
  E: Landon and Novetzke
Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly.
Upon reflection, I realized that I misunderstood the constraints and did not consider all possibilities.
I will carefully re-evaluate the choices and consider all possible combinations that satisfy the constraints.
Action: Answer("B")

Here's my explanation:
If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne cannot be assigned as ambassador to Yemen, per the given constraints. Therefore, Kayne must be assigned as ambassador to one of the remaining two countries, Zambia or Yemen.
If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Zambia, then Novetzke must be assigned as ambassador to Yemen, as either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, can be assigned to one of the ambassadorships. In this scenario, Jaramillo cannot be assigned as ambassador to any of the three countries, as Kayne and Novetzke are already assigned.
Therefore, the only possible combination that satisfies all constraints is:
Ong as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne as ambassador to Zambia, and Novetzke as ambassador to Yemen.
Hence, the correct answer is B: Jaramillo and Novetzke.

I hope this revised answer is correct. Please let me know if there's anything else I can help with!
