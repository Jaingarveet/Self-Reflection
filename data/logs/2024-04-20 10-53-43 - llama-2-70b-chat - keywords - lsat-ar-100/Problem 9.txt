Context: An administrator must assign parking spaces to six new employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young. Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
Question: If Young is assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Togowa is assigned parking space #1.
  B: Young is assigned parking space #2.
  C: Robertson is assigned parking space #3.
  D: Souza is assigned parking space #3.
  E: Vaughn is assigned parking space #4.

## Assistant 2:
  I apologize for my previous mistake. Let's analyze the problem again carefully.
The problem states that Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa and Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Therefore, we can conclude that Young must be assigned a parking space higher than #4, since Togowa cannot be assigned a parking space higher than #4.
Additionally, Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young, so Robertson must be assigned a parking space higher than #4.
Now, let's evaluate the choices:

A: Togowa is assigned parking space #1.
This is not possible since Togowa cannot be assigned a parking space higher than #4.

B: Young is assigned parking space #2.
This is possible, but it would violate the rule that Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.

C: Robertson is assigned parking space #3.
This is possible and consistent with the rules given.

D: Souza is assigned parking space #3.
This is not possible since Souza must be assigned a lower-numbered parking space than Xu, and Xu cannot be assigned a parking space lower than #3.

E: Vaughn is assigned parking space #4.
This is not possible since Vaughn cannot be assigned a parking space higher than #4, and Robertson must be assigned a parking space higher than #4.

Therefore, the correct answer is C: Robertson is assigned parking space #3.

Action: Answer("C")
