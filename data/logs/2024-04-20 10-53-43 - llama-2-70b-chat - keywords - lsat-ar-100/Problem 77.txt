Context: An administrator must assign parking spaces to six new employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young. Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.

  A: none
  B: two

## Assistant 2:
  I apologize for my previous mistake. Let's analyze the question again.
The problem states that Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4. Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa, and Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
With these rules in mind, we can deduce that the only possible parking spaces for Young are #5 and #6, since Robertson must have a lower number than Young, and Xu must have a lower number than Souza. Therefore, the assignment of parking spaces for Young is limited to two possible spaces.
Similarly, the only possible parking spaces for Xu are #4 and #5, since Xu must have a higher number than Souza, and Young must have a higher number than Togowa. Therefore, the assignment of parking spaces for Xu is also limited to two possible spaces.
No other employee has such a limitation, as Robertson, Souza, Togowa, and Vaughn can be assigned any of the remaining parking spaces.
Therefore, the correct answer is (B) two.
