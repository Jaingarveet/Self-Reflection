Question: Which is not an example of animal instinct?
Choices:
  A: migrating
  B: hibernating
  C: hunting skills
  D: building nests
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I assumed that all the options were examples of animal instinct. However, upon further reflection, I realized that hunting skills can also be learned behaviors, not just instinctual ones.

Error Keywords:
- Assumption error
- Overgeneralization error
- Lack of consideration of alternative explanations

Solution:
Animal instinct refers to the innate behaviors that animals exhibit without being taught. Migrating, hibernating, and building nests are all examples of animal instinct. However, hunting skills can be learned behaviors, not just instinctual ones. For example, a mother lion may teach her cubs how to hunt. Therefore, hunting skills are not always an example of animal instinct.

Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and understand what it is asking.
2. Consider each option and evaluate whether it is an example of animal instinct.
3. Remember that animal instinct refers to innate behaviors that animals exhibit without being taught.
4. Consider whether the behavior could be learned or taught, rather than instinctual.
5. Choose the option that is least likely to be an example of animal instinct.

Advice:
- Always read the question carefully and understand what it is asking.
- Avoid making assumptions about the options.
- Consider alternative explanations for each option.
- Remember that animal instinct refers to innate behaviors that animals exhibit without being taught.
- Consider whether the behavior could be learned or taught, rather than instinctual.
- Choose the option that is least likely to be an example of animal instinct.
