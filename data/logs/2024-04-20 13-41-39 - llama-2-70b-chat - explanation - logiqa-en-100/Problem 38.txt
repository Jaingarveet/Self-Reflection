Context: The number of crocodiles in the North Atlantic Ocean has declined sharply, but the number of seals has increased significantly at almost the same time.Some people say that it is the seal that caused the reduction of crocodiles.This argument is difficult to establish because seals rarely feed on crocodiles.
Question: Which of the following, if true, would most weaken the above argument?
Choices:
  A: Seawater pollution causes more damage to crocodiles than seals.
  B: Despite the sharp decrease in the number of crocodiles and the increase in the number of seals, there are still fewer seals in the North Atlantic Ocean than crocodiles.
  C: Before the number of seals increased, the number of crocodiles in the North Atlantic Ocean decreased.
  D: Crocodiles only eat capelin, and capelin is also the main food for seals.

You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I misinterpreted the relationship between crocodiles and seals, and their respective food sources. 
The correct answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED]
This answer choice weakens the argument that seals caused the reduction of crocodiles, as both species share a common food source.
It suggests that the decline in crocodile population may be due to other factors, such as environmental changes or overfishing of capelin, rather than competition with seals.
