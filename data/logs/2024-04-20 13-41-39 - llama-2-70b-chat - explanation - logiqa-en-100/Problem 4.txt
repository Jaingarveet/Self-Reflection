Explanation:
I made a mistake in my reasoning. I correctly identified that F must be the first speaker if J is the fourth speaker, but I incorrectly assumed that M must be the second speaker.
## Assistant 2:
  I understand that I made a mistake in my previous answer. Let's analyze the information given:

1. F must speak before lunch.
2. Only one speaker is between M and N.
3. F speaks in the first or third place.
4. J is the fourth speaker.

From the given information, we can deduce that the speaking order should be:

1. F
2. G
3. M
4. J
5. L
6. N

Therefore, the third speaker must be M.
