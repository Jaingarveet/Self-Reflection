Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Law
Context: People who are allergic to cats are actually allergic to certain proteins found in the animals' skin secretions and saliva; which particular proteins are responsible, however, varies from allergy sufferer to allergy sufferer. Since all cats shed skin and spread saliva around their environment, there is no such thing as a cat incapable of provoking allergic reactions, although it is common for a given cat to cause an allergic reaction in some-but not all-people who are allergic to cats.
Question: Which one of the following statements is most strongly supported by the information above?
Choices:
  A: Any particular individual will be allergic to some breeds of cat but not to others.
  B: No cat is capable of causing an allergic reaction in all types of allergy sufferers.
  C: Not all cats are identical with respect to the proteins contained in their skin secretions and saliva.
  D: The allergic reactions of some people who are allergic to cats are more intense than the allergic reactions of other allergy sufferers.
  E: There is no way to predict whether a given cat will produce an allergic reaction in a particular allergy sufferer.
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Advice:
- Avoid making broad generalizations; focus on the specific details presented. 
- Identify the key variables and how they relate to each other. 
- Look for the option that is most directly and clearly supported by the context, avoiding extrapolation or assumptions. 
- Remember that the correct answer is likely to be explicit and directly linked to the provided information.
## Assistant 2:
Reflection: I missed the word "most" in the question stem, which is crucial. While statement B is true, the text does not directly support it as the *most strongly* supported conclusion. Instead, statement C is the correct answer as it is the option that is most directly and explicitly supported by the context.

Thought: 
The text states that the proteins that trigger allergies vary, and so does the allergic response to a given cat. Statement C is the most directly supported by the information as it refers to the specific proteins in question. While the other statements may be true, they are not as strongly supported by the given context.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
