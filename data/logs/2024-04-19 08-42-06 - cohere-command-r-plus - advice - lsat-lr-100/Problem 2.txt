Thought: 
The correct answer is C: Some of the films that won prizes at international film festivals this year were Canadian films.

The key phrase in the question is "must also be true," indicating that we are looking for a definite conclusion that logically follows from the given statements.

Statement C is the only option that definitively follows from the given information. It states that since most of the films that won at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival also won at international festivals, some of the films that won at international festivals must have been Canadian. This conclusion accounts for all possibilities and does not make assumptions about the specific numbers or proportions involved.

Statements A, B, D, and E may or may not be true depending on additional information, but they are not definite conclusions that must be true based solely on the given statements.
