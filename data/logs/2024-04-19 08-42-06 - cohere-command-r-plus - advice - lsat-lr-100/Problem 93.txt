## Assistant 2:
Reflection: 
The correct answer is Choice C. The argument assumes that self-righteous individuals who are quick to condemn others may themselves be suspected of wrongdoing, and their indignation may be seen as a cover-up. This assumption links Ellsworth's self-righteousness to the media's allegations and the potential public perception of his offense.
