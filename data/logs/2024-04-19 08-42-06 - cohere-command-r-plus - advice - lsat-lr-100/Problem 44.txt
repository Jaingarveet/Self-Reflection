## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The argument's conclusion is that most people in Hallstown buy frozen dinners regularly, based on the premise that they shop for groceries infrequently. This is a flawed generalization, assuming a causal link without evidence.

Of the choices, option C makes a similar flawed generalization. It concludes that Fernando's friends drive to school based on their ability to drive and enrollment in school, ignoring other factors.
Action: Answer("C")
