## System:
You are an expert in Science.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Assistant 2:
  Topic: Science
Question: Red-clay bricks have a density of approximately 2000 kg/m^3. Air has a density of 1 kg/m^3. Which of the following has the lowest mass?

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand the mistake now. Here's my reflection:

Error Keywords:

* I misunderstood the question and thought it was asking for the volume of the bricks instead of their mass.
* I calculated the volume of the bricks incorrectly by using the wrong unit (m^3 instead of kg).

Solution:
The correct answer is (C) 6000 m^3 of air.

Explanation:
The density of air is 1 kg/m^3, so the mass of 6000 m^3 of air is 6000 kg.

Advice:
When solving problems involving density and mass, it's important to use the correct units and to carefully read the question to avoid misunderstandings. In this case, I should have used kg instead of m^3 when calculating the mass of the air.
