Question: A group of Canada geese left a Florida lake in the spring. The geese arrived at a Maine lake 2,000 km away in 40 days. If the geese traveled at a constant rate, how far did the geese travel on the first day?
Choices:
  A: 5 km
  B: 20 km
  C: 40 km
  D: 50 km
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I made a mistake in my reasoning and calculation. I incorrectly calculated the distance traveled by the Canada geese on the first day.

Error Keywords:

* Miscalculation
* Speed calculation error
* Distance calculation error

Solution:
To find the distance traveled by the Canada geese on the first day, we need to use the formula: distance = speed x time.

The question states that the geese traveled 2,000 km in 40 days, so the speed of the geese is:
speed = distance / time = 2,000 km / 40 days = [REDACTED]/day

Now, to find the distance traveled on the first day, we can multiply the speed by the number of days the geese have been traveling:
distance = speed x days = [REDACTED]/day x 1 day = [REDACTED]

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) [REDACTED].

Instructions:

1. Identify the formula for finding distance traveled: distance = speed x time
2. Use the given information to calculate the speed of the geese: speed = distance / time = 2,000 km / 40 days = [REDACTED]/day
3. Calculate the distance traveled on the first day: distance = speed x days = [REDACTED]/day x 1 day = [REDACTED]
4. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
5. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.

Advice:

* Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
* Break down complex problems into smaller, manageable steps.
* Use the correct formula to solve the problem.
* Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
* Always choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
