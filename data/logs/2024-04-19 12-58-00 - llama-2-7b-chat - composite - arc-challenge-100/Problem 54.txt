Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I incorrectly identified the property of a gas that allows all of the students to smell the food. I thought that a gas keeps its shape when placed in a container, but that is not the correct answer.

The correct answer is:

[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] gas takes the shape of its container.

When the teacher opens the can of food, the gas molecules inside the can are able to move freely and spread out into the surrounding air. Since the gas molecules are not attached to any particular shape, they are able to take on the shape of their container, which in this case is the classroom. As a result, the students are able to smell the food because the gas molecules from the food are able to reach their noses.

Question: A teacher opens a can of food in the front of a classroom. Soon, all of the students in the classroom can smell the food. Which statement identifies a property of a gas that allows all of the students to smell the food?

Action: Answer("D")

Explanation:
The correct answer is that a gas takes the shape of its container. When the teacher opens the can of food, the gas molecules inside the can are able to move freely and spread out into the surrounding air. Since the gas molecules are not attached to any particular shape, they are able to take on the shape of their container, which in this case is the classroom. As a result, the students are able to smell the food because the gas molecules from the food are able to reach their noses.

Keywords:

* Gas
* Shape
* Container
* Molecules
* Smell

Error Keywords:

* None of the above

Solution:

1. Identify the property of a gas that allows all of the students to smell the food.

Answer: A gas takes the shape of its container.

2. Explain why the students are able to smell the food.

Explanation: The gas molecules inside the can are able to move freely and spread out into the surrounding air, taking on the shape of their container, which is the classroom. As a result, the students are able to smell the food because the gas molecules from the food are able to reach their noses.
