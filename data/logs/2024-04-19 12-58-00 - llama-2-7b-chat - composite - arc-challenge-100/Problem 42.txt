## System:
You are an expert in Science.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:

Question: When two unequal forces act in opposite directions on a moving object, the object will
Choices:
  A: absorb the forces.
  B: come to an immediate stop.
  C: continue to move in the same direction.
  D: move in the same direction as the larger force.
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly by selecting option [REDACTED], which states that the object will [REDACTED] However, the correct answer is option [REDACTED], which states that the object will [REDACTED]

The reason for my mistake is that I misunderstood the concept of forces acting in opposite directions. I thought that the object would continue to move in the same direction due to the equal and opposite forces, but in reality, the object will accelerate in the direction of the larger force.

Error Keywords:

* Misunderstanding the concept of forces
* Confusion between equal and opposite forces

Solution:
When two unequal forces act in opposite directions on a moving object, the object will accelerate in the direction of the larger force. The correct calculation is:

F = ma

Where F is the net force acting on the object, m is the mass of the object, and a is the acceleration of the object. Since the larger force is acting in the same direction as the acceleration, the object will accelerate in that direction.

Instructions:

1. Identify the two forces acting on the object.
2. Determine the direction of each force.
3. Calculate the net force acting on the object using the formula F = ma.
4. Determine the acceleration of the object based on the net force and mass.
5. Choose the answer that matches the correct explanation.

Advice:

* Always carefully read the question and understand the problem before answering.
* Use the correct formula to calculate the net force and acceleration of the object.
* Pay attention to the direction of the forces and how they affect the object's motion.
* Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
