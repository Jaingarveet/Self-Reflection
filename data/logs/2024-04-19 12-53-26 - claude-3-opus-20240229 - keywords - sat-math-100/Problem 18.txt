## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step using the error keywords as a guide:
1) $9^{\frac{3}{4}}$ is a fractional exponent. A fractional exponent $a^{\frac{m}{n}}$ is equivalent to the $n$th root of $a$ raised to the $m$th power, i.e., $({\sqrt[n]{a}})^m$.
2) So, $9^{\frac{3}{4}} = ({\sqrt[4]{9}})^3$. This means we first take the 4th root of 9, then cube the result.
3) $\sqrt[4]{9} = \sqrt{\sqrt{9}} = \sqrt{3}$, because the square root of 9 is 3, and the square root of 3 is $\sqrt{3}$.
4) Now, we cube this result: $({\sqrt{3}})^3 = \sqrt{3} \cdot \sqrt{3} \cdot \sqrt{3} = 3\sqrt{3}$.
5) Looking at the choices, $3\sqrt{3}$ is choice D.
Therefore, the correct answer is D.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
