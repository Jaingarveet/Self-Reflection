Question: Alan drives an average of 100 miles each week. His car can travel an average of 25 miles per gallon of gasoline. Alan would like to reduce his weekly expenditure on gasoline by $\$ 5$. Assuming gasoline costs $\$ 4$ per gallon, which equation can Alan use to determine how many fewer average miles, $m$, he should drive each week?
Choices:
  A: $\frac{25}{4} m=95$
  B: $\frac{25}{4} m=5$
  C: $\frac{4}{25} m=95$
  D: $\frac{4}{25} m=5$

## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) Alan currently drives 100 miles per week. His car gets 25 miles per gallon. So the number of gallons he uses per week is:
   100 miles ÷ 25 miles/gallon = 4 gallons
2) At $4 per gallon, his current weekly cost is: 
   4 gallons × $4/gallon = $16
3) Alan wants to reduce this weekly cost by $5. So his new target weekly cost is:
   $16 - $5 = $11
4) At the new target cost of $11 per week, and with gas at $4 per gallon, the number of gallons Alan can buy is:
   $11 ÷ $4/gallon = 2.75 gallons
5) Since his car gets 25 miles per gallon, with 2.75 gallons, the number of miles (m) Alan can drive is:
   m = 2.75 gallons × 25 miles/gallon = 68.75 miles
6) So the equation relating Alan's new target miles (m) to his current miles (100) is:
   (4/25) × m = 100 - 68.75
   (4/25) × m = 31.25
   (4/25) × m = 100 - 5 × (4/25) × 100
   (4/25) × m = 100 - 5 × 4
   (4/25) × m = 100 - 20
   (4/25) × m = 80
Therefore, the correct equation is:
(4/25) × m = 100 - 5 × (4/25) × 100
Which simplifies to:
(4/25) × m = 80
This matches choice C.
Action: Answer("C")
