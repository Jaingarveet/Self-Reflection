## Get Reflection:
 Explanation:
Great, let's break down the solution step by step!

Step 1: Identify the greatest common factor (GCF) of the two positive integers. In this case, the GCF is 11.

Step 2: Divide both integers by their GCF to simplify the problem. Let's say the smaller integer is x, then the larger integer is 3x.

Step 3: Find the least common multiple (LCM) of 3x and x. We can do this by multiplying both integers together: 3x × x = 7700.

Step 4: Simplify the equation by multiplying both sides by 3: x × x = 23100.

Step 5: Find the value of x by dividing both sides by 2: x = 11550.

Step 6: Find the value of the other integer by using the fact that the GCF of 3x and x is 11: 3x = 31550.
