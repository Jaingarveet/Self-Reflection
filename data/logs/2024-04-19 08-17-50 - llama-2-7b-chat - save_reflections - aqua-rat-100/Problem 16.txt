## Get Reflection:
 Explanation:
I made a mistake in my reasoning and calculation. I misunderstood the conversion ratio between the map distance and the actual distance.

The correct conversion ratio is 1/4 inch on the map = 10 miles, not 1/4 inch on the map = 1 mile.

So, if the length of the road from Town F to Town G is measured to be 20 inches on the map, the actual distance can be found by multiplying the map distance by 10, not by 1.

The correct answer is (20 x 10) = 200 miles.

Error Keywords:

* Misunderstanding conversion ratio
* Calculation error
* Multiplication mistake

Solution:
The length of the road from Town F to Town G is 200 miles.

Instructions:

1. Identify the conversion ratio between the map distance and the actual distance.
2. Use the conversion ratio to calculate the actual distance from the map distance.
3. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
4. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.

Advice:

* Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
* Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
* Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
* Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
* Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
* Remember that the conversion ratio between the map distance and the actual distance is important to determine the actual distance.
