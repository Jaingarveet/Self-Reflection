  Explanation:

To find the average number of microwave ovens sold per month during the entire 22 months period, we need to find the average of the average sales per month for the two periods.

For the first 10 months, the average sales per month is 20 microwave ovens.
For the remaining 12 months, the average sales per month is 42 microwave ovens.

To find the average of these two averages, we can add them together and divide by 2:

(20 + 42) / 2 = 30

Therefore, the average number of microwave ovens sold per month during the entire 22 months period is 30.

The correct answer is (D) 30.
