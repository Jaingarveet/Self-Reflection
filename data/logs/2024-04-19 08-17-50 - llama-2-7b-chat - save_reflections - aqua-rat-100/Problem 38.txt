## Get Reflection:
 Explanation:
I correctly answered the question by using the information provided to calculate the number of faces of the smaller cubes that remain unpainted.

Error Keywords:
 - Misunderstanding the problem
 - Calculation error
 - Counting error
Solution:
The hollow cube has a size of 5cm, and the thickness is 1cm, making the volume of the cube 5cm x 5cm x 1cm = 25 cm³.
The cube is made of smaller cubes of size 1cm, so the number of smaller cubes that can fit inside the hollow cube is 25 cm³ / 1 cm³ = 25.
The outer surface of the cube is painted, so the number of faces of the smaller cubes that remain unpainted is 25 - 6 (faces of the smaller cubes that are not painted) = 19.
Instructions:
1. Calculate the volume of the hollow cube.
2. Determine the number of smaller cubes that can fit inside the hollow cube.
3. Calculate the number of faces of the smaller cubes that remain unpainted.
4. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that the number of faces of a cube is 6, regardless of its size.
