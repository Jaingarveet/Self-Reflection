## Get Reflection:
 Explanation:
You have correctly identified the correct answer as option C. The product of the number of workers and the number of hours worked per day does indeed affect the total amount of work completed.

Here's a breakdown of the reasoning behind each option:

A) x2/y2 units: This option suggests that the work completed by y men working y hours per day is equal to x2/y2 units. However, as you pointed out, the ratio of work completed does not change with the number of workers. Therefore, this option is incorrect.

B) y3/x2 units: This option suggests that the work completed by y men working y hours per day is equal to y3/x2 units. However, as you also pointed out, the ratio of work completed does not change with the number of workers. Therefore, this option is also incorrect.

C) x3/y2 units: This option suggests that the work completed by y men working y hours per day is equal to x3/y2 units. This is the correct answer as the ratio of work completed does change with the number of workers.

D) y2/x2 units: This option suggests that the work completed by x men working x hours per day is equal to y2/x2 units. However, as you noted, the ratio of work completed does not change with the number of workers. Therefore, this option is also incorrect.

E) None of these: This option is incorrect as at least one of the options (C) is the correct answer.

Great job! Keep practicing and you'll become more confident in your ability to solve math problems.
