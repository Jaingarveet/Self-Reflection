## Get Reflection:
 Explanation:
I apologize for my mistake earlier. I misunderstood the question and provided an incorrect answer. Thank you for pointing it out.

To answer the question correctly, we need to count the number of ways to arrange the three children on the three identical chairs in a straight line such that Susan is on the left of Tim.

There are 3 identical chairs, and each child can occupy one of the chairs. Therefore, the total number of ways to arrange the children is:

3 x 2 x 1 = 6

So, the correct answer is (B) 3.

Thank you for bringing this to my attention, and I hope this clears up any confusion.
