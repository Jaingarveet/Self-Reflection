## Get Reflection:
 Explanation:
I made a calculation error in my answer. I calculated the average speed as (M + N) / 8, which is incorrect.

The correct calculation for the average speed is:
Total distance traveled = M + N = 4M + 4N / 8
Total time taken = 4 hours
Average speed = Total distance / Total time = (4M + 4N / 8) / 4 = M + N / 8

So, the correct answer is (A) M + N / 8.
