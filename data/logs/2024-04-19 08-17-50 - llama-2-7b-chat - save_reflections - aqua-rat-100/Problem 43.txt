## Get Reflection:
 Explanation:
You are correct that the monthly sales should be $20,000 to reach a monthly salary of $1500. However, the answer I provided is incorrect. The correct answer is (D) $20,000.

Here's why:

You set up the equation correctly:

$500 + (monthly sales x 5%) = $1500

Subtracting $500 from both sides gives you:

$500 + (monthly sales x 5%) = $1000

Dividing both sides by 5% gives you:

Monthly sales = $20,000

Great job!
