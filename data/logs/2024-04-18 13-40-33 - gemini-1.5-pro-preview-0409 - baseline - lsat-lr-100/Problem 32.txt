## User 2:
Topic: Law
Context: Editorial: This political party has repeatedly expressed the view that increasing spending on education is a worthy goal. On other occasions, however, the same party has claimed that the government should not increase spending on education. So this party's policy is clearly inconsistent.
Question: The argument in the editorial depends on assuming which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: It is inconsistent for a legislator both to claim that increasing spending on education is a worthy goal and to vote against increasing spending on education.
  B: A consistent course of action in educational policy is usually the course of action that will reduce spending on education in the long run.
  C: Even if a goal is a morally good one, one should not necessarily try to achieve it.
  D: A consistent political policy does not hold that an action that comprises a worthy goal should not be performed.
  E: Members of one political party never have inconsistent views on how to best approach a political issue.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The editorial claims the party is inconsistent because it supports both increasing and not increasing spending on education. This implies that supporting both is considered inconsistent. 
Action: Answer("A") 
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
