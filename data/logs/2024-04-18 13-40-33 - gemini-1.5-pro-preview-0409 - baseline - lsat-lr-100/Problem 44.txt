Context: Most people who shop for groceries no more than three times a month buy prepared frozen dinners regularly. In Hallstown most people shop for groceries no more than three times a month. Therefore, in Hallstown most people buy prepared frozen dinners regularly.
Question: Which one of the following arguments has a flawed pattern of reasoning most like the flawed reasoning in the argument above?
Choices:
  A: It is clear that most drivers in West Ansland are safe drivers since there are very few driving accidents in West Ansland and most accidents there are not serious.
  B: It is clear that John cannot drive, since he does not own a car and no one in his family who does not own a car can drive.
  C: It is clear that Fernando's friends usually drive to school, since all of his friends can drive and all of his friends go to school.
  D: It is clear that most people in Highland County drive sedans, since most people who commute to work drive sedans and most people in Highland County commute to work.
  E: It is clear that most of Janine's friends are good drivers, since she accepts rides only from good drivers and she accepts rides from most of her friends.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The flawed reasoning in the original argument assumes that everyone who shops infrequently buys frozen dinners, which is an unjustified generalization. We need to find a similar flaw.
  A: This argument assumes that few accidents equate to safe drivers, which is not necessarily true. (Similar flaw) 
  B: This argument assumes that not owning a car equates to not being able to drive, which is not necessarily true. (Different flaw)
  C: This argument assumes that being able to drive and going to school means driving to school, which is not necessarily true. (Different flaw)
  D: This argument assumes that most people in the county commute, which may not be true. (Different flaw)
  E: This argument assumes that Janine's judgment of good drivers is accurate and applies to all situations. (Different flaw)
Action: Answer("A") 
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
