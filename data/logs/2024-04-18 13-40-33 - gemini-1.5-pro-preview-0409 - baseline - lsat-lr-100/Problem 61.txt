## User 2:
Topic: Law
Context: In a recent study, each member of two groups of people, Group A (composed of persons sixty-five to seventy-five years old) and Group B (composed of college students), was required to make a telephone call to a certain number at a specified time. The time when each call was initiated was recorded electronically. Group A proved far better at remembering to make a telephone call precisely at a specified time than did Group B. There were fourteen lapses in Group B but only one lapse in Group A. Clearly, at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages.
Question: Which one of the following, if all of them are true, is LEAST helpful in establishing that the conclusion above is properly drawn?
Choices:
  A: There was the same number of people in each group.
  B: The same group of researchers answered the calls made by the callers in both study groups.
  C: Among the college students there were no persons more than forty years old.
  D: Both groups had unrestricted access to telephones for making the required calls.
  E: The members of the two groups received their instructions approximately the same amount of time before they were to make their telephone calls.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
We need to find the option that LEAST supports the conclusion that one type of memory doesn't decline with age. 
*   Options A, D, and E ensure both groups had equal opportunity and conditions to make the call, strengthening the comparison.
*   Option B ensures consistency in response recording, also strengthening the comparison.
*   Option C, while true, doesn't directly impact the comparison between age groups and their memory performance. 
Action: Answer("C") 
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
