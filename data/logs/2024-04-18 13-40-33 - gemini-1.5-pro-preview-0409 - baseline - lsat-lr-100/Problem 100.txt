## User 2:
Topic: Law
Context: In some jurisdictions, lawmakers have instituted sentencing guidelines that mandate a penalty for theft that is identical to the one they have mandated for bribery. Hence, lawmakers in those jurisdictions evidently consider the harm resulting from theft to be equal to the harm resulting from bribery.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would most strengthen the argument?
Choices:
  A: In general, lawmakers mandate penalties for crimes that are proportional to the harm they believe to result from those crimes.
  B: In most cases, lawmakers assess the level of harm resulting from an act in determining whether to make that act illegal.
  C: Often, in response to the unusually great harm resulting from a particular instance of a crime, lawmakers will mandate an increased penalty for that crime.
  D: In most cases, a victim of theft is harmed no more than a victim of bribery is harmed.
  E: If lawmakers mandate penalties for crimes that are proportional to the harm resulting from those crimes, crime in those lawmakers' jurisdictions will be effectively deterred.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
We need to find an option that strengthens the argument that lawmakers consider the harm from theft equal to the harm from bribery because they instituted identical penalties.
*   A: This supports the general idea of proportionality in sentencing but doesn't specifically address theft and bribery.
*   B: This talks about making acts illegal, not the level of punishment, so it's not relevant.
*   C: This discusses increasing penalties for specific instances, not the general equivalence of harm between two crimes.
*   D: This directly supports the argument by stating that the harm caused by theft is similar to the harm caused by bribery.
*   E: This talks about the effectiveness of deterrence, not the equivalence of harm between the two crimes. 
Action: Answer("D") 
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: A
