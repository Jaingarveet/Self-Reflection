## System:
You are an expert in Law.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Topic: Law
Context: Astronomers have found new evidence that the number of galaxies in the universe is not 10 billion, as previously believed, but 50 billion. This discovery will have an important effect on theories about how galaxies are formed. But even though astronomers now believe 40 billion more galaxies exist, many astronomers' estimates of the universe's total mass remain virtually unchanged.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, does most to explain why the estimates remain virtually unchanged?
Choices:
  A: The mass of galaxies is thought to make up only a tiny percentage of the universe's total mass.
  B: The overwhelming majority of galaxies are so far from Earth that their mass can be only roughly estimated.
  C: The number of galaxies that astronomers believe exist tends to grow as the instruments used to detect galaxies become more sophisticated.
  D: Theories about how galaxies are formed are rarely affected by estimates of the universe's total mass.
  E: There is no consensus among astronomers on the proper procedures for estimating the universe's total mass.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
We need to find the option that explains why the total mass estimate remains unchanged despite the increased number of galaxies.
Option A directly addresses this by stating that the mass of galaxies is a tiny percentage of the universe's total mass, implying that adding more galaxies wouldn't significantly impact the overall estimate. 
Action: Answer("A")
