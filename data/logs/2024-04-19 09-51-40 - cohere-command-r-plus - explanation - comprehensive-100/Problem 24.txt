Explanation:
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
On Tuesday, George gives a report.
On Monday and Wednesday, Olivia and Robert cannot give reports as they cannot give afternoon reports and must be separated from George's report with morning and afternoon reports on each day.
This leaves Helen, Irving, Nina, and Helen to give reports on Monday and Wednesday.
As Helen and Irving must give reports the day after Nina, Nina must give a report on Monday or Wednesday.
If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving give reports on Tuesday and Wednesday.
This means the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday are given by Nina, George, and Helen respectively, matching answer A.
Action: Answer("A")
