Explanation:
## Assistant 2:
Reflection: Acne is a common skin condition that affects individuals of all ages, especially adolescents and young adults. It is characterized by the inflammation of the skin's hair follicles and sebaceous glands, resulting in lesions such as blackheads, whiteheads, pimples, and cysts. 

Comedonal acne, specifically, is a type of acne characterized by non-inflammatory lesions called comedones, which are commonly known as blackheads and whiteheads. They form when hair follicles become clogged with excess oil, dead skin cells, and bacteria. 

The first-line treatment for comedonal acne typically involves the use of topical retinoids. Retinoids are derivatives of vitamin A that help promote cell turnover, unclog pores, and prevent the formation of new comedones. They are very effective in treating comedonal acne and are usually well-tolerated. 

While benzoyl peroxide and topical antibiotics can also be used to treat acne, they are generally more effective for inflammatory types of acne lesions (such as pimples and cysts) caused by bacterial infection and inflammation. These treatments target the bacteria Propionibacterium acnes and help reduce inflammation. However, for non-inflammatory comedonal acne, retinoids are the preferred initial treatment option. 

Therefore, the correct answer is "C: Retinoids."
