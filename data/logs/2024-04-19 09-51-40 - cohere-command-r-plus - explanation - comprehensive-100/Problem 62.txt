## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Explanation:
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
First, subtract $2y - x = -19$ from the equation $3x + 4y = -23$ to get $2x + 3y = -4$. 
Then, subtract $2$ times the second equation from the first equation to get $x = -5$. 
Substitute $x = -5$ into the equation $2y - x = -19$ to get $y = -2$. 
Therefore, the solution is $(x, y) = (-5, -2)$.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
