## System:
You are an expert in Logic.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

## User 2:
Topic: Logic
Context: A laboratory has three types of robots, A.B, and C.Type A can recognize colors, type B can recognize shapes, and type C can neither recognize colors nor shapes.The laboratory experimented with robots 1 and 2 with red balls, blue balls, red squares, and blue squares, and ordered them to pick up the red balls, but number 1 picked up the red squares, and number 2 picked up the blue balls.
Question: Based on the above experiment, which of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Both No.1 and No.2 are type C.
  B: Only one of No.1 and No.2 is C type.
  C: No.1 is type A and No.2 is type B.
  D: No.1 is not Type B and No.2 is not Type A.
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Advice:
- Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
- Always consider all possibilities and do not make assumptions.
- Always eliminate answer choices that cannot be true based on the information given.
- Always choose the answer that must be true based on the information given.
- Always double-check your reasoning and final answer.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The experiment shows that robot No.1 picked up red squares instead of red balls, which means it can recognize color but not shape. Therefore, it must be type A.
Robot No.2 picked up blue balls instead of red balls, which means it can recognize shape but not color. Therefore, it must be type B.
Action: Answer("C")

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly because I made assumptions about the robots' abilities based on their mistakes. However, I realized that I needed to consider what the robots were able to do correctly in order to determine their type. I also eliminated answer choices that could not be true based on the information given, such as both robots being type C or one of them being type C. Finally, I double-checked my reasoning and final answer to ensure that it was correct.
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
