## System:
You are an expert in Logic.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your reasoning and final answer.
 - Remember that logical inferences must be based on the meaning of the statement, not on personal interpretations or assumptions.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The statement "Do not do what you don't want to do to others" is a negative form of the Golden Rule, which means treating others the way you want to be treated.
The logical inference from this statement should be consistent with this principle.
Option A is not a logical inference because it suggests that only those who do what they want can do it to others, which is not necessarily true.
Option B is not a logical inference because it suggests that if you want something, you should give it to others, which is not necessarily true.
Option C is not a logical inference because it suggests that you should not treat others unless you want to, which is not necessarily true.
Option D is a logical inference because it suggests that whatever is applied to people should be what they want, which is consistent with the principle of treating others the way you want to be treated.
Action: Answer("D")

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly because I did not carefully read the question and understand the problem.
I also did not decompose the problem into multiple simple steps and think through each subproblem step-by-step.
I skipped some steps in my reasoning and made assumptions that were not based on the meaning of the statement.
I will remember to always read the question carefully and understand the problem, decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps, think through each subproblem step-by-step, never skip any steps, be explicit in each step of my reasoning, double-check my reasoning and final answer, and remember that logical inferences must be based on the meaning of the statement, not on personal interpretations or assumptions.
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
