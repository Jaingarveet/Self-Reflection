## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Condition (1) states that H and Y must be allocated in the same department.
Condition (2) states that F and G cannot be allocated in the same department.
Condition (3) states that if X is allocated in the sales department, W is allocated in the production department.
Condition (4) states that F must be allocated in the production department.

From condition (4), we know that F must be allocated in the production department.
Since F is in the production department, G cannot be in the production department due to condition (2).
Therefore, G must be in either the public relations department or the sales department.

If G is in the public relations department, then H and Y must be in either the production department or the sales department together due to condition (1).
However, since F is already in the production department, H and Y must be in the sales department.
This leaves I, W, and X to be allocated in the production department and the sales department.
If X is in the sales department, then W must be in the production department due to condition (3).
Therefore, the final distribution would be:
Public Relations Department: G
Production Department: F, I, W
Sales Department: H, Y, X

However, this distribution is not listed in the choices.
Therefore, G must be in the sales department.
This means that H and Y must be in either the public relations department or the production department together due to condition (1).
Since F is already in the production department, H and Y must be in the production department.
This leaves I, W, and X to be allocated in the public relations department and the sales department.
If X is in the sales department, then W must be in the production department due to condition (3).
Therefore, the final distribution would be:
Public Relations Department: I
Production Department: F, H, Y
Sales Department: G, W, X

This distribution is listed in choice A.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
