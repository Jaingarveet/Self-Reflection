  B: The city that implements strict investigation of drunk driving has not eliminated drunk driving.
  C: It is more important to improve drivers' traffic safety awareness than strict management.
  D: In addition to strict investigation of drunk driving, other traffic violations should also be stopped.

## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The inconsistency presented in the question is that the incidence of traffic accidents is similar in cities where drunk driving is strictly investigated and those who do not, despite the belief that strict investigation of drunk driving can reduce traffic accidents.
Option A does not address the inconsistency as it only states that severe investigations of drunk driving have occurred in urban traffic accidents.
Option B addresses the inconsistency by stating that the city that implements strict investigation of drunk driving has not eliminated drunk driving, which could explain why the incidence of traffic accidents is still similar.
Option C does not address the inconsistency as it only suggests that improving drivers' traffic safety awareness is more important than strict management.
Option D does not address the inconsistency as it only suggests that other traffic violations should also be stopped in addition to strict investigation of drunk driving.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
