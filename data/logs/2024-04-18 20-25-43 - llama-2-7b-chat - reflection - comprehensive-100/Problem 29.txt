Context: The organizer of a reading club will select at least five and at most six works from a group of nine works. The group consists of three French novels, three Russian novels, two French plays, and one Russian play. The organizer's selection of works must conform to the following requirements: No more than four French works are selected. At least three but no more than four novels are selected. At least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected. If both French plays are selected, then the Russian play is not selected.

B: Exactly one Russian novel and both French plays are selected.
This option violates the third requirement as both French plays are selected, and the Russian play is not selected.

C: Exactly two French novels and the Russian play are selected.
This option violates the first requirement as there are more than four French works selected.
