## System:
You are an expert in Logic.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The inference is that Zhang Shan's bonus is higher than Miao Xiaoqin's.
The only assumption that contradicts this inference is the one that states Li Si's bonus is higher than Miao Xiaoqin's.
This is because we know that Zhang Shan's bonus is higher than Li Si's, so if Li Si's bonus is higher than Miao Xiaoqin's, then Zhang Shan's bonus would also have to be higher than Miao Xiaoqin's, which is already given in the context.
Action: Answer("B")

Self-reflection:
I previously made a logic error by assuming that all of the choices were possible assumptions that could make the inference hold. However, I realized that one of the choices actually contradicts the inference. I need to be more careful in identifying which assumptions are consistent with the given information and which ones are not.
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: A
