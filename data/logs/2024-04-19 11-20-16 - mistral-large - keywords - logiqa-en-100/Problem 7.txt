## Assistant 2:
Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly by selecting choice "A". However, the fact that the fish is not harmed by the chemical does not explain why some people have not been poisoned after eating the fish.

Upon further reflection, I realized that the correct answer is choice "B". This is because the toxic chemicals may be concentrated in specific parts of the fish that seals eat but people do not, such as the liver or other organs. This would explain why seals are being poisoned by the fish while people are not.

Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
