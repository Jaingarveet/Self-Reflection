## Assistant 2:
Thought:
If the team does not go to I Peak, they cannot reach Lake J (rule 4).
Since at least one of Lake G and Lake J should be visited (rule 1), and Lake J is not an option, the team must visit Lake G.
If the team visits Lake G, they must also visit either City E or City F (rule 2).
Since the team does not go to I Peak, they can still visit H Mountain (rule 3 is not violated).
Therefore, the team can visit City E, Lake G, and H Mountain, or City F, Lake G, and H Mountain.
Action: Answer("C")
