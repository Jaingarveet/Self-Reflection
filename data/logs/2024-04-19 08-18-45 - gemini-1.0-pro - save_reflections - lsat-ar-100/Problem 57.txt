# Model: gemini-1.0-pro | Task: save_reflection | Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Problem 57 of 100
## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that if Nina gives a report, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on the next day. However, the rule only applies if Nina's report is not on Wednesday. 
Error Keywords:
 - Misinterpretation of rule
 - Conditional logic error
 - Inference error
Solution:
Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report.
Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
Since Nina's report cannot be on Tuesday, if Nina gives a report, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Wednesday.
Therefore, if Helen and Nina give reports on the same day, they must give reports on Wednesday.
