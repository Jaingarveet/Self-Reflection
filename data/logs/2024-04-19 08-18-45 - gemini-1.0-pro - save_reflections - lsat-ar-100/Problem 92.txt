## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
My initial answer was incorrect because I focused on analyzing the conditions for each zone individually instead of considering the overall distribution of representatives across all zones. This led me to overlook the constraint that Zone 3 must have more representatives than Zone 2.
## Error Analysis
Here's a breakdown of my errors:
* **Overlooking global constraints:** I failed to consider the overall requirement of Zone 3 having more representatives than Zone 2.
* **Incomplete analysis:** I didn't analyze all possible scenarios for Quinn's placement across the zones, leading to an inaccurate conclusion.
* **Logical inconsistency:** My initial analysis led to a situation where Zone 3 wouldn't have more representatives than Zone 2, contradicting the given information.
## Correct Solution
Here's the correct step-by-step solution:
1. **Identify the minimum number of representatives in Zone 3:** Since Zone 3 needs to have more representatives than Zone 2, and there are 7 representatives in total, Zone 3 must have at least 4 representatives.
2. **Analyze Zone 2:** With Zone 3 having at least 4 representatives, Zone 2 can have a maximum of 3 representatives (7 total - 4 minimum for Zone 3).
3. **Consider Quinn's placement:** Since Zone 3 needs more representatives than Zone 2, Quinn cannot be placed in Zone 2. This eliminates options B and E.
4. **Analyze Zone 1:** If Quinn is placed in Zone 1, then either Parra or Tiao would also be in Zone 1. This leaves only Kim and Mahr for Zone 2, violating the maximum capacity of 3 representatives. Therefore, Quinn cannot be in Zone 1, eliminating option A.
5. **Conclusion:** By elimination, Quinn must be in Zone 3. This means she cannot be in the same zone as Tiao, who must be in either Zone 1 or Zone 2.
## Instructions for Future Problems
1. **Identify all constraints and global conditions.**
2. **Analyze all possible scenarios and combinations.**
3. **Check for logical inconsistencies in your analysis.**
4. **Consider elimination strategies when appropriate.**
5. **Double-check your reasoning and calculations before choosing an answer.**
