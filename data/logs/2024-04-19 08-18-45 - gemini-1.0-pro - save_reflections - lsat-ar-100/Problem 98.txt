# Model: gemini-1.0-pro | Task: save_reflection | Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Problem 98 of 100
## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that the houses shown in the afternoon must be shown in the order L, M, N. However, the rules only state that L must be shown before M, not necessarily in the afternoon. 
The gap in my knowledge was not in legal reasoning but in logical reasoning. 
I knew the correct rules but made an illogical assumption.
Error Keywords:
 - Logical error
 - Assumption error
 - Ordering error
Solution:
J must be shown in the evening.
K cannot be shown in the morning.
L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
One possible order is J, K, L, M, N, O, P.
In this order, P is shown after J.
Instructions:
1. Identify the rules that govern the order in which the houses can be shown.
2. Consider all possible orders in which the houses can be shown that satisfy the rules.
3. Determine whether the statement in each answer choice is true for all possible orders.
4. Choose the answer choice that is true for all possible orders.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always identify the rules that govern the problem.
 - Always consider all possible scenarios that satisfy the rules.
 - Never make assumptions that are not explicitly stated in the rules.
 - Always double-check your reasoning and final answer.
 - Remember that logical reasoning requires considering all possible scenarios, not just the most likely scenario.
