## Reflection on Incorrect Answer:
My initial analysis was correct in identifying the key constraints and deductions. However, I made a crucial error in assuming that the fourth solo had to be modern if Zara played it. This assumption led me to incorrectly conclude that Wayne could not play the fourth solo, which ultimately resulted in choosing the wrong answer.
## Error Analysis:
* **Oversimplification:** I oversimplified the possibilities for the fourth solo, focusing only on the modern piece option for Zara and neglecting the traditional piece option.
* **Incomplete Reasoning:** My reasoning regarding the fourth solo was incomplete. I failed to consider the possibility that the fourth solo could be traditional, even if Zara played it.
## Correct Solution:
1. **First Solo:** We know the first and second solos are performed by the same pianist. 
2. **Third Solo:** This is a traditional piece.
3. **Fourth Solo:** Either Wayne performs a traditional piece or Zara performs a modern piece.
4. **Fifth Solo:** The pianist who performs the second solo does not perform the fifth solo.
5. **No Traditional Piece Until Wayne Plays Modern:** This means Wayne must play a modern piece before the third solo (which is traditional).
**Combining the information:**
* Since the first and second solos are by the same pianist, and the second solo pianist doesn't play the fifth, the first pianist must also play the fifth solo.
* The third solo is traditional, and exactly two traditional pieces are performed consecutively. This means the fourth solo must also be traditional (otherwise, the third and fourth wouldn't be consecutive).
* Since the fourth solo is traditional, and Wayne must play a modern piece before the third (traditional) solo, Wayne cannot play the fourth solo. Therefore, Zara must play the fourth solo.
* As the first and fifth solos are by the same pianist, and the fourth solo is by Zara, Wayne must play the first and fifth solos.
**Therefore, the following must be true:**
* **A: Zara performs the first solo.** (This follows from the deduction that Wayne plays the first and fifth solos.)
* **B: Wayne performs the third solo.** (This follows from the information that the third solo is traditional and Wayne plays a modern piece before it.)
* **C: Zara performs the fifth solo.** (This follows from the deduction that Wayne plays the first and fifth solos.)
* **D: The second solo is a traditional piece.** (This follows from the information that the third and fourth solos are both traditional.)
* **E: The fourth solo is a modern piece.** (This is not necessarily true. The fourth solo could be either modern or traditional, depending on whether Wayne or Zara plays it.)
**Conclusion:**
The only statement that must be true is **C: Zara performs the fifth solo.** 
## Instructions for Future Problems:
1. **Identify all constraints and deductions carefully.**
2. **Consider all possibilities for each variable, not just the most obvious ones.**
3. **Reason through each step logically and ensure your conclusions are consistent with all constraints.**
4. **Double-check your reasoning and calculations before choosing an answer.**
## General Advice for Similar Problems:
* **Break down complex problems into smaller, more manageable steps.**
* **Visualize the problem using diagrams or tables if helpful.**
* **Test your deductions against all constraints to ensure consistency.**
* **Don't be afraid to revise your assumptions if they lead to contradictions.**
* **Practice solving similar problems to improve your reasoning skills.**
By following these steps and advice, I can improve my accuracy in solving complex logic problems in the future.
