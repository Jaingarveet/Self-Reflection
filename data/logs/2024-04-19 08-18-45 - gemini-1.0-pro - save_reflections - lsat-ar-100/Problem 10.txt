## Get Reflection:
## Explanation:
My initial analysis was correct in identifying the requirements and analyzing each option. However, I made a mistake in evaluating option C. I incorrectly concluded that it violated the requirement of selecting at least three novels. In reality, option C satisfies all the requirements:
* **Number of works:** 2 French novels + 2 Russian novels + 2 French plays = 6 works (within the limit of 5-6 works).
* **French works:** 2 French novels + 2 French plays = 4 works (within the limit of 4 French works).
* **Novels:** 2 French novels + 2 Russian novels = 4 novels (within the 3-4 novels range).
* **French vs. Russian novels:** 2 French novels >= 2 Russian novels (satisfies the requirement).
* **French plays and Russian play:** Since only 2 French plays are selected, the Russian play can be included without violating any requirement.
## Error Keywords:
* **Misinterpretation:** I misinterpreted the requirement for novels, focusing only on the minimum (3) and overlooking the maximum (4).
* **Inattentive reading:** I failed to carefully consider all aspects of option C, leading to a hasty conclusion.
## Solution:
1. **Identify the requirements:** Carefully read and understand all the requirements regarding the number of works, types of works, and limitations.
2. **Analyze each option:** Systematically evaluate each option against each requirement, ensuring all aspects are considered.
3. **Double-check calculations:** If calculations are involved, double-check them for accuracy to avoid misinterpretations.
4. **Consider all possibilities:** Ensure all possible combinations within the given constraints are explored before reaching a conclusion.
## Instructions:
1. Read the question and context thoroughly.
2. Break down the problem into smaller, manageable parts.
3. Identify the key requirements and limitations.
4. Analyze each option systematically against each requirement.
5. Double-check calculations and interpretations.
6. Consider all possible scenarios before making a final decision.
## General Advice:
* **Read carefully and understand the problem completely.**
* **Break down complex problems into smaller, more manageable steps.**
* **Identify key requirements and limitations.**
* **Analyze each option systematically and thoroughly.**
* **Double-check calculations and interpretations.**
