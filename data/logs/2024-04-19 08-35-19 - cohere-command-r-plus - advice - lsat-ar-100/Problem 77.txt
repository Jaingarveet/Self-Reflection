Context: An administrator must assign parking spaces to six new employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young. Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
Question: For how many of the six new employees is the assignment of a parking space limited to one of only two possible spaces?
Choices:
  A: none
  B: two
  C: three

Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Advice:
- Understand the rules and conditions thoroughly. Ensure you interpret "must be higher/lower" as providing flexibility rather than strict limitations. 
- Consider the most flexible scenarios first, as these will provide the lower bound for the number of possible options. 
- Systematically work through each employee's options, considering the impact of each possible assignment on the remaining employees.
## Assistant 2:
Reflection: I incorrectly answered "B" previously. I now understand that the question asks for how many employees there are for whom there are only two possible parking space options. 

First, we can assign Robertson to parking space #4, which satisfies all conditions and leaves the most flexibility for the remaining employees. 

Now, we can assign Young to either #5 or #6, as long as Togowa isn't assigned #6. So, Young has 2 options. 

Togowa can be assigned any space from #1 to #5, so they have 5 options. 

Souza and Xu must be on adjacent spots due to the rule regarding their assignments. They can be assigned to spots #1 and #2 or spots #2 and #3, so they each have 2 options. 

Vaughn has the remaining spot, so they have only 1 option. 

In total, 2 + 1 = 3 employees have only 2 possible space options.
Action: Answer("C")

Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: D
