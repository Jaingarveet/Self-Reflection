Context: Exactly eight books—F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O—are placed on a bookcase with exactly three shelves—the top shelf, the middle shelf, and the bottom shelf. At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.
Question: If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: F and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  B: G and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.

## Assistant 2:
Thought: Given that L must be placed on a higher shelf than H, and that O must be placed higher than L, it can be deduced that O cannot be on the bottom shelf. This leaves the middle and top shelves for O, K, and F/M.

I is placed on the middle shelf and K is on a higher shelf than F, so K and O cannot be on the middle shelf as this would mean the top shelf only has one book. Therefore, K and O must be on the top shelf together. This means that F and M are also on the top shelf together.

As a result, statement A must be true: F and G are placed on the same shelf.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: C
