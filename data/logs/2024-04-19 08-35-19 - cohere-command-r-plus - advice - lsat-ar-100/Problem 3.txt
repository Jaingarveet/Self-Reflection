## User 2:
Topic: Law
Context: An administrator must assign parking spaces to six new employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young. Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
Question: If Robertson is assigned parking space #3, then which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Souza is assigned parking space #4.
  B: Togowa is assigned parking space #2.
  C: Vaughn is assigned parking space #5.
  D: Xu is assigned parking space #6.
  E: Young is assigned parking space #2.

Advice:
- Read and understand all the conditions and rules governing the parking space assignments.
- Carefully interpret the conditions, avoiding assumptions or oversimplifications.
- Systematically work through each possible assignment, considering all conditions and constraints.
- Remember that the question asks for a definite consequence, so focus on identifying the options that must be true based on the given information.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: If Robertson is assigned parking space #3, then Young must be assigned a higher number, which is either #4, #5, or #6.

Given that Robertson must be assigned a higher number than Young, this means Young could be assigned #4, with Robertson taking #5 or #6, which doesn't satisfy the condition. Therefore, Young must be assigned #5 or #6.

Now, considering the condition that Young must have a higher number than Togowa, we can deduce that Togowa must have #2, #3, or #4. Togowa cannot have #4, as this would force Young into #6, leaving no suitable options for Robertson. So, Togowa could be assigned #2 or #3.

With these assignments, the conditions for Xu and Souza are met, as they can be assigned any of the remaining spaces, which are higher-numbered.

So, the only definite consequence of assigning Robertson parking space #3 is that Togowa will be assigned #2.
Action: Answer("B")
