Context: A bakery makes exactly three kinds of cookieâ€”oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar. Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day. The following conditions apply: No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
Question: If the number of batches made on Friday is exactly one, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: The first batch of sugar cookies is made on Monday.
  B: The first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Tuesday.
  C: The third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Friday.

## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Let's break this down step by step:
1. We know that at least one batch is made on Monday, and the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. So, we can place these on Monday, leaving sugar cookies for another day.

| Monday | Tuesday | Wednesday | Thursday | Friday |
| ------ | ------- | ---------- | -------- | ------ |
| Oatmeal |          |             |           |         |
| Peanut Butter |       |             |           |         |

2. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday. As no two batches of the same kind are made on the same day, the first and third batches of sugar cookies cannot be made on Thursday.

3. We are told that exactly one batch is made on Friday. This could be any of the three types of cookies, but let's consider which options this eliminates:
   - Option A is eliminated because if the first batch of sugar cookies were made on Monday, we'd have two batches of sugar cookies on the same day (contradicting the given conditions).
   - Option D is eliminated because if the first batch of peanut butter cookies were made on Wednesday, and the second batch were made on the same day as the second batch of oatmeal cookies, we'd again have two batches of the same type on the same day (this time, Thursday).

4. So, we are left with Options B, C, and E, which don't contradict the conditions provided. Therefore, the answer is that multiple options could be true, and we don't have enough information to narrow it down further.
