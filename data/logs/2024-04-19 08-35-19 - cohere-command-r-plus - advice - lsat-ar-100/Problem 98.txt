## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The rules state that J must be shown in the evening and K cannot be shown in the morning. L must be shown after K and before M. 

One possible order that satisfies these conditions is: K (afternoon), L (afternoon), M (afternoon), N (evening), O (evening), J (evening), and P (night). 

In this order, K is shown before L and M, and J is shown in the evening. N and O are shown after M, and P can be shown at any time after K.

Therefore, choices D and E are possible.

Answer: Choices D and E are correct.
