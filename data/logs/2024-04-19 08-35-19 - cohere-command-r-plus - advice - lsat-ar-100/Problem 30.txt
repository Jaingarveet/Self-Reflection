Context: During a recital, two pianists—Wayne and Zara—will perform solos. There will be five solos altogether, performed one immediately after another. Each solo will be either a modern piece or a traditional piece. The choice of pianist and type of piece for the solos must conform to the following conditions: The third solo is a traditional piece. Exactly two of the traditional pieces are performed consecutively. In the fourth solo, either Wayne performs a traditional piece or Zara performs a modern piece. The pianist who performs the second solo does not perform the fifth solo. No traditional piece is performed until Wayne performs at least one modem piece.
Question: If the pianist who performs the first solo also performs the second solo, then which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Zara performs the first solo.
  B: Wayne performs the third solo.
  C: Zara performs the fifth solo.

## Assistant 2:
Thought: If the pianist who performs the first solo also performs the second solo, it must be Wayne due to the condition that "No traditional piece is performed until Wayne performs at least one modern piece." This means that the first two solos must be modern pieces, and as the third solo is a traditional piece, it cannot be performed by the same pianist.

Therefore, if Wayne performs the first and second solos, Zara must perform the third solo, corresponding to choice B.
Action: Answer("B")

Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: C
