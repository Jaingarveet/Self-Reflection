Context: A shopping center has exactly seven spaces—space 1 through space 7—arranged in a straight row. Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
Question: If the shoe store is in space 2, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: The optometrist is in space 5.
  B: The pharmacy is in space 1.

## Assistant 2:
Thought: With the shoe store in space 2, the pharmacy (which must be at one end) can be in space 1, and the toy store (which cannot be next to the veterinarian) can be in space 3. This leaves spaces 4, 5, 6, and 7 for the remaining stores. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, which means one restaurant can be in space 5 and the other in space 7. Finally, as the pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, we can place the optometrist in space 6 and the veterinarian in space 4. Therefore, the correct answer is that the optometrist is in space 5.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
