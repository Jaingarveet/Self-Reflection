Context: Of the eight students—George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert—in a seminar, exactly six will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
Question: Which one of the following is a pair of students who, if they give reports on the same day as each other, must give reports on Wednesday?
Choices:
  A: George and Lenore
  B: Helen and Nina
  C: Irving and Robert

## Assistant 2:
Reflection: I understand that Tuesday is the only day George can present and that Nina presenting means Helen and Irving must present the following day, unless Nina presents on Wednesday.

For A to be true, George must present in the morning and Lenore in the afternoon.

B is incorrect because if Nina presents, Helen and Irving must present the next day. They cannot present on the same day.

C is incorrect because there are other days Irving and Robert can present together.

D is the correct answer. If Nina presents, Helen and Irving must present the next day. Therefore, if Nina and Kyle present on the same day, it must be Wednesday, as Tuesday is reserved for George.

E is incorrect because there are no conditions preventing them from presenting on other days.

Answer: Based on the conditions, the correct answer is D: Kyle and Nina.
## Result:
Agent Answer: None
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
