Context: Of the eight students—George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert—in a seminar, exactly six will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
Question: Which one of the following could be the schedule of the students' reports?
Choices:
  A: Mon. morning: Helen; Mon. afternoon: Robert Tues. morning: Olivia; Tues. afternoon: Irving Wed. morning: Lenore; Wed. afternoon: Kyle
  B: Mon. morning: Irving; Mon. afternoon: Olivia Tues. morning: Helen; Tues. afternoon: Kyle Wed. morning: Nina; Wed. afternoon: Lenore
  C: Mon. morning: Lenore; Mon. afternoon: Helen Tues. morning: George; Tues. afternoon: Kyle Wed. morning: Robert; Wed. afternoon: Irving
  D: Mon. morning: Nina; Mon. afternoon: Helen Tues. morning: Robert; Tues. afternoon: Irving Wed. morning: Olivia; Wed. afternoon: Lenore

 - Stay organized by creating a table or list to allocate students to specific time slots. 
 - Double-check your final schedule to ensure it meets all the criteria.
## Assistant 2:
Reflection: I made a mistake in my previous attempt by not correctly interpreting the condition regarding Nina's report. I placed Nina on Tuesday morning, which triggered the condition that Helen and Irving must give reports on the next day, Wednesday. This left no flexibility for the Monday schedule and resulted in an incorrect allocation. To avoid this error, I should have first considered the conditions of the other students before placing Nina on a specific day.
