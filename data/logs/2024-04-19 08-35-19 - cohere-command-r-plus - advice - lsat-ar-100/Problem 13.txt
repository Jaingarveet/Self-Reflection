## Assistant 2:
Reflection: I made a mistake in interpreting the condition, "Franco does not testify on the same day that Garcia testifies." I initially understood this to mean that Franco and Garcia could not testify on the same day as each other, but it actually means they must testify on different days. This changes the scheduling options for these two witnesses and, consequently, affects the day Hong can testify, as Hong cannot testify on the same day as Franco.

Thought: Given that Iturbe testifies on Wednesday and Hong cannot testify on Monday, if Franco and Hong testify on the same day, that leaves Tuesday as the only option for their joint testimony. This means that Garcia must testify on Monday or Wednesday to fulfill the condition that Franco and Garcia do not testify on the same day. As Monday is the only option for a day with one witness, Garcia must testify on Monday. Therefore, this schedule satisfies all the conditions provided.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
