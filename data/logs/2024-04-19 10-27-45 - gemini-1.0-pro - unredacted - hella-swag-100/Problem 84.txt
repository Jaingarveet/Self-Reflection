Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to make eggplant fritters [title] Slice the eggplant into 3 mm (1/8 of an inch, or 1/3 of a cm) thick slices. [step] You can slice in rounds or lengths; the preference is yours but round slices tend to be easier to handle. [title] Soak in salted water for 10 minutes.
Choices:
  A: [step] This is to insure that they don't taste salty. [title] Carefully pour the chicken stock over the eggplant slices.

  C: [step] The cooking time varies; you can cover the dish with something like a lid or spread olive oil over the top; however, for this recipe , 2 to 3 minutes of added cooking time should be fine. [title] Drain the eggplant in a colander.

Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that the next step in the recipe would be to remove the eggplant from the salted water. However, the correct answer is to drain the eggplant after 10 minutes and leave it to one side for later use. This is because the eggplant needs to be patted dry before being coated in the egg mixture.
