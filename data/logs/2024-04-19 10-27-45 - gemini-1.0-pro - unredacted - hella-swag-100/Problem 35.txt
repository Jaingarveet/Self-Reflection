Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to decorate white bedding [title] Pick bedding with stitching patterns for additional texture. [step] White bedding can be a little boring if you don't add other color or texture for visual interest. Interesting stitching patterns, such as white embroidery, can introduce some much-needed texture to your bed.
Choices:
  A: You'll also add a touch of variety with the pillows and blankets. [substeps] The regular colors include merino blue and red pillows, and white linens can create a striking contrast with the exact color of your headboard.
  B: [substeps] For example, if you have a white blanket or comforter, pick one that has a stitched pattern in white. The pattern could be as simple as wavy lines, but it could be more complicated, too-anything from roses to stars or leaves.
  C: Solid color bedding is the best choice because it shows color and texture in the room without leaving bulk. [title] Add a lamp on a shelf next to your bed to add texture.
  D: Don't feel like you have to opt for a constant patterned pattern or pattern. You can choose a white color of bedding you like or sit down and start making columns about how you intend to use your linens.

## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:**
I incorrectly chose option A over B because I focused on the presence of specific examples of stitching patterns in both options. However, I overlooked the fact that option B provides a more comprehensive and relevant explanation of how to choose and implement stitching patterns on white bedding. Option A, while mentioning specific colors and contrasting elements, deviates from the core topic of stitching patterns and introduces unrelated elements like headboard color.
**Error Keywords:**
* **Focus on specific details:** I prioritized the presence of specific examples over the overall coherence and relevance of the answer.
* **Incomplete understanding of the prompt:** I failed to fully grasp the prompt's emphasis on providing specific examples of stitching patterns for white bedding.
* **Lack of critical evaluation:** I did not critically evaluate each option to determine which one best addressed the prompt's requirements.
**Solution:**
1. **Identify the prompt's key elements:** The prompt focuses on decorating white bedding with stitching patterns for added texture.
2. **Analyze each option:**
    * **Option A:** Introduces irrelevant elements like headboard color and focuses on color choices rather than stitching patterns.
    * **Option B:** Provides specific examples of stitching patterns (wavy lines, roses, stars, leaves) and emphasizes their application on white bedding.
    * **Option C:** Discusses solid color bedding and introduces an unrelated element (lamp on a shelf).
    * **Option D:** Focuses on choosing white bedding color and lacks specific examples of stitching patterns.
3. **Choose the option that best addresses the prompt:** Option B directly addresses the prompt by providing specific examples of stitching patterns suitable for white bedding.
**Instructions for Future Reference:**
1. **Read the prompt carefully and identify its key elements.**
2. **Analyze each option thoroughly, considering its relevance and coherence to the prompt.**
3. **Prioritize options that provide specific examples and directly address the prompt's requirements.**
4. **Avoid options that introduce irrelevant elements or deviate from the prompt's focus.**
5. **Critically evaluate each option before making a final decision.**
**General Advice for Similar Problems:**
* **Focus on understanding the prompt's intent and key elements.**
* **Analyze each option critically, considering its relevance and coherence.**
* **Prioritize options that provide specific examples and directly address the prompt.**
* **Avoid options that introduce irrelevant elements or deviate from the prompt's focus.**
