Topic: Logic
Context: In the past, we had a lot of unrealistic high-profile in moral propaganda, so that a lot of the population said one thing and made one behind the other, and split personality.Through thinking about this phenomenon, some scholars have proposed that we should only ask ordinary people to abide by the "bottom line ethics".
