## System:
You are an expert in Logic.
You have incorrectly answered the following multiple-choice question.
Your task is to reflect on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
You will then use this information help you answer the same question in the future.
First, explain why you answered the question incorrectly.
Second, list the keywords that describe the type of your errors from most general to most specific. 
Third, solve the problem again, step-by-step, based on your knowledge of the correct answer.
Fourth, create a list of detailed instructions to help you correctly solve this problem in the future.
Finally, create a list of general advice to help you solve similar types of problems in the future.  
Be concise in your response; however, capture all of the essential information.  
For guidance, I will provide you with a single generic example problem and reflection (below).
## User 1:
Topic: Geography and Math
Question: What is the product of the number of letters contained in the name of the city where Iowa State University is located multiplied by the number of letters contained in the name of the state?
Choices:
    A: 16
    B: 20
    C: 24
    D: 32
Thought:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
ISU is located in the state of Iowa.
Action: Answer("D")
---
Correct Answer: A
## Assistant 1:
Explanation:
I miscalculated the product of the number of letters in the city and state names. 
The gap in my knowledge was not in geography but in basic arithmetic. 
I knew the correct city and state but made a calculation error.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Arithmetic error
 - Multiplication error
Solution:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
Iowa State University is located in the state of Iowa.
The city name "Ames" contains 4 letters.
The state name "Iowa" contains 4 letters.
The product of 4*4 is 16.
Instructions:
1. Identify the city where the university is located.
2. Identify the state where the university is located.
3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.
4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.
5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.
6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.
7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them.
## User 2:
Topic: Logic
Context: A laboratory has three types of robots, A.B, and C.Type A can recognize colors, type B can recognize shapes, and type C can neither recognize colors nor shapes.The laboratory experimented with robots 1 and 2 with red balls, blue balls, red squares, and blue squares, and ordered them to pick up the red balls, but number 1 picked up the red squares, and number 2 picked up the blue balls.
Question: Based on the above experiment, which of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Both No.1 and No.2 are type C.
  B: Only one of No.1 and No.2 is C type.
  C: No.1 is type A and No.2 is type B.
  D: No.1 is not Type B and No.2 is not Type A.

Thought:
Robot 1 picked up the red squares, which means it can recognize shapes but not colors.
Robot 2 picked up the blue balls, which means it can recognize colors but not shapes.
Therefore, robot 1 must be type B and robot 2 must be type A.
Action: Answer("C")

 --- 
Correct Answer: D
## Assistant 2:
Response:
Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that the robots could only recognize one type of object (either colors or shapes). However, the robots could potentially recognize both colors and shapes.
Error Keywords:
- Oversimplification
- Incomplete analysis
- Ignoring possibilities
Solution:
Robot 1 picked up the red squares, which means it can recognize shapes.
Robot 2 picked up the blue balls, which means it can recognize colors.
However, we don't know if they can recognize both colors and shapes.
Therefore, we cannot determine the specific types of robots 1 and 2.
Instructions:
1. Identify the capabilities of each robot based on the experiment.
2. Consider all possible combinations of capabilities for each robot.
3. Eliminate options that are contradicted by the experiment.
4. Choose the option that is consistent with all observations.
Advice:
- Avoid making assumptions that are not explicitly stated.
- Consider all possible scenarios before drawing conclusions.
- Be cautious about eliminating options without sufficient evidence.
- Remember that the absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.
