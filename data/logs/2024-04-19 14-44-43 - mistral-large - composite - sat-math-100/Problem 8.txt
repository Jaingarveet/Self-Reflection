Error Keywords:

* Calculation error
* Multiplication error

Solution:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames.
The city name "Ames" contains 4 letters.
The state name "Iowa" contains 4 letters.
The product of 4*4 is 16.

Instructions:

1. Identify the city where the university is located.
2. Identify the state where the university is located.
3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.
4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.
5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.
6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.
7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.

Advice:

* Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
* Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
* Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
* Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
* Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
* Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let's denote the original price of the laptop as x.
The discounted price is 80% of the original price, which is 0.8x.
The sales tax is 8% of the discounted price, which is 0.08(0.8x) = 0.064x.
The total amount Alma paid is the sum of the discounted price and the sales tax, which is 0.8x + 0.064x = 0.864x.
We are given that the total amount Alma paid is p, so we have the equation 0.864x = p.
To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 0.864, which gives us x = p / 0.864.
However, we need to express x in terms of p using the given answer choices.
We can rewrite 0.864 as (0.8)(1.08), which gives us x = p / (0.8)(1.08).
