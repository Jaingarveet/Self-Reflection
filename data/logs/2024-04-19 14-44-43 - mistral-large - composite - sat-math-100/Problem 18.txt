## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I made a calculation error.
The gap in my knowledge was not in geography but in basic arithmetic.
I knew the correct city and state but made a calculation error.

Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Arithmetic error
 - Multiplication error

Solution:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
Iowa State University is located in the state of Iowa.
The city name "Ames" contains 4 letters.
The state name "Iowa" contains 4 letters.
The product of 4*4 is 16.

Instructions:
1. Identify the city where the university is located.
2. Identify the state where the university is located.
3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.
4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.
5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.
6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.
7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.

Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
To solve $9^{\frac{3}{4}}$, we can rewrite it as $(\sqrt[4]{9})^3$.

Calculation:
$\sqrt[4]{9} \approx 1.732$
$1.732^3 \approx 5.196$

However, none of the given choices match this value.

Reflection:
I made a calculation error. The gap in my knowledge was not in understanding the concept of exponents and roots, but in performing the calculation correctly.

Solution:
To solve $9^{\frac{3}{4}}$, we can rewrite it as $(\sqrt[4]{9})^3$.

Calculation:
$\sqrt[4]{9} = 3^{\frac{1}{2}}$ (since $9 = 3^2$)
$3^{\frac{1}{2}} = \sqrt{3}$
$(\sqrt{3})^3 = 3 \sqrt{3}$

Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
