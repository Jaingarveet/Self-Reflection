## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: Mr. Kohl has a beaker containing $n$ milliliters of solution to distribute to the students in his chemistry class. If he gives each student 3 milliliters of solution, he will have 5 milliliters left over. In order to give each student 4 milliliters of solution, he will need an additional 21 milliliters. How many students are in the class?
Choices:
  A: 16
  B: 21
  C: 23
  D: 26
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I made an error in my mathematical reasoning and calculation.
The gap in my knowledge was in algebraic manipulation and solving equations.
I incorrectly set up the equation and did not correctly simplify it to solve for x.
Error Keywords:
 - Algebraic error
 - Equation setup error
 - Simplification error
Solution:
Let's denote the number of students in the class as x.
When Mr. Kohl gives each student 3 milliliters of solution, he has 5 milliliters left over. This means that the total amount of solution distributed is 3x + 5.
When Mr. Kohl gives each student 4 milliliters of solution, he needs an additional [REDACTED] milliliters. This means that the total amount of solution distributed is 4x + [REDACTED].
Since the total amount of solution distributed is the same in both cases, we can set up the following equation:
3x + 5 = 4x - [REDACTED]
Simplifying the equation, we get:
3x + 5 + [REDACTED] = 4x - [REDACTED] + [REDACTED]
3x + [REDACTED] = 4x
Subtracting 3x from both sides, we get:
[REDACTED] = x
However, this answer is not one of the available choices. This means that there must be a mistake in the question or the choices provided.
Instructions:
1. Denote the number of students in the class as x.
2. Set up an equation based on the information given in the question.
3. Simplify the equation to solve for x.
4. Double-check your calculations and simplification steps.
5. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember to simplify equations correctly and solve for the correct variable.
 - Be aware of common algebraic errors such as equation setup errors and simplification errors.
