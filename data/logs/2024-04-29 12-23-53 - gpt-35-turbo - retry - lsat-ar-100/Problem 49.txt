## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. So, the pharmacy must be in either space 1 or space 7. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. So, the restaurant cannot be in space 2 or space 6. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. So, if the pharmacy is in space 1, then the optometrist or the veterinarian must be in space 2. If the pharmacy is in space 7, then the optometrist or the veterinarian must be in space 6. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian. So, if the veterinarian is in space 2, then the toy store cannot be in space 1 or space 3. If the veterinarian is in space 6, then the toy store cannot be in space 5 or space 7. 
Option A violates the constraint that the pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
Option B satisfies all the constraints.
Option C violates the constraint that the pharmacy must be at one end of the row.
Option D violates the constraint that the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
Option E violates the constraint that the restaurant must be at one end of the row.
Action: Answer("B")
