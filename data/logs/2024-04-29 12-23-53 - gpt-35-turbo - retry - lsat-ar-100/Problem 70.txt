Topic: Law
Context: A maintenance company that takes service requests from three clients—Image, Solide, and Truvest—plans to set targets for its average service response times. Service targets will be set at 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day. Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail. The six targets are set according to the following conditions: None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
Question: If Solide's voicemail target is shorter than Truvest's website target, which one of the following targets could be 2 days?
Choices:
  A: Image's website target
  B: Image's voicemail target
  C: Solide's website target

## Assistant 2:
Thought:
If Solide's voicemail target is shorter than Truvest's website target, then Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target. Therefore, Truvest's website target cannot be 2 days. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets, so Image's voicemail target cannot be 2 days. If Image's website target is 2 days, then Image's voicemail target must be shorter than 2 days, which contradicts the condition that none of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Therefore, Image's website target cannot be 2 days. Solide's website target can be 2 days, and Truvest's voicemail target can be shorter than 2 days.
