Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day.

## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. So, the second batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Monday or Friday. 
The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday. So, the first batch of sugar cookies cannot be made on Monday or Tuesday.
At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday. So, the first batch of oatmeal or sugar cookies must be made on Monday.
Using these conditions, we can eliminate some of the answer choices.
Option A: The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Wednesday, which means the first batch of peanut butter cookies is also made on Wednesday. But the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, so this option is not possible.
Option B: The first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Monday, which means the second batch of peanut butter cookies is also made on Monday. But the first batch of sugar cookies cannot be made on Monday or Tuesday, so this option is not possible.
Option C: The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Thursday, which means the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Wednesday. But the first batch of sugar cookies must be made on Monday, so this option is not possible.
Option D: The first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Monday, which means the second batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday. The first batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, which satisfies all the conditions. So, this option could be the correct answer.
Option E: The first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Monday, which means the second batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Thursday. But the first batch of sugar cookies must be made on Monday, so this option is not possible.
Action: Answer("D")
