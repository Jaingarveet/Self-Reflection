Context: A government needs to assign new ambassadors to Venezuela, Yemen, and Zambia. The candidates for these ambassadorships are Jaramillo, Kayne, Landon, Novetzke, and Ong. One ambassador will be assigned to each country, and no ambassador will be assigned to more than one country. The assignment of the ambassadors must meet the following constraints: Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships. If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne. If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen. If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
Question: Which one of the following CANNOT be true?
Choices:
  A: Jaramillo is assigned as ambassador to Zambia.
  B: Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Zambia.
  C: Novetzke is assigned as ambassador to Zambia.
  D: Landon is not assigned to an ambassadorship.

## Assistant 2:
Thought:
If Jaramillo is assigned as ambassador to one country, then Kayne must also be assigned as ambassador to one country. Therefore, if Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Zambia, then Jaramillo must also be assigned as ambassador to Zambia. If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it must be to Zambia. Therefore, Landon cannot be assigned as ambassador to Venezuela or Yemen. If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne cannot be assigned as ambassador to Yemen. If Novetzke is assigned as ambassador to one country, then Kayne cannot be assigned as ambassador to the other two countries. Therefore, Novetzke cannot be assigned as ambassador to Zambia.
Action: Answer("C")
