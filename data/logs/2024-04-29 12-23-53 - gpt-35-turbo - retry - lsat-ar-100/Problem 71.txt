Context: A software company employs exactly seven sales representatives—Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall—to work in its three sales zones—Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3. Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

## Assistant 2:
Thought:
From the given conditions, we know that Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1, Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2, and Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. Therefore, Parra and Quinn must work in Zone 3. Also, there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, we can eliminate options A and B. Option C only has two sales representatives, so it cannot be correct. Option D has three sales representatives, but we know that Parra and Quinn must work in Zone 3, so this option is also incorrect. Option E has all four sales representatives that we know must work in Zone 3, so it is the correct answer.
Action: Answer("E")
## Result:
Agent Answer: E
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
