## Assistant 2:
Thought:
If both G and H are selected, then we have at least one botanist and one chemist. 
If we select F, then we have one botanist, one chemist, and one zoologist. 
If we select K, then we have one botanist, two chemists, and no zoologist. 
If we select M, then we have one botanist, two chemists, and two zoologists. 
Option A is incorrect because we cannot select both F and K. 
Option B is incorrect because we cannot select both K and M. 
Option C is incorrect because we cannot select both K and M. 
Option D is incorrect because we cannot select M without selecting both P and R. 
Option E is correct because we can select either P or Q as the third scientist to satisfy the condition that we have at least one scientist of each type. 
Action: Answer("E")
