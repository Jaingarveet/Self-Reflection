Context: A chemistry class has six lab sessions scheduled over three days—Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday—one session heing held each morning and one each afternoon. Each session will be led by a different lab assistant—Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, or Rebecca.

Nessa must lead an afternoon session. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.

## Assistant 2:
Thought:
If Julio and Kevin both lead morning sessions, then Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day. Therefore, Lan's session cannot meet on Thursday afternoon (because Olivia's session would have to be on Thursday morning, which is not possible). Nessa must lead an afternoon session, so she cannot lead a morning session. Therefore, Nessa's session must meet on Friday afternoon. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's. Therefore, if Olivia's session meets on Thursday morning, then Julio's session must meet on Wednesday morning. If Olivia's session meets on Friday morning, then Julio's session must meet on Wednesday or Thursday morning. Therefore, any of the answer choices could be true except for the one that contradicts the constraints. 
Action: Answer("B")
