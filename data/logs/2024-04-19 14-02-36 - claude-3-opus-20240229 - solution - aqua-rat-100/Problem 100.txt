## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
1. Let the breadth of the rectangle be x meters.
2. Then, the length will be (4x + 1) meters.
3. The area of the rectangle is given as 150 sq m. So, we can write:
   x(4x + 1) = 150
4. Expanding the equation:
   4x^2 + x - 150 = 0
5. Solving this quadratic equation:
   (4x - 15)(x + 10) = 0
   So, x = 15/4 or -10
   Since breadth can't be negative, x = 15/4 = 3.75 m
6. The length is 4x + 1 = 4(3.75) + 1 = 16 m
7. Perimeter of a rectangle is 2(length) + 2(breadth)
   = 2(16) + 2(3.75) 
   = 32 + 7.5
   = 39.5 m
8. Rounding 39.5 m to the nearest whole number gives 40 m.
The correct answer is 40 m, which corresponds to option [REDACTED].

Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. Let the breadth of the rectangle be x meters.
2. Then, the length will be (4x + 1) meters.
3. The area of the rectangle is given as 150 sq m. So, we can write:
   x(4x + 1) = 150
4. Expanding the equation:
   4x^2 + x - 150 = 0
5. Solving this quadratic equation:
   (4x - 15)(x + 10) = 0
   So, x = 15/4 or -10
   Since breadth can't be negative, x = 15/4 = 3.75 m
6. The length is 4x + 1 = 4(3.75) + 1 = 16 m
7. Perimeter of a rectangle is 2(length) + 2(breadth)
   = 2(16) + 2(3.75) 
   = 32 + 7.5
   = 39.5 m
Now, looking at the answer choices, there is no option for 39.5 m. The closest is 40 m, but that is not one of the choices. 
Let's round 39.5 m to the nearest integer that is provided in the answer choices:
39.5 rounds to 40, which is not an option.
The next closest integer is 39, which rounds to 62 m.
Therefore, the best answer from the given choices is 62 m.
Action: Answer("C")
