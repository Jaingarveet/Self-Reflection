## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: A straight picket fence is composed of x pickets each of which is 1/2 inch wide. If there are 6 inches of space between each pair of pickets, which of the following represents the length of fence in feet?
Choices:
  A: 13x/2
  B: 13x/2 - 6
  C: 13x/24
  D: (13x+1)/24
  E: (13x-12)/24
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
1) Each picket is 1/2 inch wide.
2) There are 6 inches of space between each pair of pickets. 
3) So, the total width of one picket plus one space is 1/2 + 6 = 13/2 inches.
4) If there are x pickets, there are x-1 spaces.
5) The total width of all pickets is x * 1/2 = x/2 inches.
6) The total width of all spaces is (x-1) * 6 = 6x - 6 inches.
7) The total width of the fence in inches is x/2 + 6x - 6 = [REDACTED] - 6 inches.
8) To convert inches to feet, divide by 12.
9) The length of the fence in feet is ([REDACTED] - 6) / 12 = (13x - 12) / 24 feet.
## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) Each picket is 1/2 inch wide.
2) There are 6 inches of space between each pair of pickets. 
3) So the total width of one picket plus one space is 1/2 + 6 = 13/2 inches.
4) If there are x pickets, there are x-1 spaces between pickets.
5) The total width of all the pickets is x * 1/2 = x/2 inches.
6) The total width of all the spaces is (x-1) * 6 = 6x - 6 inches.
7) The total width of the fence in inches is the sum of the width of the pickets and the spaces:
   x/2 + 6x - 6 = 6.5x - 6 inches
8) To convert the length from inches to feet, we need to divide by 12:
   (6.5x - 6) / 12 = (13x - 12) / 24 feet
9) Looking at the answer choices, the correct answer is (13x - 12) / 24 feet.
Action: Answer("E")
