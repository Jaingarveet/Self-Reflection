Question: A car is being driven, in a straight line and at a uniform speed, towards the base of a vertical tower. The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower?
Choices:
  A: 5(√3 + 1)
  B: 6(√3 + √2)
  C: 7(√3 – 1)
  D: 8(√3 – 2)
  E: None of these
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
1) Let the height of the tower be h and the uniform speed of the car be v. 
   Also, let the distance of the car from the base of the tower at the start be x.
2) At the start, tan(45°) = h/x. Therefore, x = h.
3) After 10 minutes, tan(60°) = h/(x - 10v). 
   Therefore, √3 = h/(x - 10v).
4) Substituting x = h from step 2, we get:
   √3 = h/(h - 10v)
   √3(h - 10v) = h
   √3h - 10√3v = h
   √3h - h = 10√3v
   (√3 - 1)h = 10√3v
5) Now, let's find the additional time taken. If the remaining distance is y, then:
   y = (√3 - 1)h = 10√3v
   Therefore, the additional time = y/v = 10√3(√3 - 1) minutes
6) Simplifying correctly, 10√3(√3 - 1) = 10(3 - √3) = 10(3/√3 - √3/√3) = 10(√3 - 1) = [REDACTED]
Therefore, the car will reach the base of the tower in [REDACTED] more minutes.
## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step using the reflection:
1) The height of the tower is h and the car's uniform speed is v. 
   The initial distance of the car from the tower base is x.
2) Initially, tan(45°) = h/x, so x = h.
3) After 10 minutes, tan(60°) = h/(x - 10v). 
   So √3 = h/(x - 10v).
4) Substituting x = h from step 2:
   √3 = h/(h - 10v)
   √3(h - 10v) = h
   √3h - 10√3v = h
   √3h - h = 10√3v
   (√3 - 1)h = 10√3v
5) For the remaining distance y:
   y = (√3 - 1)h = 10√3v
   So the additional time = y/v = 10√3(√3 - 1) minutes
6) Simplifying 10√3(√3 - 1):
   10√3(√3 - 1) = 10(3 - √3) = 10(√3 - 1) 
Comparing this to the answer choices, we see that 10(√3 - 1) matches choice C: 10(√3 - 1).
Action: Answer("C")
