## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
1) The question is about 5 consecutive odd numbers. Let's represent these numbers as: 
   (n-4), (n-2), n, (n+2), (n+4), where n is an odd number.
2) The sum of these numbers is:
   (n-4) + (n-2) + n + (n+2) + (n+4) = 5n
3) We are told that when this sum is divided by 10, it becomes a perfect square. 
   In other words, 5n/10 = n/2 is a perfect square.
4) For n/2 to be a perfect square, n must be an even number. But we know that n is an odd number (given in the question). 
   The only way for an odd number divided by 2 to be a perfect square is if the odd number itself is a perfect square.
5) So, n must be an odd perfect square. The odd perfect squares are: 1, 9, 25, [REDACTED], 49, 81, 121, ...
6) Among the given options, [REDACTED] is an odd perfect square.
Therefore, [REDACTED] can be one of the 5 consecutive odd numbers.
## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) We're looking for 5 consecutive odd numbers. Let's represent them as: (n-4), (n-2), n, (n+2), (n+4), where n is an odd number.
2) The sum of these numbers is: (n-4) + (n-2) + n + (n+2) + (n+4) = 5n
3) We're told that when this sum is divided by 10, it becomes a perfect square. In other words, 5n/10 = n/2 is a perfect square.
4) For n/2 to be a perfect square, n must be an even number. But we know that n is an odd number (given in the question). The only way for an odd number divided by 2 to be a perfect square is if the odd number itself is a perfect square.
5) So, n must be an odd perfect square. The odd perfect squares are: 1, 9, 25, 49, 81, 121, ...
6) Among the given options, only 81 is an odd perfect square. 
Therefore, 81 can be one of the 5 consecutive odd numbers.
