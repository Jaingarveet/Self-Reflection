## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: If n is such that 36 ≤ n ≤ 72, then x = (n2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16) / (n+ 4√n+ 4) satisfies
Choices:
  A: 20 < x < 54
  B: 23 < x < 58
  C: 25 < x < 64
  D: 28 < x < 60
  E: None of these
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
Let's recalculate the upper bound for x when n=72:
x = (72^2 + 2*72*√72 + 8*72 + 16) / (72 + 4*√72 + 4)
  = (5184 + 1224 + 576 + 16) / (72 + 33.9 + 4)
  = 7000 / 109.9
  = 63.69
So the correct range for x when 36 ≤ n ≤ 72 is:
31.75 < x < 63.69
Looking at the choices again, the only one that fits this range is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED].
## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) We're given that 36 ≤ n ≤ 72. Let's find the bounds on x by plugging in the min and max values of n.
2) When n = 36:
   x = (36^2 + 2*√36*(36+4) + 16) / (36 + 4*√36 + 4)
     = (1296 + 2*6*40 + 16) / (36 + 24 + 4)
     = (1296 + 480 + 16) / 64
     = 1792 / 64
     = 28
3) When n = 72:
   x = (72^2 + 2*√72*(72+4) + 16) / (72 + 4*√72 + 4)
     = (5184 + 2*8.485*76 + 16) / (72 + 33.941 + 4)
     = (5184 + 1289.76 + 16) / 109.941
     = 6489.76 / 109.941
     = 59.03
4) So when 36 ≤ n ≤ 72, x is bounded by 28 < x < 59.03
5) Looking at the choices, the only one that fits this range is C: 25 < x < 64.
Action: Answer("C")
