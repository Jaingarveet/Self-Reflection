Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
1. Understand the given information:
   * The grocer makes a 25% profit on the selling price of each bag of flour.
   * Each bag is sold for $100.
   * The total profit made is $3,000.
2. Calculate the profit made on each bag in dollars:
   * Profit per bag = Selling price - Cost price
   * 25% of Selling price = Selling price - Cost price
   * 0.25 × $100 = $100 - Cost price
   * $25 = $100 - Cost price
   * Cost price = $100 - $25 = $75
   * Profit per bag = $100 - $75 = $25
3. Calculate the number of bags sold:
   * Number of bags sold = Total profit ÷ Profit per bag
   * Number of bags sold = $3,000 ÷ $25 = [REDACTED]0
4. Find the answer among the given choices:
   * The closest choice to [REDACTED]0 is [REDACTED]0 itself, but it's not available.
   * The next closest choice is [REDACTED]0 ÷ 5 = [REDACTED].

Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. Understand the given information:
   * The grocer makes a 25% profit on the selling price of each bag of flour.
   * Each bag is sold for $100.
   * The total profit made is $3,000.
2. Calculate the profit made on each bag in dollars:
   * Profit per bag = 25% of Selling price
   * Profit per bag = 0.25 × $100 = $25
3. Calculate the number of bags sold:
   * Number of bags sold = Total profit ÷ Profit per bag
   * Number of bags sold = $3,000 ÷ $25 = 120
4. Find the answer among the given choices:
   * 120 bags is the correct answer.
   * The closest choice to 120 is 120 itself.
Action: Answer("D")
