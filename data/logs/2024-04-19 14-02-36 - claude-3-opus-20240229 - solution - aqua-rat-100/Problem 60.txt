## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Choices:
  A: 80°
  B: 130°
  C: 140°
  D: 160°
  E: 220°
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
1) If [REDACTED] bisects minor arc A[REDACTED], then minor arc A[REDACTED] is half of minor arc A[REDACTED].
   Minor arc A[REDACTED] = [REDACTED] / 2 = [REDACTED]
2) Since the total of a circle is 360°, and minor arc A[REDACTED] is [REDACTED], major arc A[REDACTED] must be:
   Major arc A[REDACTED] = 360° - [REDACTED] = 200°
3) Since [REDACTED] bisects minor arc A[REDACTED], it also bisects major arc A[REDACTED].
   Major arc A[REDACTED] = 200° / 2 = 100°
4) Minor arc B[REDACTED] is given as 150°.
5) Since points [REDACTED], [REDACTED], [REDACTED], [REDACTED] lie in this order on the circumference of the circle, [REDACTED] must be between [REDACTED] and [REDACTED].
6) To find minor arc A[REDACTED], we need to add minor arc A[REDACTED] and minor arc B[REDACTED].
   Minor arc A[REDACTED] = Minor arc A[REDACTED] + Minor arc BD
                = [REDACTED] + 150°
                = [REDACTED]
## Assistant 2:
Here is my thought process and solution:
1) If B bisects minor arc AC, then minor arc AB is half of minor arc AC.
   Minor arc AB = 160° / 2 = 80°
2) Since the total of a circle is 360°, and minor arc AC is 160°, major arc AC must be:
   Major arc AC = 360° - 160° = 200°
3) Since B bisects minor arc AC, it also bisects major arc AC. 
   Major arc AB = 200° / 2 = 100°
4) Minor arc BD is given as 150°.
5) Since points A, B, C, D lie in this order on the circumference of the circle, D must be between B and C.
6) To find minor arc AD, we need to add minor arc AB and minor arc BD.
   Minor arc AD = Minor arc AB + Minor arc BD 
                = 80° + 150°  
                = 230°
However, the question asks for minor arc AD, which cannot be greater than 180°. Therefore, the answer must be the reflex angle 360° - 230° = 130°.
Action: Answer("B")
