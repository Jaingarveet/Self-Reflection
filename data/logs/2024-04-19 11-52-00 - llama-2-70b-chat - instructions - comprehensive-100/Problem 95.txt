Question: Which of the following drains directly into inferior vena cava?
Choices:
  A: Superior mesenteric vein
  B: Inferior mesenteric vein
  C: Right suprarenal vein
  D: Renal vein

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I realize that I need to review the anatomy of the veins of the abdominal cavity. The inferior vena cava is a large vein that carries deoxygenated blood from the lower body to the right atrium of the heart. It receives tributaries from the abdominal organs, including the right suprarenal vein.

Action: Answer("C")

The right suprarenal vein drains directly into the inferior vena cava and not into the superior mesenteric vein, inferior mesenteric vein, or renal vein. Therefore, the correct answer is option C, Right suprarenal vein.
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
