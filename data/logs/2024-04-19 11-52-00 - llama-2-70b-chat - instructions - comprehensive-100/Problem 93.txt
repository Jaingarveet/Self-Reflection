Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:

1. Review the mechanism of action of each anti-Parkinson drug.
2. Pay close attention to the specific action of each drug.
3. Ensure that you understand the difference between increasing dopamine levels and decreasing cholinergic activity.
4. Double-check your answer by reviewing the drug's mechanism of action.
## Assistant 2:
  Sure, here's my refection on the previous answer:

I previously answered this question incorrectly, selecting option A, Levodopa. However, upon further review, I realized that Levodopa actually works by increasing dopamine levels, not by decreasing cholinergic activity.

The correct answer is option C, Selegiline. Selegiline is a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) that selectively inhibits the breakdown of dopamine in the brain, leading to increased dopamine levels. Additionally, Selegiline has been shown to decrease brain cholinergic activity, which can help alleviate Parkinson's symptoms such as tremors and rigidity.

I will make sure to carefully review the mechanism of action of each drug and pay close attention to the specific action of each drug to ensure that I select the correct answer this time.

Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
