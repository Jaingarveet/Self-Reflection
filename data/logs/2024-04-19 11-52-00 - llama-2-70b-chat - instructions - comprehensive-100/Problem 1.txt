## Assistant 2:
  My apologies for my previous mistake. Let's try to solve this problem again.

The monthly salary S of a shop assistant is the sum of a fixed salary of $500 plus 5% of all monthly sales. We need to find the monthly sales so that her monthly salary reaches $1500.

The equation to represent the problem is:
S = 500 + (0.05) x Sales

We want S to be equal to $1500, so we can set up the equation as follows:
1500 = 500 + (0.05) x Sales

Now, let's solve for Sales:
1000 = (0.05) x Sales

Sales = 1000 / (0.05)
Sales = 20,000

Therefore, the monthly sales should be $20,000 so that her monthly salary reaches $1500.
