## Assistant 2:
  Sure, I'll be happy to help. Here's how I'd approach the problem:

1. Read the question carefully and understand the problem:
The problem states that the population of City X increased by 20% and the population of City Y decreased by 10% from 2010 to 2015. The population of City X in 2010 was 120,000. We need to find the population of City Y in 2010.
2. Write down the correct equation based on the information given:
Let PX represent the population of City X andPY represent the population of City Y.
We know that PX in 2010 was 120,000, so PX(2010) = 120,000.
We also know that PX increased by 20% from 2010 to 2015, so PX(2015) = 120,000 x 1.20 = 144,000.
We know that PY decreased by 10% from 2010 to 2015, so PY(2015) = PY(2010) x 0.90.
We can set up the equation:
PX(2015) = PY(2010)
144,000 = PY(2010) x 0.90
3. Solve for the variable (Y) in the equation:
We can divide both sides of the equation by 0.90 to get:
144,000 / 0.90 = PY(2010)
160,000 = PY(2010)
4. Calculate the population of City Y in 2010:
We have found that PY(2010) = 160,000.
5. Choose the answer that matches the calculated result:
The answer is C: 160,000.

Action: Answer("C")

Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
