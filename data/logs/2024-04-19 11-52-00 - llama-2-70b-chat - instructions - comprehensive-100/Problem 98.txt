# Model: llama-2-70b-chat | Agent: instructions | Exam: comprehensive-100 | Problem 98 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Medicine.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:
Topic: Geography
Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Medicine
Subtopic: Biochemistry
Question: Aminoacyl t-RNA is not require for ?
Choices:
  A: Proline
  B: Lysine
  C: Hydroxylysine
  D: Methionine
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:

1. Review the exceptions to the rule that aminoacyl t-RN[REDACTED] is required for all amino acids.
2. Understand the difference between proline and hydroxylysine synthesis.
3. Recall that hydroxylysine is also synthesized from glutamine.
4. Choose the correct answer, [REDACTED], [REDACTED].

Question: Aminoacyl t-RNA is not required for ?
Choices:
  A: Proline
  B: Lysine
  C: Hydroxylysine
  D: Methionine

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly.
I reflected on the problem, my solution, and the correct answer.
I realized that I misunderstood the exceptions to the rule that aminoacyl t-RNA is required for all amino acids.
I also confused proline and hydroxylysine synthesis.
I now understand that hydroxylysine is synthesized from glutamine.

Action: Answer("B")

Explanation:
Aminoacyl t-RNA is not required for lysine because it is synthesized through a different mechanism that does not involve aminoacyl t-RNA.
Proline is synthesized from glutamine and does not require aminoacyl t-RNA.
Hydroxylysine is also synthesized from glutamine and does not require aminoacyl t-RNA.
Methionine is synthesized through a different mechanism that does not involve aminoacyl t-RNA.

Therefore, the correct answer is B: Lysine.
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
