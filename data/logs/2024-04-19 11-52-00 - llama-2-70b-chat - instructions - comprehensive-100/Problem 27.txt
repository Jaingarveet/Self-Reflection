3. Select the answer choice that cannot be set for more than one client.

My previous answer was incorrect, and upon reflection, I realized that I misunderstood the conditions set for the service targets. I mistakenly chose answer choice A, a 1-day website target, assuming that it would be the most restrictive target. However, upon re-evaluating the conditions, I realized that the correct answer is answer choice C, a 2-day website target.

The conditions state that none of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Therefore, if a client has a 2-day website target, their voicemail target must be shorter than 2 days. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets, so Image cannot have a 2-day website target. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target, so Solide cannot have a 2-day website target either.

Therefore, the only client that can have a 2-day website target is Truvest. However, since Truvest's website target must be longer than Image's voicemail target, Truvest cannot have a 2-day website target. Thus, a 2-day website target CANNOT be set for more than one of the clients, making answer choice C the correct answer.

Action: Answer("C")
