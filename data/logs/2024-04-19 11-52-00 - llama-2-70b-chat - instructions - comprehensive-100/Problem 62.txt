## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: $$\begin{array}{r}3 x+4 y=-23 \\2 y-x=-19\end{array}$$What is the solution $(x, y)$ to the system of equations above?
Choices:
  A: $(-5,-2)$
  B: $(3,-8)$
  C: $(4,-6)$

Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Write the first equation.
2. Write the second equation.
3. Substitute the second equation into the first equation.
4. Expand and simplify.
5. Solve for x and y.
6. Check your solution.
## Assistant 2:
  My apologies for my previous mistake. Let's try again.

1. The first equation is 3x + 4y = -23.
2. The second equation is 2y - x = -19.
3. Substituting the second equation into the first equation, we get:
3x + 4(2y - x) = -23
4. Expanding and simplifying, we get:
6y - 3x = -57
5. Solving for x and y, we get:
x = 9
y = -6

So, the solution is (9, -6).

Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
