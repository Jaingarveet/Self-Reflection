## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let's break down the given conditions:

1. Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
2. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
3. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
4. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
5. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

From conditions 1 and 3, we know that if Parra is in Zone 1, then Quinn must also be in Zone 1. However, this would leave only one sales representative (either Tiao or Udall) for Zone 2, which contradicts condition 5. Therefore, Tiao must be in Zone 1.

From conditions 2 and 4, we know that if Tiao is in Zone 2, then Udall must also be in Zone 2. However, this would again leave only one sales representative (either Parra or Quinn) for Zone 1, which contradicts condition 5. Therefore, Udall must be in Zone 2.

Now we know that Tiao is in Zone 1, Udall is in Zone 2, and Parra and Quinn work together in either Zone 1 or Zone 3. Since Tiao is already in Zone 1, Parra and Quinn must be in Zone 3.

Stuckey must be in the same zone as Udall, which is Zone 2. This leaves only Kim and Mahr. Since there must be more representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, and there are already two representatives in Zone 3 (Parra and Quinn), both Kim and Mahr must also be in Zone 3.
