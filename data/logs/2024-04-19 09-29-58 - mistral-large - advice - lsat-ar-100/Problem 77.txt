Context: An administrator must assign parking spaces to six new employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young. Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.

## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The rules given in the problem are:

1. Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
2. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
3. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
4. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.

From rule 4, we know that Robertson can only be assigned one of four possible spaces. However, this does not mean that Robertson is limited to only two possible spaces.

From rule 3, we know that Young must be assigned a lower-numbered parking space than Robertson. Since Robertson can only be assigned one of the first four spaces, Young can only be assigned one of the first three spaces. However, this does not mean that Young is limited to only two possible spaces.

From rule 1, we know that Togowa must be assigned a lower-numbered parking space than Young. Since Young can only be assigned one of the first three spaces, Togowa can only be assigned one of the first two spaces. Therefore, Togowa is limited to only two possible spaces.

From rule 2, we know that Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. However, this does not mean that Xu is limited to only two possible spaces.

Therefore, only Togowa is limited to only two possible spaces.

Action: Answer("B")
