## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. This means that the pharmacy and restaurant must be in either space 1 or space 7.
The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. This means that there must be at least two businesses between the two restaurants.
The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. This means that either the optometrist or the veterinarian must be in space 2 or space 6, depending on where the pharmacy is located.
The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian. This means that there must be at least one business between the toy store and the veterinarian.

Let's consider each choice:

A: pharmacy, optometrist, shoe store, restaurant, veterinarian, toy store, restaurant
This choice satisfies all the constraints. The pharmacy is at one end of the row, and one of the restaurants is at the other. The two restaurants are separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy is next to the optometrist. The toy store is not next to the veterinarian.

B: pharmacy, veterinarian, optometrist, shoe store, restaurant, toy store, restaurant
This choice does not satisfy all the constraints. The pharmacy is next to the veterinarian, but it is not next to either the optometrist or the toy store.

C: restaurant, shoe store, veterinarian, pharmacy, optometrist, toy store, restaurant
This choice does not satisfy all the constraints. The pharmacy is not at one end of the row, and one of the restaurants is not at the other.

D: restaurant, toy store, optometrist, restaurant, veterinarian, shoe store, pharmacy
This choice does not satisfy all the constraints. The pharmacy is not at one end of the row, and one of the restaurants is not at the other.

E: restaurant, optometrist, toy store, restaurant, shoe store, veterinarian, pharmacy
This choice does not satisfy all the constraints. The pharmacy is not at one end of the row, and one of the restaurants is not at the other.
