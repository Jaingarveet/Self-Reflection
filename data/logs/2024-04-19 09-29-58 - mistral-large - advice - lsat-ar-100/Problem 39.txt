The organizer must select at least five and at most six works, with no more than four French works, at least three but no more than four novels, and at least as many French novels as Russian novels. If both French plays are selected, then the Russian play is not selected.

We know that three French novels have already been selected. This means that the organizer can select at most one more French work, and at least one more novel (which can be French or Russian).

Let's consider each choice:

A: one Russian novel
This choice is possible, as it would bring the total number of works selected to five (three French novels and two Russian novels), with at least as many French novels as Russian novels.

B: two French plays
This choice is not possible, as it would bring the total number of French works selected to five, which is more than the maximum allowed.

C: one Russian novel, one Russian play
This choice is not possible, as it would bring the total number of works selected to five, but only two of them would be novels (three French novels and one Russian novel), which is less than the minimum required.

D: one Russian novel, two French plays
This choice is not possible, as it would bring the total number of French works selected to five, which is more than the maximum allowed.

E: two Russian novels, one French play
This choice is not possible, as it would bring the total number of works selected to six, but only three of them would be novels (three French novels and two Russian novels), which is less than the minimum required.

Action: Answer("A")
