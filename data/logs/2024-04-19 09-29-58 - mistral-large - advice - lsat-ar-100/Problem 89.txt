## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Since only one batch is made on Friday, it cannot be the second batch of any kind of cookie, as the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday. Therefore, it must be the third batch of one of the kinds of cookies.
Since the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies, and no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day, the first batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Tuesday, as that would mean both the first and second batches of oatmeal cookies would be made on Tuesday.
Since at least one batch of cookies is made on Monday, and the first batch of sugar cookies cannot be made on Monday (as that would mean both the first and second batches of sugar cookies would be made on Monday), the first batch of either oatmeal or peanut butter cookies must be made on Monday.
If the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Monday, then the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Wednesday (as the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies, and no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day).
If the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Wednesday, then the third batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Friday (as no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day, and only one batch is made on Friday).
Action: Answer("C")
