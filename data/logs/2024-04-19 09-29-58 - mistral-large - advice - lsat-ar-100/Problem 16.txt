Advice:

* Always read the question carefully and identify all the constraints given in the problem.
* Always evaluate each choice against all the constraints.
* Always eliminate any choices that violate any of the constraints.
* Always choose the answer that satisfies all the constraints.
* Always double-check your answer against the constraints to ensure accuracy.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The constraints are:

* Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
* Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
* Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
* Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.

Let's evaluate each choice against these constraints:

* Choice A: Kevin and Rebecca lead sessions on the same day, but Lan and Olivia also lead sessions on the same day, which violates a constraint.
* Choice B: Olivia leads a session on Wednesday, which means Julio cannot lead a session on Wednesday or Thursday, but he is scheduled to lead a session on Thursday, which violates a constraint.
* Choice C: Lan and Olivia lead sessions on the same day, which violates a constraint.
* Choice D: This choice satisfies all the constraints.
* Choice E: Olivia leads a session on Friday, which means Julio cannot lead a session on Wednesday or Thursday, but he is scheduled to lead a session on Thursday, which violates a constraint.

Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: E
