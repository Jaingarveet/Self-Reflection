## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Since Lan does not lead a Wednesday session, he must lead a session on Thursday or Friday. However, since Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day, Olivia cannot lead a session on Thursday or Friday.

Since Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's, Julio must lead a session on Wednesday.

Since Nessa must lead an afternoon session, she cannot lead a Wednesday morning session. Therefore, Kevin must lead the Wednesday morning session.

Since Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day, Rebecca must lead the Wednesday afternoon session.

Therefore, the only lab assistant who can lead a Thursday session is Lan.

Action: Answer("A")

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly because I did not consider all of the constraints. I did not realize that Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's, which means that Julio must lead a session on Wednesday. I also did not realize that Nessa must lead an afternoon session, which means that Kevin must lead the Wednesday morning session. By considering all of the constraints, I was able to determine the correct answer.
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: E
Score: 0
