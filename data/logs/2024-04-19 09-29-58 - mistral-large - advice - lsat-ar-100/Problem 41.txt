Topic: Law
Context: On the first day of a two-day study for a cycling magazine, four riders—Reynaldo, Seamus, Theresa, and Yuki—will each test one of four bicycles—F, G, H, and J. Each rider will then test a different one of the bicycles on the second day. Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day. The assignment of riders to bicycles is subject to the following conditions: Reynaldo cannot test F. Yuki cannot test J. Theresa must be one of the testers for H. The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
Question: If Theresa tests G on the second day, then which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Reynaldo tests H on the first day.
  B: Reynaldo tests J on the first day.
  C: Theresa tests H on the second day.
  D: Theresa tests J on the first day.
  E: Yuki tests H on the second day.

## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Theresa tests G on the second day, so she must have tested H on the first day (since she must test H at some point and cannot test it on the second day).
Since Theresa tested H on the first day, Seamus cannot test H on the first day (since each rider tests only one bicycle per day and all four bicycles are tested each day).
Since Seamus cannot test H on the first day, he must test J on the first day (since he cannot test F on the first day because Reynaldo cannot test F and each rider tests only one bicycle per day).
Since Seamus tests J on the first day, Yuki must test F on the first day (since she cannot test J and each rider tests only one bicycle per day).
Since Yuki tests F on the first day, she must test H on the second day (since the bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day and Seamus cannot test H on the second day because he tested J on the first day).
Action: Answer("E")
## Result:
Agent Answer: E
Correct Answer: E
