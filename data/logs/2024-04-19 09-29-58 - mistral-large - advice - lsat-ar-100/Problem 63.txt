## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session.
Since Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's, Olivia must lead the Friday morning or afternoon session.
Since Nessa must lead an afternoon session, she can only lead the Wednesday afternoon or Friday afternoon session.
Since Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day, Lan must lead a session on Wednesday or Thursday.
Since Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day, they can only lead sessions on Wednesday or Thursday.

Action: Answer("A")

Explanation:
We can only determine that Olivia must lead a session on Friday. We cannot determine which sessions the other lab assistants will lead.
