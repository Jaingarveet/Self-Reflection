## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The rules state that Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa, Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young, and Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.

Option A: Young is assigned a lower-numbered parking space than Togowa, which violates the first rule.
Option B: Robertson is assigned a lower-numbered parking space than Young, which violates the third rule.
Option C: Robertson is assigned a higher-numbered parking space than allowed by the fourth rule.
Option D: Xu is assigned a lower-numbered parking space than Souza, which violates the second rule.
Option E: Young is assigned a lower-numbered parking space than Togowa, which violates the first rule.
