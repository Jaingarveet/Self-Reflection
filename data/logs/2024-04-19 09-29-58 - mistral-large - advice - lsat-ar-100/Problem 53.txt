Context: A realtor will show a prospective buyer seven houses—J, K, L, M, N, 0, and P—during a single day. The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning; the third, fourth, and fifth houses to be shown will be shown in the afternoon; the sixth and seventh houses to be shown will be shown in the evening. The houses will be shown according to the following rules: J must be shown in the evening. K cannot be shown in the morning. L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.

## Assistant 2:
Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly by not considering all the rules and constraints given in the problem. I realized that I needed to carefully analyze each rule and how they affect the order in which the houses can be shown.

Advice:
To solve this problem, we need to consider the following rules:

1. J must be shown in the evening.
2. K cannot be shown in the morning.
3. L must be shown after K and before M.

Since J must be shown in the evening, it can only be the sixth or seventh house shown. Since K cannot be shown in the morning, it can only be the third, fourth, fifth, sixth, or seventh house shown. Since L must be shown after K and before M, it cannot be the first or last house shown.

Using this information, we can eliminate some of the answer choices.

A: K is shown in the evening. This is not necessarily true, as K could be shown in the afternoon.

B: L is shown in the afternoon. This could be true, as L could be the third, fourth, or fifth house shown.

C: L is shown in the evening. This is not necessarily true, as L could be shown in the afternoon.

D: M is shown in the morning. This is not possible, as L must be shown before M, and L cannot be shown in the morning.

E: M is shown in the afternoon. This could be true, as M could be the fifth house shown.

Therefore, the answer must be either B or E. However, since L must be shown after K, and K cannot be shown in the morning, L cannot be the third house shown. Therefore, L must be shown in the afternoon.

Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
