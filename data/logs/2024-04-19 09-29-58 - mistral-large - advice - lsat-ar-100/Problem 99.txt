Context: At a concert, exactly eight compositions—F, H, L, O, P, R, S, and T—are to be performed exactly once each, consecutively and one composition at a time. The order of their performance must satisfy the following conditions: T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R. At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F. O is performed either first or fifth. The eighth composition performed is either L or H. P is performed at some time before S. At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
Question: If O is performed immediately after T, then F must be performed either
Choices:
  A: first or second
  B: second or third
  C: fourth or sixth

 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never make assumptions without verifying them against the conditions.
 - Always double-check your reasoning and final answer.
 - Remember that the position of one composition can affect the position of other compositions.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
If O is performed immediately after T, then T cannot be performed immediately before F (since O is not performed immediately before F), so T must be performed immediately after R. This means that F must be performed after R. Since at least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F, and F is performed after R, at least two compositions must be performed after F and before the end of the concert. Since O is performed fifth, and O is performed immediately after T, which is performed immediately after R, R must be performed fourth. Since F must be performed after R, F cannot be performed first, second, or third. Since at least two compositions must be performed after F and before the end of the concert, F cannot be performed seventh. Therefore, F must be performed either fourth or sixth. However, since R is performed fourth, F cannot be performed fourth, so F must be performed sixth.
Action: Answer("E")
