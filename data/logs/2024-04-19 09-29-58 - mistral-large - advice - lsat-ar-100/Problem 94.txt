Context: A shopping center has exactly seven spaces—space 1 through space 7—arranged in a straight row. Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
Question: If the veterinarian is in space 5, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: The optometrist is in space 2.
  B: The pharmacy is in space 7.
  C: A restaurant is in space 4.

## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The veterinarian is in space 5. The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. Since the veterinarian is not at an end, the pharmacy cannot be next to it. Therefore, the optometrist must be next to the veterinarian. The only available space next to the veterinarian is space 6. So, the optometrist cannot be in space 2.

The pharmacy must be at one end of the row. Since it cannot be next to the veterinarian, it must be at space 1 or space 7. If it were at space 1, the optometrist would have to be at space 2 (which is not possible). Therefore, the pharmacy must be at space 7.

The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. Since the pharmacy is at space 7, one of the restaurants must be at space 1. The only available space that is at least two spaces away from space 1 and space 7 is space 4. Therefore, a restaurant must be in space 4.

The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian. Since the veterinarian is in space 5, the toy store cannot be in space 4 or space 6. Therefore, the toy store must be in space 3.

The only remaining business is the shoe store. It must be in space 2.

Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
