## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I made an error in my reasoning about the possible zone assignments. I incorrectly assumed that Parra and Quinn must be in Zone 3 based on the number of representatives in each zone. However, the question stem does not provide enough information to determine their exact zone. My reasoning was too definitive given the available information.
Error Keywords:
 - Overconfident reasoning
 - Unsupported assumption
 - Incomplete consideration of possibilities
 - Misinterpretation of constraints
Solution:
Given:
- Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. 
- Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
- Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
- Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
- There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
- Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone.
Step 1: Determine Stuckey and Udall's zone.
- Stuckey and Udall work in the same zone.
- Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2, but not both. 
- Therefore, Stuckey and Udall must work in Zone 3.
Step 2: Determine Mahr's zone.
- Mahr works in the same zone as Stuckey.
- Stuckey works in Zone 3.
- Therefore, Mahr also works in Zone 3.
Step 3: Determine possible zones for the remaining representatives.
- Tiao must work in Zone 1 or Zone 2.
- If Tiao works in Zone 1, then Parra works in Zone 3, and Kim works in Zone 2.
- If Tiao works in Zone 2, then Parra works in Zone 1, and Kim could work in either Zone 1 or Zone 3.
Therefore, the only statement that could be true is:
A: Kim works in Zone 2.
Instructions:
1. Carefully read the question and constraints.
2. Identify the fixed zone assignments based on the given constraints.
3. Determine the possible zone assignments for the remaining representatives.
4. Consider each answer choice and evaluate if it is possible given the constraints.
5. Select the answer choice that could be true under some possible assignment.
Advice:
- Always consider all possibilities consistent with the given constraints.
- Be careful not to make unsupported assumptions or jump to conclusions.
- Eliminate answer choices that are impossible or inconsistent with the constraints.
- Remember that "could be true" means possible under some scenario, not necessarily true in all scenarios.
- If multiple possibilities remain, look for the answer choice that holds under at least one of them.
