## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I focused too much on the information given about specific students and plays, and failed to consider the implications of the total number of plays. There are only three plays in total, so Megregian reviewing at least 2 plays necessarily means he reviews more plays than Jiang.
Error Keywords:
 - Incomplete analysis
 - Failure to consider all relevant information
 - Failure to draw necessary conclusions
 - Overemphasis on specific details
Solution:
1. There are only three plays in total: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation.
2. Megregian reviews at least 2 plays, as Kramer and Lopez each review fewer plays than Megregian.
3. Jiang cannot review any of the plays Megregian reviews.
4. Since there are only 3 plays total and Megregian reviews at least 2 of them, Jiang can review at most 1 play.
5. Therefore, Megregian necessarily reviews more plays than Jiang.
Instructions:
1. Identify the total number of items (plays, in this case) under consideration.
2. Determine any definite lower or upper bounds on the number of items each person has.
3. Consider the implications of these bounds in relation to the total number of items.
4. Draw necessary conclusions based on these implications.
5. Reread the question and answer choices carefully.
6. Eliminate answer choices that are not necessarily true based on your conclusions.
7. Select the answer choice that must be true based on your analysis.
Advice:
 - Always consider the big picture and total quantities involved, not just specific details.
 - Look for implied information and necessary conclusions, not just explicitly stated facts.
 - Eliminate answer choices methodically based on your deductions.
 - If an answer choice contains an absolute statement (e.g., "must be true"), look for any possible counterexample that disproves it.
 - Reread the question and answers carefully to ensure you are selecting an answer that is definitely true, not just possibly true.
