## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I made an error in my reasoning about the fourth constraint. I thought that Julio's session had to be on an earlier day than Olivia's, but the constraint actually states that Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's. I interpreted "earlier" as meaning the immediately preceding day, but "earlier day of the week" allows for a gap of one or more days between their sessions.
Error Keywords:
 - Misinterpreted constraint
 - Incorrect assumption
 - Faulty reasoning
 - Overlooked valid solution
Solution:
1. Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions on the same day. This eliminates choices B and E.
2. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions on the same day. This eliminates choice A. 
3. Nessa must lead an afternoon session. This is satisfied by choices C, D, and E.
4. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's. 
   - In choice C, Julio leads on Thursday and Olivia on Friday, satisfying the constraint. 
   - In choice D, Julio leads on Thursday and Olivia on Friday, also satisfying the constraint.
   - In choice E, Julio leads on Wednesday and Olivia on Friday, satisfying the constraint.
5. Since choices C and D were eliminated in step 1, the only remaining choice that satisfies all constraints is E.
Instructions:
1. Carefully read each constraint and make sure you understand exactly what it means. 
2. Evaluate each answer choice against the first constraint, eliminating any that violate it.
3. From the remaining choices, evaluate each against the second constraint, eliminating violators.
4. Continue this process for each subsequent constraint until only one choice remains.
5. For constraints involving relative terms like "earlier", consider all valid interpretations.
6. Remember that "earlier day of the week" allows for gaps between days, not just adjacent days.
7. The correct choice is the one that satisfies all constraints, not just most of them.
Advice:
 - Always read each constraint multiple times to ensure full understanding. 
 - Be careful not to make unwarranted assumptions that add restrictions beyond those stated.
 - Eliminate answer choices one constraint at a time to organize your reasoning.
 - For constraints with relative terms, consider alternate interpretations beyond the strictest one.
 - Don't stop evaluating an answer choice just because it satisfies most constraints; it must satisfy all.
 - If you eliminate an answer choice, don't second-guess yourself without strong justification.
