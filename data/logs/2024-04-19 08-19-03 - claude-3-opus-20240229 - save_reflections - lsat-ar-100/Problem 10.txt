## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I incorrectly selected choice A as a possible selection. While choice A satisfies most of the requirements, it violates the condition that if both French plays are selected, the Russian play cannot be selected. Choice A includes all three plays, which is not allowed.
Error Keywords:
 - Overlooked constraint
 - Misinterpreted condition
 - Incomplete analysis
 - Logical error
Solution:
Let's re-evaluate each choice considering all the requirements:
A: Violates the condition that if both French plays are selected, the Russian play cannot be selected. Not a valid selection.
B: Violates the same condition as A. Not a valid selection.
C: Has 6 works total, 4 French works (2 novels + 2 plays), 4 novels (2 French + 2 Russian), and equal numbers of French and Russian novels. Satisfies all requirements. This is a valid selection.
D: Has 5 French works, violating the requirement of no more than 4 French works. Not a valid selection.
E: Has 5 novels, violating the requirement of no more than 4 novels. Not a valid selection.
Therefore, only choice C could be the organizer's selection of works.
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and identify all the given constraints.
2. Evaluate each answer choice individually.
3. For each choice, check if it satisfies every single requirement.
4. If a choice violates any requirement, eliminate it.
5. If a choice satisfies all requirements, keep it as a possible answer.
6. After evaluating all choices, select the choice(s) that satisfy all the given constraints.
7. If multiple choices satisfy all constraints, look for additional information to narrow down to one choice.
Advice:
 - Always read the question and given information carefully.
 - Always consider all the given constraints when solving a problem.
 - Never ignore or forget about a condition or requirement.
 - Always evaluate each possibility systematically and thoroughly.
 - If a possibility violates any single requirement, it cannot be a valid solution.
 - Double-check that your answer satisfies every single given constraint.
