## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I incorrectly determined that Choice D satisfied all the rules, when in fact it violates rule 3. I failed to properly apply the transitive property of the "higher-numbered than" relationship. Since Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered space than Young, and Young must be assigned a higher-numbered space than Togowa, it follows that Robertson must also be assigned a higher-numbered space than Togowa. Choice D violates this by assigning Robertson space #2 and Togowa space #1.
Error Keywords:
 - Logical reasoning error
 - Transitive property error
 - Rule application error
 - Parking space assignment error
Solution:
Let's go through each choice again, carefully applying all the rules:
Choice A: Violates rule 3 as Young (#1) is assigned a lower-numbered space than Robertson (#4).
Choice B: Violates rule 1 as Togowa (#2) is assigned a higher-numbered space than Young (#3). 
Choice C: Violates rule 2 as Souza (#5) is assigned a higher-numbered space than Xu (#3).
Choice D: Violates rule 3. Since Robertson must be higher than Young, and Young must be higher than Togowa, Robertson must also be higher than Togowa. But here Robertson (#2) is lower than Togowa (#1).
Choice E: Satisfies all the rules:
- Young (#3) is assigned a higher-numbered space than Togowa (#2). 
- Xu (#5) is assigned a higher-numbered space than Souza (#1).
- Robertson (#4) is assigned a higher-numbered space than Young (#3).
- Robertson is assigned parking space #4, which is allowed.
Therefore, the correct answer is Choice E.
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and identify all the rules/constraints.
2. Go through each answer choice one by one.
3. For each choice, check if it violates any of the stated rules.
4. If a choice violates a rule, eliminate it and move to the next choice.
5. If a choice satisfies all the rules, select it as the correct answer.
6. Double-check that the selected answer indeed satisfies all rules.
7. Watch out for implicit rules that arise from combining explicit rules.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and identify all explicit and implicit constraints.
 - Always consider each answer choice methodically, eliminating choices that violate constraints.
 - Never select an answer without checking that it satisfies all constraints.
 - Always watch out for implicit constraints that arise from combining explicit constraints.
 - Remember that "higher-numbered than" is a transitive relationship: if A is higher than B, and B is higher than C, then A must also be higher than C.
