Topic: Law
Context: Economics professor: Marty's Pizza and Checkers Pizza are the two major pizza parlors in our town. Marty's sold coupon books including coupons good for one large plain pizza at any local pizza parlor, at Marty's expense. But Checkers refused to accept these coupons, even though they were redeemed by all other local pizza parlors. Accepting them would have cost Checkers nothing and would have satisfied those of its potential customers who had purchased the coupon books. This shows that Checkers's motive in refusing to accept the coupons was simply to hurt Marty's Pizza.
Question: Which one of the following, if assumed, enables the economics professor's conclusion to be properly drawn?
Choices:
  A: Any company that refuses to accept coupons issued by a competitor when doing so would satisfy some of the company's potential customers is motivated solely by the desire to hurt that competitor.
  B: Any company that wishes to hurt a competitor by refusing to accept coupons issued by that competitor will refuse to accept them even when accepting them would cost nothing and would satisfy its potential customers.
  C: At least one company has refused to accept coupons issued by its major local competitor simply in order to hurt that competitor, even though those coupons were accepted by all other local competitors.
  D: Any company that accepts its major competitor's coupons helps its competitor by doing so, even if it also satisfies its own actual or potential customers.
  E: If accepting coupons issued by a competitor would not enable a company to satisfy its actual or potential customers, then that company's refusal to accept the coupons is motivated by the desire to satisfy customers.

Action: Answer("B")

Explanation:
The economics professor's conclusion that Checkers' motive in refusing to accept the coupons was simply to hurt Marty's Pizza can be properly drawn by assuming choice B: Any company that wishes to hurt a competitor by refusing to accept coupons issued by that competitor will refuse to accept them even when accepting them would cost nothing and would satisfy its potential customers.

The professor's argument is that Checkers refused to accept the coupons despite it costing them nothing and satisfying their potential customers, which suggests that their motive was to hurt Marty's Pizza. Choice B supports this argument by stating that a company that wishes to hurt a competitor will refuse to accept their coupons even when it would be beneficial to do so. Therefore, assuming choice B allows the professor's conclusion to be properly drawn.

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly.
I realized that I misunderstood the argument made by the economics professor.
I incorrectly assumed that the professor was arguing that Checkers' refusal to accept the coupons was motivated by a desire to satisfy its own customers, rather than a desire to hurt Marty's Pizza.
I also failed to consider the assumptions made by the professor in the argument.
I should have identified the assumptions and evaluated their strength before choosing an answer.
I should have also considered each answer choice more carefully and determined which one most closely aligns with the assumptions made by the professor.
I will make sure to be more careful in my analysis in the future.
