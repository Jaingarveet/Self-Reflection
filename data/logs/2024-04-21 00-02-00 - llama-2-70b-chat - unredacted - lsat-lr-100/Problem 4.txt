Context: A film makes a profit if the number of people who see it is sufficient to generate revenues from ticket sales greater than the amount spent to make it. Hence, the primary goal of movie executives is to maximize the number of people who see a film. However, it is not the primary goal of television executives to maximize the number of viewers for their shows.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain the difference between the goals of movie executives and those of television executives?
Choices:
  A: More people are willing to see a film more than once than are willing to watch a television show more than once.
  B: There is no analog in television to the large profits that owners of movie theaters make by selling refreshments to their customers.
  C: The average cost of producing an hour of film is much greater than the average cost of producing an hour of television.
  D: Television shows make their profits from sponsors, who are chiefly concerned with the purchasing power of the people who watch a television show.
  E: Over half of the most popular television shows are shows that viewers do not have to pay to watch.

Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I misunderstood the relationship between production costs and profitability in the film and television industries. I thought that the high production costs of film were the primary driver of the need for large audiences, whereas, in reality, it is the reliance on ticket sales for revenue that drives this need.

Error Keywords:

* Misunderstanding of industry economics
* Failure to consider the role of advertising in television profitability

Solution:
The correct answer is D, "Television shows make their profits from sponsors, who are chiefly concerned with the purchasing power of the people who watch a television show." This answer choice accurately explains why television executives do not need to maximize the number of viewers to achieve their profit goals. Unlike movie executives, who rely on ticket sales for revenue, television executives generate revenue from sponsors who are interested in the purchasing power of the viewers. Therefore, the number of viewers is not the primary concern for television executives.

Instructions:

1. Understand the profit models of both the film and television industries.
2. Identify the key revenue streams for each industry.
3. Consider the role of advertising in television profitability.
4. Evaluate the impact of production costs on profitability.
5. Choose the answer that accurately explains the difference in goals between movie and television executives.

Advice:

* Always consider the broader context of the problem, including the industry's profit model and revenue streams.
* Be aware of the role of advertising in television profitability.
* Don't assume that production costs are the primary driver of profitability.
* Take the time to carefully evaluate each answer choice and consider its implications.
* Consider seeking additional information or resources if needed.
