Context: Journalist: A manufacturers' trade group that has long kept its membership list secret inadvertently sent me a document listing hundreds of manufacturing companies. A representative of the trade group later confirmed that every company listed in the document does indeed belong to the trade group. Because Bruch Industries is not listed on the document, it is evidently not a member of the trade group.

Action: Answer("B")

The journalist's reasoning is flawed because the journalist does not present any evidence that the document names every member of the trade group. The document only lists hundreds of manufacturing companies, but it does not necessarily list all the members of the trade group. The journalist assumes that if Bruch Industries were a member of the trade group, it would be listed in the document, but this assumption is not necessarily true. The trade group may have other members that are not listed in the document, and therefore, the journalist's conclusion that Bruch Industries is not a member of the trade group is not justified.

Error Keywords:
