## System:
You are an expert in Law.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Law
Context: Astronomers have found new evidence that the number of galaxies in the universe is not 10 billion, as previously believed, but 50 billion. This discovery will have an important effect on theories about how galaxies are formed. But even though astronomers now believe 40 billion more galaxies exist, many astronomers' estimates of the universe's total mass remain virtually unchanged.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, does most to explain why the estimates remain virtually unchanged?
Choices:
  A: The mass of galaxies is thought to make up only a tiny percentage of the universe's total mass.
  B: The overwhelming majority of galaxies are so far from Earth that their mass can be only roughly estimated.
  C: The number of galaxies that astronomers believe exist tends to grow as the instruments used to detect galaxies become more sophisticated.
  D: Theories about how galaxies are formed are rarely affected by estimates of the universe's total mass.
  E: There is no consensus among astronomers on the proper procedures for estimating the universe's total mass.

Action: Answer("A")

Explanation:
The correct answer is A: The mass of galaxies is thought to make up only a tiny percentage of the universe's total mass.

The explanation for why the estimates of the universe's total mass remain virtually unchanged despite the discovery of 40 billion more galaxies is that the mass of galaxies is only a small fraction of the universe's total mass. This means that even though the number of galaxies has increased, their total mass is still a small percentage of the universe's total mass, and therefore, the estimates of the universe's total mass remain largely unchanged.

Error Keywords:

* Misinterpretation of the question
* Failure to consider all possible answers
* Incorrect assumption about the impact of new evidence on estimates of the universe's total mass

Solution:

1. Read the question carefully and understand the context.
2. Consider all possible answers and their implications.
3. Evaluate the impact of new evidence on estimates of the universe's total mass.
4. Choose the answer that best explains why the estimates of the universe's total mass remain virtually unchanged.

Instructions:

1. Identify the correct answer choice.
2. Explain the reasoning behind the correct answer.
3. Identify any error keywords that may have contributed to the incorrect answer.
4. Provide a step-by-step solution to the problem.
5. Offer general advice for solving similar problems in the future.

Advice:

* Always read the question carefully and understand the context.
* Consider all possible answers and their implications.
* Evaluate the impact of new evidence on estimates of the universe's total mass.
* Choose the answer that best explains why the estimates of the universe's total mass remain virtually unchanged.
* In law, it is important to consider all relevant evidence and evaluate its impact on the case at hand.
* Always double-check your work and consider alternative explanations.
* Remember that the correct answer may not always be the most intuitive one.
