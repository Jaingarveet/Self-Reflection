Topic: Law
Context: Native speakers perceive sentences of their own language as sequences of separate words. But this perception is an illusion. This is shown by the fact that travelers who do not know a local language hear an unintelligible, uninterrupted stream of sound, not sentences with distinct words.
Question: Which one of the following is an assumption on which the argument depends?
Choices:
  A: It is impossible to understand sentences if they are in fact uninterrupted streams of sound.
  B: Those who do not know a language cannot hear the way speech in that language actually sounds.
  C: People pay less close attention to the way their own language sounds than they do to the way an unfamiliar language sounds.
  D: Accomplished non-native speakers of a language do not perceive sentences as streams of sound.
  E: Native speakers' perceptions of their own language are not more accurate than are the perceptions of persons who do not know that language.

Action: Answer("E")

Explanation:
The argument depends on the assumption that native speakers' perceptions of their own language are not more accurate than those of non-native speakers. This is shown by the fact that travelers who do not know a local language hear an unintelligible, uninterrupted stream of sound, rather than distinct sentences. This challenges the illusion that native speakers perceive sentences as sequences of separate words. Therefore, assumption (E) is an essential part of the argument.

Error Keywords:

* Native speakers
* Perception
* Accuracy
* Non-native speakers
* Illusion

Solution:
The argument depends on the assumption that native speakers' perceptions of their own language are not more accurate than those of non-native speakers. This is shown by the fact that travelers who do not know a local language hear an unintelligible, uninterrupted stream of sound, rather than distinct sentences. This challenges the illusion that native speakers perceive sentences as sequences of separate words. Therefore, assumption (E) is an essential part of the argument.

Instructions:

1. Identify the argument's conclusion.
2. Identify the premise that supports the conclusion.
3. Identify the assumption that is made in the argument.
4. Evaluate the assumption's validity.
5. Determine if the assumption is necessary for the argument's conclusion.
6. If the assumption is not necessary, consider alternative assumptions that could support the conclusion.
7. Evaluate the strength of the argument with the alternative assumptions.

Advice:

* Always carefully read the argument and identify its conclusion and premises.
* Identify the assumption that is made in the argument and evaluate its validity.
* Consider alternative assumptions that could support the conclusion.
* Evaluate the strength of the argument with the alternative assumptions.
* Be aware of biases and assumptions that may influence your evaluation of the argument.
