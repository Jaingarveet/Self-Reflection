## System:
You are an expert in Law.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Topic: Law
Context: There are 70 to 100 Florida panthers alive today. This represents a very large increase over their numbers in the 1970s, but their population must reach at least 250 if it is to be self-sustaining. Their current habitat is not large enough to support any more of these animals, however.
Question: If the statements above are true, which one of the following must also be true?
Choices:
  A: Some part of the panthers' current habitat is only of marginal quality.
  B: If the population of Florida panthers ever exceeds 250, it will be self-sustaining.
  C: Unless Florida panthers acquire a larger habitat, their population will not be self-sustaining.
  D: The population of Florida panthers will never increase much beyond its current level.
  E: Today, Florida panthers occupy a larger habitat than they did in the 1970s.

Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Action: Answer("C")

Explanation:
The statement "Their current habitat is not large enough to support any more of these animals" implies that the population cannot sustainably grow beyond its current level without additional habitat. Therefore, choice C, "Unless Florida panthers acquire a larger habitat, their population will not be self-sustaining," logically follows from the given information.

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, selecting choice A instead of choice C. Upon reflection, I realized that my mistake was due to a misunderstanding of the question and an incorrect application of logic. I misinterpreted the statement "Their current habitat is not large enough to support any more of these animals" as referring to the quality of the habitat rather than its size. Therefore, I selected choice A, which is related to the quality of the habitat, rather than choice C, which addresses the issue of habitat size.

To avoid making this mistake in the future, I will carefully read the question and ensure that I understand the problem before answering. I will also pay closer attention to the logical connections between the given statements and apply the principles of logic more accurately. Additionally, I will double-check my answer to ensure it is correctly formatted and reflect on my thought process to identify areas for improvement.
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
