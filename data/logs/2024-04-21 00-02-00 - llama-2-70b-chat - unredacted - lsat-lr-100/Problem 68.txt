Action: Answer("E")

Explanation:
The correct answer is E: Whether residents of Flynn Heights are more likely to license their dogs than residents of other neighborhoods are.

The argument states that more cocker spaniels are registered to addresses in Flynn Heights than to addresses in all other neighborhoods combined. This suggests that residents of Flynn Heights are more likely to license their dogs, including cocker spaniels, than residents of other neighborhoods. Therefore, if an animal control officer finds a stray cocker spaniel near Flynn Heights, it is likely that the dog belongs to a resident of that neighborhood.

The other options do not provide as much relevant information for evaluating the argument:

A: Whether cocker spaniels are more likely than dogs of other breeds to stray from their owners is not directly relevant to the likelihood that a stray cocker spaniel found near Flynn Heights belongs to a resident of that neighborhood.

B: Whether there are more cocker spaniels registered to addresses in Flynn Heights than any other breed of dog may be relevant, but it does not directly address the likelihood that a stray cocker spaniel found in the area belongs to a resident of that neighborhood.

C: Whether the city's animal control officers find more stray dogs in and around Flynn Heights than in any other part of the city may be relevant, but it does not specifically address the likelihood that a stray cocker spaniel found in the area belongs to a resident of that neighborhood.

D: Whether the number of pets owned, per capita, is greater for residents of Flynn Heights than for residents of any other neighborhood may be relevant, but it does not directly address the likelihood that a stray cocker spaniel found near Flynn Heights belongs to a resident of that neighborhood.

Therefore, the correct answer is E: Whether residents of Flynn Heights are more likely to license their dogs than residents of other neighborhoods are.
