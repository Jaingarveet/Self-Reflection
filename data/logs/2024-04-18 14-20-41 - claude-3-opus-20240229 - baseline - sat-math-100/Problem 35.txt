## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:

The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: $$\sqrt{4 x}=x-3$$What are all values of $x$ that satisfy the given equation?I. 1II. 9
Choices:
  A: I only
  B: II only
  C: I and II
  D: Neither I nor II
## Assistant 2:
Let's solve this step-by-step:
1) First, let's square both sides of the equation to get rid of the square root:
   $(\sqrt{4x})^2 = (x-3)^2$
   $4x = x^2 - 6x + 9$
2) Now, let's rearrange the equation to standard form:
   $x^2 - 10x + 9 = 0$
3) We can solve this quadratic equation by factoring:
   $(x - 1)(x - 9) = 0$
4) The solutions are the values that make each factor equal to zero:
   $x - 1 = 0$ or $x - 9 = 0$
   $x = 1$ or $x = 9$
5) However, we need to check these solutions in the original equation because squaring both sides can introduce extraneous solutions.
   For $x = 1$: $\sqrt{4(1)} = 1 - 3$
               $2 = -2$ (False)
   For $x = 9$: $\sqrt{4(9)} = 9 - 3$
               $6 = 6$ (True)
Therefore, only $x = 9$ satisfies the original equation.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
