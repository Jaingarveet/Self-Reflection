## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Question: $$\left(x^{2} y-3 y^{2}+5 x y^{2}\right)-\left(-x^{2} y+3 x y^{2}-3 y^{2}\right)$$Which of the following is equivalent to the expression above?
Choices:
  A: $4 x^{2} y^{2}$
  B: $8 x y^{2}-6 y^{2}$
  C: $2 x^{2} y+2 x y^{2}$
  D: $2 x^{2} y+8 x y^{2}-6 y^{2}$
## Assistant 2:
Let's solve this step-by-step:
1) First, let's distribute the negative sign to the terms in the second parentheses:
   $\left(x^{2} y-3 y^{2}+5 x y^{2}\right)-\left(-x^{2} y+3 x y^{2}-3 y^{2}\right)$
   $= \left(x^{2} y-3 y^{2}+5 x y^{2}\right)-\left(-x^{2} y+3 x y^{2}-3 y^{2}\right)$
   $= \left(x^{2} y-3 y^{2}+5 x y^{2}\right)-(-x^{2} y)-3 x y^{2}+3 y^{2}$
2) Now, let's remove the parentheses:
   $= x^{2} y-3 y^{2}+5 x y^{2}+x^{2} y-3 x y^{2}+3 y^{2}$
3) Let's group like terms:
   $= x^{2} y+x^{2} y+5 x y^{2}-3 x y^{2}-3 y^{2}+3 y^{2}$
   $= 2x^{2} y+2 x y^{2}+0$
   $= 2x^{2} y+2 x y^{2}$
4) Looking at the choices, the answer that matches this simplified expression is C.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
