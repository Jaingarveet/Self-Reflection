## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: Which of the following is equivalent to $9^{\frac{3}{4}}$ ?
Choices:
  A: $\sqrt[3]{9}$
  B: $\sqrt[4]{9}$
  C: $\sqrt{3}$
  D: $3 \sqrt{3}$
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1) $9^{\frac{3}{4}}$ means the fourth root of 9 cubed, or $(9^3)^{\frac{1}{4}}$.
2) $9^3 = 729$
3) So, $9^{\frac{3}{4}} = 729^{\frac{1}{4}}$, which is the fourth root of 729.
4) Looking at the choices, $\sqrt[4]{9}$ is the fourth root of 9, not the fourth root of 729.
Therefore, the correct answer is B: $\sqrt[4]{9}$.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
