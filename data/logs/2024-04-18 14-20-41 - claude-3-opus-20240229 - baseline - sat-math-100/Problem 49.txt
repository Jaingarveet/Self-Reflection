## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Question: The equation $\frac{24 x^{2}+25 x-47}{a x-2}=-8 x-3-\frac{53}{a x-2}$ is true for all values of $x \neq \frac{2}{a}$, where $a$ is a constant.What is the value of $a$ ?
Choices:
  A: -16
  B: -3
  C: 3
  D: 16
## Assistant 2:
Let's approach this step-by-step:
1) For the equation to be true for all values of $x \neq \frac{2}{a}$, the numerators on both sides must be equal for all $x$. This is because the denominators are the same on both sides $(ax-2)$.
2) Equating the numerators:
   $24x^2 + 25x - 47 = -8x(ax-2) - 3(ax-2) - 53$
3) Expanding the right side:
   $24x^2 + 25x - 47 = -8ax^2 + 16x - 3ax + 6 - 53$
   
   $24x^2 + 25x - 47 = -8ax^2 + (16-3a)x - 47$
4) For this to be true for all $x$, the coefficients of $x^2$ and $x$ must be equal on both sides. Let's equate the coefficients of $x^2$:
   $24 = -8a$
   
   $a = -3$
5) We can verify this by equating the coefficients of $x$:
   $25 = 16-3a = 16-3(-3) = 16+9 = 25$
Therefore, the value of $a$ is -3.
Action: Answer("B")
