## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: In air, the speed of sound $S$, in meters per second, is a linear function of the air temperature $T$, in degrees Celsius, and is given by $S(T)=0.6 T+331.4$. Which of the following statements is the best interpretation of the number 331.4 in this context?
Choices:
  A: The speed of sound, in meters per second, at $0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$
  B: The speed of sound, in meters per second, at $0.6^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$
  C: The increase in the speed of sound, in meters per second, that corresponds to an increase of $1^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$
  D: The increase in the speed of sound, in meters per second, that corresponds to an increase of $0.6^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1) The equation for the speed of sound is given as $S(T) = 0.6T + 331.4$. This is a linear function.
2) In a linear function $y = mx + b$, $b$ represents the y-intercept, which is the value of $y$ when $x = 0$.
3) In this context, $T$ is the independent variable (like $x$) and $S$ is the dependent variable (like $y$). 
4) So, 331.4 represents the value of $S$ when $T = 0$. In other words, it's the speed of sound when the temperature is $0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.
5) The coefficient 0.6 represents the slope of the line, which is the change in $S$ for a unit change in $T$. Specifically, it's the increase in the speed of sound (in m/s) for a $1^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ increase in temperature.
Therefore, the best interpretation of 331.4 in this context is:
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
