## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: The volume of a sphere is given by the formula $V=\frac{4}{3} \pi r^{3}$, where $r$ is the radius of the sphere. Which of the following gives the radius of the sphere in terms of the volume of the sphere?
Choices:
  A: $\frac{4 \pi}{3 V}$
  B: $\frac{3 V}{4 \pi}$
  C: $\sqrt[3]{\frac{4 \pi}{3 V}}$
  D: $\sqrt[3]{\frac{3 V}{4 \pi}}$
## Assistant 2:
To solve this, let's work through each choice and see which one is correct when we plug it back into the original formula.
Given: $V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3$
A) If $r = \frac{4\pi}{3V}$, then:
   $V = \frac{4}{3} \pi (\frac{4\pi}{3V})^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi \frac{64\pi^3}{27V^3} \neq V$. This is incorrect.
B) If $r = \frac{3V}{4\pi}$, then:
   $V = \frac{4}{3} \pi (\frac{3V}{4\pi})^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi \frac{27V^3}{64\pi^3} \neq V$. This is incorrect.
C) If $r = \sqrt[3]{\frac{4\pi}{3V}}$, then:
   $V = \frac{4}{3} \pi (\sqrt[3]{\frac{4\pi}{3V}})^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi \frac{4\pi}{3V} \neq V$. This is incorrect.
D) If $r = \sqrt[3]{\frac{3V}{4\pi}}$, then:
   $V = \frac{4}{3} \pi (\sqrt[3]{\frac{3V}{4\pi}})^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi \frac{3V}{4\pi} = V$. This is correct.
Therefore, the correct answer is choice D.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
