## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: $$\begin{aligned}y & =x^{2} \\2 y+6 & =2(x+3)\end{aligned}$$If $(x, y)$ is a solution of the system of equations above and $x>0$, what is the value of $x y$ ?
Choices:
  A: 1
  B: 2
  C: 3
  D: 9
## Assistant 2:
Let's solve this step-by-step:
1) From the first equation, we have $y = x^2$.
2) Substituting this into the second equation:
   $2(x^2) + 6 = 2(x+3)$
3) Simplify:
   $2x^2 + 6 = 2x + 6$
4) Subtract 6 from both sides:
   $2x^2 = 2x$
5) Divide both sides by 2:
   $x^2 = x$
6) Subtract x from both sides:
   $x^2 - x = 0$
7) Factor:
   $x(x-1) = 0$
8) Solve:
   $x = 0$ or $x = 1$
9) But we're told that $x > 0$, so $x = 1$.
10) Substituting $x = 1$ into $y = x^2$:
    $y = 1^2 = 1$
11) Therefore, $x = 1$ and $y = 1$.
12) The question asks for $xy$. 
    $xy = 1 * 1 = 1$
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
