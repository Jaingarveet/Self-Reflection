## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:
Topic: Geography

  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: If $x>3$, which of the following is equivalent to $\frac{1}{\frac{1}{x+2}+\frac{1}{x+3}}$ ?
Choices:
  A: $\frac{2 x+5}{x^{2}+5 x+6}$
  B: $\frac{x^{2}+5 x+6}{2 x+5}$
  C: $2 x+5$
  D: $x^{2}+5 x+6$
## Assistant 2:
Let's approach this step-by-step:
1) First, let's find a common denominator for the fractions in the denominator. The common denominator is $(x+2)(x+3)$.
2) Now, we can write the expression as:
   $\frac{1}{\frac{x+3}{(x+2)(x+3)}+\frac{x+2}{(x+2)(x+3)}}$
3) Simplify the numerator in the denominator:
   $\frac{1}{\frac{x+3+x+2}{(x+2)(x+3)}}$
4) Simplify further:
   $\frac{1}{\frac{2x+5}{(x+2)(x+3)}}$
5) Now, we can flip the fraction (reciprocal) to get rid of the fraction in the denominator:
   $\frac{(x+2)(x+3)}{2x+5}$
6) Expand the numerator:
   $\frac{x^2+5x+6}{2x+5}$
7) This matches choice B.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
