Question: \begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}\hline\multicolumn{7}{|c|}{Lengths of Fish (in inches)} \\\hline8 & 9 & 9 & 9 & 10 & 10 & 11 \\\hline11 & 12 & 12 & 12 & 12 & 13 & 13 \\\hline13 & 14 & 14 & 15 & 15 & 16 & 24 \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}The table above lists the lengths, to the nearest inch, of a random sample of 21 brown bullhead fish. The outlier measurement of 24 inches is an error. Of the mean, median, and range of the values listed, which will change the most if the 24 -inch measurement is removed from the data?
Choices:
  A: Mean
  B: Median
  C: Range
  D: They will all change by the same amount.
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1) First, let's calculate the mean, median, and range with the 24-inch measurement included.
   Mean = (8 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 10 + 10 + 11 + 11 + 12 + 12 + 12 + 12 + 13 + 13 + 13 + 14 + 14 + 15 + 15 + 16 + 24) / 21 = 12.38 inches
   Median = 12 inches (the 11th value when sorted)
   Range = 24 - 8 = 16 inches
2) Now, let's remove the 24-inch measurement and recalculate:
   Mean = (8 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 10 + 10 + 11 + 11 + 12 + 12 + 12 + 12 + 13 + 13 + 13 + 14 + 14 + 15 + 15 + 16) / 20 = 12.15 inches
   Median = 12 inches (still the 10th value when sorted)
   Range = 16 - 8 = 8 inches
3) Let's compare the changes:
   Mean: 12.38 - 12.15 = 0.23 inch change
   Median: No change
   Range: 16 - 8 = 8 inch change
The range changed the most when the outlier was removed.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
