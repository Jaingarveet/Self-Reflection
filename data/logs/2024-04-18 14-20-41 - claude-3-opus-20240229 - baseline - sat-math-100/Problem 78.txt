Question: On Saturday afternoon, Armand sent $m$ text messages each hour for 5 hours, and Tyrone sent $p$ text messages each hour for 4 hours. Which of the following represents the total number of messages sent by Armand and Tyrone on Saturday afternoon?
Choices:
  A: $9 m p$
  B: $20 m p$
  C: $5 m+4 p$
  D: $4 m+5 p$
## Assistant 2:
Let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Armand sent $m$ messages each hour for 5 hours. So the total number of messages sent by Armand is:
   
   $m + m + m + m + m = 5m$
2) Tyrone sent $p$ messages each hour for 4 hours. So the total number of messages sent by Tyrone is:
   
   $p + p + p + p = 4p$
3) The total number of messages sent by both Armand and Tyrone is the sum of the messages sent by each of them:
   
   $5m + 4p$
4) Looking at the choices, the one that matches this expression is choice C.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
