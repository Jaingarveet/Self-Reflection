## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.

Question: For what value of $n$ is $|n-1|+1$ equal to 0 ?
Choices:
  A: 0
  B: 1
  C: 2
  D: There is no such value of $n$.
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1) The expression $|n-1|+1$ is the sum of the absolute value of $(n-1)$ and 1.
2) The absolute value of a number is always non-negative. It's 0 if and only if the number itself is 0, and positive otherwise.
3) So, for $|n-1|+1$ to be equal to 0, we need $|n-1|$ to be equal to -1.
4) But as we said in step 2, the absolute value is always non-negative. It can never be -1.
5) Therefore, there is no value of $n$ for which $|n-1|+1$ is equal to 0.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
