## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Topic: Math
Question: A rectangle was altered by increasing its length by 10 percent and decreasing its width by $p$ percent. If these alterations decreased the area of the rectangle by 12 percent, what is the value of $p$ ?
Choices:
  A: 12
  B: 15
  C: 20
  D: 22
## Assistant 2:
Let's approach this step-by-step:
1) Let the original length be $l$ and the original width be $w$. So, the original area is $lw$.
2) After the alteration, the new length is $1.1l$ (increased by 10%) and the new width is $(1-\frac{p}{100})w$ (decreased by $p$%). 
3) The new area is $1.1l(1-\frac{p}{100})w$. 
4) We are told that the new area is 88% of the original area (because it decreased by 12%). So:
   $1.1l(1-\frac{p}{100})w = 0.88lw$
5) Simplifying:
   $1.1(1-\frac{p}{100}) = 0.88$
6) Multiplying out the brackets:
   $1.1 - 1.1\frac{p}{100} = 0.88$
7) Subtracting 1.1 from both sides:
   $-1.1\frac{p}{100} = -0.22$
8) Dividing both sides by -1.1:
   $\frac{p}{100} = 0.2$
9) Multiplying both sides by 100:
   $p = 20$
Therefore, the value of $p$ is 20.
Action: Answer("C")
