## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: For a polynomial $p(x)$, the value of $p(3)$ is -2 .Which of the following must be true about $p(x)$ ?
Choices:
  A: $x-5$ is a factor of $p(x)$.
  B: $x-2$ is a factor of $p(x)$.
  C: $x+2$ is a factor of $p(x)$.
  D: The remainder when $p(x)$ is divided by $x-3$ is -2 .
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1) If a polynomial $p(x)$ has a factor $(x-a)$, then $p(a) = 0$. This is because $(x-a)$ equals 0 when $x=a$.
2) However, we are given that $p(3) = -2$, not 0. So $x-3$ is not a factor of $p(x)$. This eliminates choices A and B.
3) Choice C mentions $x+2$ as a factor. But we don't have enough information to determine if this is true or not. The value of $p(-2)$ is not given.
4) Now, let's consider choice D. When a polynomial $p(x)$ is divided by $(x-a)$, the remainder is equal to $p(a)$. 
5) Here, $a=3$, and we're told that $p(3) = -2$. So when $p(x)$ is divided by $x-3$, the remainder must be -2.
Therefore, choice D must be true.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
