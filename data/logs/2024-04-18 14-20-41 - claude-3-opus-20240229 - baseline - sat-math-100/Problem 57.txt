## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: \begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|l||c|c||c|}\cline { 2 - 4 }\multicolumn{1}{c||}{} & \multicolumn{2}{c||}{Age} & \multirow{2}{c|}{Total} \\\hlineGender & Under 40 & 40 or older \\\hline\hlineMale & 12 & 2 & 14 \\\hlineFemale & 8 & 3 & 11 \\\hline\hlineTotal & 20 & 5 & 25 \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}The table above shows the distribution of age and gender for 25 people who entered a contest. If the contest winner will be selected at random, what is the probability that the winner will be either a female under age 40 or a male age 40 or older?
Choices:
  A: $\frac{4}{25}$
  B: $\frac{10}{25}$
  C: $\frac{11}{25}$
  D: $\frac{16}{25}$
## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) We want the probability of selecting either a female under 40 or a male 40 or older.
2) From the table, we can see that there are 8 females under 40 and 2 males 40 or older.
3) The total number of people who fit our criteria is thus 8 + 2 = 10.
4) The total number of people in the contest is 25.
5) The probability of selecting a person who meets our criteria is thus:
   Number of people who meet criteria / Total number of people
   = 10 / 25
   = $\frac{10}{25}$
6) Looking at the choices, $\frac{10}{25}$ corresponds to choice B.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
