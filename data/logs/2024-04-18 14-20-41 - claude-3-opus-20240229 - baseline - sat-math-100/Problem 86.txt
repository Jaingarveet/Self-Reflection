Question: If $y=k x$, where $k$ is a constant, and $y=24$ when $x=6$, what is the value of $y$ when $x=5$ ?
Choices:
  A: 6
  B: 15
  C: 20
  D: 23
## Assistant 2:
Let's solve this step-by-step:
1) We are given that $y = kx$, where $k$ is a constant.
2) We are also told that $y = 24$ when $x = 6$. Let's use this information to find the value of $k$.
   $24 = k(6)$
   $24 = 6k$
   $k = 24/6 = 4$
3) So, the equation is $y = 4x$.
4) Now, we need to find the value of $y$ when $x = 5$. Let's substitute $x = 5$ into the equation:
   $y = 4(5) = 20$
Therefore, when $x = 5$, $y = 20$.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
