Question: Alma bought a laptop computer at a store that gave a 20 percent discount off its original price. The total amount she paid to the cashier was $p$ dollars, including an 8 percent sales tax on the discounted price. Which of the following represents the original price of the computer in terms of $p$ ?
Choices:
  A: $0.88 p$
  B: $\frac{p}{0.88}$
  C: $(0.8)(1.08) p$
  D: $\frac{p}{(0.8)(1.08)}$
## Assistant 2:
Let's approach this step-by-step:
1) Let the original price of the computer be $x$.
2) After the 20% discount, the price becomes $0.8x$. 
   (Since 20% is taken off, 80% of the original price remains.)
3) The 8% sales tax is applied to this discounted price. So the total price Alma paid is:
   $p = 1.08(0.8x)$
   (The tax is 8% of the discounted price, so the total is 108% of the discounted price.)
4) Simplifying the right side of the equation:
   $p = 0.864x$
5) To express $x$ (the original price) in terms of $p$, we divide both sides by 0.864:
   $x = \frac{p}{0.864}$
6) $0.864 = (0.8)(1.08)$, so this can also be written as:
   $x = \frac{p}{(0.8)(1.08)}$
Therefore, the correct answer is D: $\frac{p}{(0.8)(1.08)}$
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
