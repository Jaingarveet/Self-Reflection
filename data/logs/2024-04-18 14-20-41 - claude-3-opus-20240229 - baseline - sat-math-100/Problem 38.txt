## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:

## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: Which of the following is equal to $a^{\frac{2}{3}}$, for all values of $a$ ?
Choices:
  A: $\sqrt{a^{\frac{1}{3}}}$
  B: $\sqrt{a^{3}}$
  C: $\sqrt[3]{a^{\frac{1}{2}}}$
  D: $\sqrt[3]{a^{2}}$
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1) We need to find an expression that is equal to $a^{\frac{2}{3}}$ for all values of $a$.
2) Let's look at each choice:
   A) $\sqrt{a^{\frac{1}{3}}}$ = $a^{\frac{1}{6}}$ (using the rule $\sqrt{a^n} = a^{\frac{n}{2}}$). This is not equal to $a^{\frac{2}{3}}$.
   B) $\sqrt{a^{3}}$ = $a^{\frac{3}{2}}$ (using the same rule as above). This is not equal to $a^{\frac{2}{3}}$.
   C) $\sqrt[3]{a^{\frac{1}{2}}}$ = $a^{\frac{1}{6}}$ (using the rule $\sqrt[n]{a^m} = a^{\frac{m}{n}}$). This is not equal to $a^{\frac{2}{3}}$.
   D) $\sqrt[3]{a^{2}}$ = $a^{\frac{2}{3}}$ (using the same rule as in C). This is equal to $a^{\frac{2}{3}}$.
3) Therefore, the correct answer is D.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
