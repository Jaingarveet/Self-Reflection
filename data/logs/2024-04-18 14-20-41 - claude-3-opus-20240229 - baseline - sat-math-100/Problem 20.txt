Topic: Math
Question: $$\begin{aligned}& 2.4 x-1.5 y=0.3 \\& 1.6 x+0.5 y=-1.3\end{aligned}$$The system of equations above is graphed in the $x y$-plane. What is the $x$-coordinate of the intersection point $(x, y)$ of the system?
Choices:
  A: -0.5
  B: -0.25
  C: 0.8
  D: 1.75
## Assistant 2:
Let's solve this step-by-step:
1) First, let's use substitution method to solve for x and y. From the first equation, we can express y in terms of x:
   $2.4x - 1.5y = 0.3$
   $-1.5y = -2.4x + 0.3$
   $y = \frac{2.4x - 0.3}{1.5} = 1.6x - 0.2$
2) Now, substitute this expression for y into the second equation:
   $1.6x + 0.5(1.6x - 0.2) = -1.3$
   $1.6x + 0.8x - 0.1 = -1.3$
   $2.4x = -1.2$
   $x = -0.5$
3) Now that we have x, we can find y by substituting x back into either of the original equations. Let's use the first equation:
   $2.4(-0.5) - 1.5y = 0.3$
   $-1.2 - 1.5y = 0.3$
   $-1.5y = 1.5$
   $y = -1$
4) Therefore, the point of intersection is (-0.5, -1).
