Context: $$.\begin{aligned}.& S(P)=\frac{1}{2} P+40 \\.& D(P)=220-P.\end{aligned}.$$.The quantity of a product supplied and the quantity of the product demanded in an economic market are functions of the price of the product. The functions above are the estimated supply and demand functions for a certain product. The function $S(P)$ gives the quantity of the product supplied to the market when the price is $P$ dollars, and the function $D(P)$ gives the quantity of the product demanded by the market when the price is $P$ dollars.
Question: Graphene, which is used in the manufacture of integrated circuits, is so thin that a sheet weighing one ounce can cover up to 7 football fields. If a football field has an area of approximately $1 \frac{1}{3}$ acres, about how many acres could 48 ounces of graphene cover?
Choices:
  A: 250
  B: 350
  C: 450
  D: 1,350
## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) We know that 1 ounce of graphene can cover 7 football fields.
2) Each football field is approximately $1 \frac{1}{3}$ acres.
3) So, 1 ounce of graphene can cover $7 \times 1 \frac{1}{3} = 9 \frac{1}{3}$ acres.
4) Now, we want to know how many acres 48 ounces can cover.
5) If 1 ounce covers $9 \frac{1}{3}$ acres, then 48 ounces will cover $48 \times 9 \frac{1}{3}$ acres.
6) $48 \times 9 \frac{1}{3} = 48 \times \frac{28}{3} = \frac{1344}{3} = 448$ acres.
The closest answer to 448 is 450.
Action: Answer("C")
