## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Question: The number of states that joined the United States between 1776 and 1849 is twice the number of states that joined between 1850 and 1900. If 30 states joined the United States between 1776 and 1849 and $x$ states joined between 1850 and 1900 , which of the following equations is true?
Choices:
  A: $30 x=2$
  B: $2 x=30$
  C: $\frac{x}{2}=30$
  D: $x+30=2$
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1) Let's define our variables:
   Let $a$ = number of states that joined between 1776 and 1849
   Let $x$ = number of states that joined between 1850 and 1900
2) We're told that $a$ is twice $x$. In mathematical terms, this can be written as:
   $a = 2x$
3) We're also told that $a = 30$. So we can substitute this into our equation:
   $30 = 2x$
4) This is the same as the equation in choice B.
Therefore, the correct answer is B.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
