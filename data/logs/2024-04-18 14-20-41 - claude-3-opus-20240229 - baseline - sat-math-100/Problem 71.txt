## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: Survey Results\begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|l|c|}\hlineAnswer & Percent \\\hlineNever & $31.3 \%$ \\\hlineRarely & $24.3 \%$ \\\hlineOften & $13.5 \%$ \\\hlineAlways & $30.9 \%$ \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}The table above shows the results of a survey in which tablet users were asked how often they would watch video advertisements in order to access streaming content for free. Based on the table, which of the following is closest to the probability that a tablet user answered "Always," given that the tablet user did not answer "Never"?
Choices:
  A: 0.31
  B: 0.38
  C: 0.45
  D: 0.69
## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's approach this step-by-step:
1) The probability of a user answering "Always" given they did not answer "Never" is a conditional probability. We can calculate this using the formula:
   P(Always | Not Never) = P(Always and Not Never) / P(Not Never)
2) P(Always and Not Never) is just P(Always), because "Always" and "Never" are mutually exclusive. From the table, P(Always) = 30.9% = 0.309.
3) To find P(Not Never), we can subtract P(Never) from 1:
   
   P(Not Never) = 1 - P(Never) = 1 - 0.313 = 0.687
4) Now we can calculate the conditional probability:
   P(Always | Not Never) = 0.309 / 0.687 â‰ˆ 0.45
Therefore, the probability that a tablet user answered "Always," given that the tablet user did not answer "Never," is closest to 0.45.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
