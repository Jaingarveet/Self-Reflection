## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: \begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|c||c|c|c|c|}\hline$n$ & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\\hline$f(n)$ & -2 & 1 & 4 & 7 \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}The table above shows some values of the linear function $f$. Which of the following defines $f$ ?
Choices:
  A: $f(n)=n-3$
  B: $f(n)=2 n-4$
  C: $f(n)=3 n-5$
  D: $f(n)=4 n-6$
## Assistant 2:
Let's approach this step-by-step:
1) We are told that $f$ is a linear function. The general form of a linear function is $f(n) = an + b$, where $a$ and $b$ are constants.
2) We can find $a$ and $b$ using the given values in the table. Let's use the points $(1, -2)$ and $(2, 1)$.
3) Using the point $(1, -2)$:
   $f(1) = a(1) + b = -2$
   $a + b = -2$ ... (Equation 1)
4) Using the point $(2, 1)$:
   $f(2) = a(2) + b = 1$
   $2a + b = 1$ ... (Equation 2)
5) Subtracting Equation 1 from Equation 2:
   $(2a + b) - (a + b) = 1 - (-2)$
   $a = 3$
6) Substituting $a = 3$ into Equation 1:
   $3 + b = -2$
   $b = -5$
7) Therefore, $f(n) = 3n - 5$
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
