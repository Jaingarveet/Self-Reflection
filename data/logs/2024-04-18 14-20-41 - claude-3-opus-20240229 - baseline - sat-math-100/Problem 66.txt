## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: In the $x y$-plane, the graph of the function $f(x)=x^{2}+5 x+4$ has two $x$-intercepts. What is the distance between the $x$-intercepts?
Choices:
  A: 1
  B: 2
  C: 3
  D: 4
## Assistant 2:
Let's approach this step-by-step:
1) The x-intercepts are the points where the graph crosses the x-axis. At these points, y = 0.
2) To find the x-intercepts, we set f(x) = 0:
   $x^2 + 5x + 4 = 0$
3) This is a quadratic equation. We can solve it using the quadratic formula:
   $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$
   where $a=1$, $b=5$, and $c=4$.
4) Substituting these values:
   $x = \frac{-5 \pm \sqrt{5^2-4(1)(4)}}{2(1)}$
      $= \frac{-5 \pm \sqrt{25-16}}{2}$
      $= \frac{-5 \pm \sqrt{9}}{2}$
      $= \frac{-5 \pm 3}{2}$
5) This gives us two solutions:
   $x_1 = \frac{-5 + 3}{2} = -1$
   $x_2 = \frac{-5 - 3}{2} = -4$
6) The distance between these two x-intercepts is the absolute difference between these values:
   $|-1 - (-4)| = |-1 + 4| = |3| = 3$
Therefore, the distance between the x-intercepts is 3.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
