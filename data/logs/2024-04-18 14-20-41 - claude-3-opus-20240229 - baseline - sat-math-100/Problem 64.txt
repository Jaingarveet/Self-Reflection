## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:

## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: If $3 x-y=12$, what is the value of $\frac{8^{x}}{2^{y}} ?$
Choices:
  A: $2^{12}$
  B: 4
  C: $8^{2}$
  D: The value cannot be determined from the information given.
## Assistant 2:
Let's approach this step-by-step:
1) We are given the equation $3x - y = 12$. However, we have two unknowns (x and y) and only one equation. This means we cannot determine unique values for x and y.
2) The question asks for the value of $\frac{8^x}{2^y}$. Let's simplify this:
   $\frac{8^x}{2^y} = \frac{(2^3)^x}{2^y} = \frac{2^{3x}}{2^y} = 2^{3x-y}$
3) Now, if we could determine the value of $3x-y$, we could find the value of $\frac{8^x}{2^y}$. But from step 1, we know that we cannot determine unique values for x and y.
4) Therefore, we do not have enough information to determine the value of $\frac{8^x}{2^y}$.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: A
