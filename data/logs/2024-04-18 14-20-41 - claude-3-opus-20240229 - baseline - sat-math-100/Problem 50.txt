## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Question: \begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}\cline { 2 - 3 }\multicolumn{1}{c|}{} & \multicolumn{2}{c|}{Handedness} \\\hlineGender & Left & Right \\\hline\hlineFemale &  &  \\\hlineMale &  &  \\\hline\hlineTotal & 18 & 122 \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}The incomplete table above summarizes the number of left-handed students and right-handed students by gender for the eighth-grade students atKeisel Middle School. There are 5 times as many right-handed female students as there are left-handed female students, and there are 9 times as many right-handed male students as there are left-handed male students. If there is a total of 18 left-handed students and 122 right-handed students in the school, which of the following is closest to the probability that a right-handed student selected at random is female? (Note: Assume that none of the eighth-grade students are both right-handed and left-handed.)
Choices:
  A: 0.410
  B: 0.357
  C: 0.333
  D: 0.250
## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Let's define some variables:
   Let F_L be the number of left-handed females
   Let F_R be the number of right-handed females
   Let M_L be the number of left-handed males
   Let M_R be the number of right-handed males
2) We're told that there are 5 times as many right-handed females as left-handed females, and 9 times as many right-handed males as left-handed males. So:
   F_R = 5 * F_L
   M_R = 9 * M_L
3) We're also told that there are 18 left-handed students in total and 122 right-handed students in total. So:
   F_L + M_L = 18
   F_R + M_R = 122
4) Substituting the equations from step 2 into the equations from step 3:
   F_L + M_L = 18
   5*F_L + 9*M_L = 122
5) Now we have a system of equations. Let's solve for F_L and M_L:
   From the first equation: M_L = 18 - F_L
   Substituting this into the second equation:
   5*F_L + 9*(18 - F_L) = 122
   5*F_L + 162 - 9*F_L = 122
   -4*F_L = -40
   F_L = 10
   Substituting this back into the equation M_L = 18 - F_L:
   M_L = 18 - 10 = 8
6) Now that we have F_L and M_L, we can calculate F_R and M_R:
   F_R = 5 * F_L = 5 * 10 = 50
   M_R = 9 * M_L = 9 * 8 = 72
7) The probability that a right-handed student selected at random is female is:
   P(Right-handed and Female) = F_R / (F_R + M_R) = 50 / (50 + 72) = 50 / 122 â‰ˆ 0.410
Therefore, the answer closest to the probability that a right-handed student selected at random is female is 0.410.
