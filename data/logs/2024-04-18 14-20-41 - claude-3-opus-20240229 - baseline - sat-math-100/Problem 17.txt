## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: If $\frac{a}{b}=2$, what is the value of $\frac{4 b}{a} ?$
Choices:
  A: 0
  B: 1
  C: 2
  D: 4
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1) We are given that $\frac{a}{b} = 2$. This means that $a = 2b$.
2) Now, we want to find the value of $\frac{4b}{a}$. Let's substitute $a = 2b$ into this:
   $\frac{4b}{a} = \frac{4b}{2b}$
3) The $b$ cancels out in the numerator and denominator:
   $\frac{4b}{2b} = \frac{4}{2}$
4) And $\frac{4}{2} = 2$.
Therefore, the correct answer is C.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
