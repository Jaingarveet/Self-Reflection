## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:
Topic: Geography
Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: $$\begin{aligned}& k x-3 y=4 \\& 4 x-5 y=7\end{aligned}$$In the system of equations above, $k$ is a constant and $x$ and $y$ are variables. For what value of $k$ will the system of equations have no solution?
Choices:
  A: $\frac{12}{5}$
  B: $\frac{16}{7}$
  C: $-\frac{16}{7}$
  D: $-\frac{12}{5}$
## Assistant 2:
Let's approach this step-by-step:
1) For a system of equations to have no solution, the lines represented by the equations must be parallel. Parallel lines have the same slope.
2) The slope of a line in the form $ax + by = c$ is $-\frac{a}{b}$.
3) For the first equation, the slope is $-\frac{k}{-3} = \frac{k}{3}$.
4) For the second equation, the slope is $-\frac{4}{-5} = \frac{4}{5}$.
5) For the lines to be parallel, we must have:
   $\frac{k}{3} = \frac{4}{5}$
6) Solving for $k$:
   $k = \frac{4}{5} \cdot 3 = \frac{12}{5}$
Therefore, when $k = \frac{12}{5}$, the system of equations will have no solution.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
