## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:

Question: \begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}\hline$x$ & $f(x)$ \\\hline0 & 3 \\\hline2 & 1 \\\hline4 & 0 \\\hline5 & -2 \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}The function $f$ is defined by a polynomial. Some values of $x$ and $f(x)$ are shown in the table above. Which of the following must be a factor of $f(x)$ ?
Choices:
  A: $x-2$
  B: $x-3$
  C: $x-4$
  D: $x-5$
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1) If a polynomial $f(x)$ has a factor $(x-a)$, then $f(a) = 0$. This is because when $x=a$, the factor $(x-a)$ becomes zero, making the whole polynomial zero.
2) Looking at the table, we see that $f(4) = 0$.
3) This means that $(x-4)$ must be a factor of $f(x)$, because when $x=4$, $f(x)$ becomes zero.
4) None of the other choices have this property. For example, $f(2) = 1$, so $(x-2)$ is not a factor, and so on.
Therefore, the correct answer is C: $x-4$.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
