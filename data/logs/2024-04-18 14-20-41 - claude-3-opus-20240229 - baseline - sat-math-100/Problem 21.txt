## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: What are the solutions to $3 x^{2}+12 x+6=0 ?$
Choices:
  A: $x=-2 \pm \sqrt{2}$
  B: $x=-2 \pm \frac{\sqrt{30}}{3}$
  C: $x=-6 \pm \sqrt{2}$
  D: $x=-6 \pm 6 \sqrt{2}$
## Assistant 2:
Let's solve this step-by-step using the quadratic formula:
1) The quadratic formula is $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are the coefficients of the quadratic equation in standard form $(ax^2 + bx + c)$.
2) In this case, $a=3$, $b=12$, and $c=6$.
3) Substituting these values into the quadratic formula:
   $x = \frac{-12 \pm \sqrt{12^2-4(3)(6)}}{2(3)}$
4) Simplify:
   
   $x = \frac{-12 \pm \sqrt{144-72}}{6}$
   
   $x = \frac{-12 \pm \sqrt{72}}{6}$
   
   $x = \frac{-12 \pm 6\sqrt{2}}{6}$
5) Simplify further:
   $x = \frac{-12}{6} \pm \frac{6\sqrt{2}}{6}$
   
   $x = -2 \pm \sqrt{2}$
Therefore, the correct answer is A.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
