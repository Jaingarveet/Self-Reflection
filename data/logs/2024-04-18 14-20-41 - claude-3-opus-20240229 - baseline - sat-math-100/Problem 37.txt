## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: The volume of right circular cylinder A is 22 cubic centimeters. What is the volume, in cubic centimeters, of a right circular cylinder with twice the radius and half the height of cylinder A?
Choices:
  A: 11
  B: 22
  C: 44
  D: 66
## Assistant 2:
Let's approach this step-by-step:
1) The volume of a right circular cylinder is given by the formula: V = πr²h, where r is the radius and h is the height.
2) Let's say the radius of cylinder A is r and its height is h. We don't know these values, but we know that πr²h = 22.
3) Now, we're asked about a new cylinder. Let's call it cylinder B. Its radius is twice that of cylinder A (so it's 2r), and its height is half that of cylinder A (so it's h/2).
4) The volume of cylinder B is:
   V_B = π(2r)²(h/2)
       = π(4r²)(h/2)
       = 2πr²h
5) But we know that πr²h = 22 (from step 2). So:
   V_B = 2(22) = 44
Therefore, the volume of cylinder B is 44 cubic centimeters.
Action: Answer("C")
