Question: A square field measures 10 meters by 10 meters. Ten students each mark off a randomly selected region of the field; each region is square and has side lengths of 1 meter, and no two regions overlap. The students count the earthworms contained in the soil to a depth of 5 centimeters beneath the ground's surface in each region. The results are shown in the table below.\begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}\hlineRegion & $\begin{array}{c}\text { Number of } \\ \text { earthworms }\end{array}$ & Region & $\begin{array}{c}\text { Number of } \\ \text { earthworms }\end{array}$ \\\hlineA & 107 & $\mathrm{~F}$ & 141 \\\hlineB & 147 & $\mathrm{G}$ & 150 \\\hlineC & 146 & $\mathrm{H}$ & 154 \\\hlineD & 135 & $\mathrm{I}$ & 176 \\\hlineE & 149 & $\mathrm{~J}$ & 166 \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}Which of the following is a reasonable approximation of the number of earthworms to a depth of 5 centimeters beneath the ground's surface in the entire field?
Choices:
  A: $\quad 150$
  B: $\quad 1,500$
  C: 15,000
  D: 150,000
## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's approach this step-by-step:
1) First, we need to find the average number of earthworms per square meter. To do this, we sum up the number of earthworms in each region and divide by the number of regions.
   Total earthworms = 107 + 147 + 146 + 135 + 149 + 141 + 150 + 154 + 176 + 166 = 1,471
   Average earthworms per square meter = 1,471 / 10 = 147.1
2) Now, we know the average number of earthworms in a 1m x 1m area. The entire field is 10m x 10m, which is an area of 100 square meters.
3) To estimate the total number of earthworms in the field, we multiply the average number of earthworms per square meter by the total area of the field in square meters.
   Estimated total earthworms = 147.1 * 100 = 14,710
4) Looking at the choices, the closest answer to 14,710 is 15,000.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
