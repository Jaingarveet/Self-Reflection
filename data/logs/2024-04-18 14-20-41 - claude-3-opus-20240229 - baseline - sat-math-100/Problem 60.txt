Question: Mr. Kohl has a beaker containing $n$ milliliters of solution to distribute to the students in his chemistry class. If he gives each student 3 milliliters of solution, he will have 5 milliliters left over. In order to give each student 4 milliliters of solution, he will need an additional 21 milliliters. How many students are in the class?
Choices:
  A: 16
  B: 21
  C: 23
  D: 26
## Assistant 2:
Let's approach this step-by-step:
1) Let the number of students in the class be $s$.
2) If each student gets 3 milliliters, and there are 5 milliliters left over, we can write:
   
   $n = 3s + 5$
3) If each student gets 4 milliliters, the teacher needs an additional 21 milliliters. This means:
   
   $n + 21 = 4s$
4) From (2) and (3), we can write:
   
   $3s + 5 + 21 = 4s$
5) Simplifying:
   
   $3s + 26 = 4s$
6) Solving for $s$:
   
   $26 = s$
Therefore, there are 26 students in the class.
Action: Answer("D")
