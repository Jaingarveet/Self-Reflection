## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: $$\sqrt{k+2}-x=0$$In the equation above, $k$ is a constant. If $x=9$, what is the value of $k$ ?
Choices:
  A: 1
  B: 7
  C: 16
  D: 79
## Assistant 2:
Let's solve this step-by-step:
1) We are given the equation $\sqrt{k+2}-x=0$, where $k$ is a constant and $x=9$.
2) Substituting $x=9$ into the equation:
   $\sqrt{k+2}-9=0$
3) To solve for $k$, first add 9 to both sides:
   $\sqrt{k+2}=9$
4) Now square both sides to eliminate the square root:
   $k+2=9^2=81$
5) Subtract 2 from both sides to isolate $k$:
   $k=81-2=79$
Therefore, when $x=9$, the value of $k$ is 79.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
