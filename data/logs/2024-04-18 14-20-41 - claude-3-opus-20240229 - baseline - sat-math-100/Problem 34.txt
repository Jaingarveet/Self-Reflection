Topic: Math
Question: A book was on sale for $40 \%$ off its original price. If the sale price of the book was $\$ 18.00$, what was the original price of the book? (Assume there is no sales tax.)
Choices:
  A: $\$ 7.20$
  B: $\$ 10.80$
  C: $\$ 30.00$
  D: $\$ 45.00$
## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's approach this step-by-step:
1) Let's define the original price of the book as x.
2) The sale price is 60% of the original price (100% - 40% = 60%).
3) We can express this as an equation:
   0.6x = $18.00
4) To solve for x, divide both sides by 0.6:
   x = $18.00 / 0.6
5) Simplify:
   x = $30.00
Therefore, the original price of the book was $30.00.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
