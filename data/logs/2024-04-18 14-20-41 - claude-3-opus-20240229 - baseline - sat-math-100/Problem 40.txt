Question: If $20-x=15$, what is the value of $3 x ?$
Choices:
  A: 5
  B: 10
  C: 15
  D: 35
## Assistant 2:
Let's solve this step-by-step:
1) The equation is $20 - x = 15$
2) To solve for $x$, add $x$ to both sides:
   $20 - x + x = 15 + x$
   $20 = 15 + x$
3) Now subtract 15 from both sides:
   $20 - 15 = 15 - 15 + x$
   $5 = x$
4) So $x = 5$
5) The question asks for $3x$. Since $x = 5$, $3x = 3 * 5 = 15$
Therefore, the correct answer is C: 15.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
