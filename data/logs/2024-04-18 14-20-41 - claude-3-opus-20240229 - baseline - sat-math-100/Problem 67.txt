Question: Which of the following is an equation of a circle in the $x y$-plane with center $(0,4)$ and a radius with endpoint $\left(\frac{4}{3}, 5\right) ?$
Choices:
  A: $x^{2}+(y-4)^{2}=\frac{25}{9}$
  B: $x^{2}+(y+4)^{2}=\frac{25}{9}$
  C: $x^{2}+(y-4)^{2}=\frac{5}{3}$
  D: $x^{2}+(y+4)^{2}=\frac{3}{5}$
## Assistant 2:
Let's approach this step-by-step:
1) The general equation of a circle with center $(h,k)$ and radius $r$ is $(x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2$.
2) Here, the center is given as $(0,4)$, so $h=0$ and $k=4$.
3) To find the radius, we need to calculate the distance between the center and the given endpoint of the radius. The endpoint is given as $(\frac{4}{3}, 5)$.
4) The distance formula is $\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2 + (y_2-y_1)^2}$. Here, $(x_1,y_1)=(0,4)$ and $(x_2,y_2)=(\frac{4}{3}, 5)$.
   $r = \sqrt{(\frac{4}{3}-0)^2 + (5-4)^2} = \sqrt{(\frac{4}{3})^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{\frac{16}{9} + 1} = \sqrt{\frac{25}{9}} = \frac{5}{3}$
5) Substituting $h=0$, $k=4$, and $r=\frac{5}{3}$ into the general equation:
   $(x-0)^2 + (y-4)^2 = (\frac{5}{3})^2$
   $x^2 + (y-4)^2 = \frac{25}{9}$
6) This matches choice A.
Action: Answer("A")
