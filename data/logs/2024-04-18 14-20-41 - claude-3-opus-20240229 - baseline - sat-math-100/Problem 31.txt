Question: $$\begin{aligned}1 \text { decagram } & =10 \text { grams } \\1,000 \text { milligrams } & =1 \text { gram }\end{aligned}$$A hospital stores one type of medicine in 2-decagram containers. Based on the information given in the box above, how many 1-milligram doses are there in one 2-decagram container?
Choices:
  A: $\quad 0.002$
  B: $\quad 200$
  C: $\quad 2,000$
  D: 20,000
## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) First, we need to convert 2 decagrams to grams. 
   We know that 1 decagram = 10 grams.
   So, 2 decagrams = 2 * 10 grams = 20 grams.
2) Now, we need to convert 20 grams to milligrams.
   We know that 1 gram = 1,000 milligrams.
   So, 20 grams = 20 * 1,000 milligrams = 20,000 milligrams.
3) Therefore, a 2-decagram container contains 20,000 milligrams of the medicine.
4) Since the question asks for the number of 1-milligram doses, and we have 20,000 milligrams in total, the answer is 20,000.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
