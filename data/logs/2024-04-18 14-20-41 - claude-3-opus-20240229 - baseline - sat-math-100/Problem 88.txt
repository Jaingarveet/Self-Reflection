Topic: Math
Question: $$h=-4.9 t^{2}+25 t$$The equation above expresses the approximate height $h$, in meters, of a ball $t$ seconds after it is launched vertically upward from the ground with an initial velocity of 25 meters per second. After approximately how many seconds will the ball hit the ground?
Choices:
  A: 3.5
  B: 4.0
  C: 4.5
  D: 5.0
## Assistant 2:
Let's approach this step-by-step:
1) The ball hits the ground when the height, $h$, is equal to 0. So, we need to solve the equation:
   $0 = -4.9t^2 + 25t$
2) Dividing both sides by -4.9, we get:
   $0 = t^2 - \frac{25}{4.9}t$
3) This is a quadratic equation. We can solve it by factoring:
   $0 = t(t - \frac{25}{4.9})$
4) The solutions are $t = 0$ and $t = \frac{25}{4.9}$. The first solution, $t = 0$, corresponds to the initial launch time. The second solution is the time when the ball hits the ground.
5) Calculating $\frac{25}{4.9}$:
   $\frac{25}{4.9} \approx 5.10$
6) Therefore, the ball will hit the ground approximately 5.10 seconds after it is launched.
Among the given choices, 5.0 seconds is the closest to 5.10 seconds.
