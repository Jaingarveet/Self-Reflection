Question: A television with a price of $\$ 300$ is to be purchased with an initial payment of $\$ 60$ and weekly payments of $\$ 30$. Which of the following equations can be used to find the number of weekly payments, $w$, required to complete the purchase, assuming there are no taxes or fees?
Choices:
  A: $300=30 w-60$
  B: $300=30 w$
  C: $300=30 w+60$
  D: $300=60 w-30$
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1) The total cost of the TV is $300.
2) There is an initial payment of $60.
3) After the initial payment, the remaining balance is $300 - $60 = $240.
4) This remaining balance is to be paid off in weekly installments of $30.
So, if we let $w$ represent the number of weekly payments, then:
5) The total amount paid in weekly installments is $30w$.
6) This amount plus the initial payment must equal the total cost of the TV. In other words:
   Initial Payment + Weekly Installments = Total Cost
   $60 + 30w = 300$
This matches the equation in choice C.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
