Question: If $16+4 x$ is 10 more than 14 , what is the value of $8 x$ ?
Choices:
  A: 2
  B: 6
  C: 16
  D: 80 5
## Assistant 2:
Let's solve this step-by-step:
1) The question states that $16+4x$ is 10 more than 14. We can write this as an equation:
   $16+4x = 14+10$
2) Simplify the right side of the equation:
   $16+4x = 24$
3) Subtract 16 from both sides:
   $4x = 8$
4) Divide both sides by 4:
   $x = 2$
5) The question asks for the value of $8x$. We can find this by multiplying our value for $x$ by 8:
   $8x = 8(2) = 16$
Therefore, the correct answer is C: 16.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
