## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: If $a^{2}+b^{2}=z$ and $a b=y$, which of the following is equivalent to $4 z+8 y$ ?
Choices:
  A: $(a+2 b)^{2}$
  B: $(2 a+2 b)^{2}$
  C: $(4 a+4 b)^{2}$
  D: $(4 a+8 b)^{2}$
## Assistant 2:
Let's approach this step-by-step:
1) We are given that $a^{2}+b^{2}=z$ and $a b=y$.
2) We need to find which expression is equivalent to $4z + 8y$.
3) Let's expand each choice:
   A) $(a+2b)^{2} = a^2 + 4ab + 4b^2 = z + 4y + 3b^2$
   
   B) $(2a+2b)^{2} = 4a^2 + 8ab + 4b^2 = 4z + 8y$
   
   C) $(4a+4b)^{2} = 16a^2 + 32ab + 16b^2 = 16z + 32y$
   
   D) $(4a+8b)^{2} = 16a^2 + 64ab + 64b^2 = 16z + 64y + 48b^2$
4) Looking at the expansions, we see that choice B, $(2a+2b)^{2}$, is equivalent to $4z + 8y$.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
