Question: A retail company has 50 large stores located in different areas throughout a state. A researcher for the company believes that employee job satisfaction varies greatly from store to store. Which of the following sampling methods is most appropriate to estimate the proportion of all employees of the company who are satisfied with their job?
Choices:
  A: Selecting one of the 50 stores at random and then surveying each employee at that store
  B: Selecting 10 employees from each store at random and then surveying each employee selected
  C: Surveying the 25 highest-paid employees and the 25 lowest-paid employees
  D: Creating a website on which employees can express their opinions and then using the first 50 responses
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1) The goal is to estimate the proportion of all employees who are satisfied with their job. This means we need a sample that is representative of all employees.
2) Option A (selecting one store at random) is not ideal because employee satisfaction may vary significantly from store to store. The selected store may not be representative of all stores.
3) Option C (surveying the highest and lowest paid employees) is biased. It only considers the extremes and ignores the majority of employees in the middle.
4) Option D (using a website) is prone to self-selection bias. Only employees who feel strongly (either positively or negatively) may respond.
5) Option B (selecting 10 employees from each store at random) ensures that all stores are represented, and by selecting employees randomly within each store, it helps ensure a representative sample from each store.
Therefore, option B is the most appropriate sampling method.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
