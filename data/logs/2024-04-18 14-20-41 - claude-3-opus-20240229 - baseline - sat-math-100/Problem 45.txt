Question: Shipping Charges\begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}\hline$\begin{array}{c}\text { Merchandise weight } \\ \text { (pounds) }\end{array}$ & $\begin{array}{c}\text { Shipping } \\ \text { charge }\end{array}$ \\\hline5 & $\$ 16.94$ \\\hline10 & $\$ 21.89$ \\\hline20 & $\$ 31.79$ \\\hline40 & $\$ 51.59$ \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}The table above shows shipping charges for an online retailer that sells sporting goods. There is a linear relationship between the shipping charge and the weight of the merchandise. Which function can be used to determine the total shipping charge $f(x)$, in dollars, for an order with a merchandise weight of $x$ pounds?
Choices:
  A: $f(x)=0.99 x$
  B: $f(x)=0.99 x+11.99$
  C: $f(x)=3.39 x$
  D: $f(x)=3.39 x+16.94$
## Assistant 2:
Let's approach this step-by-step:
1) We're told there's a linear relationship between the shipping charge and the weight. This means the function will be of the form $f(x) = mx + b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept.
2) To find the slope, let's choose two points from the table. Let's use (5, 16.94) and (10, 21.89).
   Slope = $\frac{change\text{ }in\text{ }y}{change\text{ }in\text{ }x} = \frac{21.89 - 16.94}{10 - 5} = \frac{4.95}{5} = 0.99$
   So, $m = 0.99$.
3) Now that we have the slope, we can use any point to find the y-intercept. Let's use (5, 16.94).
   $16.94 = 0.99(5) + b$
   $16.94 = 4.95 + b$
   $b = 16.94 - 4.95 = 11.99$
4) Therefore, the function is $f(x) = 0.99x + 11.99$.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
