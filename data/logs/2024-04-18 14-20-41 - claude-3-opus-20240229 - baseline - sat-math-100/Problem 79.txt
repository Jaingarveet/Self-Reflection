## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: A helicopter, initially hovering 40 feet above the ground, begins to gain altitude at a rate of 21 feet per second. Which of the following functions represents the helicopter's altitude above the ground $y$, in feet, $t$ seconds after the helicopter begins to gain altitude?
Choices:
  A: $y=40+21$
  B: $y=40+21 t$
  C: $y=40-21 t$
  D: $y=40 t+21$
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1) The helicopter starts at an altitude of 40 feet. This is the initial value or y-intercept of the function.
2) The helicopter gains altitude at a rate of 21 feet per second. This is the rate of change or slope of the function.
3) In a linear function, the variable t (time in seconds) is multiplied by the rate of change.
4) The general form of a linear function is y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept.
5) Substituting the values we know:
   - y-intercept (b) = 40
   - slope (m) = 21
   - x variable is t
6) This gives us the function: y = 21t + 40
Looking at the choices, the function that matches this is choice B.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
