## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: Keith modeled the growth over several hundred years of a tree population by estimating the number of the trees' pollen grains per square centimeter that were deposited each year within layers of a lake's sediment. He estimated there were 310 pollen grains per square centimeter the first year the grains were deposited, with a $1 \%$ annual increase in the number of grains per square centimeter thereafter. Which of the following functions models $P(t)$, the number of pollen grains per square centimeter $t$ years after the first year the grains were deposited?
Choices:
  A: $P(t)=310^{t}$
  B: $P(t)=310^{1.01 t}$
  C: $P(t)=310(0.99)^{t}$
  D: $P(t)=310(1.01)^{t}$
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1) We're told that there were 310 pollen grains per square centimeter in the first year. This means that when $t = 0$, $P(0) = 310$. This eliminates choices A and B, as they would give $P(0) = 1$.
2) We're also told that there is a 1% annual increase in the number of grains per square centimeter. This means that each year, the number of grains is multiplied by 1.01 (because a 1% increase means multiplying by 1 + 0.01 = 1.01).
3) Choice C suggests that each year, the number of grains is multiplied by 0.99. This would represent a 1% decrease each year, not a 1% increase, so this choice is incorrect.
4) Choice D correctly models the situation. It starts with 310 grains in the first year (when $t = 0$), and then multiplies by 1.01 raised to the power of $t$ for each subsequent year. This correctly models a 1% annual increase.
Therefore, the correct function is $P(t) = 310(1.01)^t$.
Action: Answer("D")
