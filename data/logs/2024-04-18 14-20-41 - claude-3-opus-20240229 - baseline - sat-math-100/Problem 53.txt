## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:
Topic: Geography
Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: A line in the $x y$-plane passes through the origin and has a slope of $\frac{1}{7}$. Which of the following points lies on the line?
Choices:
  A: $(0,7)$
  B: $(1,7)$
  C: $(7,7)$
  D: $(14,2)$
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1) The line passes through the origin (0,0), so that's one point we know is on the line.
2) The slope of the line is $\frac{1}{7}$. This means that for every 7 units we move horizontally (along the x-axis), we move 1 unit vertically (along the y-axis).
3) Let's check each point:
   A: (0,7) - This point has the same y-coordinate as the slope (7), but it's not on the line because it doesn't follow the slope rule. Moving from (0,0) to (0,7) would be a vertical line, not a line with a slope of $\frac{1}{7}$.
   B: (1,7) - This point doesn't follow the slope rule. Moving from (0,0) to (1,7) would mean moving 1 unit horizontally and 7 units vertically, which is a slope of 7, not $\frac{1}{7}$.
   C: (7,7) - This point also doesn't follow the slope rule. Moving from (0,0) to (7,7) would mean moving 7 units horizontally and 7 units vertically, which is a slope of 1, not $\frac{1}{7}$.
   D: (14,2) - This point does follow the slope rule. Moving from (0,0) to (14,2) means moving 14 units horizontally and 2 units vertically. This is equivalent to moving 7 units horizontally and 1 unit vertically twice, which matches the slope of $\frac{1}{7}$.
4) Therefore, the point that lies on the line is (14,2).
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
