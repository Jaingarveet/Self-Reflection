Question: A painter will paint $n$ walls with the same size and shape in a building using a specific brand of paint. The painter's fee can be calculated by the expression $n K \ell h$, where $n$ is the number of walls, $K$ is a constant with units of dollars per square foot, $\ell$ is the length of each wall in feet, and $h$ is the height of each wall in feet. If the customer asks the painter to use a more expensive brand of paint, which of the factors in the expression would change?
Choices:
  A: $h$
  B: $\ell$
  C: $K$
  D: $n$
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1) The expression $n K \ell h$ calculates the total fee for painting $n$ walls, each with a length of $\ell$ feet and a height of $h$ feet, at a rate of $K$ dollars per square foot.
2) If the customer asks for a more expensive brand of paint, this would affect the cost per square foot of the painting job.
3) In the expression, the factor that represents the cost per square foot is $K$, the constant with units of dollars per square foot.
4) The number of walls ($n$), the length of each wall ($\ell$), and the height of each wall ($h$) would not change based on the brand of paint used.
Therefore, if a more expensive brand of paint is used, the factor that would change in the expression is $K$.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
