## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Topic: Math
Question: $$\sqrt{9 x^{2}}$$If $x>0$, which of the following is equivalent to the given expression?
Choices:
  A: $3 x$
  B: $3 x^{2}$
  C: $18 x$
  D: $18 x^{4}$
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1) The given expression is $\sqrt{9x^2}$.
2) We know that $\sqrt{a^2} = |a|$ for any real number $a$. Here, $a = 3x$.
3) Since we're told that $x > 0$, we know that $3x > 0$ as well. 
4) When $a > 0$, $|a| = a$. So in this case, since $3x > 0$, $|3x| = 3x$.
5) Therefore, $\sqrt{9x^2} = |3x| = 3x$ when $x > 0$.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
