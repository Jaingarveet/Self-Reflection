## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1. Find the number of juniors inducted into the National Honor Society:
   - 7% of 562 juniors
   - 0.07 × 562 = 39.34 juniors
2. Find the number of seniors inducted into the National Honor Society:
   - 5% of 602 seniors
   - 0.05 × 602 = 30.1 seniors
3. Add the number of inducted juniors and seniors:
   - 39.34 + 30.1 = 69.44 total students
4. Round 69.44 to the nearest whole number:
   - 69.44 rounds to 69
Looking at the choices, the closest number to 69 is choice B, which is 69.
Action: Answer("B")
