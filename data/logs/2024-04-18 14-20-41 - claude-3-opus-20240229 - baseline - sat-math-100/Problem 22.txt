Question: The average number of students per classroom at Central High School from 2000 to 2010 can be modeled by the equation $y=0.56 x+27.2$, where $x$ represents the number of years since 2000 , and $y$ represents the average number of students per classroom. Which of the following best describes the meaning of the number 0.56 in the equation?
Choices:
  A: The total number of students at the school in 2000
  B: The average number of students per classroom in 2000
  C: The estimated increase in the average number of students per classroom each year
  D: The estimated difference between the average number of students per classroom in 2010 and in 2000
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1) The equation is in the form $y = mx + b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept.
2) The slope $m$ represents the rate of change of $y$ (average number of students per classroom) with respect to $x$ (number of years since 2000).
3) The y-intercept $b$ represents the value of $y$ when $x = 0$, i.e., the average number of students per classroom in the year 2000.
4) In the given equation, the slope is 0.56. This means that the average number of students per classroom is increasing by 0.56 each year.
5) The y-intercept is 27.2, which means that the average number of students per classroom in 2000 was 27.2.
Therefore, the number 0.56 in the equation represents the estimated increase in the average number of students per classroom each year.
Action: Answer("C")
