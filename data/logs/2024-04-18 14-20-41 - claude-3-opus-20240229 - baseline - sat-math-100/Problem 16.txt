## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: The line $y=k x+4$, where $k$ is a constant, is graphed in the $x y$-plane. If the line contains the point $(c, d)$, where $c \neq 0$ and $d \neq 0$, what is the slope of the line in terms of $c$ and $d$ ?
Choices:
  A: $\frac{d-4}{c}$
  B: $\frac{c-4}{d}$
  C: $\frac{4-d}{c}$
  D: $\frac{4-c}{d}$
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1) The general equation of a line is $y = mx + b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept.
2) Comparing this to the given equation $y = kx + 4$, we see that $k$ is the slope and 4 is the y-intercept.
3) We are told that the line contains the point $(c, d)$. This means that the coordinates $(c, d)$ satisfy the equation of the line. Let's substitute:
   $d = kc + 4$
4) Now we can solve for $k$, which is the slope:
   $d - 4 = kc$
   $k = \frac{d - 4}{c}$
5) Therefore, the slope of the line in terms of $c$ and $d$ is $\frac{d - 4}{c}$.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
