## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: $$\begin{aligned}& y<-x+a \\& y>x+b\end{aligned}$$In the $x y$-plane, if $(0,0)$ is a solution to the system of inequalities above, which of the following relationships between $a$ and $b$ must be true?
Choices:
  A: $a>b$
  B: $b>a$
  C: $|a|>|b|$
  D: $a=-b$
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1) If (0,0) is a solution to the system, it must satisfy both inequalities. Let's substitute x=0 and y=0 into each inequality:
   From $y < -x + a$, we get: $0 < -0 + a$, which simplifies to $0 < a$.
   From $y > x + b$, we get: $0 > 0 + b$, which simplifies to $0 > b$.
2) So, for (0,0) to be a solution, we must have $a > 0$ and $b < 0$.
3) Now, let's look at the answer choices:
   A: $a > b$. This is true, because $a$ is positive and $b$ is negative.
   B: $b > a$. This is false, because $b$ is negative and $a$ is positive.
   C: $|a| > |b|$. We don't have enough information to determine this. The inequalities only tell us about the signs of $a$ and $b$, not their magnitudes.
   D: $a = -b$. This could be true, but it's not necessarily true. For example, $a = 1$ and $b = -2$ would satisfy the conditions, but $a \neq -b$ in this case.
4) Therefore, the only statement that must be true is A: $a > b$.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
