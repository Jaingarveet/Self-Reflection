## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")

Choices:
  A: 6
  B: 7
  C: 8
  D: 9
  E: 10

## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:**
My initial approach was correct in identifying U as the midpoint of ST and calculating the length of SU as 11. However, I made a crucial error in adding the lengths of RS and SU to find RU. Since U is the midpoint, the length of RU is actually half the length of ST, not the sum of RS and SU.
**Error Keywords:**
* Misinterpretation of midpoint concept
* Addition instead of division for midpoint calculation
* Failure to consider midpoint property in final calculation
**Solution:**
1. Identify U as the midpoint of ST.
2. Calculate the length of SU as half the length of ST: 22 / 2 = 11.
3. Recognize that RU is half the length of ST due to U being the midpoint.
4. Calculate the length of RU: 22 / 2 = 11.
**Instructions for Future:**
1. Carefully read and understand the definition of midpoint.
2. Remember that the midpoint divides a line segment into two segments of equal length.
3. When dealing with midpoints, focus on division rather than addition to find lengths of related segments.
4. Double-check calculations and interpretations to ensure they align with the problem's context.
**General Advice:**
* Visualize the problem using diagrams or sketches.
* Break down complex problems into smaller, manageable steps.
* Apply relevant formulas and properties accurately.
* Pay close attention to keywords and specific details in the problem statement.
* Don't rush; take your time to think through each step logically.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
U is the midpoint of line segment ST, so the length of line segment RU is half the length of line segment ST.
The length of line segment ST is 22.
Therefore, the length of line segment RU is 22 / 2 = 11.
Action: Answer("E")
