Topic: Law
Context: Economics professor: Marty's Pizza and Checkers Pizza are the two major pizza parlors in our town. Marty's sold coupon books including coupons good for one large plain pizza at any local pizza parlor, at Marty's expense. But Checkers refused to accept these coupons, even though they were redeemed by all other local pizza parlors. Accepting them would have cost Checkers nothing and would have satisfied those of its potential customers who had purchased the coupon books. This shows that Checkers's motive in refusing to accept the coupons was simply to hurt Marty's Pizza.
Question: Which one of the following, if assumed, enables the economics professor's conclusion to be properly drawn?
Choices:
  A: Any company that refuses to accept coupons issued by a competitor when doing so would satisfy some of the company's potential customers is motivated solely by the desire to hurt that competitor.
  B: Any company that wishes to hurt a competitor by refusing to accept coupons issued by that competitor will refuse to accept them even when accepting them would cost nothing and would satisfy its potential customers.
  C: At least one company has refused to accept coupons issued by its major local competitor simply in order to hurt that competitor, even though those coupons were accepted by all other local competitors.
  D: Any company that accepts its major competitor's coupons helps its competitor by doing so, even if it also satisfies its own actual or potential customers.
  E: If accepting coupons issued by a competitor would not enable a company to satisfy its actual or potential customers, then that company's refusal to accept the coupons is motivated by the desire to satisfy customers.

## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
I incorrectly identified option C as the correct answer because I focused solely on the specific scenario presented in the context, rather than considering the broader principle being tested. While option C does describe a situation where a company refuses competitor coupons to harm the competitor, it doesn't establish a general rule like option A does.
## Error Keywords
* **Overgeneralization:** Applying a specific observation to a broader context without sufficient justification.
* **Limited Scope:** Failing to consider the full range of possibilities or principles involved in the question.
* **Misinterpretation:** Incorrectly understanding the meaning or intent of the question or answer choices.
## Solution Steps
1. **Identify the principle being tested:** The question asks which assumption enables the professor's conclusion to be **properly drawn**. This implies a general rule rather than a specific instance.
2. **Analyze each answer choice:** Evaluate each option based on its ability to establish a general principle that supports the professor's conclusion.
3. **Choose the most comprehensive and applicable option:** Option A provides the most encompassing rule, stating that any company refusing competitor coupons to satisfy customers is motivated by harming the competitor. This aligns with the professor's claim about Checkers's motive.
## Instructions for Future Success
1. **Focus on principles:** When encountering legal reasoning questions, prioritize identifying the underlying legal principle or rule being tested.
2. **Evaluate answer choices comprehensively:** Analyze each option in relation to the principle, considering its scope, applicability, and logical consistency.
3. **Beware of overgeneralization:** Avoid drawing broad conclusions based on limited information or specific scenarios.
4. **Consider alternative interpretations:** Explore different ways to interpret the question and answer choices to ensure a thorough understanding.
## General Advice for Similar Problems
* **Read carefully and identify key issues:** Pay close attention to the wording of the question and identify the specific legal concepts or principles being tested.
* **Break down complex arguments:** Divide complex legal arguments into smaller, more manageable components to analyze them effectively.
* **Apply relevant legal rules and principles:** Utilize your knowledge of legal rules and principles to evaluate the answer choices and identify the most appropriate response.
* **Support your reasoning with evidence:** Provide clear and concise explanations for your chosen answer, referencing relevant legal sources or principles.
* **Practice and seek feedback:** Regularly engage with legal reasoning questions and seek feedback from experts or peers to improve your understanding and application of legal concepts.
