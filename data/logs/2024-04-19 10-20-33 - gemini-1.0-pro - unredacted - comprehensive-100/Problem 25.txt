Context: A shopping center has exactly seven spaces—space 1 through space 7—arranged in a straight row. Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space.

## Explanation of Incorrect Answer:
My initial analysis was correct in identifying the constraints and potential arrangements. However, I made a mistake in assuming that the two possible arrangements were the only ones that satisfied all the constraints. I overlooked the possibility that the restaurants could be placed in spaces 1 and 7, which would allow the pharmacy to be next to the optometrist in space 2 and the veterinarian in space 6.
## Error Keywords:
* Incomplete analysis
* Overlooking possibilities
* Misinterpretation of constraints
## Solution:
1. Identify the constraints:
    * Pharmacy at one end (space 1 or 7)
    * Restaurants separated by at least two businesses
    * Pharmacy next to optometrist or veterinarian
    * Toy store not next to veterinarian
2. Analyze possible arrangements:
    * Pharmacy in space 1:
        * Veterinarian in space 2, Optometrist in space 6, Restaurants in spaces 3, 4, 5 (satisfies constraints)
    * Pharmacy in space 7:
        * Veterinarian in space 6, Optometrist in space 2, Restaurants in spaces 3, 4, 5 (satisfies constraints)
    * Pharmacy in space 1:
        * Veterinarian in space 6, Optometrist in space 2, Restaurants in spaces 7 and 3 (satisfies constraints)
    * Pharmacy in space 7:
        * Veterinarian in space 2, Optometrist in space 6, Restaurants in spaces 1 and 5 (satisfies constraints)
3. Identify the correct answer:
    * The only arrangement that satisfies all constraints is:
        **Restaurant, Optometrist, Toy Store, Restaurant, Shoe Store, Veterinarian, Pharmacy**
## Instructions for Future Problems:
1. Carefully read and understand all constraints.
2. Systematically analyze all possible arrangements that satisfy the constraints.
3. Do not make assumptions or jump to conclusions.
4. Double-check your analysis and reasoning.
5. Consider alternative solutions and possibilities.
## General Advice for Similar Problems:
* Break down complex problems into smaller, manageable steps.
* Use diagrams or visual aids to represent the problem and potential solutions.
* Test your solutions against all constraints to ensure they are valid.
* Be methodical and thorough in your analysis.
* Don't be afraid to revise your approach if you encounter difficulties.
