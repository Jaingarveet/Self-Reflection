# Model: gemini-1.0-pro | Agent: unredacted | Exam: comprehensive-100 | Problem 98 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Medicine.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:
Topic: Geography
Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Medicine
Subtopic: Biochemistry
Question: Aminoacyl t-RNA is not require for ?
Choices:
  A: Proline
  B: Lysine
  C: Hydroxylysine
  D: Methionine
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that aminoacyl t-RNA is required for all amino acids to be incorporated into proteins. However, hydroxylysine is an exception. It is formed by post-translational modification of lysine, not by direct translation from mRNA.
Error Keywords:
- Overgeneralization
- Incomplete knowledge
- Exception not considered
Solution:
1. Identify the amino acid in question.
2. Determine if the amino acid is directly translated from mRNA or formed by post-translational modification.
3. If the amino acid is directly translated from mRNA, then aminoacyl t-RNA is required.
4. If the amino acid is formed by post-translational modification, then aminoacyl t-RNA is not required.
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and identify the amino acid in question.
2. Recall your knowledge of amino acid biosynthesis and post-translational modifications.
3. Determine if the amino acid is directly translated from mRNA or formed by post-translational modification.
4. If the amino acid is directly translated from mRNA, choose the answer that indicates aminoacyl t-RNA is required.
5. If the amino acid is formed by post-translational modification, choose the answer that indicates aminoacyl t-RNA is not required.
6. Double-check your answer to ensure it aligns with your reasoning.
Advice:
- Be aware of exceptions to general rules.
- Maintain a comprehensive understanding of biochemical pathways and modifications.
- Carefully consider all answer choices before making a selection.
- If unsure, research the specific amino acid or pathway to clarify its requirements.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Hydroxylysine is formed by post-translational modification of lysine, not by direct translation from mRNA.
Therefore, aminoacyl t-RNA is not required for hydroxylysine.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
