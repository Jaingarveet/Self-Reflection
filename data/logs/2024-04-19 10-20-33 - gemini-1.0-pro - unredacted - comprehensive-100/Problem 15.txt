Context: A rare and endangered animal of the northern salamander in Xinjiang.It was first discovered by a Russian explorer in 1840, but disappeared for more than 100 years.It was rediscovered in Hot Spring County, Xinjiang in 1898.But the data shows that in the 15 years since 1898, the number of northern salamanders in Xinjiang has been reduced by half.Some experts believe that the habitat of the northern salamander in Xinjiang was originally a local pasture, and the cattle and sheep walking around on the grassland in summer will trample them to death, resulting in a sharp decline in their numbers.

Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that the experts' opinion was the only valid explanation for the decline in the northern salamander population. 
I failed to consider alternative explanations and their potential impact on the experts' opinion.
Error Keywords:
 - Confirmation bias
 - Overlooking alternative explanations
 - Ignoring contradictory evidence
Solution:
The experts believe that the decline in the northern salamander population is due to the trampling of cattle and sheep.
Statement B suggests that the decline in rainfall and groundwater levels may have affected the water source environment of the northern salamander.
This alternative explanation contradicts the experts' opinion and raises doubts about its validity.
Instructions:
1. Identify the experts' opinion and the evidence supporting it.
2. Consider alternative explanations for the observed phenomenon.
3. Evaluate the evidence supporting each explanation.
4. Identify statements that contradict the experts' opinion or provide evidence for alternative explanations.
5. Choose the statement that raises the most doubts about the experts' opinion.
Advice:
 - Be aware of confirmation bias and the tendency to favor evidence that supports your existing beliefs.
 - Actively seek out and consider alternative explanations.
 - Evaluate the evidence for each explanation objectively.
 - Be open to revising your opinion based on new evidence.
 - Remember that correlation does not imply causation.
