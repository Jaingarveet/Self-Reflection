## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Let's analyze each choice:
A: No Russian novels and exactly one play are selected. This is possible because we can select 4 French works (3 novels and 1 play) and 1 Russian play.
B: Exactly one Russian novel and both French plays are selected. This is possible because we can select 3 French novels, 1 Russian novel, and 2 French plays.
C: Exactly two French novels and the Russian play are selected. This is possible because we can select 2 French novels, 2 Russian novels, and the Russian play.
D: Exactly two French novels and exactly two plays are selected. This is possible because we can select 2 French novels, 2 Russian novels, and 2 French plays.
E: Exactly two Russian novels and exactly one play are selected. This violates the requirement of selecting at least three novels because we would only be selecting two Russian novels and no French novels.
