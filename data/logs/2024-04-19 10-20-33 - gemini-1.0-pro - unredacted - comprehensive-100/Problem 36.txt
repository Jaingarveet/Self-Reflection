Context: Editorial: Painting involves a sequential application of layers, each of which adheres satisfactorily only if the underlying layer has been properly applied. Education is, in this respect, like the craft of painting. Since the most important steps in painting are preparation of the surface to be painted and application of the primer coat, it makes sense to suppose that .
Question: Which one of the following most logically completes the editorial's argument?
Choices:
  A: in the educator's initial contact with a student, the educator should be as undemanding as possible
  B: students who have a secure grasp of the fundamentals of a subject are likely to make progress in that subject
  C: educators who are not achieving the goals they intended should revise their teaching methods
  D: teaching new students is rewarding but much more difficult than teaching more advanced students
  E: the success of a student's overall educational experience depends above all upon that student's initial educational experience

## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:**
My initial reasoning was partially correct in recognizing the importance of a strong foundation in education. However, I failed to fully grasp the analogy between painting and education presented in the editorial. The editorial emphasizes the sequential nature of learning, where each subsequent layer of knowledge builds upon the previous one. Therefore, the most crucial stage is not simply laying a strong foundation, but ensuring that the initial educational experience sets the stage for successful learning throughout the student's journey.
**Error Keywords:**
* Incomplete analogy analysis
* Misinterpretation of editorial's central argument
* Overemphasis on foundational knowledge at the expense of overall educational experience
**Solution:**
1. **Revisit the analogy:** Re-read the editorial, paying close attention to how the painting process parallels the educational experience. 
2. **Identify the key parallel:** Recognize that the editorial emphasizes the sequential nature of learning, where each layer of knowledge builds upon the previous one.
3. **Connect the analogy to the answer choices:** Analyze how each answer choice aligns with the identified parallel.
4. **Choose the most logically aligned answer:** Select the answer that best reflects the importance of the initial educational experience in shaping the student's overall learning journey.
**Instructions for Future Success:**
1. **Thoroughly analyze analogies:** When encountering analogies, carefully examine how the comparison is constructed and what aspects of the source domain are relevant to the target domain.
2. **Identify the central argument:** Pay close attention to the author's main point and how the supporting arguments contribute to it.
3. **Evaluate answer choices based on the central argument:** Analyze how each answer choice aligns with the central argument and the overall logic of the passage.
4. **Consider the broader context:** Think about how the question and answer choices fit within the larger context of the text or subject matter.
**General Advice for Similar Problems:**
* **Read actively and critically:** Engage with the text, questioning assumptions and identifying the author's purpose.
* **Break down complex arguments:** Divide complex arguments into smaller, more manageable components.
* **Identify key concepts and relationships:** Pay attention to how different ideas connect and support each other.
* **Consider alternative perspectives:** Think about different interpretations of the text and potential counterarguments.
* **Practice applying these strategies:** Regularly engage with challenging texts and questions to hone your analytical skills.
