## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:**
My initial solution involved multiplying the map distance (20 inches) by the scale (10 miles/inch), resulting in an incorrect answer of 200 miles. The error stemmed from misinterpreting the scale as a direct conversion factor instead of a ratio.
**Error Keywords:**
* Misinterpretation of scale
* Ratio error
* Unit conversion error
**Correct Solution:**
1. **Identify the scale:** 1/4 inch represents 10 miles.
2. **Convert map distance to actual distance:** 20 inches * (10 miles/ 1/4 inch) = 800 miles.
**Detailed Instructions:**
1. Read the problem carefully and identify the given information: map distance and scale.
2. Understand the scale as a ratio, not a direct conversion factor.
3. Set up a proportion to convert map distance to actual distance: (map distance) / (scale) = (actual distance) / 1.
4. Solve the proportion for the actual distance.
5. Double-check the units and calculations.
**General Advice:**
* Pay close attention to the units involved in the problem.
* Interpret the scale correctly as a ratio, not a direct conversion factor.
* Set up proportions to convert between different units.
* Double-check calculations and units before submitting the answer.
**Additional Notes:**
* In this specific problem, the answer choices were far apart, making it easier to identify the significant error in my initial calculation.
* Practicing with similar problems and focusing on understanding the underlying concepts can help prevent such errors in the future.
