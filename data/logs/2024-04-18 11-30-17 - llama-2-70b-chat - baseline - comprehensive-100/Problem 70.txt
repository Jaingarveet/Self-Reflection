Question: In 2015 the populations of City $\mathrm{X}$ and City $\mathrm{Y}$ were equal. From 2010 to 2015, the population of City X increased by $20 \%$ and the population of City $\mathrm{Y}$ decreased by $10 \%$. If the population of City $\mathrm{X}$ was 120,000 in 2010, what was the population of City Y in 2010 ?
Choices:
  A: 60,000
  B: 90,000
  C: 160,000
  D: 240,000
## Assistant 2:
  Let's call the population of City X "X" and the population of City Y "Y".
We know that X + Y = 120,000 (since the populations are equal)
We also know that X increased by 20% and Y decreased by 10%
X + Y = 120,000 ... (1) (the populations are equal)
X = 120,000 + (20% of 120,000)
X = 120,000 + 24,000
X = 144,000 ... (2) (population of City X in 2015)
Y = 120,000 - (10% of 120,000)
Y = 120,000 - 12,000
Y = 108,000 ... (3) (population of City Y in 2015)
Now we can substitute the values we found into equation (1):
144,000 + 108,000 = 120,000
252,000 = 120,000

So, the population of City Y in 2010 was 90,000.
