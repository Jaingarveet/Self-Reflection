Question: A sales person gets a 10% commission on each sale he makes. How many sales of $250 each must he make in order to reach a salary of at least $1000?
Choices:
  A: 15
  B: 24
  C: 25
  D: 40
  E: 52
## Assistant 2:
  Let X be the number of sales made.
The total amount of sales made is 250X.
The total commission earned is 10% of 250X = 25X.
The total salary earned is 25X + 1000.

We want to find X such that 25X + 1000 ≥ 1000.

25X ≥ 0

X ≥ 0

Since X is a whole number, X ≥ 1.

Therefore, the salesperson must make at least 1 sale of $250 to reach a salary of at least $1000.

Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
