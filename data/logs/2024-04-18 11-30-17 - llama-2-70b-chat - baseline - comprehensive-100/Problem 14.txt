(1) The two floors of the human resources department and the sales department are not adjacent; (2) The finance department is on the next floor of the planning department; (3) The floor of the administrative department is above the planning department, but in the manpower Below the Resources Department.

  B: The sales department is one level above the administrative department
  C: The sales department is at the next level of the planning department
  D: Sales Department is on the second floor
## Assistant 2:
  Thought: 
We can start by noting that the human resources department is not on the top floor, so it must be on a lower floor.
We know that the finance department is on the next floor of the planning department, so the planning department must be on the second floor, and the finance department must be on the third floor.
We also know that the administrative department is above the planning department but below the human resources department, so it must be on the fourth floor.
We also know that the two floors of the human resources department and the sales department are not adjacent, so the sales department cannot be on the second floor (directly below the human resources department).
With this information, we can conclude that the sales department must be on the fifth floor, directly above the administrative department.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
