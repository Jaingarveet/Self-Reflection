[header] How to avoid atm fees [title] Learn locations of atms associated with your bank. [step] If you want to avoid atm fees, the easiest way to do so is to use an atm associated with your bank. If you have a nationwide bank, such as chase bank or bank of america, you can find atms across the country.

  D: This is a good way to avoid atm fees. [substeps] Las vegas banks are located in las vegas.
## Assistant 2:
  Answer: B

Explanation:
The text suggests that the best way to avoid ATM fees is to use an ATM associated with your bank. Therefore, the most likely completion to the text would be option B, which suggests trying to learn where ATMs associated with your bank are located. This is a practical and effective way to avoid ATM fees, as it allows you to use an ATM that is part of your bank's network without having to pay a fee.

Option A is not a good completion to the text, as it is not related to the topic of avoiding ATM fees. Option C is also not relevant, as it mentions ATMs being open during the evening, but does not provide any information about how to avoid ATM fees. Option D is not a good completion, as it simply states that using an ATM associated with your bank is a good way to avoid ATM fees, without providing any additional information or advice.
## Result:
Agent Answer: None
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
