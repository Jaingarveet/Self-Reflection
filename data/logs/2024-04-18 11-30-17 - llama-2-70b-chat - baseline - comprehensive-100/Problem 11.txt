Context: In recent years, China's housing prices have risen rapidly.In the fourth quarter of 2004, various government departments issued a number of measures to suppress the excessively rapid growth of housing prices, but national housing prices continued to rise in the first quarter of 2005.It was asserted that rising land prices are the chief culprit in soaring housing prices.
Question: Which of the following, if true, is the most doubtful of an assertion?
Choices:
  A: Shanghai's housing prices in the first quarter of 2005 increased by 19.1% over the same period last year, and land prices rose by 6.53%.
  B: Residential prices in Beijing increased by 7.2% in the first quarter of 2005 compared with the same period last year, and residential land prices rose by 0.37%.
  C: The chairman of Huayuan Real Estate believes that as land development costs increase, house prices will definitely increase.
  D: The chairman of Yongtai Development Company said? "The skyrocketing housing prices are because supply has not kept up with demand."
## Assistant 2:
  Answer: "C"

Explanation:
The assertion in choice C, "The chairman of Huayuan Real Estate believes that as land development costs increase, house prices will definitely increase," is the most doubtful. This is because it is a subjective opinion and not necessarily based on objective evidence. The chairman's belief may not accurately reflect the relationship between land development costs and housing prices.

On the other hand, choices A, B, and D provide more objective information that is supported by data. Choice A provides data on the increase in housing and land prices in Shanghai, while choice B provides data on the increase in housing and land prices in Beijing. Choice D is a statement from the chairman of Yongtai Development Company, which suggests that the high demand for housing is a factor in rising housing prices. These statements are more reliable than the subjective opinion in choice C.
## Result:
Agent Answer: None
