## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: The first year Eleanor organized a fund-raising event, she invited 30 people. For each of the next 5 years, she invited double the number of people she had invited the previous year. If $f(n)$ is the number of people invited to the fund-raiser $n$ years after Eleanor began organizing the event, which of the following statements best describes the function $f$ ?
Choices:
  A: The function $f$ is a decreasing linear function.
  B: The function $f$ is an increasing linear function.
  C: The function $f$ is a decreasing exponential function.
  D: The function $f$ is an increasing exponential function.
## Assistant 2:
  Let's break this down step by step:

The first year, Eleanor invited 30 people.
In the second year, she invited double the number of people she had invited the previous year, which is 2 x 30 = 60 people.
In the third year, she invited double the number of people she had invited the previous year, which is 2 x 60 = 120 people.
This pattern continues, with the number of people invited in year $n$ being 2 x the number of people invited in year $n-1$.

The formula for this pattern is:
f(n) = 2^n \* 30

Since 2^n is a growing exponential function, the function f(n) is also a growing exponential function.

Therefore, the best description of the function f(n) is:

D: The function f(n) is an increasing exponential function.

Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
