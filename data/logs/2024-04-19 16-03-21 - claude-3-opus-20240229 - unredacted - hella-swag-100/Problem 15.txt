Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that the text was describing the process of making lemonade. While the first two sentences could be part of making lemonade, I jumped to conclusions without considering the full context provided in the answer choices. I failed to recognize that this was likely describing a video or film scene rather than a real-life process.
Error Keywords:
 - Assumption error
 - Lack of context consideration
 - Premature conclusion
 - Misinterpretation of question
Solution:
The text describes:
1. Steaming hot water being poured over lemons in glasses
2. The glasses being stirred with a stirring rod
3. The glasses...
Looking at the answer choices, only A makes sense to complete the third sentence in the context of a video or film scene:
"are seen set on the table and are slowly panned over from right to left."
The other choices do not logically complete the sentence or fit the context.
Instructions:
1. Read the entire question carefully, including all answer choices.
2. Identify keywords and context clues in the question text.
3. Consider each answer choice in the context of the question.
4. Eliminate answer choices that do not logically complete the given text.
5. Select the answer choice that provides the most likely and coherent completion.
6. Re-read the completed text with your selected answer to ensure it makes sense.
Advice:
 - Always read the full question and all answer choices before making a decision.
 - Pay attention to context clues and consider the broader scenario, not just the immediate text.
 - Don't make assumptions or jump to conclusions without considering all the information provided.
 - Eliminate answer choices that don't fit logically or grammatically with the given text.
 - If the question seems to be describing a scene or process, visualize it in your mind to better understand the context.
