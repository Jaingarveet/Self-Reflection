## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Topic: Math
Question: $$m=\frac{\left(\frac{r}{1,200}\right)\left(1+\frac{r}{1,200}\right)^{N}}{\left(1+\frac{r}{1,200}\right)^{N}-1} P$$The formula above gives the monthly payment $m$ needed to pay off a loan of $P$ dollars at $r$ percent annual interest over $N$ months. Which of the following gives $P$ in terms of $m, r$, and $N$ ?
Choices:
  A: $P=\frac{\left(\frac{r}{1,200}\right)\left(1+\frac{r}{1,200}\right)^{N}}{\left(1+\frac{r}{1,200}\right)^{N}-1} m$
  B: $P=\frac{\left(1+\frac{r}{1,200}\right)^{N}-1}{\left(\frac{r}{1,200}\right)\left(1+\frac{r}{1,200}\right)^{N}} m$
  C: $P=\left(\frac{r}{1,200}\right) m$
  D: $P=\left(\frac{1,200}{r}\right) m$

## Assistant 2:
  Reflection:

I previously answered this question incorrectly by selecting choice C, which is not the correct solution. Upon reflecting on my mistake, I realized that the formula given in the question can be simplified to:

$$P = \frac{\left(\frac{r}{1,200}\right)\left(1+\frac{r}{1,200}\right)^{N}}{\left(1+\frac{r}{1,200}\right)^{N}-1} m$$

Therefore, the correct answer is choice A: $P = \frac{\left(\frac{r}{1,200}\right)\left(1+\frac{r}{1,200}\right)^{N}}{\left(1+\frac{r}{1,200}\right)^{N}-1} m$.

Advice: When solving problems, it is essential to carefully read and understand the given information, including the formula and the variables involved. In this case, I mistakenly simplified the formula too early, which led to my incorrect answer. It is important to work through the problem step-by-step and not to skip any important steps.
