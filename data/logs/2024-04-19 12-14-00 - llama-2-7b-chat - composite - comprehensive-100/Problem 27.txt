  C: a 2-day website target
  D: a 3-day voicemail target
  E: a 3-day website target

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I realized that I made a mistake in my solution. Here is my reflection:

Error Keywords:

* I misunderstood the condition that Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
* I overlooked the fact that Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.

Solution:

To solve the problem, I will re-evaluate the conditions and use the correct information to determine the answer.

The correct answer is (B) a 2-day voicemail target. None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target, and Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Therefore, it is not possible to set a 2-day voicemail target for more than one client.

Advice:

When solving a problem, it is essential to carefully evaluate the conditions and constraints given in the problem statement. It is also important to reflect on any mistakes made in the previous attempt and use that information to improve the solution.
