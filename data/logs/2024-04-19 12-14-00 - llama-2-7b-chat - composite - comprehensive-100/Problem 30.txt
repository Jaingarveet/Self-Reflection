Solution:
Let's re-analyze the given conditions:

4. O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so O must be on the top shelf or the middle shelf.
5. F is placed on the same shelf as M, so M must be on the bottom shelf.

Now, let's consider the possible combinations of books on the middle shelf:

[REDACTED]. [REDACTED]: This combination is possible only if G is placed on the top shelf.
[REDACTED]. [REDACTED]: This combination is possible only if G is placed on the bottom shelf.
