[header] How to remove pen ink stains from a silk dress
[title] Blot the stain with paper towel.
[step] Treating the ink stain immediately will make removing the stain much easier. If the ink stain is recent and hasn't set into the material, blot the ink stain with a cloth or paper towel before using any cleaning method.

Choices:

A: [substeps] The ink stain is shallow and should be gradually removed. Blotting towels and paper towels will not get the ink stain out.

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I reflected on the problem, my solution, and the correct answer. I realized that blotting the stain with a paper towel will not remove the ink stain, but it will prevent the ink from collecting and making the stain easier to remove. The correct answer is (B) Place a first-aid kit inside a size-appropriate bag. If ink stain removers are not readily available on shelves, storing the cheap silk dress inside a larger bag or in a bag with an elastic top will help remove the stain.

Advice:
When dealing with ink stains on delicate fabrics, it's essential to act quickly and use the right cleaning methods to prevent the stain from setting in. Blotting the stain with a cloth or paper towel can help remove excess ink and make the stain easier to remove, but it may not completely remove the stain. In such cases, using a first-aid kit or storing the dress in a protective bag can help prevent the stain from spreading and make it easier to remove.
