Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
You have correctly analyzed the information given in the question and arrived at the correct answer. Great job!

Here's a breakdown of your thought process:

1. You recognized that the population of City X increased by 20% from 2010 to 2015, which means the population of City X in 2015 was 144,000 (120,000 x 1.20).
2. You then used this information to calculate the population of City Y in 2010, by recognizing that the population of City Y decreased by 10% from 2010 to 2015. You calculated the population of City Y in 2010 as 108,000 (120,000 x 0.90).
3. You then evaluated the options given and chose the correct answer, which is option [REDACTED]: 108,000.

Well done!
