Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?

[header] How to register a car in Texas without going to Texas [title] Print and fill out form 130-U].

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I realize now that I misunderstood the instructions. I completed the form based on my own assumptions, which led to an incorrect answer. To correctly complete the form, the person registering the car must put their name and address on line 14, and the name and address of the person registering the car for them on line 14a. Additionally, the departure location must be entered on line 17b, and the zip code on line 1b.

Action: Answer("B")

Explanation:
The most likely completion to the text is to put the name and address of the person registering the car for you on line 14a, and the departure location on line 17b. This is the correct way to complete the form and register a car in Texas without having to physically go to Texas.
