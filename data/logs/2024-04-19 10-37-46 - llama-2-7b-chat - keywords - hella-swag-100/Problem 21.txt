[header] How to survive a sexless marriage [title] Accept that you and your spouse have different needs and desires. [step] Whether your sexual needs aren't being met or you're not interested in having sex, acknowledge that your partner's needs are just as valid.

Choices:

A: [substeps] Consider the status of your sexual wants and needs within your marriage. If you see that your spouse has a sexual desire that he's suppressing, respect this fact.

Reflection:

In my previous answer, I incorrectly selected option B, "Recognize that your needs are their own." However, upon further reflection, I realize that the correct answer is option A, "Consider the status of your sexual wants and needs within your marriage." This is because acknowledging and respecting your spouse's sexual desires, even if they are different from your own, is crucial in maintaining a healthy and empathetic relationship. By prioritizing empathy and understanding, you can deepen your bond in nonsexual ways and find ways to compromise and meet each other's needs.
