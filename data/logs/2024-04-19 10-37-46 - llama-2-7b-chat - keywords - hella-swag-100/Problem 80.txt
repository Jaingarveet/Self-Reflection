Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?

[header] How to react when stopped by the police
[title] Ask why you were stopped.
[step] A police officer may stop and temporarily detain you if he suspects you were engaged in illegal activity. This is called a "Terry stop."

Choices:

A: "Under this scenario, the officer can only ask you questions about the particular suspicious activity he observed. Ask the officer why you were stopped so that you know what kinds of questions he is legally permitted to ask you."

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly. Upon reflection, I realized that the correct answer is (A) "Ask why you were stopped." This is because during a Terry stop, the officer is only allowed to ask questions about the specific suspicious activity that led to the stop, and not about any other personal information or activities. By asking why you were stopped, you can understand the legal basis for the stop and the types of questions the officer is allowed to ask you.
