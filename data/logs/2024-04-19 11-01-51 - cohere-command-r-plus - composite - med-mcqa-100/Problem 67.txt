## System:
You are an expert in Medicine.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: Major complication of cyst-gastrostomy for pseudo pancreatic cyst is?
Choices:
  A: Infection
  B: Obstruction
  C: Fistula
  D: Hemorrhage
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I focused on the general complications of surgery and the specific complications of cyst-gastrostomy without considering the anatomical context of the procedure. The correct answer, "hemorrhage," is a major concern due to the rich vascular supply of the pancreas and the potential for damage to nearby blood vessels. 

Error Keywords:
- Overgeneralization
- Lack of anatomical context

Solution:
Cyst-gastrostomy is a surgical procedure used to treat pancreatic cysts or pseudocysts. While infection, obstruction, and fistula formation are potential complications, the major concern specific to this procedure is hemorrhage. The pancreas has a rich vascular supply, and there is a significant risk of bleeding during the operation or as a postoperative complication. 

Instructions:
1. Understand the context: Cyst-gastrostomy is a procedure for pancreatic cysts/pseudocysts.
2. Consider anatomical context: Recognize the rich vascular supply of the pancreas.
3. Evaluate complications: [REDACTED], obstruction, and fistula are general surgical risks, but hemorrhage is a major concern due to the anatomy.
4. Choose the answer: [REDACTED] - [REDACTED] is the major complication to consider for this specific procedure.

Advice:
- Consider the anatomical context and unique characteristics of the surgical site when evaluating potential complications. 
- Recognize that while general surgical complications are important, certain procedures carry specific risks due to the anatomy involved. 
- Always review potential complications for each procedure, especially those related to the unique aspects of the anatomy being operated on.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Upon reflection, the correct answer is "hemorrhage." This is due to the rich vascular supply of the pancreas, which increases the risk of bleeding during and after the procedure. While infection, obstruction, and fistula formation are general surgical risks, hemorrhage is a major concern specific to cyst-gastrostomy for pseudo pancreatic cysts.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
