Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I incorrectly recalled the source of antisera, confusing it with another type of antibody often used in research. My mistake was in the specific detail of the source animal, a common challenge in the vast field of medicine. 

Error Keywords:
- Recall error
- Confusion
- Source confusion

Solution:
Antisera, a heterologous serum containing antibodies, is obtained from horses. [REDACTED]s are large animals and can provide a substantial volume of serum, making them a suitable source for antisera production. 

Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and identify the specific biological product in question: antisera.
2. Recall that antisera is a heterologous serum, which indicates its source.
3. Understand that antisera is often obtained from large animals to yield sufficient quantities.
4. Recall that horses are a common source of heterologous serum.
5. Choose the answer option that reflects this knowledge: "[REDACTED]." 

Advice:
 - Ensure a strong foundational understanding of medical concepts. 
 - Focus on understanding the underlying principles and patterns rather than rote memorization. 
 - Develop a systematic approach to problem-solving, breaking down complex topics into manageable chunks. 
 - Regularly review and organize your knowledge to facilitate accurate recall. 
 - Stay cautious and avoid overgeneralization or jumping to conclusions. 
 - When in doubt, take a step back and re-evaluate the fundamental concepts.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: Antisera, a heterologous serum containing antibodies, is obtained from horses. This reflection highlights the previous confusion with the source of antisera and provides clarification. Horses are used because they can provide a substantial volume of serum, making them ideal for antisera production.
Action: Answer("D")
