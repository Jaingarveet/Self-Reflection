## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Spring catarrh, or seasonal allergic rhinitis, is a type I hypersensitivity reaction characterized by IgE-mediated responses to environmental allergens.

Type I hypersensitivity reactions are defined by the presence of IgE antibodies, which are specific to particular allergens. When an individual is exposed to the allergen, IgE antibodies are released, leading to an allergic reaction.

Therefore, the correct answer is Type I.

Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
