# Model: gemini-1.0-pro | Task: save_reflection | Exam: comprehensive-100 | Problem 11 of 100
## Get Reflection:
## Explanation:
My initial reasoning was flawed. While I correctly identified that options A and B support the assertion, I failed to recognize that option B contradicts the assertion. 
Option B states that land prices in Beijing rose by only 0.37%, significantly lower than the 7.2% increase in housing prices. This suggests that rising land prices might not be the sole cause of soaring housing prices in Beijing, casting doubt on the assertion.
## Error Keywords:
* Overgeneralization
* Incomplete analysis
* Ignoring contradictory evidence
## Solution:
1. Identify the assertion being questioned.
2. Analyze each option to determine whether it supports, contradicts, or is irrelevant to the assertion.
3. Pay close attention to details and numerical data provided in the options.
4. Identify options that present contradictory evidence or weaken the assertion.
5. Choose the option that most directly contradicts or casts the most doubt on the assertion.
## Instructions:
1. Read the passage and the assertion carefully.
2. Analyze each option individually and thoroughly.
3. Look for evidence that directly contradicts or weakens the assertion.
4. Consider numerical data and specific examples provided in the options.
5. Choose the option that raises the most significant doubt about the assertion.
## General Advice:
* Be cautious of overgeneralizations and incomplete analyses.
* Pay close attention to details and numerical data.
* Look for evidence that contradicts or weakens the main argument.
* Consider alternative explanations and perspectives.
* Don't rush to judgment; take your time to analyze all options carefully.
