# Model: gemini-1.0-pro | Task: save_reflection | Exam: comprehensive-100 | Problem 34 of 100
## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that the argument implies that currently, most Acme employees have a commute of less than 30 minutes. However, the argument only states that most Acme employees cannot afford housing within a 30-minute commute of Ocean View. This does not necessarily imply anything about their current commute times.
Error Keywords:
 - Assumption error
 - Implication error
 - Logical fallacy
Solution:
The argument states that most Acme employees cannot afford housing within a 30-minute commute of Ocean View. This implies that if the company moves to Ocean View, most employees will have to choose between living further away and having a longer commute or living closer and paying more for housing. The argument does not make any assumptions about the current commute times of Acme employees.
Instructions:
1. Carefully read the argument and identify the main conclusion.
2. Identify the evidence provided in the argument to support the conclusion.
3. Consider alternative explanations for the evidence.
4. Determine whether the evidence is sufficient to support the conclusion without making any unwarranted assumptions.
5. Choose the answer choice that identifies an assumption that is required for the argument to be valid.
Advice:
 - Be cautious about making assumptions that are not explicitly stated in the argument.
 - Consider alternative explanations for the evidence provided in the argument.
 - Ensure that the evidence is sufficient to support the conclusion without relying on unwarranted assumptions.
 - Pay attention to the wording of the answer choices and choose the one that most accurately identifies an assumption required for the argument to be valid.
