## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I made a mistake in solving for $x$ after substituting $y=-6$ into the second equation. 
I incorrectly calculated $2(-6)-19$ as $-31$ instead of $-31$.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Substitution error
 - Algebraic manipulation error
Solution:
1. Identify the system of equations to be solved.
2. Choose a variable to solve for using substitution.
3. Solve for the chosen variable in terms of the other variable.
4. Substitute the solved expression for the chosen variable into the other equation.
5. Solve for the remaining variable.
6. Substitute the value of the solved variable back into the equation from step 3 to solve for the first variable.
7. Double-check all calculations and substitutions.
8. Choose the answer that matches the calculated values of $x$ and $y$.

Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that substitution involves replacing a variable with an expression that is equivalent to that variable.
 - Remember that algebraic manipulation involves applying mathematical operations to both sides of an equation to isolate a variable.
