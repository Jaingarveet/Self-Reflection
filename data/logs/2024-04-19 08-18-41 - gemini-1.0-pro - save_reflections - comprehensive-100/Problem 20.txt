## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I misinterpreted the passage and focused on the metaphor in option D instead of the direct definition in option B. 
My error was in prioritizing a figurative explanation over a literal definition.
Error Keywords:
 - Figurative language error
 - Metaphor misinterpretation
 - Definition confusion
Solution:
The passage defines "bottom line ethics" as basic codes of conduct that should be observed by ordinary people in a society.
Option A is too specific and does not encompass all aspects of "bottom line ethics."
Option B directly matches the definition provided in the passage.
Option C is not a definition but rather a statement about what "bottom line ethics" is not.
Option D is a metaphor that accurately describes the role of "bottom line ethics" as the foundation of human morality, but it is not the definition itself.
Instructions:
1. Carefully read the passage and identify the key concepts.
2. Identify the question being asked and the options provided.
3. Analyze each option and compare it to the definition or description provided in the passage.
4. Choose the option that most accurately matches the definition or description.
5. Do not prioritize figurative language over literal definitions.
Advice:
 - Pay close attention to the wording of the question and the answer choices.
 - Look for keywords and phrases that match the concepts presented in the passage.
 - Be cautious of figurative language and metaphors, as they may not be the literal definition.
 - If unsure, eliminate options that are clearly incorrect or do not match the passage.
 - Choose the option that provides the most accurate and comprehensive definition or description.
