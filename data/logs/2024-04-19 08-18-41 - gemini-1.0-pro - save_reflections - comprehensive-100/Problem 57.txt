Explanation:
I focused on the conflict between Lady Carlotta and Mrs. Quabarl, overlooking the central theme of mistaken identity. 
Error Keywords:
 - Misinterpretation of central theme
 - Overemphasis on conflict
 - Ignoring key plot point
Solution:

3. Analyze the character's actions and reactions in response to the mistaken identity.
4. Consider the overall impact of the mistaken identity on the plot.

Advice:
 - Pay close attention to details that suggest a character's true identity or intentions.
