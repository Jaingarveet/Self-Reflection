## Get Reflection:
  Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I misunderstood the pattern of the ages of the members in the club. I incorrectly assumed that the pattern was increasing by 3 months for each member, when in fact, the pattern was increasing by 3 years for each member.

Error Keywords:

* Misunderstanding the pattern
* Incorrect assumption
* Lack of attention to detail

Solution:
The youngest member is 7 years old.
The common difference between consecutive terms in an arithmetic progression (AP) is 3 years, not 3 months.
The sum of the ages of all members is 250.

Now, let's find the number of members in the club:

The first member's age is 7.
The second member's age is 10 (7 + 3).
The third member's age is 13 (10 + 3).
The fourth member's age is 16 (13 + 3).
The fifth member's age is 19 (16 + 3).

We can see a pattern here. Each member's age is 3 years older than the previous member's age.

The number of members in the club is the number of ages we have:
1, 2, 3, 4, 5

Therefore, the number of members in the club is 5.

Action: Answer("C")

Instructions:

1. Read the question carefully and understand the pattern of the ages of the members in the club.
2. Pay attention to the details of the question, including the common difference between consecutive terms in an arithmetic progression.
3. Work step-by-step through the calculation of the ages of each member in the club.
4. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
5. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
