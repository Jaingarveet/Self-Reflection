## Get Reflection:
  Explanation:
I made a mistake in my calculation of the numerator.
I incorrectly calculated 19 × ? as 19 × 4 = 76.
However, the correct calculation is 19 × ? = 19 × 5 = 95.
Error Keywords:
- Calculation error
- Numerator error
- Multiplication error

Solution:
(5 + ? × 19 - 15 - 7)/(13 × 13 - 156) = 6

First, let's calculate the numerator:
5 + ? × 19 - 15 - 7 = 5 + 19 × ? - 22

We can see that 19 × ? = 19 × 5 = 95

So, the numerator is 5 + 95 - 22 = 78

Now, let's calculate the denominator:
13 × 13 - 156 = 169 - 156 = 13

Now, we can simplify the fraction:
78/13 = 6

Instructions:
1. Calculate the numerator correctly.
2. Calculate the denominator correctly.
3. Simplify the fraction.
4. Compare the result to the given choices.
5. Choose the matching answer.

Advice:
- Always double-check your calculations.
- Be careful when multiplying numbers.
