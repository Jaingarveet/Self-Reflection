## Get Reflection:
  Explanation:
I made a mistake in my calculation. I misunderstood the problem and wrote an incorrect equation.
I incorrectly assumed that the cost of each white sharpeners was 1 rupee more than the cost of each brown sharpeners, when in fact, the cost of each white sharpeners was 1 rupee more than the cost of each brown sharpeners.
Error Keywords:
- Misunderstanding of the problem
- Incorrect equation
- Calculation error

Solution:
Let W be the number of white sharpeners and B be the number of brown sharpeners.
Since Jack pays 1 rupee more for each white sharpeners than brown sharpeners, the cost of each white sharpeners is 1 rupee more than the cost of each brown sharpeners.
The total cost of all sharpeners is 100 rupees.
The cost of W white sharpeners is W rupees, and the cost of B brown sharpeners is B rupees.
Since the total cost is 100 rupees, we can set up the equation:
W + B = 100

We know that W + B = 18 (total number of sharpeners)

Substituting W + B = 18 into the first equation, we get:
W + B = 100
W = 100 - B

Now, we can substitute this expression for W into the first equation:
100 - B + B = 100

Combine like terms:
2B = 100 - 100
2B = 0

Since B is a whole number, B = 0.

Now, we can find W:
W = 100 - B
W = 100 - 0
W = 100

Therefore, the answer is A: 10,8.

Instructions:
1. Read the problem carefully and understand the cost of each white and brown sharpeners.
2. Write the equation for the total cost of all sharpeners.
3. Substitute the expression for W into the first equation.
4. Solve for B.
5. Find W.
6. Check your answer.

Advice:
- Always read the problem carefully and understand the cost of each item.
- Write the equation for the total cost of all items.
- Substitute the expression for one variable into the first equation.
- Solve for the other variable.
- Find the first variable.
- Check your answer.

In this problem, I made a mistake by misunderstanding the problem and writing an incorrect equation. I incorrectly assumed that the cost of each white sharpeners was 1 rupee more than the cost of each brown sharpeners, when in fact, the cost of each white sharpeners was 1 rupee more than the cost of each brown sharpeners. I also made a calculation error when solving for B. To avoid this mistake in the future, I should carefully read the problem and understand the cost of each item, write the equation for the total cost of all items, and solve for the variables carefully.
