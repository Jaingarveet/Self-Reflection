## Get Reflection:
  Explanation:
I made a mistake in my calculation. I misunderstood the question and added the vectors component-wise, which is not correct. I should have used the Pythagorean theorem to find the hypotenuse of the right triangle formed by A's journey.

Error Keywords:

* Vector addition
* Pythagorean theorem
* Right triangle

Solution:
Let's break down A's journey:

1. A travels 3 km towards the south.
2. Then, A travels 5 km towards the east.
3. Next, A travels 3 km towards the north.
4. Finally, A travels 2 km towards the west.

We can represent A's journey as a right triangle with legs of length 3 km and 5 km, and a hypotenuse of unknown length.

Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the length of the hypotenuse:

Hypotenuse = sqrt(3^2 + 5^2)

= sqrt(9 + 25)

= sqrt(34)

= 6 km

So, A is 6 km away from home.

Instructions:

1. Draw a diagram of A's journey.
2. Identify the legs of the right triangle formed by A's journey.
3. Use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the hypotenuse.
4. Calculate the length of the hypotenuse.
5. Choose the answer that matches the calculated length.

Advice:

* Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
* Always draw a diagram to visualize the problem.
* Always use the appropriate formula or theorem to solve the problem.
* Always calculate the answer precisely.
* Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
