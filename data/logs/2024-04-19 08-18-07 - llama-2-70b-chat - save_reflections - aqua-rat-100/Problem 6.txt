I made a mistake in my calculation. I misunderstood the information given in the question and calculated the time taken by Mr. Black to paint 3 houses incorrectly.

Error Keywords:

* Misunderstanding of the question

Solution:
Let's break this down step by step:

1. Mr. Brown paints a house in 6 days, so he can paint 3 houses in 3 x 6 = 18 days.
2. Mr. Brown goes on vacation after 8 days, so he has painted 3 houses in 8 days.
3. Mr. Black starts working after 8 days, so he has 18 - 8 = 10 days to paint 3 houses.
4. Mr. Black can paint a house in 8 days, so he can paint 3 houses in 3 x 8 = 24 days.
5. Since Mr. Black has 10 days to paint 3 houses, he will finish in 10 days.
6. Mr. Blue will finish the contract in 12 - 10 = 2 days.
