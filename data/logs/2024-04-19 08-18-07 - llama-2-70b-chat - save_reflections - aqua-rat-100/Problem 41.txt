## Get Reflection:
  Explanation:
I made a mistake in my calculation. I misunderstood the question and thought that the number of friends who attended the picnic was x - 4, instead of x.

Error Keywords:

* Misunderstanding the question
* Calculation error
* incorrect variables

Solution:
Let's assume the number of friends who attended the picnic is x.
The total amount spent on eatables was Rs. 96.
Since four friends did not turn up, the amount spent by the remaining friends is Rs. 96 / x.
Since each of the remaining friends had to contribute Rs. 4 extra, the total amount spent by them is Rs. 96 / x + 4x.
We want to find the value of x for which the above expression is equal to Rs. 96.

Rs. 96 / x + 4x = Rs. 96

Simplifying, we get:

x = 8

Therefore, the number of friends who attended the picnic is 8.

Instructions:

1. Read the question carefully and understand the variables.
2. Use the correct variables in your calculation.
3. Simplify your calculation before solving for the answer.
4. Check your answer to ensure it is reasonable.
