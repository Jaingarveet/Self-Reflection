## Get Reflection:
  Explanation:
I miscounted the number of ways to arrange the children in a straight line.
I mistakenly believed that there was only one way to arrange the children, when in fact, there are three ways.
Error Keywords:
- Counting error
- Combinatorics error
- Arrangement error

Solution:
Let's list out all the ways to arrange the children in a straight line:

1. Susan, Tim, Zen
2. Tim, Susan, Zen
3. Zen, Susan, Tim

There are three ways to arrange the children in a straight line, so the answer is B.

Instructions:
1. List out all the ways to arrange the children in a straight line.
2. Count the number of ways that Susan is on the left of Tim.
3. Choose the answer that matches the number of ways you counted.

Advice:
- Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
- Always list out all possible options before selecting an answer.
- Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
- In combinatorics problems, consider all possible outcomes and count them carefully.
- Remember that the order of elements in a sequence matters.
