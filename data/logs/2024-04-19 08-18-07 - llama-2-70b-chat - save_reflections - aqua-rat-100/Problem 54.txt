## Get Reflection:
  Explanation:
I made a mistake in my calculation. I misunderstood the phrase "half of her weight" and calculated it as (x/2) instead of (x/2) + x.
I also simplified the expression incorrectly, combining like terms instead of solving for x.
Error Keywords:
- Calculation error
- Misunderstanding the problem
- Simplification error

Solution:
Let's assume Meenu's weight to be x.
According to the statement, Meenu said she weighs 29 kg plus half of her weight.
So, Meenu's weight can be represented as: x + (x/2) + x = 3x/2
Now, we know that Meenu's weight is 29 kg plus half of her weight, which is 29 + (29/2) = 29 + 14.5 = 43.5 kg.

Instructions:
1. Read the problem carefully and understand the given information.
2. Let the weight of Meenu be x.
3. Write an expression for Meenu's weight based on the given information: x + (x/2) + x.
4. Simplify the expression: 3x/2.
5. Solve for x: 3x/2 = 43.5.
6. Calculate x: x = 29.
7. Choose the answer that matches the calculated value: D.

Advice:
- Always read the problem carefully and understand the given information.
- Be careful when simplifying expressions and solving equations.
- Double-check your calculations and final answer.
- Use a step-by-step approach to solve problems.
- Don't assume you know the answer without going through the process.
