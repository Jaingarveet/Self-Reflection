  Explanation:
I made a mistake in my calculation of the distance traveled by the point on the edge of the fan blade.
I correctly used the formula for the circumference of a circle and the formula for distance = circumference x time, but I made a mistake in my conversion of time from seconds to minutes.
I incorrectly converted 30 seconds to 0.5 minutes, when it should be 0.5 seconds.
This led to an incorrect calculation of the distance traveled.

Error Keywords:

* Conversion error
* Time conversion error
* Calculation error

Solution:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames

* Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
* Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
* Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
* Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them.

Reflection:
I should have been more careful in my calculation and double-checked my work.
I should have noticed that the conversion of 30 seconds to 0.5 minutes was incorrect.
I will make sure to be more mindful of my calculations and conversions in the future.
