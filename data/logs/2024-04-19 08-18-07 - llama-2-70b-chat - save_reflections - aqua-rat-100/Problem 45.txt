## Get Reflection:
  Explanation:
I made a mistake in my calculation. I misunderstood the question and calculated the profit incorrectly.
The correct calculation is as follows:
1. The cost price of the sewing machine is Rs. 1200.
2. The seller, Karan, wants to make a 20% profit.
3. To find the selling price, we need to calculate 20% of the cost price and add it to the cost price.
4. 20% of the cost price is:
1200 x 0.20 = 240
5. The selling price should be:
1200 + 240 = 1440
6. However, the question states that Karan wants to offer a 20% discount, not make a 20% profit.
7. Therefore, the selling price should be:
1440 - (20% of 1440) = 1440 - 288 = 1152

So, the correct answer is choice E: 1,800.

Error Keywords:

* Miscalculation
* Misunderstanding of the question
* Confusion between profit and discount

Instructions:

1. Read the question carefully and understand the problem.
2. Identify the cost price of the sewing machine.
3. Calculate 20% of the cost price.
4. Add the calculated percentage to the cost price to find the selling price.
5. Check if the question asks for a profit or a discount.
6. If the question asks for a discount, subtract the discount amount from the selling price.
7. Choose the answer that matches the calculated selling price.

Advice:

* Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
* Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
* Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
* Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
* Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
* Remember that profit and discount are different concepts, and they require different calculations.
