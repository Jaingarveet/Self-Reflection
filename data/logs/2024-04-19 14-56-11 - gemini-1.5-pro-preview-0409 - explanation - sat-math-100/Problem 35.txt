## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:
Topic: Geography
Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: $$\sqrt{4 x}=x-3$$What are all values of $x$ that satisfy the given equation?I. 1II. 9
Choices:
  A: I only
  B: II only
  C: I and II
  D: Neither I nor II
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.

Explanation:
I failed to check if the solutions obtained by squaring both sides of the equation actually satisfy the original equation. This oversight led me to include an extraneous solution.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
I need to solve the equation for x and then check which of the given options satisfy the original equation.
Squaring both sides: 
$$(\sqrt{4x})^2 = (x-3)^2$$
$$4x = x^2 - 6x + 9$$
$$x^2 - 10x + 9 = 0$$
$$(x-9)(x-1) = 0$$
So, x = 1 or x = 9.
Checking for extraneous solutions:
x = 1: 
$$\sqrt{4(1)} = 1 - 3$$
$$2 = -2$$ This is not true, so x = 1 is extraneous.
x = 9:
$$\sqrt{4(9)} = 9 - 3$$
$$6 = 6$$ This is true, so x = 9 is a valid solution.
Action: Answer("B") 
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
