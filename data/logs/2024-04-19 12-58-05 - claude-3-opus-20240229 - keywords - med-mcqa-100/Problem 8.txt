## Assistant 2:
Thought process:
Randomization is a key principle in scientific studies and experiments. The purpose of randomization is to ensure that each subject or item has an equal probability of being assigned to any given group.
When subjects are randomized, it means they have an equal chance of ending up in the treatment group or control group. Importantly, these probabilities are known - usually 50/50 for a two-group study.
Randomization introduces unpredictability in terms of which specific subjects will end up in each group. However, the overall probability for group assignment is equal and known in advance.
So randomization provides equal chances (50/50 for two groups) and these probabilities are predetermined and known, even though the actual group assignments are unpredictable.
Therefore, the correct answer is that randomization implies equal and known chances for group assignment.
Action: Answer("B")
