## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
The key points are:
- 34 weeks gestation 
- Multigravida with 2 previous normal deliveries
- Current pregnancy has an unstable lie
An unstable lie at 34 weeks in a multigravida is abnormal. With her history of normal deliveries, there is likely a pathological reason for the unstable lie.
Potential causes, in order of likelihood:
1. Uterine anomalies - Structural uterine abnormalities can prevent the fetus from settling into a stable lie. This is a probable cause, especially if undiagnosed in previous pregnancies.
2. Pelvic tumor - A mass in the pelvis could interfere with the fetal position. While possible, a tumor large enough to cause this should have been detected earlier.
3. Placenta previa - A low-lying placenta can lead to malpresentation. However, placenta previa significant enough to cause an unstable lie would likely have been diagnosed by 34 weeks.
4. Oligohydramnios - While low amniotic fluid can be associated with malpresentation, it is less likely to be the primary cause of an unstable lie, especially in an otherwise uncomplicated pregnancy.
Therefore, uterine anomalies are the most probable cause of an unstable lie at 34 weeks in this multigravida with an otherwise normal obstetric history.
