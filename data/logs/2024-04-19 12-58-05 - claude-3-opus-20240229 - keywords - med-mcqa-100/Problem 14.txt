## System:
You are an expert in Medicine.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: In anaerobic glycolysis, end product is -
Choices:
  A: 2 ATP + 2 NAD
  B: 2 ATP
  C: 2 ATP + 2 NADH
  D: 4 ATP + 2 FADH2
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Error Keywords:
 - Incomplete understanding of anaerobic glycolysis
 - Failure to account for NAD+ regeneration
 - Confusion about end products in anaerobic conditions
## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step, keeping in mind the key points from my previous reflection:
1. Anaerobic glycolysis occurs in the absence of oxygen. This is important because it impacts the fate of the NADH produced.
2. Glycolysis produces 2 ATP per glucose molecule. This part I had correct before. 
3. Glycolysis also produces 2 NADH per glucose. In aerobic conditions, these NADH would enter the electron transport chain to generate more ATP. However, in anaerobic conditions, there is no electron transport chain operating due to lack of oxygen.
4. In anaerobic glycolysis, the NADH must be regenerated back to NAD+ in order for glycolysis to continue (since NAD+ is required as an electron acceptor). This is accomplished by converting pyruvate to lactate, oxidizing NADH to NAD+ in the process.
5. Therefore, the end products of anaerobic glycolysis are:
   - 2 ATP 
   - 2 NADH (which are then oxidized back to NAD+ to allow glycolysis to continue)
   - 2 Lactate (produced from pyruvate to regenerate NAD+)
So in summary, the key end products are 2 ATP and 2 NADH, with the NADH being recycled back to NAD+. This matches choice C.
Action: Answer("C")
