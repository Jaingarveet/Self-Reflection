## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step considering the relevant factors for pediatric split skin graft harvesting:
1. Skin quality and thickness: In young children, the skin is thinner and more delicate compared to adults. The donor site should have sufficient thickness to allow harvesting without causing damage.
2. Ease of immobilization: Children are active and less cooperative, so the donor site should be easy to immobilize post-operatively to prevent shearing and graft loss. 
3. Cosmetic outcome: The donor site will leave a scar, so it's best to choose an area that can be easily hidden by clothing to minimize cosmetic impact.
4. Potential for growth: As children grow, the grafted skin and donor site will need to expand. Choosing a donor site with good expandability is important.
Considering these factors:
A. Buttocks: This area has thicker skin, is easy to immobilize, is usually hidden, and has good expandability. It is a preferred donor site in young children.
B. Thigh: The thigh skin is thinner, harder to immobilize, and more visible compared to the buttocks. It's a less ideal choice.
C. Trunk: The trunk skin has variable thickness, is difficult to immobilize in active children, and may impact growth. It's not the best option.
D. Upper limb: The upper limb skin is thin, difficult to immobilize, often visible, and has little room for expansion. It's the least suitable site.
Therefore, the buttocks are the most appropriate donor site for split skin grafts in young children.
