Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day. The following conditions apply: No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.

## Assistant 2:
## Reflection on Previous Attempt:
In my previous attempt, I likely focused too much on individual conditions and failed to consider the combined implications of all conditions simultaneously. This led to overlooking potential conflicts and inconsistencies between different cookie schedules. 
## Improved Approach:
1. **Start with fixed points:** The second batch of sugar cookies is on Thursday, providing a starting point.
2. **Analyze interconnected conditions:** The second oatmeal and first peanut butter batches are on the same day. This links their schedules.
3. **Eliminate conflicts:** Ensure no two batches of the same kind are on the same day and at least one batch is made on Monday.
4. **Test remaining options:** Systematically evaluate each remaining choice against all conditions to find the valid schedule.
## Analyzing Choices:
**A:** Oatmeal on Thursday conflicts with sugar's second batch. **Eliminate.**
**B:** No conflicts, but violates "at least one batch on Monday" condition. **Eliminate.**
**C:** Oatmeal on Thursday conflicts with sugar's second batch. **Eliminate.**
**D:**  No conflicts and satisfies all conditions. **Potential Answer.**
**E:** Oatmeal on Thursday conflicts with sugar's second batch. **Eliminate.**
Action: Answer("D") 
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
