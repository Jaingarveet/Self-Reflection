## Assistant 2:
## Reflection on Previous Attempt:
In my previous attempt, I focused too much on the constraint of Franco not testifying with Garcia and overlooked the implications of the "exactly two witnesses on Tuesday" rule. This led me to a wrong conclusion.
## Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Iturbe and Jackson testify on Wednesday:** This leaves three witnesses (Franco, Garcia, and Hong) for Monday and Tuesday.
2. **Exactly two witnesses on Tuesday:** This means only one witness can testify on Monday. 
3. **Hong not on Monday:** Since only one witness testifies on Monday and it can't be Hong, it must be either Franco or Garcia.
4. **Franco not with Garcia:** This constraint becomes irrelevant as they cannot both be on Monday due to point 2.
Therefore, the only certainty is that **exactly one witness is scheduled to testify on Monday**. 
Action: Answer("C") 
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
