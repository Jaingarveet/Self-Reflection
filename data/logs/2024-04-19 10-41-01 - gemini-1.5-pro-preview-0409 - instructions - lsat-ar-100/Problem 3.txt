Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.

## Assistant 2:
## Reflection on Previous Attempt:
In my previous attempt, I made an error by focusing too much on the specific parking space assignments and not on the relationships between the employees' parking spaces. I should have paid closer attention to the "must be higher/lower than" statements to deduce the possible orderings.
## Answering the Question:
**Given:** Robertson is assigned parking space #3.
**Rules & Deductions:**
*   **Rule:** Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
    *   **Deduction:** Young must be in space #1 or #2.
*   **Rule:** Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
    *   **Deduction:** Togowa must be in space #1 (if Young is in #2) or cannot be placed yet (if Young is in #1).
*   **Rule:** Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. 
    *   **Deduction:** We don't have enough information to place Xu or Souza yet.
**Analyzing Choices:**
*   **A:** We don't have enough information to determine Souza's placement.
*   **B:** This could be true if Young is in #1, but it's not guaranteed.
*   **C:** We don't have enough information to determine Vaughn's placement.
*   **D:** This is possible, but not guaranteed. Xu could be in #4 or #5 depending on Young and Souza's placement.
*   **E:** This is **NOT POSSIBLE** because Young must be in a lower-numbered space than Robertson (#3).
Therefore, based on the given information and deductions, none of the options **must** be true. 
**Action: None of the Above** 
## Result:
Agent Answer: None
Correct Answer: E
Score: 0
