Context: On each of exactly seven consecutive days (day 1 though day 7), a pet shop features exactly one of three breeds of kitten—Himalayan, Manx, Siamese—and exactly one of three breeds of puppy—Greyhound, Newfoundland, Rottweiler. The following conditions must apply: Greyhounds are featured on day 1. No breed is featured on any two consecutive days. Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7. Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1. Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.
Question: Which one of the following could be the order in which the breeds of kitten are featured in the pet shop, from day 1 though day 7?
Choices:
  A: Himalayan, Manx, Siamese, Himalayan, Manx, Himalayan, Siamese
  B: Manx, Himalayan, Siamese, Himalayan, Manx Himalayan, Manx
  C: Manx, Himalayan, Manx, Himalayan, Siamese, Manx, Siamese

## Reflection on Previous Attempt:
**Error Analysis:**
In my previous attempt, I likely focused too much on placing the Himalayan kittens on three non-consecutive days and ensuring no breed repetition on consecutive days. This might have led me to overlook the constraint regarding Rottweilers not being featured on any day with Himalayans. 
**Lessons Learned:**
1. **Consider all constraints simultaneously:**  I need to ensure that each placement satisfies all given conditions, not just a subset.
2. **Systematic Approach:**  A more methodical approach, perhaps by elimination or building the schedule step-by-step, could help avoid overlooking constraints.
**Improved Strategy:**
1. **Start with fixed points:** Greyhounds on day 1 and no repetition on day 7 are fixed starting points.
2. **Analyze Rottweiler placement:** Since Rottweilers can't be with Himalayans, their placement will influence the Himalayan schedule.
3. **Eliminate options:** Use the given constraints to eliminate choices that violate any condition.
4. **Build the schedule:** If elimination doesn't lead to a direct answer, try building a possible schedule step-by-step while adhering to all constraints. 
**Applying the Improved Strategy:**
Let's analyze the options:
* **Option A:** Violates the "no repeat on day 7" rule as both day 1 and day 7 have Siamese. 
* **Option B:**  This option places Himalayans on days 2, 4, and 6. This means Rottweilers cannot be on these days.  However, with Greyhounds on day 1 and no repeats on consecutive days or day 7, the only remaining options for days 3, 5, and 7 are filled with Siamese and Manx, leaving no room for Rottweilers. So, this option violates the condition of featuring Rottweilers.
* **Option C:** Similar to option B, placing Himalayans on days 2, 4, and 6 leaves no room for Rottweilers with the given constraints. 
* **Option D:** This option places Himalayans on days 2, 4, and 7, violating the "no repeat on day 7" rule.
* **Option E:** This option places Himalayans on days 2, 4, and 6.  This leaves days 3, 5, and 7 for Manx and Siamese, allowing Rottweilers to be placed on day 7 without violating any constraints. 
Therefore, based on the analysis and elimination process, the only possible order for kitten breeds is:
**Action: Answer("E")**
