## Reflection on Previous Attempt:
**Error Analysis:**
In my previous attempt, I likely made an error in interpreting the given conditions and their implications for the number of sales representatives in each zone. This led me to choose an option that contradicted the constraint of having more representatives in Zone 1 than in Zone 3.
**Understanding the Constraints:**
* **Zone 1:** Either Parra or Tiao (exclusive)
* **Zone 2:** Either Tiao or Udall (exclusive)
* **Parra & Quinn:** Same zone
* **Stuckey & Udall:** Same zone
* **Zone 3:** More representatives than Zone 2
* **Zone 1:** More representatives than Zone 3 
**Deductions:**
* **Zone 2 cannot have the most representatives.** 
* **If Zone 1 has more representatives than Zone 3, then it must have at least 3.**
* **Parra and Quinn must be together, either in Zone 1 or Zone 3.**
* **Stuckey and Udall must be together, either in Zone 2 or Zone 3.**
**Applying Deductions to Choices:**
* **A: Kim in Zone 2:** This could be true as long as Zone 2 has only 2 representatives and Zone 1 has at least 3.
* **B: Mahr in Zone 2:** Same as A, this could be true under the same conditions.
* **C: Parra in Zone 3:** This would mean Quinn is also in Zone 3. With Stuckey and Udall needing to be together, this would make Zone 3 have more representatives than Zone 1, violating a constraint. So, this cannot be true.
* **D: Tiao in Zone 1:** This is possible as long as Parra is in Zone 3 with Quinn, and Zone 1 has at least 3 representatives.
* **E: Udall in Zone 3:** This would mean Stuckey is also in Zone 3.  With Parra and Quinn needing to be together, this would make Zone 3 have more representatives than Zone 1, violating a constraint. So, this cannot be true.
**Conclusion:**
Based on the analysis, options A, B, and D are possible scenarios that satisfy the given conditions and constraints.
