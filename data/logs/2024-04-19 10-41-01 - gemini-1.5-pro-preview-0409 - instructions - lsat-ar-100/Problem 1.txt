Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Question: Which one of the following CANNOT be true of the schedule?
Choices:
  A: Franco is the only witness scheduled to testify on Monday.
  B: Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Iturbe.
  C: Garcia and Hong are both scheduled to testify on Tuesday.
  D: Garcia is the only witness scheduled to testify on Monday and Hong is one of two witnesses scheduled to testify on Wednesday.

## Reflection on Previous Attempt:
**Error Analysis:**
In my previous attempt, I likely made an error in interpreting the constraints or overlooked a key detail, leading to the selection of an impossible scenario. This highlights the importance of meticulous attention to detail and a systematic approach when dealing with logical reasoning problems.
**Improved Approach:**
1. **Analyze Constraints:** Carefully review each constraint and its implications for the possible schedules.
2. **Elimination Process:** Systematically eliminate options that violate any of the given conditions.
3. **Logical Deduction:** Use the remaining information to deduce the possible schedules and identify the option that cannot occur.
**Applying the Improved Approach:**
Let's analyze each option:
* **A:** This could be true. If Franco testifies on Monday and the other four testify on Tuesday and Wednesday, it satisfies all conditions.
* **B:** This could be true. If Franco and Iturbe testify on Wednesday and the others on Monday and Tuesday, it satisfies all conditions.
* **C:** This could be true. If Garcia and Hong testify on Tuesday and the others on Monday and Wednesday, it satisfies all conditions.
* **D:** This **cannot be true**. If Garcia is alone on Monday, then Hong must be on Tuesday or Wednesday. But the condition states Hong cannot be on Monday, and option D puts the other witness on Wednesday with Iturbe, leaving no space for Hong. 
* **E:** This could be true. If Jackson testifies on Tuesday and two others (Franco and Hong, for example) testify on Monday, it satisfies all conditions.
Therefore, based on the analysis, option D presents an impossible scenario given the constraints. 
Action: Answer("D") 
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: E
Score: 0
