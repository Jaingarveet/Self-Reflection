Context: A maintenance company that takes service requests from three clients—Image, Solide, and Truvest—plans to set targets for its average service response times. Service targets will be set at 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day. Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail. The six targets are set according to the following conditions: None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
Question: If none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days, then each of the following must be true EXCEPT:
Choices:
  A: Image's website target is 1 day.
  B: Solide's website target is 2 days.
  C: Solide's voicemail target is 2 days.

## Reflection on Previous Attempt:
In my previous attempt, I focused too much on the individual conditions and failed to consider the combined implications of all conditions together. This led me to a conclusion that contradicted one of the given conditions. 
##  Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **No 3-day voicemail targets:** This means all voicemail targets are either 1 or 2 days.
2. **Image's voicemail is shortest:**  Combined with point 1, this means Image's voicemail target **must be 1 day**.
3. **Website targets are shorter than or equal to voicemail targets:** This means Image's website target is also **1 day** (Option A is TRUE).
4. **Solide's website target is shorter than Truvest's:** This means Solide's website target cannot be 3 days.
5. **Combining points 1 and 4:** Solide's website target must be **2 days** (Option B is TRUE).
6. **Image's voicemail is 1 day (point 2):** This means both Solide and Truvest must have a voicemail target of 2 days (Options C and E are TRUE).
7. **With points 5 and 6:** We know Solide has both website and voicemail targets of 2 days. 
8. **Therefore, Truvest's website target must be either 2 or 3 days to be longer than Solide's.** Option D stating it's 2 days is NOT necessarily true. 
Action: Answer("D") 
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
