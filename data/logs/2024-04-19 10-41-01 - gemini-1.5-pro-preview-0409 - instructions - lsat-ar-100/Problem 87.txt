## Reflection on Previous Attempt:
**Error Analysis:**
In my previous attempt, I likely focused too much on the individual constraints without considering their combined implications. This led me to overlook a crucial aspect of the problem, resulting in an incorrect answer.
**Understanding the Constraints:**
1. **French Works Limit:**  Maximum of 4 French works (novels + plays)
2. **Novels Range:** Minimum 3 and maximum 4 novels (French + Russian)
3. **French/Russian Novel Ratio:** At least as many French novels as Russian novels.
4. **Plays Condition:** Selecting both French plays excludes the Russian play.
**Key Insights:**
*  The minimum number of novels (3) combined with the French/Russian novel ratio constraint implies at least one French novel must be chosen. 
*  Since the total work selection is at least 5, and we need a minimum of 3 novels, there must be at least 2 additional works from the remaining categories (French plays and Russian play).
**Improved Approach:**
1. **Start with the mandatory French novel:** This satisfies constraint 3 and contributes towards the minimum novel requirement.
2. **Analyze remaining options:** We need at least 2 more works. 
3. **Consider plays:** Choosing both French plays would exclude the Russian play and force us to select another French novel (to meet the minimum novel requirement). This would reach the limit of 4 French works. 
4. **Alternative:** Selecting one French play and the Russian play allows for flexibility in choosing the remaining novels while respecting all constraints.
**Conclusion:**
The organizer must select at least **one French novel and one French play** to satisfy all given conditions. This ensures we meet the minimum novel requirement, maintain the French/Russian novel ratio, and stay within the limit of French works while keeping options open for the remaining selections. 
**Action: Answer("A")**
