Context: A bakery makes exactly three kinds of cookieâ€”oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar. Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day. The following conditions apply: No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
Question: If the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday, then each of the following could be true EXCEPT:
Choices:
  A: Two different kinds of cookie have their first batch made on Monday.
  B: Two different kinds of cookie have their first batch made on Tuesday.
  C: Two different kinds of cookie have their second batch made on Wednesday.

## Reflection on Previous Attempt:
**Error Analysis:**
In my previous attempt, I likely focused too much on the specific conditions and not enough on the overall constraints of the problem. This led me to overlook a possible scenario and choose an answer that contradicted the given information.
**Key Learnings:**
* **Consider all constraints:**  Pay close attention to all conditions and limitations, including the number of batches per cookie type and the days of the week.
* **Think about combinations:** Explore different combinations of cookie batches on different days, ensuring they comply with the given conditions.
* **Eliminate impossible scenarios:**  Use the process of elimination to rule out options that violate the given information.
**Improved Approach:**
1. **Analyze the fixed points:** Start with the information that is definitively stated:
    * Three batches of each cookie type are made.
    * No two batches of the same kind are made on the same day.
    * At least one batch is made on Monday.
    * Second sugar batch is on Thursday.
    * First peanut butter batch is on Tuesday (given in the question).
2. **Deduce implications:** Based on the given information:
    * The second oatmeal batch is also on Tuesday (due to the condition linking it to the first peanut butter batch).
3. **Explore possibilities:** Consider different valid arrangements of the remaining batches while adhering to the constraints.
4. **Eliminate options:** Based on the possible arrangements, eliminate answer choices that cannot be true. 
**Applying the Improved Approach:**
Given the first peanut butter batch is on Tuesday, we know the second oatmeal batch is also on Tuesday. Let's analyze the options:
* **A:** Possible. Monday could have the first batch of oatmeal and sugar cookies.
* **B:** Possible. Tuesday already has the first peanut butter batch, and could have the first batch of sugar cookies.
* **C:** Possible. Wednesday could have the second batch of sugar cookies and the second batch of peanut butter cookies.
* **D:** **NOT Possible.** Thursday already has the second sugar batch, and cannot have another second batch of any cookie type.
* **E:** Possible. Friday could have the third batch of all three cookie types.
Therefore, the answer that cannot be true is the one where two different kinds of cookies have their second batch made on Thursday.
