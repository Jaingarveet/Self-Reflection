Context: A shopping center has exactly seven spaces—space 1 through space 7—arranged in a straight row. Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
Question: If the shoe store is in space 4, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: The optometrist is next to a restaurant.
  B: The pharmacy is next to the veterinarian.
  C: A restaurant is next to the toy store.

## Assistant 2:
## Reflection on Previous Attempt:
In my previous attempt, I focused too much on the constraint of the pharmacy being at one end and a restaurant at the other, neglecting the specific constraint of the shoe store being in space 4. This led me to a conclusion that wasn't necessarily true based on the given information.
## Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Shoe Store Placement:** We know the shoe store is in space 4. This leaves spaces 1, 2, 3 on one side and 5, 6, 7 on the other.
2. **Restaurant Placement:** One restaurant must be at either space 1 or 7. The other restaurant must be at least two spaces away, meaning it can be in space 3 or 5 at the closest.
3. **Pharmacy Placement:** The pharmacy must be at one end (space 1 or 7) and next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. 
4. **Eliminating Options:**
    - **Option A:** We don't have enough information to confirm if the optometrist is next to a restaurant. 
    - **Option B:** The pharmacy could be next to the optometrist instead.
    - **Option C:** The toy store's placement is flexible and not necessarily next to a restaurant.
    - **Option D:**  The toy store could be in various positions; we don't have enough information to confirm its adjacency to the shoe store.
    - **Option E:**  This is the only option that **must be true** given the constraints. If the pharmacy is at space 1, the veterinarian must be at space 2 due to the "at least two spaces between restaurants" rule. If the pharmacy is at space 7, the veterinarian must be at space 6 due to the same rule. 
Therefore, the shoe store in space 4 will always be next to the veterinarian in either scenario.
