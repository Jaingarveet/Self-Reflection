## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: A cow is tethered in the middle of a field with a 14 feet long rope. If the cow grazes 10 sq.ft. per day, then approximately what time will be taken by the cow to graze the whole field?
Choices:
  A: 51 days
  B: 61 days
  C: 71 days
  D: 81 days
  E: 91 days
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Identify the radius of the circle that the cow can graze.
2. Calculate the area of the circle using the formula [REDACTED] = pi*r^2.
3. Identify the area that the cow can graze in a day.
4. Divide the area of the field by the area that the cow can graze in a day.
5. Round the result to the nearest whole number or decimal place, as required.
6. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
7. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
1. The radius of the circle that the cow can graze is 14 feet.
2. The area of the circle is [REDACTED] = pi*r^2 = pi*(14/2)^2 = 153.94 sq.ft. (rounded to two decimal places).
3. The cow can graze 10 sq.ft. per day.
4. The area of the field is unknown.
5. Let's assume that the field is a perfect circle with an area of [REDACTED] = pi*r^2. We can solve for r using the formula r = sqrt(A/pi) = sqrt([REDACTED]/pi) = sqrt([REDACTED]) = [REDACTED] (rounded to two decimal places). Therefore, the radius of the field is approximately 56.08 feet.
6. The area of the field is [REDACTED] = pi*r^2 = pi*(56.08)^2 = 9,886.47 sq.ft. (rounded to two decimal places).
7. The cow can graze 10 sq.ft. per day, so it will take [REDACTED] = [REDACTED]/10 = 988.65 days (rounded to two decimal places) for the cow to graze the whole field.
8. The answer choices are all in whole numbers, so we need to round our result. Rounding 988.65 to the nearest whole number gives us 989.
Action: Answer("E")
## Result:
Agent Answer: E
Correct Answer: B
