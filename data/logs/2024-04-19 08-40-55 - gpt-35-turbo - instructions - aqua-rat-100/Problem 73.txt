## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Choices:
  A: 550
  B: 570
  C: 600
  D: 700

Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and understand the problem.
2. Write down the given information and the equations that represent the problem.
3. Identify the unknown variable and the conditions that it must satisfy.
4. Start with a reasonable assumption for the value of the variable.
5. Use logical reasoning and calculations to narrow down the possible values of the variable.
6. Check each possible value of the variable to see if it satisfies the conditions of the problem.
7. Choose the minimum value of the variable that satisfies all the conditions.
8. If none of the given choices match the minimum value, choose "[REDACTED]".
## Assistant 2:
Given: 
- 20% of students took physics
- 28% of students took math
- There are more than 501 students in the school
Let's assume that there are exactly 501 students in the school. 
Then, the minimum number of students who took physics is 20% of 501 = 100.2 (which is not possible since the number of students must be a whole number). 
Similarly, the minimum number of students who took math is 28% of 501 = 140.28 (also not possible). 
Let's assume that there are 550 students in the school. 
Then, the minimum number of students who took physics is 20% of 550 = 110. 
The minimum number of students who took math is 28% of 550 = 154. 
The total number of students who took either physics or math is at least 110 + 154 = 264. 
Since 264 is less than half of 550, it is possible that some students took both physics and math. 
Therefore, 550 is a possible minimum number of students in the school. 
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: E
