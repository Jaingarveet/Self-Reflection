## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Identify the time interval for each train.
2. Find the LCM of the two time intervals.
3. The LCM is the time it takes for both trains to leave the station simultaneously again.
4. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
5. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Train A leaves every 16 minutes.
Train B leaves every 17 minutes.
To find the time until they leave simultaneously again, we need to find the LCM of 16 and 17.
Prime factorizing 16 and 17, we get 16 = 2^4 and 17 is a prime number.
The LCM of 16 and 17 is 2^4 * 17 = 272.
Therefore, both trains will leave the station simultaneously again in 272 minutes.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
