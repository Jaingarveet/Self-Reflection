2. Calculate the fraction of work done by each painter in a day.
3. Add the fractions of work done by each painter to calculate the total work done.
4. Subtract the total work done from 1 to find the remaining work.
5. Set up an equation to solve for the remaining work.
6. Solve the equation to find the time taken by the remaining painter to complete the work.

[REDACTED]. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let's first calculate the fraction of work done by each painter in a day.
Mr.Brown can paint a house in 6 days, so he can paint 1/6 of a house in a day.
Mr.Black can paint a house in 8 days, so he can paint 1/8 of a house in a day.
Mr.Blue can paint a house in 12 days, so he can paint 1/12 of a house in a day.
After 8 days, Mr.Brown has completed 8*(1/6) = 4/3 of the work.
Then, Mr.Black works for 6 days and completes 6*(1/8) = 3/4 of the work.
Together, Mr.Brown and Mr.Black have completed 4/3 + 3/4 = 7/3 of the work.
The remaining work is 1 - 7/3 = 2/3 of the work.
Let's set up an equation to solve for the time taken by Mr.Blue to complete the remaining work.
2/3 = (1/12)*t
where t is the time taken by Mr.Blue to complete the remaining work.
Solving for t, we get t = 8.
Action: Answer("B")
