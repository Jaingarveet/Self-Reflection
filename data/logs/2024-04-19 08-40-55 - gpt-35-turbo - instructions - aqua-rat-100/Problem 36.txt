## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let's start by identifying the relevant information and variables:
- 10% of the chocolates are cocoa flavored.
- 90% of the rest are squashed.
- We want to find the percentage of chocolates that are vanilla flavored and not squashed.
Let's assume that there are 100 chocolates in total.
Then, 10 chocolates are cocoa flavored, and 90 chocolates are vanilla flavored.
Out of the 90 vanilla chocolates, 90% are squashed, which means 9 chocolates are squashed.
Therefore, the number of vanilla chocolates that are not squashed is 90 - 9 = 81.
The percentage of vanilla chocolates that are not squashed is (81/100) x 100% = 81%.
Action: Answer("None of the Above") [The correct answer is not listed. The correct answer is 81%.]
