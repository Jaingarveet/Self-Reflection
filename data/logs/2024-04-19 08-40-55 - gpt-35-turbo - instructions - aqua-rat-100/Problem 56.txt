## Assistant 2:
Self-reflection:
1. The principal amount borrowed is Rs.360.
2. The total amount paid back is 12 x Rs.31.50 = Rs.378.
3. The interest paid is Rs.378 - Rs.360 = Rs.18.
4. Using the formula: Interest Rate = (Interest / Principal) x 100, we get:
   Interest Rate = (18 / 360) x 100 = 5%.
5. Calculation is correct.
Action: Answer("D")
