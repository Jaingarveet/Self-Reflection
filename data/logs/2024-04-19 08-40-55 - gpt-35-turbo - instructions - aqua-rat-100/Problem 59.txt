## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let's start by finding the number of black marbles in the second draw. Since one black marble represents the percentage of black marbles in the bag, we can set up the equation:
1/20 = x/Q, where x is the number of black marbles in the bag and Q is the total number of marbles in the bag.
Solving for x, we get x = Q/20.
Now, we know that 20 marbles were drawn in the first draw, and they were all painted black and returned to the bag. Therefore, the number of black marbles in the bag after the first draw is 20.
So, the total number of black marbles in the bag is 20 + x = 20 + Q/20.
The percentage of black marbles in the bag is (20 + Q/20)/Q * 100.
Simplifying this expression, we get 100 + 5Q/Q.
Therefore, we have the equation 100 + 5Q/Q = 1/20 * 100.
Solving for Q, we get Q = 400.
