## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Given, speed of the train = 100 miles/hour
Time taken to reach the destination = 10 hours
Distance covered by the train = speed x time = 100 x 10 = 1000 miles
When the train covers a quarter of the distance, the remaining distance is 3/4 of the total distance.
Let's calculate the distance covered by the train before it starts raining.
Distance covered by the train before it starts raining = 1/4 x 1000 = 250 miles
Time taken to cover 250 miles at a speed of 100 miles/hour = distance/speed = 250/100 = 2.5 hours
Now, the train has to be slowed down to 75 miles/hour due to rain.
Let's calculate the remaining distance to be covered by the train.
Remaining distance = total distance - distance covered before raining = 1000 - 250 = 750 miles
Time taken to cover 750 miles at a speed of 75 miles/hour = distance/speed = 750/75 = 10 hours
Total journey duration = time taken before raining + time taken after raining = 2.5 + 10 = 12.5 hours
Action: Answer("C")
