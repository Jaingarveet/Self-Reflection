## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Question: Amy is organizing her bookshelves and finds that she has 10 different types of books. She then codes each book with either a single letter or a pair of two different letters. If each type of book is uniquely represented by either a single letter or pair of letters, what is the smallest number of letters Amy will need to create the codes for all 10 types of books? (Assume the order of letters in a pair does not matter.)
Choices:
  A: 3
  B: 4
  C: 5
  D: 10
  E: 20

## Assistant 2:
Thought:
There are 10 different types of books, and each type can be represented by either a single letter or a pair of two different letters. If we use a single letter to represent each type, we need at least 10 letters. If we use a pair of two different letters to represent each type, we can use the combination formula to calculate the number of possible pairs: C(10,2) = 45. Therefore, we need at least 45 letters to represent each type with a pair of two different letters. Since we want to find the smallest number of letters, we should choose the smaller value, which is 10.
Action: Answer("D")
