## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: A point on the edge of a fan blade that is rotating in a plane 10 centimeters from the center of the fan. What is the distance traveled, in centimeters, by this point after 30 seconds when the fan runs at the rate of 300 revolutions per minutes?
Choices:
  A: 750pi
  B: 1500pi
  C: 1875pi
  D: 3000pi
  E: 7500pi
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Identify the radius of the circle.
2. Calculate the circumference of the circle.
3. Identify the number of revolutions made by the fan blade in the given time.
4. Multiply the circumference of the circle by the number of revolutions made by the fan blade.
5. Multiply the result by 2 because the point on the edge of the fan blade travels the circumference of the circle twice in one revolution.
6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.
7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
1. The radius of the circle is 10 centimeters.
2. The circumference of the circle is 2*pi*r = 20*pi centimeters.
3. The fan blade makes 300/60 = 5 revolutions per second.
4. The point on the edge of the fan blade travels 20*pi*5 = 100*pi centimeters per second.
5. The point on the edge of the fan blade travels 100*pi*30 = 3000*pi centimeters in 30 seconds.
6. Calculation: 20*pi*5 = 100*pi; 100*pi*30 = 3000*pi.
Action: Answer("D")
