## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let's call the distance between A and B "d".
Let's call the time it takes for Kevin to drive from A to B "t1".
Let's call the time it takes for Kevin to drive from B to A "t2".
We know that Kevin drove at a constant speed of 70 mph from A to B, so we can set up the equation:
d = 70t1
We also know that Kevin drove at a constant speed of 90 mph from B to A, so we can set up the equation:
d = 90t2
We know that 3 hours before the end of his trip, he was still approaching B, only 70 miles away from it. This means that at that point, he had already driven 2d - 70 miles. We can set up the equation:
2d - 70 = 70t1 + 90(t2 - 3)
Simplifying this equation, we get:
2d - 70 = 70t1 + 90t2 - 270
2d = 70t1 + 90t2 - 200
We can use the first two equations to substitute for d:
2(70t1) = 70t1 + 90t2 - 200
Simplifying this equation, we get:
140t1 = 90t2 + 200
We also know that t1 + t2 = total time of the trip. Let's call the total time of the trip "T":
t1 + t2 = T
We can solve for t2 in terms of t1:
t2 = T - t1
Substituting this expression into the previous equation, we get:
140t1 = 90(T - t1) + 200
Simplifying this equation, we get:
50t1 = 90T - 200
t1 = (90T - 200) / 50
We can use this expression to solve for t2:
t2 = T - t1
t2 = T - (90T - 200) / 50
t2 = (10T + 200) / 50
Now we can use the equation d = 70t1 to solve for d:
d = 70t1
d = 70[(90T - 200) / 50]
d = 126T - 280
We know that 2d = 70t1 + 90t2, so we can use this equation to check our answer:
2d = 70t1 + 90t2
2d = 70[(90T - 200) / 50] + 90[(10T + 200) / 50]
2d = 126T + 280
d = 203.2
