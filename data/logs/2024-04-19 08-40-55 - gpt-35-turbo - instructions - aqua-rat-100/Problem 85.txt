## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let's assume the speed of the elevator is "x" steps/minute.
From the first statement, we know that the elevator covers 20 steps in 10 minutes, so the speed of the elevator can be expressed as 20/10 = 2 steps/minute.
From the second statement, we know that the elevator covers 10 steps in 20 minutes, so the speed of the elevator can be expressed as 10/20 = 0.5 steps/minute.
Since the speed of the elevator should be constant, we can equate both expressions to get:
2 = 0.5 + x
x = 1.5 steps/minute
Action: Answer("E")
