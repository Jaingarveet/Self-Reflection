Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Identify the investments of each person and the duration of their investments.
2. Use the ratio of their investments to calculate the share of profit for each person.
3. Add up their shares of the profit to get the total profit.
4. Set up an equation using the total profit and the sum of their shares of the profit.
5. Simplify the equation and solve for the unknown variable.
6. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
7. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let's assume C joined after x months.
A invested for 12 months, B invested for 10 months, and C invested for (12-x) months.
The ratio of their investments is (40,000*12):(60,000*10):(120,000*(12-x)) = 4:3:9-3x.
Let's assume C's share is y.
Then, (375,000*y) = (4+3+9-3x)*375,000/16.
Simplifying the equation, we get 3x = 23y - 69.
We know that y = 150,000/375,000 = 2/5.
Substituting y, we get 3x = 23(2) - 69 = -23.
Therefore, x = 23/3 months.
Action: Answer("C")
