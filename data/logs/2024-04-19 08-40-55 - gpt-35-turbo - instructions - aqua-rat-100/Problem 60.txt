## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Assistant 2:
Self-reflection:
I made a mistake in my previous answer by assuming that minor arc BD was bisected by segment AC. However, the problem only states that minor arc AC is bisected by segment BD. This changes the diagram and the solution. After redrawing the diagram and using the angle addition postulate, I found that the measure of minor arc AD is 140°. 
Solution:
1. Given: Minor arc AC = 160°, Minor arc BD = 150°, B bisects minor arc AC
2. To find: Measure of minor arc AD
3. Draw a diagram to visualize the problem. [REDACTED]
4. Relevant theorem: Angle addition postulate
5. Assume that segment BD bisects minor arc AC at point E.
6. Using the angle addition postulate, we can find the measure of minor arc AE:
   - Measure of minor arc AC = 160°
   - Measure of minor arc BE = 1/2 * measure of minor arc AC = 80°
   - Measure of minor arc AE = Measure of minor arc AB + Measure of minor arc BE = 80° + x (let x be the measure of minor arc AB)
   - Measure of minor arc AB = Measure of minor arc BD - Measure of minor arc AD = 150° - y (let y be the measure of minor arc AD)
   - Measure of minor arc DE = 1/2 * measure of minor arc BD = 75°
   - Measure of minor arc AD = Measure of minor arc AE + Measure of minor arc ED = (80° + x) + 75° = 155° + x
7. We know that B bisects minor arc AC, so angle ABC is congruent to angle CBD. Therefore, x = y.
8. Substitute x = y into the equation for minor arc AD: Measure of minor arc AD = 155° + x = 155° + y
9. Measure of minor arc BD = Measure of minor arc AB + Measure of minor arc AD
   - 150° = x + (155° + x)
   - 150° = 2x + 155°
   - -5° = 2x
   - x = -2.5°
10. Substitute x = -2.5° into the equation for minor arc AD: Measure of minor arc AD = 155° + x = 155° - 2.5° = 152.5°
11. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
