## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

  B: 550
  C: 500
  D: 450
  E: 498
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Identify the dimensions of the outer cube and the inner cube.
2. Calculate the surface area of the outer cube.
3. Calculate the surface area of the inner cube.
4. Subtract the surface area of the inner cube from the surface area of the outer cube to find the surface area of the hollow cube.
5. Calculate the number of smaller cubes that make up the outer surface.
6. Multiply the number of smaller cubes that make up the outer surface by 6 to find the total number of faces of the smaller cubes.
7. Subtract the number of faces of the smaller cubes that make up the outer surface from the total number of faces of the smaller cubes to find the number of faces that remain unpainted.
8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
1. The outer cube has dimensions of 5cm x 5cm x 5cm.
2. The inner cube has dimensions of 3cm x 3cm x 3cm.
3. The surface area of the outer cube is 6 x (5cm x 5cm) = 150cm^2.
4. The surface area of the inner cube is 6 x (3cm x 3cm) = 54cm^2.
5. The surface area of the hollow cube is 150cm^2 - 54cm^2 = 96cm^2.
6. The outer surface is made up of 5cm x 5cm = 25 smaller cubes.
7. The total number of faces of the smaller cubes is 6 x (5cm x 5cm x 1cm) = 150 faces.
8. The number of faces that remain unpainted is 150 faces - (25 cubes x 4 faces) = 50 faces.
Action: Answer("C")
