## System:
You are an expert in Science.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Topic: Science
Question: Sheep Challenge Evolution A species of sheep lives on the Scottish island of Hirta. Hirta has plenty of grass for the sheep to eat, and no natural predators of the sheep live on the island. Some sheep have dark wool, and some have light wool. The sheep with dark wool tend to be much larger and stronger than the sheep with light wool. However, researchers have found that in the last 20 years, the sheep with light wool have increased in number. Usually, strength and size help animals survive and breed. A new sheep predator is introduced to the island. Which change to the sheep population will most likely occur first?
Choices:
  A: a decrease in the population of sheep with dark wool
  B: a decrease in the population of sheep with light wool
  C: an increase in the population of sheep with dark wool
  D: an increase in the population of sheep with light wool

You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:** My reasoning was flawed because I focused on the existing trend of increasing light-wool sheep without considering the impact of the new predator. I assumed the existing trend would continue without considering the change in the environment.
**Error Keywords:**
*   Incorrect extrapolation
*   Ignoring environmental change
*   Misinterpretation of trend
**Solution:**
1.  **Analyze the situation:** The introduction of a predator changes the selection pressure on the sheep population.
2.  **Consider the predator's impact:** Predators are more likely to catch and kill weaker, slower prey.
3.  **Apply this to the sheep:** Dark wool sheep are larger and stronger, making them better equipped to escape or defend against predators.
4.  **Predict the outcome:** The population of light wool sheep, being weaker and more vulnerable, will likely decrease first.
**Instructions for Future Similar Problems:**
1.  **Identify the initial conditions and any changes to the environment.**
2.  **Analyze how the environmental change affects the selection pressures on the population.**
3.  **Consider the traits of different individuals and how they relate to the new selection pressures.**
4.  **Predict the population changes based on which traits provide an advantage in the new environment.**
**General Advice:**
*   **Always consider the full context of the situation, including any changes to the environment.**
*   **Avoid assuming that existing trends will continue without considering external factors.**
*   **Focus on the specific selection pressures introduced by the change and how they affect different individuals.**
*   **Think critically about the advantages and disadvantages of different traits in the new context.**
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The introduction of a predator will change the selection pressure to favor stronger, faster sheep, which are the dark wool sheep. 
Action: Answer("B") 
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
