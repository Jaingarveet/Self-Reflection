Context: Although Pluto has an atmosphere and is much larger than any asteroid, Pluto is not a true planet. Pluto formed in orbit around the planet Neptune and was then ejected from orbit around Neptune when Triton, Neptune's largest moon, was captured by Neptune's gravity.
Question: The conclusion of the argument follows logically if which one of the following is assumed?
Choices:
  A: No celestial body can simultaneously be a moon and a planet.
  B: Not all celestial bodies that have an atmosphere and orbit the sun are true planets.
  C: If Pluto had not been ejected from its orbit around Neptune, Pluto would not have its current orbit around the sun and would still be a moon.
  D: The size of a celestial body in orbit around the sun is not relevant to determining whether or not it is a true planet.
  E: For a celestial body to be a true planet it must have formed in orbit around the sun exclusively.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The argument states that Pluto is not a true planet because it was ejected from orbit around Neptune when Triton was captured by Neptune's gravity. Therefore, the assumption must be related to this fact.
Option A is incorrect because there are celestial bodies that can be both a moon and a planet.
Option B is a possible assumption because it suggests that having an atmosphere and orbiting the sun are not sufficient conditions to be a true planet.
Option C is not necessary to the argument because it does not explain why Pluto is not a true planet.
Option D is incorrect because the size of a celestial body is relevant to determining whether or not it is a true planet.
Option E is incorrect because it is not necessary for a celestial body to form in orbit around the sun exclusively to be a true planet.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: E
Score: 0
