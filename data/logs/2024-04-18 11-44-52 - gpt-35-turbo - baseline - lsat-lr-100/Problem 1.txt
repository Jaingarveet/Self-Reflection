Context: It is difficult to grow cacti in a humid climate. It is difficult to raise orange trees in a cold climate. In most parts of a certain country, it is either easy to grow cacti or easy to raise orange trees.
Question: If the statements above are true, which one of the following must be false?
Choices:
  A: Half of the country is both humid and cold.
  B: Most of the country is hot.
  C: Some parts of the country are neither cold nor humid.
  D: It is not possible to raise cacti in the country.
  E: Most parts of the country are humid.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The statements above imply that the country is divided into two regions: one where it is easy to grow cacti and the other where it is easy to raise orange trees. 
If most parts of the country are hot, then it is likely that the region where it is easy to grow cacti is hot and the region where it is easy to raise orange trees is not hot. 
If some parts of the country are neither cold nor humid, then it is possible that these parts belong to the region where it is easy to grow cacti.
If it is not possible to raise cacti in the country, then the statement that it is easy to grow cacti in some parts of the country must be false.
Action: Answer("D")
