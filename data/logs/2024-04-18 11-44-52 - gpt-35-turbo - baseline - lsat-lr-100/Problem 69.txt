You are an expert in Law.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Topic: Law
Context: Some scientists have expressed reservations about quantum theory because of its counterintuitive consequences. But despite rigorous attempts to show that quantum theory's predictions were inaccurate, they were shown to be accurate within the generally accepted statistical margin of error. These results, which have not been equaled by quantum theory's competitors, warrant acceptance of quantum theory.
Question: Which one of the following principles most helps to justify the reasoning above?
Choices:
  A: A scientific theory should be accepted if it has fewer counterintuitive consequences than do its competitors.
  B: A scientific theory should be accepted if it has been subjected to serious attempts to disprove it and has withstood all of them.
  C: The consequences of a scientific theory should not be considered counterintuitive if the theory's predictions have been found to be accurate.
  D: A theory should not be rejected until it has been subjected to serious attempts to disprove it.
  E: A theory should be accepted only if its predictions have not been disproved by experiment.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The argument is about the justification of accepting quantum theory despite its counterintuitive consequences. The argument states that rigorous attempts to disprove quantum theory have failed, and its predictions have been accurate within the generally accepted statistical margin of error. 
Action: Answer("B") 
Justification: 
Option B states that a scientific theory should be accepted if it has been subjected to serious attempts to disprove it and has withstood all of them. This principle justifies the reasoning in the argument that despite attempts to disprove quantum theory, it has withstood all of them and its predictions have been accurate. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
