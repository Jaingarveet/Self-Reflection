Context: A computer game publisher has recently released its latest adventure game. The game's inventive puzzles and compelling plot induce even casual players to become preoccupied with completing it. The game can be purchased from retail outlets or rented for two-day intervals. The publisher offers a rebate equal to the cost of one rental for renters who go on to purchase the game, saving them a significant portion of the purchase price. Since the rate of sales now meets expectations and rentals are exceeding expectations, the publisher predicts that soon sales of the game will also exceed expectations.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to justify the publisher's prediction?
Choices:
  A: The game can be purchased directly from the publisher as well as from retailers.
  B: It takes several weeks for most players to complete the game.
  C: The publisher's games are among the most popular computer games on the market.
  D: Most people who complete the game do not play it extensively afterward.
  E: Some people buy and complete the game and then give it away to a friend.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The publisher predicts that soon sales of the game will also exceed expectations.
We need to find an option that supports the prediction.
Action: Answer("B") 
Explanation: 
If it takes several weeks for most players to complete the game, then they will have to rent the game multiple times before they can complete it. This will increase the rental revenue for the publisher. Additionally, if players are spending several weeks on the game, it is likely that they are enjoying it and will be more likely to purchase it after completing it. This justifies the publisher's prediction that sales of the game will soon exceed expectations.
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
