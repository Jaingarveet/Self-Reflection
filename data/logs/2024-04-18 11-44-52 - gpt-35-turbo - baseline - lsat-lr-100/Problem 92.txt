Context: Museum curakor: Our ancient Egyptian collection includes an earthenware hippopotamus that resembles a child's roy. It was discovered in a tomb, upside down, with its legs broken off. We know that the ancient Egyptians believed the dead had to wage eternal war with beasts. Breaking the legs off a representation of an animal was thought to help a deceased person in this war. We conclude that, far from being a roy, this hippopotamus was a religious object.
Question: Which one of the following is an assumption required by the curator's argument?
Choices:
  A: The tomb in which the hippopotamus was found was not the tomb of a child.
  B: Earthenware figures were never used as children's roys in ancient Egypt.
  C: The tomb in which the hippopotamus was found was not reentered from the time of burial until archaeologists opened it.
  D: The hippopotamus' legs were not broken 1hrough some natural occurrence after it was placed in the tomb.
  E: The hippopotamus was originally placed upside down in the tomb.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The curator argues that the earthenware hippopotamus was not a child's toy but a religious object based on the belief of ancient Egyptians that breaking the legs off a representation of an animal would help a deceased person in their eternal war with beasts. Therefore, the assumption required by the curator's argument should support this conclusion.
Action: Answer("D") 
The hippopotamus' legs were not broken through some natural occurrence after it was placed in the tomb. This assumption supports the curator's argument that the hippopotamus was not a child's toy but a religious object because the legs were intentionally broken off to serve a religious purpose.
