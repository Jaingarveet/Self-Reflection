## User 2:
Topic: Law
Context: Editorial: Cell-phone usage on buses and trains is annoying to other passengers. This suggests that recent proposals to allow use of cell phones on airplanes are ill-advised. Cell-phone use would be far more upsetting on airplanes than it is on buses and trains. Airline passengers are usually packed in tightly. And if airline passengers are offended by the cell-phone excesses of their seatmates, they often cannot move to another seat.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes the role played in the editorial's argument by the statement that cell-phone use would be far more upsetting on airplanes than it is on buses and trains?
Choices:
  A: It is the main conclusion of the argument.
  B: It is a claim that the argument tries to rebut.
  C: It is a premise that indirectly supports the main conclusion of the argument by supporting a premise for that conclusion.
  D: It is a conclusion for which support is provided and that itself is used in turn to directly support the argument's main conclusion.
  E: It provides background information that plays no role in the reasoning in the argument.

## Assistant 2:
  Reflection:
I previously answered this question as follows:

"I believe the correct answer is (B) It is a claim that the argument tries to rebut. The editorial argues that recent proposals to allow cell phone use on airplanes are ill-advised, and the statement that cell phone use would be far more upsetting on airplanes than it is on buses and trains is used to support this argument by highlighting the potential disruptions and annoyances that could arise if cell phone use is allowed on airplanes. Therefore, this statement is being used to rebut the idea that cell phone use on airplanes is a good idea."

However, upon further reflection, I realize that the correct answer is (C) It is a premise that indirectly supports the main conclusion of the argument by supporting a premise for that conclusion. The editorial argues that cell phone use on airplanes would be more disruptive than on buses and trains, and this statement is used to support the premise that airline passengers are more likely to be affected by cell phone use than passengers on other forms of transportation. This premise, in turn, indirectly supports the main conclusion of the argument by providing a reason why allowing cell phone use on airplanes is a bad idea.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) It is a premise that indirectly supports the main conclusion of the argument by supporting a premise for that conclusion.
