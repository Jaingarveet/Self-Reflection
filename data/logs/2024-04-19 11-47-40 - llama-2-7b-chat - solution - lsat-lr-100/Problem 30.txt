Topic: Law
Context: Larew: People in the lowest income quintile had a much higher percentage increase in average income over the last ten years than did those in the highest quintile. So their economic prosperity increased relative to the highest quintile's. Mendota: I disagree. The average income for the lowest quintile may have increased by a greater percentage, but the absolute amount of the increase in average income was surely greater for the highest quintile.
Question: Larew and Mendota disagree about whether
Choices:
  A: change in the economic prosperity of the lowest income quintile relative to the highest is accurately measured by comparing their percentage changes in average income
  B: change in the economic prosperity of the lowest income quintile is more accurately measured in terms relative to the highest income quintile than in terms relative only to the lowest income quintile
  C: changes in the average income of people in the lowest quintile should ever be compared to changes in the average income of people in the highest quintile
  D: there were any improvements at all in the economic situation of those in the lowest income quintile during the ten years being considered
  E: the average income of people in the lowest quintile increased by a greater percentage over the last decade than did that of people in the highest quintile

  Topic: Law
Question: Larew and Mendota disagree about whether

Action: Answer("A")

Explanation:
Larew and Mendota are correct in their respective arguments. The percentage change in average income provides a more accurate measure of the relative change in economic prosperity between the two groups, rather than just looking at the absolute amount of the increase in average income. The absolute amount of the increase in average income may be greater for the highest quintile, but the percentage change in average income is a more meaningful measure of the relative change in economic prosperity. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) change in the economic prosperity of the lowest income quintile relative to the highest is accurately measured by comparing their percentage changes in average income.
