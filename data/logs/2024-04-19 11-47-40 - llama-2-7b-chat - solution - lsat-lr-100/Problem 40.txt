Topic: Law
Context: A significant amount of the acquisition budget of a typical university library is spent on subscriptions to scholarly journals. Over the last several years, the average subscription rate a library pays for such a journal has increased dramatically, even though the costs of publishing a scholarly journal have remained fairly constant Obviously, then, in most cases publishing a scholarly journal must be much more profitable now than it was several years ago.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument?
Choices:
  A: Many university libraries have begun to charge higher and higher fines for overdue books and periodicals as a way of passing on increased journal subscription costs to library users.
  B: A university library's acquisition budget usually represents only a small fraction of its total operating budget.
  C: Publishing a scholarly journal is an expensive enterprise, and publishers of such journals cannot survive financially if they consistently lose money.
  D: Most subscnbers to scholarly journals are individuals, not hbraries, and the subscription rates for individuals have generally remained unchanged for the past several years.
  E: The majority of scholarly journals are published no more than four times a year.

## Assistant 2:
  Topic: Law
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument?

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and after reflecting on the problem, my solution, and the correct answer, I realized that I made a mistake. Here is my revised answer:

The correct answer is (C): Publishing a scholarly journal is an expensive enterprise, and publishers of such journals cannot survive financially if they consistently lose money.

Explanation:
The argument assumes that the increase in subscription rates for scholarly journals is due to the journals becoming more profitable. However, if publishing a scholarly journal is an expensive enterprise and publishers cannot consistently lose money, then it is possible that the increase in subscription rates is not due to increased profitability, but rather due to other factors such as increased demand or a lack of alternative sources. Therefore, option (C) most seriously weakens the argument.
