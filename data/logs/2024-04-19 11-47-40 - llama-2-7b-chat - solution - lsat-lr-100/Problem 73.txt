Context: Many people say that the press should not pry into the personal lives of private individuals. But the press has the right to publish any story of interest to the public unless that story is libelous. So, if a story about a private individual is not libelous, the press has an obligation to publish it, for such information is clearly of interest to the public.

Question: The argument's reasoning is vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that the argument presumes, without giving warrant, that

Reflection:

Upon further reflection, I realize that my previous answer was incorrect. The argument's reasoning is indeed vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it assumes without justification that the press has an obligation to publish nonlibelous stories about private individuals without prying into their personal lives.

The correct answer is (B) One's having a right to do something entails one's having an obligation to do it. The argument assumes that the press has a right to publish stories of interest to the public, but it does not follow that the press has an obligation to do so without proper justification.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) One's having a right to do something entails one's having an obligation to do it.
