Context: Most people who shop for groceries no more than three times a month buy prepared frozen dinners regularly. In Hallstown most people shop for groceries no more than three times a month. Therefore, in Hallstown most people buy prepared frozen dinners regularly.
Question: Which one of the following arguments has a flawed pattern of reasoning most like the flawed reasoning in the argument above?
Choices:

  B: It is clear that John cannot drive, since he does not own a car and no one in his family who does not own a car can drive.
  C: It is clear that Fernando's friends usually drive to school, since all of his friends can drive and all of his friends go to school.
  D: It is clear that most people in Highland County drive sedans, since most people who commute to work drive sedans and most people in Highland County commute to work.
  E: It is clear that most of Janine's friends are good drivers, since she accepts rides only from good drivers and she accepts rides from most of her friends.

## Assistant 2:
  Topic: Law
Question: Which one of the following arguments has a flawed pattern of reasoning most like the flawed reasoning in the argument above?

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and upon reflection, I realized that I made a mistake in my reasoning. Here is my self-reflection:

* I incorrectly assumed that the argument was trying to prove that most people in Hallstown buy prepared frozen dinners regularly, when in fact, the argument is trying to prove that most people in Hallstown shop for groceries no more than three times a month.
* I misunderstood the conclusion of the argument and thought it was trying to prove a different statement.

To answer the question correctly, I will analyze each of the options and determine which one has a flawed pattern of reasoning most like the flawed reasoning in the argument above.

Option A: It is clear that most drivers in West Ansland are safe drivers since there are very few driving accidents in West Ansland and most accidents there are not serious.

Flawed pattern of reasoning: This argument is similar to the original argument in that it makes a conclusion based on a small sample size. Just like in the original argument, there is no evidence to suggest that the sample size of drivers in West Ansland is representative of the entire population of drivers in Hallstown. Therefore, this argument also has a flawed pattern of reasoning.

Option B: It is clear that John cannot drive, since he does not own a car and no one in his family who does not own a car can drive.

Flawed pattern of reasoning: This argument is similar to the original argument in that it makes a conclusion based on a single piece of information. Just like in the original argument, there is no evidence to suggest that John's inability to drive is representative of the entire population of drivers in Hallstown. Therefore, this argument also has a flawed pattern of reasoning.

Option C: It is clear that Fernando's friends usually drive to school, since all of his friends can drive and all of his friends go to school.

Flawed pattern of reasoning: This argument is similar to the original argument in that it makes a conclusion based on a small sample size. Just like in the original argument, there is no evidence to suggest that the sample size of Fernando's friends is representative of the entire population of students in Hallstown. Therefore, this argument also has a flawed pattern of reasoning.

Option D: It is clear that most people in Highland County drive sedans, since most people who commute to work drive sedans and most people in Highland County commute to work.

Flawed pattern of reasoning: This argument is similar to the original argument in that it makes a conclusion based on a correlation between two pieces of information. Just like in the original argument, there is no evidence to suggest that the correlation between commuting to work and driving a sedan is representative of the entire population of drivers in Hallstown. Therefore, this argument also has a flawed pattern of reasoning.

Option E: It is clear that most of Janine's friends are good drivers, since she accepts rides only from good drivers and she accepts rides from most of her friends.

Flawed pattern of reasoning: This argument is similar to the original argument in that it makes a conclusion based on a small sample size. Just like in the original argument, there is no evidence to suggest that the sample size of Janine's friends is representative of the entire population of drivers in Hallstown. Therefore, this argument also has a flawed pattern of reasoning.

Conclusion:
The option that has a flawed pattern of reasoning most like the flawed reasoning in the argument above is Option D: It is clear that most people in Highland County drive sedans, since most people who commute to work drive sedans and most people in Highland County commute to work. This argument makes a conclusion based on a correlation between two pieces of information, just like the original argument. Therefore, it also has a flawed pattern of reasoning.
