## User 2:
Topic: Law
Context: Ethicist: Marital vows often contain the promise to love "until death do us part." If "love" here refers to a feeling, then this promise makes no sense, for feelings are not within one's control, and a promise to do something not within one's control makes no sense. Thus, no one—including those making marital vows—should take "love" in this context to be referring to feelings.
Question: The ethicist's conclusion follows logically if which one of the following is assumed?
Choices:
  A: None of our feelings are within our control.
  B: People should not make promises to do something that is not within their control.
  C: "Love" can legitimately be taken to refer to something other than feelings.
  D: Promises should not be interpreted in such a way that they make no sense.
  E: Promises that cannot be kept do not make any sense.

## Assistant 2:
  Topic: Law
Question: The ethicist's conclusion follows logically if which one of the following is assumed?

Reflection:
After initially answering the question incorrectly, I realized that the ethicist's argument relies on the assumption that "love" in marital vows should not be interpreted as a feeling. The ethicist argues that since feelings are not within one's control, a promise to love until death do us part makes no sense.

To answer the question correctly, we need to identify the assumption that logically follows the ethicist's argument. The correct answer is (B) People should not make promises to do something that is not within their control.

Explanation:
The ethicist's argument is that since feelings are not within one's control, a promise to love until death do us part is meaningless. This conclusion follows logically if we assume that people should not make promises to do something that is not within their control. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) People should not make promises to do something that is not within their control.

Action: Answer("B")
