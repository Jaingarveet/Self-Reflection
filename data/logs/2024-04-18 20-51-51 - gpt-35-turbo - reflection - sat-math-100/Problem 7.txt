Third, solve the problem again, step-by-step, based on your knowledge of the correct answer.
Fourth, create a list of detailed instructions to help you correctly solve this problem in the future.
Finally, create a list of general advice to help you solve similar types of problems in the future.  
Be concise in your response; however, capture all of the essential information.  
For guidance, I will provide you with a single generic example problem and reflection (below).
## User 1:
Topic: Geography and Math
Question: What is the product of the number of letters contained in the name of the city where Iowa State University is located multiplied by the number of letters contained in the name of the state?
Choices:
    A: 16
    B: 20
    C: 24
    D: 32
Thought:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
ISU is located in the state of Iowa.
Action: Answer("D")
---
Correct Answer: A
## Assistant 1:
Explanation:
I miscalculated the product of the number of letters in the city and state names. 
The gap in my knowledge was not in geography but in basic arithmetic. 
I knew the correct city and state but made a calculation error.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Arithmetic error
 - Multiplication error
Solution:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
Iowa State University is located in the state of Iowa.
The city name "Ames" contains 4 letters.
The state name "Iowa" contains 4 letters.
The product of 4*4 is 16.
Instructions:
1. Identify the city where the university is located.
2. Identify the state where the university is located.
3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.
4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.
5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.
6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.
7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them.
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: For $i=\sqrt{-1}$, what is the sum $(7+3 i)+(-8+9 i) ?$
Choices:
  A: $-1+12 i$
  B: $-1-6 i$
  C: $15+12 i$
  D: $15-6 i$ 3

Thought:
Add the real parts and imaginary parts separately.
Action: Answer("B")

 --- 
Correct Answer: A
## Assistant 2:
Response:
Explanation:
I made an error in adding the imaginary parts. 
I added $3i+9i$ to get $12i$ instead of $12i$.
Error Keywords:
 - Addition error
 - Imaginary number error
 - Complex number error
Solution:
$(7+3i)+(-8+9i)=7+(-8)+(3i+9i)=-1+12i$
Instructions:
1. Identify the real and imaginary parts of each complex number.
2. Add the real parts together.
3. Add the imaginary parts together.
4. Combine the results from steps 2 and 3 to form the sum of the two complex numbers.
5. Write the answer in the form $a+bi$.
6. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
7. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that the sum of two complex numbers is the sum of their real parts plus the sum of their imaginary parts.
