## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Professor Zhao said that the champion is not Tsinghua University or Zhejiang University.
Professor Qian said that the champion is not Tsinghua University but the University of Science and Technology of China.
Professor Sun said that the champion is not the China University of Science and Technology team but the Tsinghua University team.
Only one of them judged both, one 'S judgment is one-to-one wrong, the other one is wrong.
If Professor Zhao is correct, then the winner is either the University of Science and Technology of China or Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics.
If Professor Qian is correct, then the winner is the University of Science and Technology of China.
If Professor Sun is correct, then the winner is Tsinghua University.
If Professor Zhao is wrong, then the winner is either Tsinghua University or China University of Science and Technology.
If Professor Qian is wrong, then the winner is either Tsinghua University or Zhejiang University.
If Professor Sun is wrong, then the winner is either China University of Science and Technology or Zhejiang University.
Since only one of them judged both, one 'S judgment is one-to-one wrong, the other one is wrong. This means that Professor Zhao and Professor Qian are wrong, and Professor Sun is correct. Therefore, the winner is Tsinghua University.
Action: Answer("A")
