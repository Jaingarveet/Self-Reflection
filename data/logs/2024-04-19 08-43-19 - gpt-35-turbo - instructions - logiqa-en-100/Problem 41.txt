Context: Due to recent market changes, Green Island must increase productivity by 10% over the next two years, otherwise it will go bankrupt.In fact, from the perspective of Green Island's production and management structure, if it can increase productivity by 10%, then it can achieve the goal of increasing productivity by 20%.
Question: If the above statement is true, which of the following statements must be true?
Choices:
  A: If Green Island cannot achieve its goal of increasing productivity by 20%, it will go bankrupt.
  B: In the next two years, if Green Island increases productivity by 20%, it will not go bankrupt.
  C: If the market does not change, Green Island does not need to increase productivity to prevent bankruptcy.
  D: In the next two years, Green Island may increase productivity by 10%, but it is impossible to achieve the goal of increasing by 20%.
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and understand the problem.
2. Identify the conditional statement and its contrapositive.
3. Consider all possible outcomes based on the given information.
4. Choose the answer that must be true based on the given information.
5. Double-check your reasoning to ensure accuracy.
## Assistant 2:
Self-reflection:
The conditional statement is "if Green Island can increase productivity by 10%, then it can achieve the goal of increasing productivity by 20%." The contrapositive is "if Green Island cannot achieve the goal of increasing productivity by 20%, then it cannot increase productivity by 10%." Based on this information, we know that if Green Island can increase productivity by 10%, it will not go bankrupt. Therefore, statement B must be true. Statement A is not necessarily true because there may be other factors that could cause Green Island to go bankrupt. Statement C is not true because the market changes have already occurred. Statement D is not necessarily true because it is possible for Green Island to achieve the goal of increasing productivity by 20% if it increases productivity by 10%. 
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
