## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The argument seems to suggest that it is impossible to distinguish between true and false because everyone has prejudices. It then proposes that we can only judge with someone who shares our opinion, but this person cannot judge because they have the same opinion. It then suggests that we can only judge with people who have different opinions, but they cannot judge because they have different opinions. The argument seems to be caught in a loop and does not provide a clear solution to the problem.
Action: Answer("D")

Agent Answer: D
