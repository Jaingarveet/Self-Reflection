## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Option A is not a strong argument against the claim made in the argument because it only talks about the turnover and not the volume of Chinese buyers.
Option C is not a strong argument against the claim made in the argument because it talks about real estate speculators in Beijing and Shanghai, but the question is about Chinese buyers in the US.
Option D is a strong argument against the claim made in the argument because it provides an alternative explanation for why Chinese buyers are investing in US real estate. It suggests that the US real estate market has been a safe investment with a potential for appreciation.
