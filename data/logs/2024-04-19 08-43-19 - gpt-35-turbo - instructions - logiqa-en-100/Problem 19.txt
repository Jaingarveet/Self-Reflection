## Assistant 2:
Self-reflection:
The main point of the argument is that most people agree with the blogger's analysis of the future trend of housing prices. The evidence used to support the conclusion is that the blogger's analysis received more than 1,000 netizens' follow-up posts, and 85% of the follow-up posts agree with the blogger's opinion. The assumption made in the argument is that the netizens who follow the blogger's article are representative of the general population's opinion. 
My previous answer was incorrect because I did not address the main point of the argument. 
Answering the question:
Action: Answer("D") 
Explanation: 
Answer choice D questions the assumption made in the argument that the netizens who follow the blogger's article are representative of the general population's opinion. If most people who follow the blogger's article are their loyal fans, then the blogger's analysis may not be representative of the general population's opinion. Therefore, this answer best questions the validity of the blogger's conclusion.
