You are an expert in Logic.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

## User 2:
Topic: Logic
Context: There are five stations set up from west to east along a section of the high-speed railway along the river.It is known that Fuyi Station is east of Haoyun Station and West of Huyao Station, and is adjacent to Huyao Station; Jiushang Station is adjacent to Yinling Station.
Question: If Jiushang Station is adjacent to Haoyun Station and east of Haoyun Station, it can be concluded that?
Choices:
  A: Hu Yao is standing on the east side;
  B: Fuyi is standing in the west;
  C: Yinling is standing on the east side;
  D: Leek standing on the west side;
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I misunderstood the spatial relationships between the stations. I incorrectly placed Jiushang Station between Haoyun and Fuyi, when it should have been placed to the east of Haoyun but not necessarily immediately next to it. This led to an incorrect placement of Yinling Station as well.
Error Keywords:
- Spatial reasoning error
- Logical reasoning error
- Misinterpretation of clues
Solution:
From the context, we know that Fuyi Station is east of Haoyun Station and west of Huyao Station. This means that the order from west to east is Haoyun, Fuyi, Huyao. We also know that Jiushang Station is adjacent to Haoyun Station and east of Haoyun Station, so Jiushang could be placed either between Haoyun and Fuyi or to the east of Fuyi. However, since Jiushang Station is also adjacent to Yinling Station, the only possible order is Haoyun, Fuyi, Jiushang, Yinling, Huyao. Therefore, Huyao is standing on the east side.
Instructions:
1. Understand the spatial relationships between the stations from the context.
2. Start by placing the stations with known relationships.
3. Consider all possible placements for stations with multiple adjacent stations.
4. Make sure the final order respects all the given relationships.
5. Choose the answer that matches your final order.
Advice:
- Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
- Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
- Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
- Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
- Always double-check your reasoning and final answer.
- Remember that adjacency does not necessarily mean immediate adjacency.
