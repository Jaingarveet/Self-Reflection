Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misinterpreted the shift in focus. I thought the shift was from individual enterprise competition to industry-wide competition, but the correct interpretation is that the shift is from industry standards to individual enterprise performance.
Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation
- Contextual understanding
- Shift in focus
Solution:
The shift in question from "What should I do, what can I do to make money?" to "What can I do to be the best?" suggests a change in focus from simply making money to excelling in the industry. This shift implies that what used to be good or bad in the industry is now only good or bad for enterprises. Therefore, the correct answer is D.
