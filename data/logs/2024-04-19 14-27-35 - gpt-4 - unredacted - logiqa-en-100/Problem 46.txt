Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I overlooked the third condition, which states that if X is allocated in the sales department, W is allocated in the production department. This means that if G and X are both in the sales department, W would have to be in the production department, which would leave no room for F, who must be in the production department. Therefore, G and X cannot both be in the sales department.
Error Keywords:
- Overlooking conditions
- Misinterpretation
- Logic error
Solution:
1. Identify the conditions for each candidate's allocation.
2. F must be in the production department, so G cannot be in the production department.
3. If X is in the sales department, W must be in the production department.
4. Therefore, G and X cannot both be in the sales department because it would leave no room for F in the production department.
Instructions:
1. Read the question and conditions carefully.
2. Identify the conditions for each candidate's allocation.
3. Consider the implications of each condition.
4. Identify any conflicts between the conditions.
5. Use the conditions to eliminate impossible combinations.
6. Choose the answer that is not possible based on the conditions.
Advice:
- Always read the question and conditions carefully.
- Understand the implications of each condition.
- Consider the relationships between the conditions.
- Use the conditions to eliminate impossible combinations.
- Double-check your answer to ensure it meets all conditions.
