Context: It is no longer new for college students to take vacation as a nanny.A survey showed that 63% of the respondents favored college students as nanny, but when asked if they would ask college students to be nanny, nearly 60% said "no".

Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misinterpreted the information provided in the options. I failed to recognize that option C provides a valid explanation for the contradiction: respondents favor college students as nannies because they believe it's beneficial for the students, not necessarily because they believe the students would provide better services. This explains why they might not hire them.
Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation
- Reading comprehension
- Logical reasoning
Solution:
The contradiction is that while a majority of respondents favor college students as nannies, a majority also would not hire them as such. The best explanation would be a reason that supports the idea of college students as nannies but also provides a reason why they would not be hired. 
Option C provides this explanation: Among those who favor college students as nanny, 69% think that doing housekeeping work is good for college students themselves, and only 31% think that college students nanny can provide better housekeeping services. This means that while they favor the idea for the benefit of the students, they do not necessarily believe the students would provide better services, hence they would not hire them.
Instructions:
1. Understand the contradiction in the question.
2. Read all the options carefully.
3. Identify the option that provides a reason supporting both sides of the contradiction.
4. Ensure the chosen option explains why respondents favor college students as nannies and also why they would not hire them.
5. Choose the answer that best explains the contradiction.
Advice:
- Always read the question and all options carefully.
- Understand the contradiction or problem in the question.
- Look for an option that provides a logical explanation for the contradiction.
- Practice logical reasoning problems to improve comprehension and interpretation skills.
