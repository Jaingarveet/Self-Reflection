## System:
You are an expert in Logic.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Topic: Logic
Context: There are five volcanic islands E, F, G, H, and I in the east coast of a country.They are arranged in a straight line from north to south, and they are found? (1) F is adjacent to H and is on the north side of H.(2) I and E are adjacent.(3) G is somewhere in the north of F.
Question: If it is found that G is the northernmost island, how many possible arrangements are there for this group of islands?
Choices:
  A: 2
  B: 3
  C: 4
  D: 5
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I overlooked one possible arrangement. I failed to consider that E and I could be adjacent in two different ways (E-I or I-E), and this led to an underestimation of the total number of possible arrangements.
Error Keywords:
- Overlooking possibilities
- Arrangement error
- Combinatorial error
Solution:
Given the conditions:
1. F is to the north of H (F-H)
2. I and E are adjacent (I-E or E-I)
3. G is to the north of F and is the northernmost island.
The possible arrangements are:
1. G-F-H-I-E
2. G-F-H-E-I
3. G-F-I-H-E
4. G-F-I-E-H
Instructions:
1. Understand the given conditions and constraints.
2. Identify the fixed positions based on the conditions.
3. Identify the variables that can change positions.
4. List all possible arrangements considering the conditions and constraints.
5. Count the total number of possible arrangements.
Advice:
- Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
- Break down the problem into smaller parts.
- Consider all possible arrangements or combinations.
- Double-check your solutions to ensure you haven't missed any possibilities.
- Practice more problems on arrangements and combinations to improve your skills.
