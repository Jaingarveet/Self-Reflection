Question: Sheep Challenge Evolution A species of sheep lives on the Scottish island of Hirta. Hirta has plenty of grass for the sheep to eat, and no natural predators of the sheep live on the island. Some sheep have dark wool, and some have light wool. The sheep with dark wool tend to be much larger and stronger than the sheep with light wool. However, researchers have found that in the last 20 years, the sheep with light wool have increased in number. Usually, strength and size help animals survive and breed. A new sheep predator is introduced to the island. Which change to the sheep population will most likely occur first?
Choices:
  A: a decrease in the population of sheep with dark wool
  B: a decrease in the population of sheep with light wool
  C: an increase in the population of sheep with dark wool
  D: an increase in the population of sheep with light wool

Explanation: 
I misinterpreted the question and applied an incorrect rule of natural selection. I assumed that the introduction of a predator would favor the traits of light wool and smaller size, leading to a decline in the dark-wool sheep population. However, the correct interpretation is that the presence of any predator, regardless of the specific traits it targets, will initially reduce the overall number of sheep, which are now easier prey. This results in a decrease in the population of light-wool sheep, as they were previously the dominant population on the island. 

Error Keywords: 
- Misinterpretation
- Incorrect rule application
- Natural selection misunderstanding

Solution: 
The question asks for the initial change in the sheep population following the introduction of a predator. The correct answer, B, reflects the understanding that the presence of any predator will first result in a decline in the overall number of sheep, which are now vulnerable to predation. This decrease will affect the more abundant light-wool sheep population first, as they are now more accessible to the predator. 

Instructions: 
1. Understand the current conditions on Hirta: an abundance of grass and no natural sheep predators. 
2. Recognize the key fact: the increase in light-wool sheep over the last 20 years, indicating their dominance in the population. 
3. Interpret the impact of the new predator: it will make sheep easier prey, leading to a decrease in their overall population. 
4. Identify the initial change: a decline in the number of light-wool sheep, as they are now the majority and more available to the predator. 
5. Choose the answer reflecting this initial decrease in light-wool sheep. 

Advice: 
 - Read the question and choices carefully to identify the specific changes predicted by each answer. 
 - Understand the current ecological balance on the island and the factors influencing it. 
 - Recognize that the introduction of a new predator will initially make all sheep more vulnerable, leading to a general decline in their population. 
 - Avoid making assumptions about specific traits favored by the predator without explicit information. 
 - Consider the law of small numbers: a decline in the majority population will be more noticeable at first.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Prior to the introduction of a predator, the sheep population on Hirta thrived due to an abundance of grass and the absence of natural predators. The key factor to consider is the recent increase in the population of sheep with light wool. 

With the introduction of a predator, the initial change will be a decrease in the overall population of sheep as they become prey. Given that the light-wool sheep have dominated in recent years, the first noticeable change will be a decrease in their numbers. This is due to their higher visibility and accessibility to the new predator. 

Answer: B - a decrease in the population of sheep with light wool.

Action: Answer("B")

Agent Answer: B
