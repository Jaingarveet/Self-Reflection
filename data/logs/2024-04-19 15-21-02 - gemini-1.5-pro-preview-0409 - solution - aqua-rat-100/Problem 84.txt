Solution:
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The key point I missed previously was that the chairs are identical. This means that switching Tim and Zen in the arrangement where Susan is in the middle doesn't create a new arrangement. 
Therefore, there are only 3 possible arrangements:
* Susan, Tim, Zen
* Tim, Susan, Zen
* Zen, Susan, Tim
Action: Answer("B") 
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
