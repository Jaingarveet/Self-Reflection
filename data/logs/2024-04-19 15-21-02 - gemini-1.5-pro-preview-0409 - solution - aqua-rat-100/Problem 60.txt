## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:
Topic: Geography
Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: Points A, B, C, D lie in this order on the circumference of a circle. Minor arc AC is 160°, and minor arc BD is 150°. If B bisects minor arc AC, then what is the measure of minor arc AD?
Choices:
  A: 80°
  B: 130°
  C: 140°
  D: 160°
  E: 220°
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
1. Since [REDACTED] bisects minor arc A[REDACTED], angle AB[REDACTED] = [REDACTED]/2 = [REDACTED].
2. Angle AB[REDACTED] is an inscribed angle, so it intercepts an arc twice its measure. Therefore, minor arc A[REDACTED] = 2 * [REDACTED] = [REDACTED] (which we already knew).
3.  Minor arc A[REDACTED] = [REDACTED]/2 = [REDACTED] (since [REDACTED] bisects arc AC).
4.  Minor arc C[REDACTED] = minor arc B[REDACTED] - minor arc B[REDACTED] = 150° - [REDACTED] = 70°.
5.  Minor arc A[REDACTED] = minor arc A[REDACTED] + minor arc B[REDACTED] = [REDACTED] + 70° = 150°.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The reflection clarifies the step-by-step process of finding the measure of minor arc AD. 
Following these steps with the given information will lead to the correct answer.
Action: Answer("C")
