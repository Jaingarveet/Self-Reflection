Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
Let x be the number of months [REDACTED] invested after [REDACTED] joined.
A's investment: 40,000 * 12 = 480,000 (amount * time)
B's investment: 60,000 * (12-2) = 600,000
C's investment: 120,000 * x
Ratio of their profits = Ratio of their investments
C's profit share / Total profit = C's investment / Total investment
150,000 / 375,000 = (120,000 * x) / (480,000 + 600,000 + 120,000x)
2/5 = x / (5 + x)
Solving for x, we get x = [REDACTED].
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The previous solution correctly set up the equation based on the ratio of investments and profit sharing. 
The error likely occurred in solving for x. Let's carefully solve the equation 2/5 = x / (5 + x).
