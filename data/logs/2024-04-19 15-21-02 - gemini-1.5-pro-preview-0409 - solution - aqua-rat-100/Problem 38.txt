## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The outer layer of the cube contains cubes with at least one face painted. 
We need to count the number of cubes that are not on the outer layer.
The inner cube will have dimensions 3cm x 3cm x 3cm as we remove 1cm from each side due to the thickness.
This inner cube contains 3 * 3 * 3 = 27 smaller cubes, all of which have no painted faces.
Action: Answer("E")
