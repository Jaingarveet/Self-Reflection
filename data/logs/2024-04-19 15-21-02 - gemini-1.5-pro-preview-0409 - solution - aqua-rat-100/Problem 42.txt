You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Question: A straight picket fence is composed of x pickets each of which is 1/2 inch wide. If there are 6 inches of space between each pair of pickets, which of the following represents the length of fence in feet?
Choices:
  A: 13x/2
  B: 13x/2 - 6
  C: 13x/24
  D: (13x+1)/24
  E: (13x-12)/24
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
Each picket is 0.5 inches wide, and each space is 6 inches wide.
So, each picket-space unit is 0.5 + 6 = 6.5 inches wide.
With x pickets, there are (x-1) spaces between them. 
Therefore, the total length of the fence in inches is 0.5x + 6(x-1) = 6.5x - 6.
Converting inches to feet (12 inches/foot) gives (6.5x - 6)/12 = (13x - 12)/24 feet.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
I recall this question and my previous error. 
The key is to account for both the width of the pickets and the spaces between them, then convert the total length from inches to feet.
Action: Answer("E") 
## Result:
Agent Answer: E
Correct Answer: E
