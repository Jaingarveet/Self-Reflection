Solution:
We need to find the number of ways to choose 2 letters (with repetition allowed) out of 26, and then 2 digits out of 10.
Number of ways to choose 2 letters (with repetition) = 26 * 26 = 676 
Number of ways to choose 2 digits = 10 * 10 = 100
Total number of distinct bike numbers = 676 * 100 = 67600
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The previous solution correctly calculated the total number of bike numbers but didn't address the distinct letters requirement. 
We need to ensure the two letters are different.
