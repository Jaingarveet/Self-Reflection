Question: Kevin drove from A to B at a constant speed of 70 mph. Once he reached B, he turned right around with pause, and returned to A at a constant speed of 90 mph. Exactly 3 hours before the end of his trip, he was still approaching B, only 70 miles away from it. What is the distance between A and B?
Choices:
  A: 180
  B: 90
  C: 270
  D: 360
  E: None of the above

Explanation: I made a mistake in setting up the equation and solving for the distance. I incorrectly assumed that the time taken to travel from A to B was equal to the time taken to travel back from B to A. This led me to incorrectly conclude that the total trip time was the sum of these two individual travel times. 

Error Keywords:
- Algebraic error
- Equation setup error
- Time calculation error

Solution: 

Let the distance between A and B be $x$ miles. 
Kevin drives at $70$ mph for $\frac{x}{70}$ hours. 
Then, he immediately drives back at $90$ mph for the same distance, taking $\frac{x}{90}$ hours. 
The total trip time is thus $\frac{x}{70} + \frac{x}{90} = \frac{16x}{630} = \frac{8x}{315}$. 

$3$ hours before the end of his trip, he was still approaching B. 
At this point, he had traveled for $\frac{8x}{315} - \frac{17}{6} = \frac{1}{6}$ hours. 
During this time, he covered the distance $(70 \text{ mph}) \times (\frac{1}{6} \text{ hour}) = \frac{35}{3}$ miles. 

The remaining distance to B is $70$ miles, so the total distance from A to B is $x = \frac{35}{3} + 70 = 175$ miles. 
Therefore, the correct answer is $A: 180$ miles. 

Instructions: 
1. Identify the given values: speed to location B ($70$ mph), speed returning to location A ($90$ mph), and time before the end of the trip when he was still approaching B ($3$ hours). 
2. Define the unknown value: let the distance between locations A and B be $x$ miles. 
3. Calculate the time taken to travel from A to B and from B to A, and express them in terms of $x$. 
4. Find the total trip time by adding the two times calculated in step 3. 
5. Set up an equation: the total trip time minus the time spent before arriving at B should equal the time it takes to cover the remaining $70$ miles. 
6. Solve the equation for $x$ to find the distance between A and B. 
7. Choose the answer option that matches your calculated result. 

Advice: 
 - Identify all given values and clearly define unknowns. 
 - Break down the problem into smaller, manageable steps. 
 - Translate words into mathematical expressions and equations. 
 - Always double-check your equations and ensure they accurately represent the problem. 
 - Solve equations step-by-step to avoid errors in algebraic manipulation. 
 - Pay attention to units and ensure they are consistent throughout your calculations. 
 - Practice similar types of problems to improve your familiarity and accuracy.

The total trip time is thus $\frac{x}{70} + \frac{x}{90} = \frac{16x}{630} = \frac{8x}{315}$. 

$3$ hours before the end of his trip, he was still approaching B. 
At this point, he had traveled for $\frac{8x}{315} - 3 = -\frac{17}{6}$ hours. 
During this time, he covered the distance $(70 \text{ mph}) \times (-\frac{17}{6} \text{ hour}) = \frac{35}{3}$ miles. 

The remaining distance to B is $70$ miles, so the total distance from A to B is $x = \frac{35}{3} + 70 = 175$ miles. 
This means the answer is $A: 180$.
