## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:
Topic: Geography
Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")

Choices:
  A: 3km
  B: 2km
  C: 4km

Explanation: 
I incorrectly applied Pythagoras' theorem to find the distance. The east-west and south-north displacements are not perpendicular, and the former is not the hypotenuse of a right triangle. The correct approach is to consider the net displacement in each direction.

Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation
- Incorrect theorem application
- Geometry error

Solution: 
A travels 3 km south, 5 km east, 3 km north, and 2 km west. The net displacement to the south and north cancels out, leaving A 3 km to the east and 2 km to the north of the starting point. These displacements are not perpendicular, so we calculate them separately. Thus, A is 3 km away from home.

Instructions:
1. Understand the problem: A travels in different directions and wants to know the final distance from home.
2. Identify the net displacement in each direction: south-north cancels out, leaving 3 km east and 2 km north.
3. Recognize that the east-west and south-north displacements are independent and not perpendicular.
4. Calculate the distance for each direction separately: 3 km east and 2 km north from the starting point.
5. Choose the answer that matches the calculated distance from home.

Advice:
- Understand the geometry of the problem and the directions involved.
- Recognize that displacements in different directions may not always result in a right triangle.
- Calculate net displacements separately for each direction.
- Be cautious when applying mathematical theorems and ensure their conditions are met.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
A travels a total of 3 km to the south and north (which cancel each other out) and 5 km to the east and west. So, A is 5 km away from home.

Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
