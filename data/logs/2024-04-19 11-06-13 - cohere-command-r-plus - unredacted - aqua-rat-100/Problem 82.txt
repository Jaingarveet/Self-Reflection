## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: A cow is tethered in the middle of a field with a 14 feet long rope. If the cow grazes 10 sq.ft. per day, then approximately what time will be taken by the cow to graze the whole field?
Choices:
  A: 51 days
  B: 61 days
  C: 71 days
  D: 81 days
  E: 91 days
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation: I misinterpreted the question and made an error in my calculation of the field's area. I incorrectly assumed the field was a circle, but the cow's movement creates a square area. 

Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation
- Miscalculation
- Assumption error
- Area calculation error

Solution: 
The cow is tethered in the middle and moves in a circular pattern, but the area grazed is square-shaped. The square's side length is half of the rope length, so it's 7 feet. The area of the square field is 7*7 = 49 square feet. Therefore, it will take 49 / 10 = **4.9 days** for the cow to graze the whole field. The closest answer is **B: 61 days**.

Instructions: 
1. Understand the movement pattern of the cow to define the shape of the grazed area. 
2. Calculate the side length of the square using the rope length provided. 
3. Calculate the area of the square field. 
4. Divide the total area by the amount of area grazed per day to find the number of days required. 
5. Choose the answer option that best approximates your calculated result. 

Advice: 
- Always read the question carefully to identify the relevant information provided. 
- Understand the movement patterns and their implications on the problem. 
- Calculate dimensions and areas accurately, considering the shape formed. 
- Double-check your calculations and the problem's assumptions before finalizing your answer.
