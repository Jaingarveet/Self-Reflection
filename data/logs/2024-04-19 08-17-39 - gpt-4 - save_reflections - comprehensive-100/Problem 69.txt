## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I made a mistake in the subtraction of the equations. I subtracted the coefficients of the variables correctly, but I made an error when subtracting the constants on the right side of the equations. 
Error Keywords:
- Calculation error
- Arithmetic error
- Subtraction error
Solution:
Subtract the second equation from the first:
(2x - 3x) - (3y - 2y) = -14 - (-6)
-1x - 1y = -14 - (-6)
or
x - y = -14 - (-6)
x - y = -14 + 6
x - y = -8
Instructions:
1. Identify the two equations in the system.
2. Subtract the second equation from the first.
3. Subtract the coefficients of the variables correctly.
4. Subtract the constants on the right side of the equations correctly.
5. Simplify the equation to find the value of x - y.
6. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
7. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
- Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
- Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
- Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
- Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
- Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
- Remember to correctly subtract the constants on the right side of the equations.
