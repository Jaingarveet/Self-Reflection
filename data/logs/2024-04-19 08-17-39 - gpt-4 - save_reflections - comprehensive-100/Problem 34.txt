## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I focused on the commute time of the employees, rather than considering the financial implications of the move. The argument is based on the premise that most employees cannot afford housing within a 30-minute commute of Ocean View, which implies that there will not be a significant pay raise to accommodate the increased cost of living. 
Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation
- Financial implications
- Assumption error
Solution:
The argument is based on the premise that most Acme employees cannot afford housing within a 30-minute commute of Ocean View. This implies that the employees' salaries will not increase significantly to accommodate the increased cost of living in Ocean View. Therefore, the argument requires assuming that Acme's move to Ocean View will not be accompanied by a significant pay raise for Acme employees. The correct answer is E.
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and understand the argument.
2. Identify the underlying assumptions in the argument.
3. Consider all aspects of the argument, including financial implications.
4. Choose the answer that best fits the assumptions required for the argument to hold true.
Advice:
- Always read the question carefully and understand the argument.
- Identify the underlying assumptions in the argument.
- Consider all aspects of the argument, not just the most obvious ones.
- Be aware of financial implications in legal scenarios.
- Always double-check your answer to ensure it fits the argument.
