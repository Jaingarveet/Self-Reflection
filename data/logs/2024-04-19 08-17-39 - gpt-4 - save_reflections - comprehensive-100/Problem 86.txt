# Model: gpt-4 | Task: save_reflection | Exam: comprehensive-100 | Problem 86 of 100
## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I didn't consider the context of the question. The question was asking for the completion of the text, not necessarily the next step in a process. The correct answer was providing additional information about the website addresses for different countries, which is relevant to the previous step of searching for "olx (your country)".
Error Keywords:
- Context error
- Interpretation error
- Process error
Solution:
The question is asking for the completion of the text. The previous step mentioned searching for "olx (your country)". The correct completion to this would be to provide examples of how the website address varies based on the country selected, which is what option C does.
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and understand what it is asking for.
2. Consider the context of the question.
3. Identify the relevant information from the previous steps.
4. Choose the answer that logically completes the text based on the context and the previous steps.
Advice:
- Always read the question carefully and understand what it is asking for.
- Consider the context of the question.
- Don't assume the question is asking for the next step in a process if it's asking for the completion of a text.
- Always consider the information provided in the previous steps when choosing an answer.
