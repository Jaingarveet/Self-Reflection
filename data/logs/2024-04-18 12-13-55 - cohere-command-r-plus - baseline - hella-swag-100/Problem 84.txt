Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to make eggplant fritters [title] Slice the eggplant into 3 mm (1/8 of an inch, or 1/3 of a cm) thick slices. [step] You can slice in rounds or lengths; the preference is yours but round slices tend to be easier to handle. [title] Soak in salted water for 10 minutes.
Choices:
  A: [step] This is to insure that they don't taste salty. [title] Carefully pour the chicken stock over the eggplant slices.
  B: [step] Remove the eggplant from the water and allow to sit in the salted water for 30 minutes. Then remove from the water and wring out the excess liquid.
  C: [step] The cooking time varies; you can cover the dish with something like a lid or spread olive oil over the top; however, for this recipe , 2 to 3 minutes of added cooking time should be fine. [title] Drain the eggplant in a colander.
  D: [substeps] Drain after 10 minutes and leave to one side for later use. [title] Beat the egg with a quarter teaspoon of fine salt.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The text describes steps in a recipe, so the completion should logically be a continuation of this.
Choices A and C do not make sense in the context of the recipe and seem to be illogical or incorrect.
Choice B seems to be a misstatement or incorrect instruction, as it says to let the eggplant sit in salted water for 30 minutes, which contradicts the previous instruction to soak for only 10 minutes.
Choice D is the most logical and sensible completion, as it instructs the cook to drain the eggplant after the specified 10 minutes of soaking and set it aside, which are logical and correct steps in the recipe.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
