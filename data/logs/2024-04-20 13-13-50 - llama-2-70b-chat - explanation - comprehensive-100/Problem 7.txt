## Assistant 2:
  Action: Answer("B")

Explanation:
I made a mistake in my previous answer, and I appreciate the opportunity to correct it. The correct answer is indeed B: 41.6 tons.

Here's my reflection on the problem and the correct answer:
The problem states that the average weight of 10 vehicles is 12.2 tons, and the average weight of the group of vehicles increased by 2.6 tons after a new heavy-duty truck was added to the group. To find the weight of the new truck, we need to find the new average weight of the group of vehicles and subtract the average weight of the original 10 vehicles.

The formula for finding the new average weight is:
New average = (Original average + New weight) / (Number of vehicles + 1)

In this case, the new average weight would be:
New average = (12.2 + x) / (10 + 1)

Where x is the weight of the new truck.

We can simplify the formula by substituting the values:
New average = (12.2 + x) / 11

We know that the new average weight increased by 2.6 tons, so we can set up the equation:
12.2 + x = 14.8

Solving for x, we get:
x = 2.6

Therefore, the weight of the new truck is 2.6 tons.

I hope this explanation clarifies my mistake and the correct solution to the problem. Thank you for the opportunity to reflect and correct my answer.
