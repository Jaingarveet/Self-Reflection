Explanation:
I made a mistake in my conversion from inches to miles.
I incorrectly divided 1 inch by 40 miles instead of multiplying by 40 miles.
This resulted in an incorrect answer of 200 miles instead of [REDACTED] miles.
## Assistant 2:
  Thought: 
The length of the road from Town F to Town G is 20 inches, and 1/4 inch represents 10 miles.
To find the actual distance, we need to convert 20 inches to miles.
We can do this by multiplying 20 by 40 miles/inch, which gives us [REDACTED] miles.
