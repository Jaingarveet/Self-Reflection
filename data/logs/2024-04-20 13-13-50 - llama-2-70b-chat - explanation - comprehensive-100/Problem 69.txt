Explanation:
My previous answer was incorrect because I made a mistake in my calculation. I incorrectly added 9y to both sides of the equation, which led to a contradiction.
## Assistant 2:
  My apologies for my previous mistake. Let's try to solve this problem again.
We are given two equations:

2x - 3y = -14 ... (1)
3x - 2y = -6 ... (2)

We can solve this system of equations by substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution. Solving equation (1) for x, we get:

x = -3y + 14

Now, substitute this expression for x into equation (2):

-3y + 14 - 2y = -6

Expand and simplify:

-5y = -20

Now, divide both sides by -5:

y = -4

Now, substitute y = -4 into one of the original equations to solve for x. For example, using equation (1):

2x - 3(-4) = -14
2x = -14 + 12
2x = -2

Now, divide both sides by 2:

x = -1

So, x = -1 and y = -4 is a solution to the system of equations.
Now, we need to find the value of x - y:

x - y = -1 - (-4)
x - y = 3

The correct answer is C: -4.
