Context: Aptripa Cave is located near the bay of Dilos in the Peninsula of Maina, and is as large as four football fields.This cave dates back to the Neolithic Age, but was not accidentally discovered by a man walking a dog until the 1950s.After decades of scientific research work, archaeologists excavated tools, pottery, obsidian, silver and copper utensils from the cave, and thus believed that hundreds of people had lived in the cave.
Question: Which of the following, if true, can best refute the above argument?
Choices:
  A: The cave inspired the description of hell in Greek mythology
  B: The cave is actually an ancient cemetery and funeral venue
  C: There is no prehistoric village in Europe that has been found earlier than the cave
  D: The entrance to the cave collapsed 5000 years ago

## Assistant 2:
  My apologize for my previous response. After reevaluating the information provided, I realize that my initial answer was incorrect.
Here's my reflection on the problem and the correct answer:
The correct answer is D: The entrance to the cave collapsed 5000 years ago.
The argument states that the cave was not accidentally discovered until the 1950s, implying that it was not accessible to people for a long time. If the entrance to the cave collapsed 5000 years ago, it would explain why the cave was not discovered until the 20th century. This would refute the argument that hundreds of people had lived in the cave, as it would have been inaccessible for a significant period.
Therefore, the answer is D: The entrance to the cave collapsed 5000 years ago.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
