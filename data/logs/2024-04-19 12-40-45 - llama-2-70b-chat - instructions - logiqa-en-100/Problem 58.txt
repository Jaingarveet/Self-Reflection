  D: The chairman of Yongtai Development Company said? "The skyrocketing housing prices are because supply has not kept up with demand."
Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly.
After reflecting on the problem, my solution, and the correct answer, I realized that I need to carefully evaluate each choice to determine if it provides objective evidence that contradicts the assertion.
Here's my revised answer:
Action: Answer("B")
Explanation:
The assertion being made is that rising land prices are the chief culprit in soaring housing prices.
Choice B provides the most reliable information that contradicts the assertion. According to the statement, residential prices in Beijing increased by 7.2% in the first quarter of 2005, but residential land prices rose by only 0.37%. This suggests that the increase in housing prices is not directly caused by the rise in land prices. Therefore, Choice B is the best answer.

I double-checked my answer to ensure that it is in the correct format.
I also made sure that I did not consider any information that I am not allowed to see, which is marked [REDACTED].
I am confident that my revised answer is correct.
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
