## Assistant 2:
  My apologize for my previous response, and I appreciate the opportunity to reflect on my answer. According to the information given, we can eliminate certain teams based on the statements of each professor.

Professor Zhao's statement eliminates the Tsinghua University team and the Zhejiang University team. Therefore, the champion cannot be either of these two teams.

Professor Qian's statement eliminates the University of Science and Technology of China team, as he states that the champion is not this team.

Professor Sun's statement eliminates the China University of Science and Technology team, as he states that the champion is not this team.

Now, let's analyze the remaining teams:

* Tsinghua University team (eliminated by Professor Zhao)
* Zhejiang University team (eliminated by Professor Zhao)
* University of Science and Technology of China team (eliminated by Professor Qian)
* China University of Science and Technology team (eliminated by Professor Sun)

The only remaining team is the Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics team. Therefore, the winner of the football game in the "Master Cup 2003 China Robot Competition" is the Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics team.
