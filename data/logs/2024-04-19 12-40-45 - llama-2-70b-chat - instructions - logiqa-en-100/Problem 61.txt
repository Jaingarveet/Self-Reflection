## Assistant 2:
  My previous answer was incorrect, and upon reflection, I realized that I had overlooked a critical detail in the question. The statement "F and M are not in charge of the same department" provides crucial information that can help us determine the correct answer.

Let's revisit the problem and consider all possible combinations:

1. F is in charge of Department 1, and M is in charge of Department 2. In this case, Condition 1 is violated since F and M are not in charge of the same department.
2. F is in charge of Department 2, and M is in charge of Department 1. This scenario also violates Condition 1.
3. F is in charge of Department 1, and M is in charge of Department 3. This satisfies Condition 1, but it also means that H and I must be in charge of Departments 2 and 3, respectively, which violates Condition 3.
4. F is in charge of Department 3, and M is in charge of Department 1. This satisfies Condition 1, but it also means that H and I must be in charge of Departments 1 and 2, respectively, which violates Condition 3.
5. F is in charge of Department 2, and M is in charge of Department 3. This satisfies Condition 1 and does not violate Conditions 2 or 3.

Based on the above analysis, we can conclude that the correct answer is B: F and I are in charge of the same department.

Action: Answer("B")
