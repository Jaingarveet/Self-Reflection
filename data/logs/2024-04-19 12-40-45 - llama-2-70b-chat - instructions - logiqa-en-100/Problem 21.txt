## Assistant 2:
  My apologize for my previous response, where I incorrectly answered the question. After reflecting on the problem, I realize that I misunderstood the question and focused on the wrong aspect of the argument.
The correct answer is (D) Disagree with Xiao Chen's conclusion, and put forward another explanation for Xiao Chen's argument.
Xiao Wang refuted Xiao Chen's views by providing an alternative explanation for the flickering light observed from Comet 1996D3. Xiao Wang pointed out that the flicker could be caused by the comet's distance from the sun, rather than being an unusual scene as suggested by Xiao Chen. Therefore, option (D) best matches Xiao Wang's method of refutation.
