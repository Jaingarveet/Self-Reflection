## Assistant 2:
  My apologize for my previous response, where I incorrectly answered the question.
After re-reading the rules, I realized that I misunderstood the information provided.
Let's go through the rules again:
1. If valve No.1 is opened, then valve No.2 must be opened and valve No.5 must be closed.
2. If valve No.2 or valve No.5 is opened, valve No.4 must be closed.
3. No.3 valve and No.4 valve cannot be closed at the same time.
Now, we need to open valve No.1.
According to rule 1, valve No.2 must be opened, and valve No.5 must be closed.
Therefore, the two valves that must be opened at the same time are valve No.2 and valve No.1.
The correct answer is choice 
Action: Answer("B")
