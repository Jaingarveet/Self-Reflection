## Assistant 2:
  My apologies for my previous mistake. I realize that my initial answer was incorrect because I misunderstood the question.

The question asks for the best explanation for the inconsistency between the experts' belief that strict investigation of drunk driving can reduce traffic accidents and the survey findings that the incidence of traffic accidents is similar in cities where drunk driving is strictly investigated and those who do not.

The correct answer is (D) In addition to strict investigation of drunk driving, other traffic violations should also be stopped.

This answer choice acknowledges that strict investigation of drunk driving may not be enough to reduce traffic accidents and that other factors, such as other traffic violations, may also need to be addressed. It provides a possible explanation for the inconsistency between the experts' beliefs and the survey findings.

Therefore, Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: A
