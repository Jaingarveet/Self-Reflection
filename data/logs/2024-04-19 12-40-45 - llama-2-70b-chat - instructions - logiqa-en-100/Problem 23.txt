Answer:
The correct answer is (B) People with intimate relationships have little time for loneliness.

Explanation:
The argument assumes that people with intimate relationships have little time for loneliness, which contradicts the fact that great painters often spend most of their time in loneliness. This contradiction is the main point of the argument.

The psychological theory mentioned in the argument is the idea that to be happy, one must maintain an intimate relationship with those around him. However, the fact that great painters often spend most of their time in loneliness contradicts this theory, suggesting that intimate relationships are not necessary for happiness or artistic achievement.

Answer choice (B) best summarizes the contradiction between the psychological theory and the fact that great painters often spend most of their time in loneliness. It highlights the idea that people with intimate relationships have little time for loneliness, which contrasts with the fact that great painters often spend most of their time in loneliness.

Answer choice (A) is not related to the contradiction between the psychological theory and the fact that great painters often spend most of their time in loneliness. It mentions the relationship between inner experience and artistic achievement, which is not the main point of the argument.

Answer choice (C) is also not related to the contradiction between the psychological theory and the fact that great painters often spend most of their time in loneliness. It suggests that loneliness is necessary for great painting artists, which is not the main point of the argument.

Answer choice (D) is incorrect because it does not summarize the contradiction between the psychological theory and the fact that great painters often spend most of their time in loneliness. It mentions the idea that artists who have achieved great achievements cannot be unhappy, which is not the main point of the argument.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) People with intimate relationships have little time for loneliness.
