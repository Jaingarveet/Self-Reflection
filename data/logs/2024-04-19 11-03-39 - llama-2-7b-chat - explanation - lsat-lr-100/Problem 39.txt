Topic: Law
Context: Rossi: It is undemocratic for people to live under a government in which their interests are not represented. So children should have the right to vote, since sometimes the interests of children are different from those of their parents. Smith: Granted, children's interests are not always the same as their parents'; governmental deficits incurred by their parents' generation will later affect their own generation's standard of living. But even if children are told about the issues affecting them, which is not generally the case, their conceptions of what can or should be done are too simple, and their time horizons are radically different from those of adults, so we cannot give them the responsibility of voting.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes Rossi's argument?
Choices:
  A: It makes an appeal to a general principle.
  B: It denies the good faith of an opponent.
  C: It relies on evaluating the predictable consequences of a proposal.
  D: It substitutes description for giving a rationale for a policy.
  E: It employs a term on two different occasions in different senses.

Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
Rossi's argument can be most accurately described as relying on evaluating the predictable consequences of a proposal. This is because Rossi's argument is based on the predicted consequences of giving children the right to vote, rather than appealing to a general principle or denying the good faith of an opponent.

The other options do not accurately describe Rossi's argument:

* Option [REDACTED]: This option suggests that Rossi's argument makes an appeal to a general principle, but Rossi's argument does not rely on any general principle. Instead, it relies on the predicted consequences of giving children the right to vote.
* Option [REDACTED]: This option suggests that Rossi denies the good faith of an opponent, but Rossi's argument does not deny the good faith of any opponent.
* Option [REDACTED]: This option suggests that Rossi substitutes description for giving a rationale for a policy, but Rossi's argument provides a rationale for why children should not be given the right to vote based on the predicted consequences of doing so.
* Option [REDACTED]: This option suggests that Rossi employs a term on two different occasions in different senses, but there is no evidence to suggest that Rossi is using the term "consequences" in a different sense than usual.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) Relying on evaluating the predictable consequences of a proposal.
