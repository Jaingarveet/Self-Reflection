Context: Museum curakor: Our ancient Egyptian collection includes an earthenware hippopotamus that resembles a child's roy. It was discovered in a tomb, upside down, with its legs broken off. We know that the ancient Egyptians believed the dead had to wage eternal war with beasts. Breaking the legs off a representation of an animal was thought to help a deceased person in this war. We conclude that, far from being a roy, this hippopotamus was a religious object.
Question: Which one of the following is an assumption required by the curator's argument?
Choices:
  A: The tomb in which the hippopotamus was found was not the tomb of a child.
  B: Earthenware figures were never used as children's roys in ancient Egypt.
  C: The tomb in which the hippopotamus was found was not reentered from the time of burial until archaeologists opened it.
  D: The hippopotamus' legs were not broken 1hrough some natural occurrence after it was placed in the tomb.
  E: The hippopotamus was originally placed upside down in the tomb.

Question: Which one of the following is an assumption required by the curator's argument?

Reflection:

Initial Answer: B - Earthenware figures were never used as children's roys in ancient Egypt.

Reasoning: The curator mentions that the hippopotamus resembles a child's roy, but then argues that it was a religious object. This suggests that the curator is assuming that earthenware figures were not used as children's toys in ancient Egypt.

However, upon further reflection, I realize that this assumption is not necessarily true. While it is possible that earthenware figures were not used as children's toys, it is also possible that they were used in other contexts, such as religious rituals or ceremonies. Therefore, this assumption is not necessarily required by the curator's argument.

Correct Answer: E - The hippopotamus was originally placed upside down in the tomb.

Explanation: The curator's argument hinges on the idea that the hippopotamus was placed in the tomb upside down, which suggests that it was intended to be a religious object rather than a children's toy. Therefore, the correct assumption is that the hippopotamus was originally placed upside down in the tomb.
