## User 2:
Topic: Law
Context: In some jurisdictions, lawmakers have instituted sentencing guidelines that mandate a penalty for theft that is identical to the one they have mandated for bribery. Hence, lawmakers in those jurisdictions evidently consider the harm resulting from theft to be equal to the harm resulting from bribery.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would most strengthen the argument?
Choices:
  A: In general, lawmakers mandate penalties for crimes that are proportional to the harm they believe to result from those crimes.
  B: In most cases, lawmakers assess the level of harm resulting from an act in determining whether to make that act illegal.
  C: Often, in response to the unusually great harm resulting from a particular instance of a crime, lawmakers will mandate an increased penalty for that crime.
  D: In most cases, a victim of theft is harmed no more than a victim of bribery is harmed.
  E: If lawmakers mandate penalties for crimes that are proportional to the harm resulting from those crimes, crime in those lawmakers' jurisdictions will be effectively deterred.

## Assistant 2:
  Topic: Law
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would most strengthen the argument?

Reflection:
After initially answering the question incorrectly, I reflected on the problem and my solution. I realized that the correct answer is (B) In most cases, lawmakers assess the level of harm resulting from an act in determining whether to make that act illegal.

Explanation:
The argument that lawmakers in some jurisdictions consider the harm resulting from theft to be equal to the harm resulting from bribery is strengthened if it can be shown that lawmakers generally assess the level of harm resulting from an act in determining whether to make that act illegal. This means that lawmakers are not simply imposing penalties for theft and bribery without considering the level of harm caused by each crime. Rather, they are taking into account the severity of the harm caused by each crime when determining the appropriate penalty.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) In most cases, lawmakers assess the level of harm resulting from an act in determining whether to make that act illegal. This answer choice best supports the argument that lawmakers in these jurisdictions consider the harm resulting from theft to be equal to the harm resulting from bribery.
