## User 2:
Topic: Law
Context: Archaeologist: The mosaics that were removed from Zeugma, the ancient city now flooded by the runoff from Turkey's Birecik Dam, should have been left there. We had all the information about them that we needed to draw archaeological conclusions, and future archaeologists studying the site, who may not have access to our records, might be misled by their absence.
Question: Which one of the following, if assumed, most helps to justify the reasoning in the archaeologist's argument?
Choices:
  A: The only considerations that bear upon the question of whether the mosaics should have been removed are archaeological.
  B: Archaeologists studying a site can tell whether or not that site had been flooded at some time.
  C: The materials used in the construction of a mosaic are readily apparent when the mosaic is examined in its original location.
  D: Archaeological sites from which artifacts have been removed rarely mislead archaeologists who later study the site.
  E: The removal of artifacts from archaeological sites rarely has any environmental impact.

Question: Which one of the following, if assumed, most helps to justify the reasoning in the archaeologist's argument?
Choices:

A: The only considerations that bear upon the question of whether the mosaics should have been removed are archaeological. [REDACTED]
B: Archaeologists studying a site can tell whether or not that site had been flooded at some time. [REDACTED]
C: The materials used in the construction of a mosaic are readily apparent when the mosaic is examined in its original location. [REDACTED]
D: Archaeological sites from which artifacts have been removed rarely mislead archaeologists who later study the site. [REDACTED]
E: The removal of artifacts from archaeological sites rarely has any environmental impact. [REDACTED]

Action: Answer("C")

Explanation:
The correct answer is (C) The materials used in the construction of a mosaic are readily apparent when the mosaic is examined in its original location.

The archaeologist's argument is based on the idea that the absence of the mosaics at the site will mislead future archaeologists who may not have access to the records of the original excavation. By leaving the mosaics in their original location, future archaeologists can still observe and study the materials used in their construction, which is an important aspect of archaeological analysis.

Option (C) is the best answer because it directly supports the archaeologist's argument. The materials used in the construction of a mosaic are indeed readily apparent when the mosaic is examined in its original location, and this information is crucial for archaeological analysis.
