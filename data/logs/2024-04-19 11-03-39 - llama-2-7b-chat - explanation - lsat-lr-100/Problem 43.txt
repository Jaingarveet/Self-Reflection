Topic: Law
Context: Ethicist: Marital vows often contain the promise to love "until death do us part." If "love" here refers to a feeling, then this promise makes no sense, for feelings are not within one's control, and a promise to do something not within one's control makes no sense. Thus, no one—including those making marital vows—should take "love" in this context to be referring to feelings.
Question: The ethicist's conclusion follows logically if which one of the following is assumed?
Choices:
  A: None of our feelings are within our control.
  B: People should not make promises to do something that is not within their control.
  C: "Love" can legitimately be taken to refer to something other than feelings.
  D: Promises should not be interpreted in such a way that they make no sense.
  E: Promises that cannot be kept do not make any sense.

Explanation:
The ethicist's conclusion that marital vows to love "until death do us part" makes no sense if "love" refers to feelings, which are not within one's control, follows logically if the assumption is that promises should not be interpreted in such a way that they make no sense. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) [REDACTED]

The other options do not follow logically from the ethicist's conclusion:

* Option (A) None of our feelings are within our control is not necessarily true, and even if it were, it would not logically follow that marital vows to love "until death do us part" make no sense.
* Option (C) "Love" can legitimately be taken to refer to something other than feelings is possible, but it does not address the issue of whether marital vows to love "until death do us part" make sense if "love" refers to feelings.
* Option (E) Promises that cannot be kept do not make any sense is true, but it does not logically follow that marital vows to love "until death do us part" make no sense if "love" refers to feelings.

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) [REDACTED]
