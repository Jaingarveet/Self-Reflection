Topic: Law
Context: A study of 86 patients, all of whom suffered from disease T and received the same standard medical treatment, divided the patients into 2 equal groups. One group's members all attended weekly support group meetings, but no one from the other group attended support group meetings. After 10 years, 41 patients from each group had died. Clearly, support group meetings do not help patients with disease T live longer.
Question: Which one of the following statements, if true, most seriously weakens the argument?
Choices:
  A: Of the 4 patients who survived more than 10 years, the 2 who had attended weekly support group meetings lived longer than the 2 who had not.
  B: For many diseases, attending weekly support group meetings is part of the standard medical treatment.
  C: The members of the group that attended weekly support group meetings lived 2 years longer, on average, than the members of the other group.
  D: Some physicians have argued that attending weekly support group meetings gives patients less faith in the standard treatment for disease T.
  E: Everyone in the group whose members attended weekly support group meetings reported after 1 year that those meetings had helped them to cope with the disease.
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
The correct answer is (C) [REDACTED]

The argument in the passage is based on a comparison between the two groups, but it does not take into account individual factors that may affect the patients' survival rates. The statement (C) acknowledges that there may be individual differences within each group that could affect the survival rates, and therefore, the conclusion that support group meetings do not help patients with disease T live longer is not necessarily valid.

Here's why the other options do not weaken the argument:

(A) does not provide any information about the survival rates of the patients who attended support group meetings.
(B) is irrelevant to the argument, as the passage does not mention anything about attending support group meetings being part of the standard medical treatment for disease T.
(D) is also irrelevant, as it does not provide any information about the effect of attending support group meetings on patients' survival rates.
(E) is not a valid counterargument, as it only suggests that the patients in the group that attended support meetings reported that those meetings had helped them cope with the disease, which does not address the issue of survival rates.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) [REDACTED]
