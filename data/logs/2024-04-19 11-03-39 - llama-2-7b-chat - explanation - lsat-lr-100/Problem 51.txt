Topic: Law
Context: Political scientist: People become unenthusiastic about voting if they believe that important problems can be addressed only by large numbers of people drastically changing their attitudes and that such attitudinal changes generally do not result from government action. The decreasing voter turnout is thus entirely due to a growing conviction that politicians cannot solve the most important problems.
Question: The reasoning in the political scientist's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that the argument
Choices:
  A: presumes, without providing justification, that there is no cause of decreasing voter turnout other than the belief that few important problems can be solved by government action
  B: presumes, without providing justification, that there are no political solutions to the most important problems
  C: infers that important problems can be seriously addressed if people's attitudes do change from the premise that these problems cannot be addressed if people's attitudes do not change
  D: undermines its claim that people no longer believe there are political solutions to important problems by suggesting that people are dissatisfied with politicians
  E: presumes, without providing justification, that voter apathy prevents the attitudinal changes that result in finding solutions to important problems

Explanation:
The reasoning in the political scientist's argument is most vulnerable to criticism because it assumes without providing justification that important problems can be seriously addressed if people's attitudes do change. This inference is not supported by evidence and is potentially flawed.

Other factors, such as decreased trust in government or increased cynicism about politics, may also contribute to decreasing voter turnout, and the argument does not consider these alternative explanations. Therefore, the argument is vulnerable to criticism for making an unwarranted inference.

The correct answer is (C) Infers that important problems can be seriously addressed if people's attitudes do change.
## Assistant 2:
  Great, let's break down the argument and identify the flaw:

The political scientist argues that people become unenthusiastic about voting if they believe that important problems can be addressed only by large numbers of people drastically changing their attitudes, and that such attitudinal changes generally do not result from government action.

The reasoning in the argument is vulnerable to criticism because it assumes without providing justification that important problems can be seriously addressed if people's attitudes do change. This inference is not supported by evidence and is potentially flawed.

Now, let's select the best answer:

Action: Answer("C")

Explanation: The argument infers that important problems can be seriously addressed if people's attitudes do change, but this inference is not supported by evidence and is potentially flawed. Therefore, the reasoning in the argument is most vulnerable to criticism on this ground.
## Result:
