# Model: llama-2-70b-chat | Agent: composite | Exam: arc-challenge-100 | Problem 30 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Science.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:
Topic: Geography
Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Science
Question: When moist air comes in contact with a cold surface in the winter, one result can be frost. What has happened to the water vapor in the air to cause frost?
Choices:
  A: It has melted.
  B: It has sublimated.
  C: It has evaporated.
  D: It has condensed.
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I misunderstood the process of condensation. I thought that the water vapor in the air would condense into liquid water, not realizing that it would actually sublimate (change directly from a gas to a solid) and form frost.

Error Keywords:

* Misunderstanding of condensation
* Sublimation vs. condensation
* Water vapor vs. liquid water

Solution:
When moist air comes in contact with a cold surface in the winter, the water vapor in the air changes directly from a gas to a solid, forming frost. This process is called sublimation.

Instructions:

1. Recognize that frost forms when moist air meets a cold surface.
2. Understand that the water vapor in the air sublimates (changes directly from a gas to a solid) to form frost.
3. Identify the correct answer, "[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]"

Advice:

* Pay attention to the specific process described in the question.
* Understand the difference between condensation and sublimation.
* Be careful not to confuse liquid water with water vapor.
* Double-check your answer by reviewing the process described in the question.
