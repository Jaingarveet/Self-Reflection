## System:
You are an expert in Science.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:
Topic: Geography
Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore

## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Science
Question: Elisa was classifying types of energy as either potential or kinetic. Which is a type of potential energy?
Choices:
  A: sound energy
  B: radiant energy
  C: thermal energy
  D: chemical energy
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I confused [REDACTED] with [REDACTED]. Thermal energy is a type of kinetic energy, not potential energy. Chemical energy is the potential energy stored in the bonds of atoms and molecules.

Error Keywords:

* Confusion
* Misclassification
* Energy types

Solution:
Elisa was classifying types of energy as either potential or kinetic.
Potential energy is the energy an object has due to its position or state.
Chemical energy is a type of potential energy.

Instructions:

1. Review the types of energy: kinetic, potential, sound, radiant, thermal, chemical.
2. Understand the definition of potential energy: energy an object has due to its position or state.
3. Identify the type of energy that is stored in the bonds of atoms and molecules: [REDACTED].
4. Choose the answer that matches the correct type of energy: [REDACTED] - [REDACTED].

Advice:

* Always review and understand the concepts before answering a question.
* Be careful when distinguishing between similar terms, such as thermal and [REDACTED].
* Use a systematic approach to identify the correct answer.
* Double-check your answer by reviewing the question and the options.
* Practice, practice, practice to build your knowledge and confidence.
## Assistant 2:
  Action: Answer("D")

Explanation:
Chemical energy is a type of potential energy. It is the energy stored in the bonds of atoms and molecules. Thermal energy, on the other hand, is a type of kinetic energy. It is the energy of motion of particles in a substance.

Reflection:
I correctly answered this question by reflecting on my previous mistake. I reviewed the types of energy and understood the definition of potential energy. I identified the type of energy stored in the bonds of atoms and molecules as chemical energy. I chose the answer that matched the correct type of energy, chemical energy, which is option D.

Error Keywords:

* None

Solution Keywords:

* Potential energy
* Chemical energy
* Thermal energy
* Kinetic energy
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
