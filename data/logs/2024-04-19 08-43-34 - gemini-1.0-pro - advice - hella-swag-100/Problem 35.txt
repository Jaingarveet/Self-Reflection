Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to decorate white bedding [title] Pick bedding with stitching patterns for additional texture. [step] White bedding can be a little boring if you don't add other color or texture for visual interest. Interesting stitching patterns, such as white embroidery, can introduce some much-needed texture to your bed.
Choices:
  A: You'll also add a touch of variety with the pillows and blankets. [substeps] The regular colors include merino blue and red pillows, and white linens can create a striking contrast with the exact color of your headboard.
  B: [substeps] For example, if you have a white blanket or comforter, pick one that has a stitched pattern in white. The pattern could be as simple as wavy lines, but it could be more complicated, too-anything from roses to stars or leaves.
  C: Solid color bedding is the best choice because it shows color and texture in the room without leaving bulk. [title] Add a lamp on a shelf next to your bed to add texture.
  D: Don't feel like you have to opt for a constant patterned pattern or pattern. You can choose a white color of bedding you like or sit down and start making columns about how you intend to use your linens.
