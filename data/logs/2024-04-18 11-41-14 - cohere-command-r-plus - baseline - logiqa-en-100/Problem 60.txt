Context: If a person increases the number of meals per day but does not increase the total amount of meals, his cholesterol level will obviously decrease.However, most people consume more food while increasing the number of meals.
Question: If the above statement is true, which of the following options will it most strongly support?
Choices:
  A: For most people, his daily food intake does not significantly affect his cholesterol level.
  B: For most people, increasing the number of meals a day will not result in a significant reduction in cholesterol levels.
  C: For most people, the amount of food eaten per day will not be affected by the number of foods eaten per day.
  D: For most people, the amount of food consumed is greatly affected by the time taken to eat.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The statement suggests that increasing the number of meals can lead to a decrease in cholesterol levels if the total amount of food remains constant. However, as most people tend to eat more when they increase their meal frequency, their cholesterol levels may be affected.

Therefore, the correct option is B: For most people, increasing the number of meals a day will not result in a significant reduction in cholesterol levels. This is because they tend to consume more food overall, which counteracts the potential benefit of smaller, more frequent meals.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
