Context: Prince Lima in Li Na's mind is tall, handsome and doctor.She knew four men, Wang Wei, Wu Gang, Li Qiang, and Liu Dawei, and one of them met all the conditions she required.(1) Among the 4 men, there are 3 tall men, 2 doctors, and 1 is handsome; (2) Wang Wei and Wu Gang are both doctors; (3) Liu Dawei and Li Qiang are the same height; (4) Li Qiang and Wang Wei Not all are tall.
Question: Who can meet all the requirements of Li Na?
Choices:
  A: Liu Dawei
  B: Li Qiang
  C: Wu Gang
  D: Wang Wei
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
From the first statement, we know there is only one handsome man out of the four.
The second statement tells us that Wang Wei and Wu Gang are doctors.
The third statement tells us that Liu Dawei and Li Qiang are the same height, and the fourth statement tells us that only one of Li Qiang or Wang Wei is tall (the other must be short).

We can deduce that Li Qiang must be the handsome one, as he is the only one left who could be.
Liu Dawei must also be tall, as Li Qiang is tall and they are the same height.
This leaves Wang Wei and Wu Gang as the two doctors.

Therefore, the only person who meets all the requirements is Li Qiang - he is tall, handsome, and a doctor.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: C
