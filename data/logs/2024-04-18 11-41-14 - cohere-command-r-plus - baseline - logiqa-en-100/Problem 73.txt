If G is in Team 1, he must be in the front position.
From condition (2), K must be in the middle position.
L must be in Team 1 from condition (3).
N and Q cannot be in Team 2 because they must be in the front and middle positions, respectively, if they are in Team 2 (conditions 1 and 6).
P cannot be in Team 1 because of condition (4).

Therefore, the only pair that can be in Team 1 with G is L and K.
