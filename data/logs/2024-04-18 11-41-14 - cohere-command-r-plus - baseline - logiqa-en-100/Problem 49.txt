Context: The intelligence department intercepted the three pieces of cryptographic information sent by the terrorists.After analysis by cryptographers, "Alingoits Doximayo Makasey" means "kidnapping student (host) hostage", and "Huholikaso Makasey Mugbudengs" means "hostage holding (see) "Reporter", "Mugbudengs Ftoufgke Alingoits" means "kidnapping reporters away".
Question: Regarding the meaning of the relevant words in this cryptographic language, which of the following statements may be true?
Choices:
  A: "Doximayo" means "hostage"
  C: "Mugbudengs" means "kidnapping".
  B: "Doximayo" means "student"
  D: I don't know what they mean.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The first sentence tells us that "Alingoits Doximayo Makasey" means "kidnapping student (host) hostage".
So, we can assume that "Doximayo" means "student" and "Makasey" means "hostage".

The second sentence, "Huholikaso Makasey Mugbudengs" means "hostage holding (see) "Reporter", further confirms that "Makasey" means "hostage".

The third sentence, "Mugbudengs Ftoufgke Alingoits" means "kidnapping reporters away", indicates that "Mugbudengs" is likely related to the act of kidnapping but does not specifically mean "kidnapping". It could be a verb indicating the action of taking/holding someone captive.

Therefore, choice B, "Doximayo" means "student", is the correct answer based on the provided information.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
