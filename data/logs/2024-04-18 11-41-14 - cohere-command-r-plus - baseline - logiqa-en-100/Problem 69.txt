## System:
You are an expert in Logic.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:

  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Logic
Context: Zhang Shan received a higher bonus than Li Si.After learning that Wang Wu's bonus was higher than Miao Xiaoqin, Zhang Shan's bonus was also higher than Miao Xiaoqin.
Question: The following assumptions can make the above inference hold, except
Choices:
  A: Wang Wu's bonus is higher than Li Si's.
  B: Li Si's bonus is higher than Miao Xiaoqin's.
  C: Li Si's bonus is higher than Wang Wu's.
  D: Li Si's bonus is as high as Wang Wu's.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The inference is that Zhang Shan's bonus > Miao Xiaoqin's bonus, based on:
1. Zhang Shan's bonus > Li Si's bonus
2. Wang Wu's bonus > Miao Xiaoqin's bonus
3. Zhang Shan's bonus > Wang Wu's bonus

For the inference to not hold, one of these assumptions must be false while the others remain true.

Choice A is not the exception as we can still infer that Zhang Shan's bonus > Miao Xiaoqin's bonus even if we assume that Wang Wu's bonus > Li Si's bonus.

Choice B is not the exception either, as it does not affect the inference when we assume that Li Si's bonus is higher than Miao Xiaoqin's.

Choice C is the key assumption that allows us to make the inference. If we assume that Li Si's bonus is lower than Wang Wu's, then the link between Zhang Shan's bonus and Miao Xiaoqin's bonus is broken.

Choice D can be eliminated as it directly contradicts assumption C, which has already been identified as critical.

Therefore, the exception is Choice C.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
