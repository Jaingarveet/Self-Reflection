Context: Recently, hundreds of seals died from eating a fish contaminated with chemicals.Even small amounts of this chemical can poison mammals.However, some people have not been poisoned after eating this fish.
Question: Which of the following, if correct, is most helpful in explaining the contradictions in the above statement?
Choices:
  A: The fish contaminated with this chemical has not been harmed by the chemical itself.
  B: Toxic chemicals gather in the parts of the fish that seals eat but people don't.
  C: Traces of this chemical poison were also found in the bodies of some people who ate neither fish nor fish products.
  D: Fish contaminated with this chemical only accounts for a small portion of the seal â€™s total food intake.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The statement suggests that people who have eaten the contaminated fish have not been poisoned, which contradicts the fact that the chemical can poison mammals.
Choice B provides a reasonable explanation for this contradiction, suggesting that the toxic chemical may be concentrated in parts of the fish that seals eat, but that people typically do not consume those specific parts.

Choice A is irrelevant to the contradiction, as it does not explain why people remain unaffected while seals suffer poisoning. Choice C introduces the idea of chemical traces in people who haven't eaten the fish, which doesn't address the core contradiction. Choice D implies that the impact on the seals may be minimal, which doesn't explain why people remain unaffected.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
