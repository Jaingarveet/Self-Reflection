Context: When a team travels to Tibet, in addition to Lhasa, there are 6 cities or scenic spots to choose from? City E, City F, Lake G, Mountain H, Mountain I, Lake J Taking into account factors such as time, funding, plateau environment, and physical condition of the personnel, (1) at least one of Lake G and Lake J should be visited.(2) If you don't go to E city or F city, you can't go to G lake.(3) If you don't go to E city, you can't go to H mountain.(4) Only when I cross the I peak can I reach Lake J.
Question: If this team does not go to I Peak due to climate reasons, which of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: The group went to E city and J lake
  B: The group went to city E instead of city F
  C: The group went to visit G Lake and H Mountain
  D: The group went to F city and G lake tour
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Statement (4) tells us that in order to go to Lake J, the team must cross Peak I. If they did not go to Peak I, then they did not go to Lake J. This means that they must visit Lake G to satisfy statement (1). 

Statement (2) tells us that if the team does not go to either City E or City F, then they cannot go to Lake G. Therefore, the team must have gone to either City E or City F (or both). 

Statement (3) tells us that if the team did not go to City E, then they cannot go to Mountain H. 

Combining these statements, we can deduce that the team must have gone to City F, and from there, they could have chosen to go to either Lake G, Mountain H, or both. 

Therefore, the correct answer is that the group went to F City, and they could have gone to either G Lake, H Mountain, or both, but they did not go to J Lake.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
