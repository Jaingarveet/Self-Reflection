Context: Last year, the national consumer price index (CPI) rose only 1.8%, which is a moderate increase.However, people's personal feelings are quite different.They feel that water, electricity, gas, vegetables, oil, going to school to see a doctor, and buying a house by car are all rising prices, and the increase is not "moderate."
Question: Which of the following options does not help explain the gap between the statistics in the question and the people â€™s feelings?
Choices:
  A: China's current CPI statistical range and standards were formulated more than 20 years ago, and it is difficult to truly reflect the current trend of consumer prices.
  B: The CPI published by the National Bureau of Statistics is a data description of the overall situation of the prices of various goods and services across the country, and it cannot fully reflect individual feelings and the differences between regions and consumption levels.
  C: Products with a high degree of relevance to people's lives tend to increase prices; those with a low degree of relevance tend to fall prices.
  D: High-income groups have little sense of a small price increase.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Option A explains that the CPI statistical range and standards are outdated and may not accurately reflect the true trend of consumer prices, which could contribute to the gap between statistics and people's feelings.

Option B highlights that the published CPI is a general description of price trends across the country and may not capture individual experiences, regional differences, or variations in consumption patterns, again providing a possible explanation for the discrepancy.

Option C suggests that prices of essential goods and services with a high impact on people's lives have increased, while less relevant items may have become cheaper. This directly relates to people's perceptions of a significant price increase and does not contradict their feelings.

Option D mentions that high-income groups may be less sensitive to small price increases. However, this does not explain the gap between the moderate CPI increase and the perceived higher inflation by the general public, including those with varying income levels.

Therefore, option D does not help explain the discrepancy between the statistics and people's feelings.

Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
