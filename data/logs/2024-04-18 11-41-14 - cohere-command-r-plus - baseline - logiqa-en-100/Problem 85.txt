Topic: Logic
Context: An editor is considering the issue of choosing the manuscript for the theoretical version of the newspaper.Six papers from E, F, G, J and K are available.Taking into account the content of the article, the layout of the newspaper and other factors.(1) If paper E is used, then paper F cannot be used but paper K must be used; (2) Paper G or paper H can only be used without paper J.(3) If you don't need thesis G, you don't need thesis K.(4) Essay E is a manuscript requested by a celebrity and cannot be used.
Question: If the above items are true, which of the following items must be true?
Choices:
  A: Paper E is used, but paper H is not used.
  B: Both articles G and H are used.
  C: No paper J, but paper K.
  D: Both G and J articles are unnecessary.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Statement 1 tells us that if Paper E is used, Paper F cannot be used, and Paper K must be used. Statement 3 tells us that if Paper G is not needed, then Paper K is also not needed. Statement 4 tells us that Paper E cannot be used as it is requested by a celebrity and is therefore not an option. 

Therefore, we can deduce that Paper K cannot be used (from statements 1 and 3, as Paper E is not an option), and Paper G is also not needed (from statement 3). This means that statement D is true - both Papers G and J are unnecessary.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
