Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand now that the correct answer is (B) gets to the end, she starts to push her kids to the center so the line can come together.

In my previous answer, I misread the context of the situation and assumed that the woman was pushing her kids to the center to make the line come together. However, the text explicitly states that the woman is eager to have her kids play the game and is actively encouraging them to do so. Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is that the woman is pushing her kids to the center so they can play the game together.
