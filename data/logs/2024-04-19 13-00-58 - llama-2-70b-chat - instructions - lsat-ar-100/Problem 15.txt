Context: A shopping center has exactly seven spaces—space 1 through space 7—arranged in a straight row. Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
Question: If the shoe store is in space 4, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: The optometrist is next to a restaurant.
  B: The pharmacy is next to the veterinarian.
  C: A restaurant is next to the toy store.

## Assistant 2:
  I apologize for my previous mistake. Let's try again, following the instructions carefully.

1. Pharmacy in space 1.
2. Restaurant in space 7.
3. Restaurant in space 3.
4. Optometrist in space 2.
5. Veterinarian in space 4.
6. Toy store in space 6.
7. Shoe store in space 4.

Now, let's evaluate the options:

A: The optometrist is next to a restaurant.
The optometrist is next to the pharmacy, not a restaurant. Therefore, this option is incorrect.

B: The pharmacy is next to the veterinarian.
The pharmacy is indeed next to the veterinarian, so this option is correct.

C: A restaurant is next to the toy store.
The restaurant in space 7 is next to the toy store in space 6, so this option is correct.

D: The shoe store is next to the toy store.
The shoe store in space 4 is not next to the toy store in space 6, so this option is incorrect.

E: The shoe store is next to the veterinarian.
The shoe store in space 4 is next to the veterinarian in space 5, so this option is correct.

After re-evaluating the options, the correct answer is B: The pharmacy is next to the veterinarian.

Action: Answer("B")
