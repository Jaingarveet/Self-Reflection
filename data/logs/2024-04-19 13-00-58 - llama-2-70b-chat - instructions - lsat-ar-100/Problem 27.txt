## Assistant 2:
  Sure, I'll do my best to answer the question based on the information provided.

From the given information, we know that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Therefore, the list of students who review Tamerlane must include both Kramer and O'Neill.

We also know that Lopez does not review any play that Jiang reviews. Therefore, if Jiang reviews Tamerlane, Lopez cannot be on the list.

Furthermore, we know that exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other. Therefore, the list of students who review Tamerlane must have exactly two members.

With these conditions in mind, let's consider each of the choices:

A: Jiang, Kramer - This choice includes Jiang, who may not review Tamerlane, and excludes O'Neill, who definitely reviews Tamerlane. Therefore, this choice is incorrect.

B: Kramer, O'Neill - This choice includes both Kramer and O'Neill, which is correct. However, it does not include Lopez, who may review Tamerlane. Therefore, this choice is also incorrect.

C: Kramer, Lopez, O'Neill - This choice includes Kramer and O'Neill, which is correct. However, it also includes Lopez, who may not review Tamerlane. Therefore, this choice is incorrect.

D: Kramer, Megregian, O'Neill - This choice includes Kramer and O'Neill, which is correct. However, it also includes Megregian, who may not review Tamerlane. Therefore, this choice is incorrect.

E: Lopez, Megregian, O'Neill - This choice includes O'Neill, which is correct. However, it also includes Lopez and Megregian, who may not review Tamerlane. Therefore, this choice is incorrect.

Therefore, the correct answer is B: Kramer, O'Neill. This choice includes both Kramer and O'Neill, who definitely review Tamerlane, and excludes Lopez and Megregian, who may not review Tamerlane.
