Context: A software company employs exactly seven sales representatives—Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall—to work in its three sales zones—Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3. Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Question: Quinn CANNOT work in the same sales zone as which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: Kim
  B: Mahr
  C: Stuckey
  D: Tiao
  E: Udall
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Read the conditions carefully and understand the relationships between the sales representatives and sales zones.
2. Identify the constraints that apply to each sales representative and sales zone.
3. Use a process of elimination to determine which sales representative Quinn cannot work with.
4. Check your answer against the conditions to ensure it satisfies all the constraints.
## Assistant 2:
  My previous answer was incorrect because I misunderstood the conditions and didn't carefully consider all the constraints.
Upon reflection, I realized that I missed the fact that Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
This means that Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Tiao, since Tiao works in Zone 1, and Parra works in Zone 3.
Therefore, the correct answer is D: Tiao.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
