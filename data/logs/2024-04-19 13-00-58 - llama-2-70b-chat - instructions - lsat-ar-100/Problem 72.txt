## Assistant 2:
  I apologize for my previous mistake. Let's try to solve this problem again, taking into account the given constraints.

1. Draw a diagram of the seven spaces in the shopping center:

| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |

3. Ensure that the pharmacy is at one end of the row and one of the restaurants is at the other end:

The pharmacy is at space 2, and restaurant 1 is at space 3.

4. Ensure that the two restaurants are separated by at least two other businesses:

Restaurant 1 is at space 3, and restaurant 2 is at space 6, separated by the optometrist (space 1), the pharmacy (space 2), and the toy store (space 5).

5. Ensure that the pharmacy is next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian:

The pharmacy (space 2) is next to the optometrist (space 1).

6. Ensure that the toy store is not next to the veterinarian:

The toy store is at space 5, and the veterinarian is at space 6. They are not next to each other.
