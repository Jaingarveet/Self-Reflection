## Assistant 2:
  My apologize for my previous response. After re-reading the question, I realized that my previous answer was incorrect.
The correct answer is B: J, M.
The reason is that J must be shown in the evening, and M must be shown before J. Therefore, it is not possible to show J and M consecutively in either order.

Here's my reflection on my previous incorrect answer:
I mistakenly thought that J and M could be shown consecutively in the evening, but that is not possible since J must be shown last. I also didn't consider the fact that M must be shown before J.

I'll make sure to carefully analyze the rules and constraints in the future, and double-check my answers to ensure they are correct.
## Result:
Agent Answer: None
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
