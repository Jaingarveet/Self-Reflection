Topic: Logic
Context: The late famous logician Jin Yuelin of China heard the words "Money is like dung" and "Friends are worth a thousand dollars" when he was a child, and found that there are logical problems because they can lead to the absurd conclusion of "friends are like dung".
Question: Since the conclusion of "friends like dung" is not true, it can be logically derived?
Choices:
  A: The expression "money is like dung" is false.
  B: If a friend is indeed worth a lot of money, then money is not like dung.
  C: The statement that "friends are valuable" is true.
  D: The words "Money is like dung" and "Friends are worth a thousand dollars" are either true or false.

## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The logical issue in the given statements is that they lead to an absurd conclusion, "friends are like dung."
The answer choice that logically addresses this issue is the one that shows why the conclusion is invalid.

Option A is incorrect because it only addresses one of the statements and does not explain why the conclusion is invalid.
Option B is incorrect because it assumes that friends are worth a lot of money, which is not necessarily true.
Option C is incorrect because it does not address the logical issue in the given statements.
Option D is incorrect because it does not address the logical issue in the given statements.

The correct answer is:

Action: Answer("B")
