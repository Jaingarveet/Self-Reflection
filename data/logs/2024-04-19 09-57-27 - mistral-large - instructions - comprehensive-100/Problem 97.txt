Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")

Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Identify the disorder in question.
2. Identify the gene involved in the disorder.
3. Identify the mode of inheritance of the disorder.
4. Identify the characteristics of the disorder.
5. Choose the answer that matches the mode of inheritance and characteristics of the disorder.
6. Double-check your answer to ensure accuracy.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Hypophosphatemic Vitamin D Resistant Rickets is a disorder characterized by impaired bone mineralization, leading to rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults. It is caused by mutations in the PHEX gene, which encodes a protein involved in phosphate regulation. The disorder is inherited in an X-linked recessive manner.
Action: Answer("D")

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly by selecting "AR" as the mode of inheritance. However, upon further reflection, I realized that Hypophosphatemic Vitamin D Resistant Rickets is inherited in an X-linked recessive manner, not autosomal recessive. I also reviewed the characteristics of the disorder and confirmed that it is caused by mutations in the PHEX gene. Therefore, the correct answer is "XR". I will double-check my answer to ensure accuracy before submitting it.
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
