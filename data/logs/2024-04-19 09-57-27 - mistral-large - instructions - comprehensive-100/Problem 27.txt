Context: A maintenance company that takes service requests from three clients—Image, Solide, and Truvest—plans to set targets for its average service response times. Service targets will be set at 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day. Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail. The six targets are set according to the following conditions: None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
Question: Which one of the following targets CANNOT be set for more than one of the clients?
Choices:
  A: a 1-day website target
  B: a 2-day voicemail target

3. Consider the implications of each condition on the possible targets for each client.
4. Eliminate any targets that could be set for more than one client based on the conditions.
5. Choose the answer that matches the target that cannot be set for more than one client.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Based on the conditions, Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. This means that Image's voicemail target must be 1 day, and the other clients' voicemail targets must be either 2 or 3 days.
Since none of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target, Image's website target must also be 1 day.
Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target. This means that Solide's website target can be either 1 or 2 days, and Truvest's website target must be either 2 or 3 days.
Therefore, the only target that cannot be set for more than one client is a 1-day website target.
Action: Answer("A")
