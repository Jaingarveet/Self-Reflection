Instructions:
1. Identify the given conditions and constraints.
2. Determine the maximum and minimum number of books that can be placed on each shelf based on the given conditions.
3. Consider all possible placements of the books based on the given conditions.
4. Eliminate any placements that violate the given conditions.
5. Choose the answer that matches a possible and valid placement of the books.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
1. Given conditions and constraints:
   - More books on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
   - I is on the middle shelf.
   - K is higher than F.
   - O is higher than L.
   - F and M are on the same shelf.
   - G is on the top shelf.
2. Maximum and minimum number of books on each shelf:
   - Top shelf: Min 2, Max 3 (since more books on bottom)
   - Middle shelf: Min 2, Max 4 (since at least 2 on each shelf)
   - Bottom shelf: Min 3, Max 5 (since more books than top)
3. Possible placements of the books:
   - Top shelf: G, [one or two more books]
   - Middle shelf: I, [one, two, or three more books]
   - Bottom shelf: [three, four, or five books]
4. Eliminate placements that violate conditions:
   - Since K > F and O > L, neither F nor L can be on the top shelf.
   - Since F and M are together, they can't be on the top shelf (only one spot left).
5. Choose the answer that matches a possible and valid placement:
   - A: H, I (Valid: H can be on the middle shelf)
   - B: I, L (Invalid: L can't be on the middle shelf)
   - C: H, I, L (Invalid: L can't be on the middle shelf)
   - D: I, K, L (Invalid: L can't be on the middle shelf)
   - E: F, I, M (Invalid: F can't be on the middle shelf)

Action: Answer("A")
