## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The ages of the members are in an arithmetic progression with a common difference of 3 months. The youngest member is 7 years old, which is equivalent to 84 months. Let's denote the number of members as n.
The sum of the ages of all the members is given as 250 years, which is equivalent to 3000 months.
The formula for the sum of an arithmetic progression is:
Sum = (n/2) \* (2a + (n-1)d)
where a is the first term, d is the common difference, and n is the number of terms.
Substituting the given values, we get:
3000 = (n/2) \* (2 \* 84 + (n-1) \* 3)
Expanding and simplifying, we get:
3000 = 84n + 1.5n^2 - 1.5n
Dividing by 1.5, we get:
2000 = 56n + n^2 - n
Rearranging, we get:
n^2 + 55n - 2000 = 0
Factoring, we get:
(n - 25)(n + 80) = 0
The possible values for n are 25 and -80. Since the number of members cannot be negative, we discard -80.
Action: Answer("C")

Self-reflection:
Previously, I made a mistake in the calculation of the sum of the ages. I incorrectly converted the sum from years to months, which led to an incorrect result. After reflecting on the problem, I realized my mistake and corrected it. I also double-checked my calculations to ensure accuracy.
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
