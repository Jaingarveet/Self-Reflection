[header] How to get rid of chilblains [title] Use calamine lotion or witch hazel for itching. [step] Chilblains can be extremely itchy, but scratching them may result in an infection. To ease the itchiness of chilblains without scratching, apply some calamine lotion or witch hazel onto your chilblains using a cotton ball.
Choices:
  A: This will leave your chilblains feeling soft and soothing. [substeps] Do not use witch hazel or similar products if you have sensitive skin.
  B: Let it sit on the itchy rash for up to 5 minutes. [substeps] You can also purchase witch hazel at a pharmacy or physician's office.
  C: Both work well, so use whichever you have on hand. [substeps] Don't rub the lotion or witch hazel into your chilblains.
  D: Repeat this cycle every day for up to three days until the itch is gone. [substeps] If you are not used to scratching or do not want to seek medical treatment for an itch, ask your doctor to prescribe.

## Assistant 2:
## Self-Reflection on Previous Incorrect Answer:
**Problem:** I incorrectly chose option A as the answer, which focused on the softness and soothing feeling of the lotion/witch hazel, neglecting the crucial information about sensitive skin.
**Solution:** I need to prioritize the information that directly addresses the itchiness and potential risks associated with the remedies.
**Correct Answer:** Option C provides the most relevant information by acknowledging the effectiveness of both calamine lotion and witch hazel while emphasizing the importance of avoiding rubbing and considering individual skin sensitivities.
## Applying Self-Reflection to Current Question:
**Previous Step:** Applying calamine lotion or witch hazel to chilblains to relieve itchiness without scratching.
**Overall Goal:** Providing effective and safe methods to manage chilblains.
**Evaluation of Options:**
* **Option A:** While mentioning the soothing effect, it doesn't address the potential issue of sensitive skin.
* **Option B:** While providing information about the duration of application, it doesn't address the potential issue of sensitive skin.
* **Option C:** This option directly addresses the potential issue of sensitive skin, making it the most relevant and useful information to follow the previous step.
* **Option D:** This option focuses on repeating the process for several days, which is not directly relevant to the previous step of applying the lotion/witch hazel.
