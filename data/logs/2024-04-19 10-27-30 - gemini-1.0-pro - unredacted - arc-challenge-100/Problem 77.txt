You are an expert in Science.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: Sheep Challenge Evolution A species of sheep lives on the Scottish island of Hirta. Hirta has plenty of grass for the sheep to eat, and no natural predators of the sheep live on the island. Some sheep have dark wool, and some have light wool. The sheep with dark wool tend to be much larger and stronger than the sheep with light wool. However, researchers have found that in the last 20 years, the sheep with light wool have increased in number. Usually, strength and size help animals survive and breed. A new sheep predator is introduced to the island. Which change to the sheep population will most likely occur first?
Choices:
  A: a decrease in the population of sheep with dark wool
  B: a decrease in the population of sheep with light wool
  C: an increase in the population of sheep with dark wool
  D: an increase in the population of sheep with light wool
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that the new predator would target the larger and stronger sheep with dark wool. However, the question states that the sheep with light wool have increased in number in the last 20 years. This suggests that the sheep with light wool have a survival advantage, possibly due to their agility or camouflage.
Error Keywords:
 - Misinterpretation of data
 - Ignoring relevant information
 - Jumping to conclusions
Solution:
The new predator will likely target the sheep that are easier to catch.
The sheep with light wool have increased in number in the last 20 years, suggesting they have a survival advantage.
Therefore, the new predator is more likely to target the sheep with dark wool, leading to a decrease in their population.
Instructions:
1. Carefully read and understand the question, including all provided information.
2. Identify the key factors influencing the sheep population, such as predator introduction and wool color.
3. Analyze the historical trends in sheep population changes based on wool color.
4. Consider the predator's likely prey selection based on ease of capture.
5. Determine the population group most likely to be targeted by the predator, considering their survival advantage and ease of capture.
6. Choose the answer that reflects the most likely population change based on your analysis.
Advice:
 - Pay close attention to all details and data provided in the question.
 - Avoid making assumptions or jumping to conclusions without sufficient evidence.
 - Consider all relevant factors and their potential impact on the situation.
 - Analyze historical trends and patterns to identify potential influences.
 - Base your conclusions on logical reasoning and evidence-based analysis.
