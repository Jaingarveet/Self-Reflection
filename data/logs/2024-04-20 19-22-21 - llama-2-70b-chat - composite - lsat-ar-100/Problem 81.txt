Action: Answer("B") 

Explanation:
The correct answer is B: Exactly one French novel is selected.

The requirements state that no more than four French works can be selected, and at least three but no more than four novels can be selected. Therefore, option B meets both requirements.

Option A violates the requirement that at least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected. Option C violates the requirement that no more than four French works can be selected. Option D violates the requirement that at least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected. Option E violates the requirement that no more than six works can be selected.

Reflection:
After reflecting on the problem, I realized that I misunderstood the requirements and didn't carefully analyze the choices. I also failed to notice violations of the requirements. In the future, I will be more careful when dealing with negative statements and pay closer attention to the wording of the requirements and the choices. I will also double-check my work to ensure accuracy.
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
