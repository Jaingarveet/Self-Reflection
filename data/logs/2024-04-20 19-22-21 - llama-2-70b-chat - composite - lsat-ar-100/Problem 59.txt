You are an expert in Law.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## User 2:
Topic: Law
Context: At a concert, exactly eight compositions—F, H, L, O, P, R, S, and T—are to be performed exactly once each, consecutively and one composition at a time. The order of their performance must satisfy the following conditions: T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R. At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F. O is performed either first or fifth. The eighth composition performed is either L or H. P is performed at some time before S. At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
Question: P CANNOT be performed
Choices:
  A: second
  B: third
  C: fourth
  D: sixth
  E: seventh
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I failed to consider all possible scenarios that satisfy the given conditions. I chose the first valid order that came to mind, but it turned out to be incorrect.

Error Keywords:

* Overconfidence
* Lack of thoroughness
* Failure to consider all possible scenarios

Solution:
The correct order that satisfies all the conditions is:
H, F, L, O, R, T, S, P

In this order, P is performed [REDACTED], so the answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED].

Instructions:

1. Read the question carefully and understand the conditions.
2. Decompose the problem into smaller sub-problems.
3. Consider all possible scenarios that satisfy the conditions.
4. Check each scenario against the given conditions.
5. Choose the answer that matches the correct order.

Advice:

* Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
* Never assume the first valid solution is the only one.
* Consider all possible scenarios that satisfy the conditions.
* Be thorough in your reasoning and double-check your work.
* Don't be overconfident and always verify your answer.
