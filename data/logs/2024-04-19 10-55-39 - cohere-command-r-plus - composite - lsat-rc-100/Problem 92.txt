Context: Many educators in Canada and the United States advocate multicultural education as a means of achieving multicultural understanding. There are, however, a variety of proposals as to what multicultural education should consist of. The most modest of these proposals holds that schools and colleges should promote multicultural understanding by teaching about other cultures, teaching which proceeds from within the context of the majority culture. Students should learn about other cultures, proponents claim, but examination of these cultures should operate with the methods, perspectives, and values of the majority culture. These values are typically those of liberalism: democracy, tolerance, and equality of persons. Critics of this first proposal have argued that genuine understanding of other cultures is impossible if the study of other cultures is refracted through the distorting lens of the majority culture's perspective. Not all cultures share liberal values. Their value systems have arisen in often radically different social and historical circumstances, and thus, these critics argue, cannot be understood and adequately appreciated if one insists on approaching them solely from within the majority culture's perspective. In response to this objection, a second version of multicultural education has developed that differs from the first in holding that multicultural education ought to adopt a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures. The values of one culture should not be standards by which others are judged; each culture should be taken on its own terms. However, the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in this second version of multicultural education are still identifiably Western. They are the methods of anthropology, social psychology, political science, and sociology. They are, that is, methods which derive from the Western scientific perspective and heritage. Critics of this second form of multicultural education argue as follows: The Western scientific heritage is founded upon an epistemological system that prizes the objective over the subjective, the logical over the intuitive, and the empirically verifiable over the mystical. The methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are thus already value laden; the choice to examine and understand other cultures by these methods involves a commitment to certain values such as objectivity. Thus, the second version of multicultural education is not essentially different from the first. Scientific discourse has a privileged place in Western cultures, but the discourses of myth, tradition, religion, and mystical insight are often the dominant forms of thought and language of non-Western cultures. To insist on trying to understand nonscientific cultures by the methods of Western science is not only distorting, but is also an expression of an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism: the chauvinism of science. According to this objection, it is only by adopting the (often nonscientific) perspectives and methods of the cultures studied that real understanding can be achieved.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would provide the strongest objection to the criticism in the passage of the second version of multicultural education?
Choices:
  A: It is impossible to adopt the perspectives and methods of a culture unless one is a member of that culture.
  B: Many non-Western societies have value systems that are very similar to one another.
  C: Some non-Western societies use their own value system when studying cultures that have different values.
  D: Students in Western societies cannot understand their culture's achievements unless such achievements are treated as the subject of Western scientific investigations.
  E: Genuine understanding of another culture is necessary for adequately appreciating that culture.

Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation
- Incomplete understanding
- Overemphasis on one aspect of the criticism

Solution: The criticism of the second version of multicultural education is that using Western scientific methods to understand non-Western cultures can be distortive and culturally chauvinistic. It argues that the methods of social sciences, such as anthropology and sociology, are inherently value-laden and reflect Western biases. 

The strongest objection to this criticism would be an argument that directly addresses and refutes the idea that Western scientific methods are inherently distortive or chauvinistic. 

Choice [REDACTED]: It is important to note that this statement is incorrect. One can adopt the perspectives and methods of a culture without being a member of that culture. This is the basis of many academic disciplines, including anthropology and cultural studies. However, this does not directly refute the criticism that Western scientific methods may distort the understanding of non-Western cultures.

Choice [REDACTED]: While it is true that many non-Western societies share similar value systems, this does not address the criticism that Western scientific methods can impose a distorted perspective on non-Western cultures.

Choice [REDACTED]: This choice does not provide a strong objection to the criticism. The fact that some non-Western societies use Western scientific methods does not address the concern about cultural distortion or chauvinism.

Choice [REDACTED]: This choice is irrelevant to the criticism, as it focuses on Western societies' understanding of their own achievements rather than the understanding of non-Western cultures.

Choice [REDACTED]: This choice is a general statement about the importance of cultural understanding and does not directly address the criticism regarding the potential distortion caused by Western scientific methods.

Solution:
Instructions:
1. Carefully read and understand the criticism presented in the passage. 
2. Identify the key issue: the potential distortion and cultural chauvinism inherent in using Western scientific methods to understand non-Western cultures. 
3. Analyze each answer choice to determine if it directly refutes or addresses this key issue. 
4. Select the answer choice that provides the strongest objection to the criticism by demonstrating the benefits or validity of using Western scientific methods in this context. 

Advice:
 - Ensure you have a comprehensive understanding of the criticism presented in the passage. 
 - Identify the specific concerns and arguments made by the critics. 
 - Recognize any logical fallacies or misconceptions in the answer choices that may lead you astray. 
 - Look for answer choices that directly address and refute the key issues raised by the critics. 
 - Remember that the objection should provide a strong counterargument or evidence in favor of the approach taken by the second version of multicultural education.
