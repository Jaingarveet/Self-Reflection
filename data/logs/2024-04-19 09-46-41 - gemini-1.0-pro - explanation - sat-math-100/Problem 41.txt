Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that the function $f(x)$ was defined by a polynomial. 
The gap in my knowledge was not in the concept of factors but in the understanding of the problem statement. 
I did not recognize that the function $f(x)$ could be any function, not necessarily a polynomial.
