## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")

Question: $$h=-16 t^{2}+v t+k$$The equation above gives the height $h$, in feet, of a ball $t$ seconds after it is thrown straight up with an initial speed of $v$ feet per second from a height of $k$ feet. Which of the following gives $v$ in terms of $h, t$, and $k$ ?
Choices:
  A: $v=h+k-16 t$
  B: $v=\frac{h-k+16}{t}$
  C: $v=\frac{h+k}{t}-16 t$
  D: $v=\frac{h-k}{t}+16 t$
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
## Assistant 2:
I understand. I will use my self-reflection to answer this question correctly.
**Self-reflection:**
* I initially chose answer A because I focused on the term $-16t^2$ and thought it represented the initial velocity. However, I realized that this term represents the acceleration due to gravity, which is always negative for objects thrown upwards.
* The correct answer should isolate $v$ and include the terms $h$, $t$, and $k$.
* Answer B satisfies these conditions and correctly represents the initial velocity.
**Answer:**
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
