Explanation:
I incorrectly calculated the original price of the computer. 
I made a mistake in the order of operations when calculating the final price. 
I should have first calculated the discounted price and then added the sales tax.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The original price of the computer is the price before the discount and sales tax.
Let $x$ be the original price of the computer.
The discount is 20%, so the discounted price is 0.8x.
The sales tax is 8%, so the final price is 1.08(0.8x).
We know that the final price is $p$, so we can set up the equation:
1.08(0.8x) = p
To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 0.88:
x = p / 0.88
Action: Answer("B")
