Topic: Math
Context: $$.\begin{aligned}.& S(P)=\frac{1}{2} P+40 \\.& D(P)=220-P.\end{aligned}.$$.The quantity of a product supplied and the quantity of the product demanded in an economic market are functions of the price of the product. The functions above are the estimated supply and demand functions for a certain product. The function $S(P)$ gives the quantity of the product supplied to the market when the price is $P$ dollars, and the function $D(P)$ gives the quantity of the product demanded by the market when the price is $P$ dollars.
Question: Graphene, which is used in the manufacture of integrated circuits, is so thin that a sheet weighing one ounce can cover up to 7 football fields. If a football field has an area of approximately $1 \frac{1}{3}$ acres, about how many acres could 48 ounces of graphene cover?
Choices:
  A: 250
  B: 350
  C: 450
  D: 1,350

Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I made a mistake in calculating the total area covered by 48 ounces of graphene. I correctly calculated the number of football fields that 48 ounces of graphene could cover, but I then incorrectly multiplied that number by the area of a single football field. I should have multiplied by the area of 48 football fields.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
One ounce of graphene can cover 7 football fields.
48 ounces of graphene can cover 48 * 7 = 336 football fields.
The area of a football field is 1 1/3 acres.
The area of 336 football fields is 336 * 1 1/3 = 448 acres.
Action: Answer("B")
