## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Explanation:
## Assistant 2:
## Self-Reflection (Previous Incorrect Answer)
**My mistake:** I incorrectly combined like terms without considering the negative sign in front of the second parenthesis.
**Corrected approach:** 
1. Distribute the negative sign to all terms within the second parenthesis.
2. Combine like terms:
    - $x^2y$ terms: $x^2y - (-x^2y) = 2x^2y$
    - $y^2$ terms: $-3y^2 + 3y^2 = 0$
    - $xy^2$ terms: $5xy^2 + 3xy^2 = 8xy^2$
**Therefore, the simplified expression is:** $2x^2y + 8xy^2 - 0$
Action: Answer("D") 
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
