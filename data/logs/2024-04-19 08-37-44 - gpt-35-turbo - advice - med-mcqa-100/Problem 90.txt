## Assistant 2:
Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly. I did not read the question carefully and missed the fact that the patient is a multigravida with previous 2 normal delivery. This information is important because it suggests that the patient's uterus is not likely to have any anomalies. After reviewing the question again, I believe that the most likely cause of the unstable lie at 34 weeks in this patient is placenta previa, which is when the placenta is implanted in the lower uterine segment. This can cause the fetus to be in an unstable lie and can lead to bleeding during labor. 
Action: Answer("B")
