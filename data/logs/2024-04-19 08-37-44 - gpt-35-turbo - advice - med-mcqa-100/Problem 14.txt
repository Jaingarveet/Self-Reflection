## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Anaerobic glycolysis is the process of glucose breakdown in the absence of oxygen. It occurs in the cytoplasm of cells and produces energy in the form of ATP. The end product of anaerobic glycolysis is pyruvate, which is converted to lactate in the presence of lactate dehydrogenase. The net yield of ATP in anaerobic glycolysis is 2 ATP molecules per glucose molecule. However, 2 NADH molecules are also produced, which can be used in the electron transport chain to produce additional ATP.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
