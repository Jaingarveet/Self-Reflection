## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The question is asking about the narrowest part of the uterine tube.
I previously answered this question incorrectly by selecting the infundibulum, which is the widest part of the uterine tube.
I reviewed the anatomy of the uterine tube and found that the narrowest part is the isthmus, which is the part of the tube closest to the uterus.
Action: Answer("C")
