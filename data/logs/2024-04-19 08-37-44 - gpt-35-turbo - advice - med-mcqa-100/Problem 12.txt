## Assistant 2:
Reflection:
Aminoacyl t-RNA is required for the synthesis of proteins. Each amino acid has its own specific aminoacyl t-RNA synthetase enzyme that attaches the amino acid to its corresponding t-RNA molecule. However, there are some exceptions to this rule. Methionine is the only amino acid that is attached to its t-RNA molecule without the help of an aminoacyl t-RNA synthetase enzyme. Therefore, the correct answer is D: Methionine.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
