## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The contradiction arises because people favor the idea of college students working as nannies but are reluctant to hire them for the role. This suggests that there is a disconnect between the perceived benefits of college student nannies and the practical considerations of actually employing them. 

Answer A addresses this disconnect by providing a potential reason why people may be hesitant to hire college students as nannies. It suggests that the majority of respondents who would consider hiring college students are interested in specialized roles (tutors or secretaries) rather than general nanny or housekeeping work. This preference for specialized roles may not align with the typical responsibilities of a nanny, which could explain why there is a discrepancy between the favorable perception of college student nannies and the reluctance to hire them. 

Therefore, Answer A provides the most reasonable explanation for the contradictory phenomenon presented in the question.
