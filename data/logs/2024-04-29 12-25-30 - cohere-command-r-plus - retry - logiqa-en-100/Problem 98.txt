Topic: Logic
Context: Right and wrong and whether they violate the rules are two things.There may be regulations that prohibit things that are not wrong in themselves, such as laws in certain countries that prohibit criticism of the government; there may also be regulations that require things that are inherently wrong, such as laws that require apartheid in public places.And, like evaluating behavior, we can also evaluate some of the prescribed right and wrong.
Question: Which of the following does not weaken, but supports the argument in the question stem?
Choices:
  A: If we do not follow some pre-existing regulations or standards, how can we judge right and wrong?
  B: "People are doing, heaven is watching." Failure to act in accordance with ethical regulations will incur punishment from heaven.
  C: Behind the judgment of right and wrong, you can always find the rules or standards on which people judge.
  D: The basis for judgment of right and wrong lies in pushing oneself and one's moral conscience.It is common and universal; however, the moral regulations on how to act for people vary from person to person and from place to place.

## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The argument in the question stem is about the relationship between rules and judgments of right and wrong. 
Choice C directly supports this by stating that judgments of right and wrong are based on underlying rules or standards.

Choice A weakens the argument by suggesting that following pre-existing regulations is a prerequisite for judging right and wrong, which is not discussed in the argument.
Choice B introduces the idea of punishment from a higher power, which is not relevant to the argument's focus on the relationship between rules and judgments.
Choice D mentions individual and universal moral conscience as the basis for judgment, which is a separate concept from the argument's focus on rules and regulations.

Therefore, choice C is the correct answer as it directly supports the relationship between rules and judgments of right and wrong.
Action: Answer("C")

Agent Answer: C
