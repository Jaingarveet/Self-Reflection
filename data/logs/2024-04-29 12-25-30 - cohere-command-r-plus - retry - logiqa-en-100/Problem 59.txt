## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
From the conditions, we know:
1. H and Y must be in the same department.
2. F and G cannot be in the same department.
3. If X is in sales, then W is in production.
4. F must be in production.

Therefore, we can deduce the following:
1. H and Y are either in production or sales, but not public relations.
2. F is in production, and G is in sales or vice versa.
3. If X is in sales, then W is in production, but if W is in sales, we don't know where X is.

Only choice B satisfies all the conditions:
- W is in public relations.
- F and H are in production, and G is in sales (satisfying conditions 1, 2, and 4).
- Y is in sales (satisfying condition 1).
- X is in production, and W is in public relations (satisfying condition 3).

Thus, choice B is the correct answer.

Action: Answer("B")
