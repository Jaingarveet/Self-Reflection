## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Professor Zhao's statement tells us that the champion is neither Tsinghua University nor Zhejiang University.
Professor Qian's statement contradicts Professor Zhao's, so one of them must be wrong. 
If Professor Qian is wrong, then the champion is Tsinghua University, but this contradicts Professor Sun. 
Therefore, Professor Qian's statement is correct, and Professor Sun's is wrong. 
So, the champion is the University of Science and Technology of China.
