## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Rising land prices are claimed to be the main driver of soaring housing prices. For this assertion to be doubtful, there should be another factor that has a more significant impact on housing prices. 

Answer D suggests that the reason for rising housing prices is a lack of supply relative to demand. This provides an alternative explanation and thus casts doubt on the original assertion.

The other choices (A, B, and C) provide data or opinions that support the link between land prices and housing prices, which does not refute the original assertion.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
