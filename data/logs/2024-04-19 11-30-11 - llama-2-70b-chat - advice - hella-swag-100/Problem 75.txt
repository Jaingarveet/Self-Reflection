Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to escape extreme pressure employment [title] Come to grips with the fact that you can't take it anymore. [step] The lower you've hit bottom, the higher you will go. Consider stopping caring about your work/colleagues criticism and you might feel more relaxed in the short term.

  B: But as time goes on, the hard way tends to become ever harder. Stop caring about what others say/look at what they like.

## Assistant 2:
  Answer: B

The text suggests that the reader should stop caring about what others say and focus on their own well-being. Option B aligns with this idea by suggesting that the reader should stop caring about work/colleagues criticism and might feel more relaxed in the short term.

Option A does not align with the text's main idea. It suggests acting as if one doesn't need the money, which may not necessarily address the issue of pressure employment.

Option C suggests looking back on the future, which is not related to the context of the text.

Option D suggests giving notice to someone who deserves it, which may not be a healthy or productive solution to dealing with extreme pressure employment.
