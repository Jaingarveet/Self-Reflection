Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to make a gravity bong [title] Find an empty plastic bottle. [step] An empty water bottle or liter of soda will work. You can use any size bottle, but keep in mind that the bigger the bottle, the bigger the gravity bong hits will be.
Choices:
  A: [substeps] If you are using an empty bottle, ensure that the nozzle is clean and dry before you use it. If you're using an empty bottle, use a zip lock or a sheet of tin foil.
  B: [title] Cut a slit and feed all of the plastic in the slit into the bottle. [step] Make sure that you cut tight enough to keep the plastic in place if you're using an empty bottle.
  C: [substeps] If you're smoking alone, a small plastic bottle should work. You may want a large plastic bottle if you're smoking with multiple people.
  D: [title] Put on rubber gloves to avoid snapping the plastic skin of the bottle. [step] This won't break the bottle.

* Use logical reasoning to determine the most likely completion to the given text.

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly by choosing option A.
Upon reflection, I realized that the instructions are asking for a way to make a gravity bong, and option A does not provide any information related to that.
Option B seems to be the most relevant to the context of making a gravity bong, as it mentions cutting a slit and feeding plastic into the bottle, which could potentially create a makeshift bong.
Therefore, the most likely completion to the given text is option B.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
