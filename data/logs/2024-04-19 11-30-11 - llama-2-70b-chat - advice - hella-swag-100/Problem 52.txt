Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to be indie (for guys ) [title] Break free from conformity. [step] One of the most critical aspects to being indie is not adopting other people's views without evaluating the situation yourself. Going with the crowd is never something that an indie person would do, so make sure that you are making independent decisions when it comes to music, clothing, and your opinions.
Choices:
  A: [substeps] Understand how people may affect how you think about the music and related trends. [title] Steer clear of the " what's indie, what's indie-animal " mentality.
  B: Do your research on different topics to help inform your opinions. [substeps] If you like a band or musician, but everyone else thinks they are bad or weird, then you should stand up for your views.
  C: [substeps] Never allow the messenger back into your life. If you are in a relationship with someone but they are choosing to change with you, leave the conversation.
  D: You don't have to assume how you will feel. What's more, you probably know a bit more about people who just want to blend in with their surroundings.

## Assistant 2:
  Action: Answer("B")

Reflection:
Previously, I selected answer A, but upon reflection, I realize that it doesn't align with the text's message. The text advises guys on how to be indie and not adopt other people's views without evaluating the situation. Choice A talks about understanding how people may affect how you think about music and trends, which doesn't align with the text's message of not conforming to other people's views.

Choice B, on the other hand, advises guys to do their research on different topics to help inform their opinions. This aligns with the text's message of making independent decisions and not conforming to other people's views. Therefore, the correct answer is B.
