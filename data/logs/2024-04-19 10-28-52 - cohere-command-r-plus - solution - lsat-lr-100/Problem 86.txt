Topic: Law
Context: Until 1985 all commercial airlines completely replenished the cabin air in planes in flight once every 30 minutes. Since then the rate has been once every hour. The less frequently cabin air is replenished in a plane in flight, the higher the level of carbon dioxide in that plane and the easier it is for airborne illnesses to be spread.
Question: Which one of the following is most strongly supported by the information above?
Choices:
  A: In 1985 there was a loosening of regulations concerning cabin air in commercial airline flights.
  B: People who fly today are more likely to contract airborne illnesses than were people who flew prior to 1985.
  C: Low levels of carbon dioxide in cabin air make it impossible for airborne illnesses to spread.
  D: In 1980 the rate at which the cabin air was replenished in commercial airliners was sufficient to protect passengers from the effects of carbon dioxide buildup.
  E: In 1980 the level of carbon dioxide in the cabin air on a two-hour commercial airline flight was lower than it is today on a similar flight.
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
The context provides information about the rate of cabin air replenishment and its relationship to carbon dioxide levels. It states that less frequent air replenishment results in higher carbon dioxide levels. 

Before 1985, cabin air was replenished every 30 minutes, which is more frequent than the current rate of once per hour. Therefore, we can infer that carbon dioxide levels were lower during a two-hour flight in 1980 than they would be during a similar flight today.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: The correct answer is E. The information provided in the context supports the inference that carbon dioxide levels were lower in 1980 than they are today due to the more frequent replenishment of cabin air during flights at that time.
Action: Answer("E")
## Result:
Agent Answer: E
Correct Answer: E
Score: 1
