Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
The statements given are: 
 - Only Canadian films are shown at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival. 
 - Most films that won prizes at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival also won prizes at international festivals. 

Statement [REDACTED] states: [REDACTED] 

While this statement is true, it does not necessarily follow from the given statements. It could be true, but it is not a definite conclusion. 

Statement [REDACTED] states: It is not true that every film that won a prize at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival was also shown at an international film festival. 

This statement is the correct answer because it logically follows from the given information. If most films that won at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival also won at international festivals, it means that there could be films that did not follow this pattern, i.e., some films that won at Lac Nichoutec did not win at international festivals.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: The correct answer must be a statement that logically follows from the provided information.

Statement A is not correct as it claims that most Canadian films shown at international festivals won prizes at Lac Nichoutec, but this cannot be concluded from the given information.

Statement B is not correct as it claims that most Canadian films produced this year were shown at Lac Nichoutec. However, the given information does not provide any data on the production or origin of the films shown at international festivals.

Statement C is true as it is supported by the first premise, which states that only Canadian films are shown at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival. Therefore, if films won prizes at this festival, they must be Canadian.

Statement D is the correct answer. It is a valid conclusion from the second premise, which states that most of the films that won prizes at the Lac Nichoutec Festival also won at international festivals. This implies that there could be some films that did not follow this pattern, i.e., some films that won at Lac Nichoutec might not have won at international festivals.

Statement E is incorrect because it claims that there was at least one film that won at an international festival but was not shown at Lac Nichoutec. This cannot be concluded from the given information as it contradicts the second premise, which states that most films that won at Lac Nichoutec also won at international festivals.

Thus, the correct answer is D.

Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
