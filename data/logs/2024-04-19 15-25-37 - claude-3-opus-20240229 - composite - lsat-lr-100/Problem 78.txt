Topic: Law
Context: The chairperson of Acme Corporation has decided to move the company from its current location in Milltown to Ocean View. Most Acme employees cannot afford housing within a 30-minute commute of Ocean View. So once the company has moved, most Acme employees will have a commute of more than 30 minutes.
Question: The argument requires assuming which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: All Acme employees can afford housing within a 30-minute commute of Milltown.
  B: The chairperson of Acme has good financial reasons for wanting to move the company to Ocean View.
  C: None of Acme's employees except the chairperson are in favor of moving the company to Ocean View.
  D: Currently, most Acme employees have a commute of less than 30 minutes.
  E: Acme's move to Ocean View will not be accompanied by a significant pay raise for Acme employees.
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that the argument required assuming that most employees currently have a short commute. However, the argument does not provide any information about the current commute times. The argument only states that after the move, most employees will have a long commute because they cannot afford housing near Ocean View.
The correct assumption is that there will not be a significant pay raise accompanying the move. If there was a large pay raise, it could allow employees to afford housing near Ocean View, negating the conclusion that most will have a long commute.
Error Keywords:
 - Incorrect assumption
 - Missing information
 - Irrelevant assumption
 - Compensation oversight
Solution:
1. Acme Corporation is moving from Milltown to Ocean View.
2. Most Acme employees cannot afford housing within a 30-minute commute of Ocean View.
3. The argument concludes that after the move, most Acme employees will have a commute of more than 30 minutes.
4. For this conclusion to hold, we must assume there will not be a significant pay raise that would allow employees to afford housing near Ocean View.
5. If employees received a large pay raise, they might be able to afford housing near Ocean View, making the conclusion false.
6. Therefore, the argument requires assuming choice [REDACTED]: [REDACTED]
Instructions:
1. Read the argument carefully and identify the conclusion.
2. Identify the facts provided in the argument.
3. Determine what additional piece of information must be true for the conclusion to logically follow from the facts.
4. Don't make assumptions beyond what is provided in the argument.
5. Eliminate answer choices that are irrelevant or already stated in the argument.
6. Choose the answer choice that, if false, would make the conclusion illogical or unsupported.
Advice:
 - Focus on the logical structure of the argument.
 - Don't bring in outside knowledge or make unsupported assumptions.
 - The correct answer choice will be a critical piece of information required for the conclusion to follow from the premises.
 - Eliminate answer choices that are irrelevant, already stated, or go beyond the scope of the argument.
 - Consider how the argument would be impacted if each answer choice were false.
## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The conclusion of the argument is that once Acme moves to Ocean View, most employees will have a commute of more than 30 minutes.
2. The facts provided are:
   - Acme is moving from Milltown to Ocean View
   - Most employees cannot afford housing within a 30-minute commute of Ocean View
3. For the conclusion to hold, there must be an unstated assumption that bridges the gap between the facts and the conclusion. We need to find an assumption that, if false, would make the conclusion illogical.
4. Let's examine each answer choice:
   A) The current commute times in Milltown are not stated, so this is not a necessary assumption.
   
   B) The chairperson's financial reasons are not relevant to the employees' commute times.
   
   C) The employees' opinions on the move are not relevant to their commute times.
   
   D) The argument does not rely on the current commute times, so this is not a necessary assumption.
   
   E) If this were false, and there was a significant pay raise, employees might be able to afford housing near Ocean View. This would undermine the conclusion.
5. The argument relies on choice E being true. If employees got a big pay raise, the conclusion would not necessarily follow.
Therefore, the argument requires assuming choice E: Acme's move to Ocean View will not be accompanied by a significant pay raise for Acme employees.
Action: Answer("E")
