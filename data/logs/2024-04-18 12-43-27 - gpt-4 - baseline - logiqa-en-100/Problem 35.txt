Context: Five graduate students Zhang, Wang, Li, Zhao, and Liu graduated from a linguistics major in a college of arts of a university in 2014, and were hired by one of the three employers, Tianshu, Tianji, and Tianxuan, and at least one of them was hired by each unit.name.Known? (1) Li was hired by Tianshu; (2) Li and Zhao were not hired by the same unit; (3) Liu and Zhao were hired by the same unit; (4) If Zhang was hired by Tianxuan, then Wang Ye Was hired by Tianxuan.
Question: Which of the following may be correct?
Choices:
  A: Li and Liu were hired by the same unit.
  B: Wang, Zhao and Liu were all hired by Tianji.
  C: Only Liu was hired by Tian Xuan.
  D: Only Wang was hired by Tianxuan.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
From the given conditions, we know that:
1) Li was hired by Tianshu.
2) Li and Zhao were not hired by the same unit, so Zhao was not hired by Tianshu.
3) Liu and Zhao were hired by the same unit, so Liu was not hired by Tianshu.
4) If Zhang was hired by Tianxuan, then Wang was also hired by Tianxuan.
From these conditions, we can infer that:
- Li and Liu were not hired by the same unit, so choice A is incorrect.
- Since Zhao and Liu were hired by the same unit and Zhao was not hired by Tianshu, they must have been hired by either Tianji or Tianxuan. If they were hired by Tianji, then Wang could not have been hired by Tianji because if Zhang was hired by Tianxuan, then Wang was also hired by Tianxuan. So, choice B is incorrect.
- If only Liu was hired by Tianxuan, then Zhao must have been hired by Tianji. But this would mean that Wang could not have been hired by Tianxuan, contradicting the condition that if Zhang was hired by Tianxuan, then Wang was also hired by Tianxuan. So, choice C is incorrect.
- If only Wang was hired by Tianxuan, then Zhao and Liu must have been hired by Tianji, which is possible. So, choice D may be correct.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
