B: This could weaken the argument because it suggests that the advertisers might have left due to the magazine's low credibility, an economic reason.
C: This could weaken the argument because it suggests that the advertisers left because the magazine's new content didn't align with their products, an economic reason.
D: This could weaken the argument because it suggests that the advertisers left due to the increased advertising cost, an economic reason.
