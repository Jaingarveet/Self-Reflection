## System:
You are an expert in Logic.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

## User 2:
Topic: Logic
Context: Right and wrong and whether they violate the rules are two things.There may be regulations that prohibit things that are not wrong in themselves, such as laws in certain countries that prohibit criticism of the government; there may also be regulations that require things that are inherently wrong, such as laws that require apartheid in public places.And, like evaluating behavior, we can also evaluate some of the prescribed right and wrong.
Question: Which of the following does not weaken, but supports the argument in the question stem?
Choices:
  A: If we do not follow some pre-existing regulations or standards, how can we judge right and wrong?
  B: "People are doing, heaven is watching." Failure to act in accordance with ethical regulations will incur punishment from heaven.
  C: Behind the judgment of right and wrong, you can always find the rules or standards on which people judge.
  D: The basis for judgment of right and wrong lies in pushing oneself and one's moral conscience.It is common and universal; however, the moral regulations on how to act for people vary from person to person and from place to place.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The argument in the question stem is about the relationship between regulations and the inherent right or wrong of actions. It suggests that regulations can sometimes prohibit actions that are not inherently wrong and require actions that are inherently wrong. It also suggests that we can evaluate the right or wrong of regulations themselves. 
Choice A suggests that we need pre-existing regulations to judge right and wrong, which does not support the argument that regulations can be inherently wrong. 
Choice B introduces a religious perspective, which is not relevant to the argument about regulations and inherent right or wrong. 
Choice C supports the argument by suggesting that judgments of right and wrong are always based on some rules or standards, which could be seen as regulations. 
Choice D supports the argument by suggesting that the basis for judgment of right and wrong is universal, but the regulations on how to act can vary, which implies that regulations can be inherently wrong.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
