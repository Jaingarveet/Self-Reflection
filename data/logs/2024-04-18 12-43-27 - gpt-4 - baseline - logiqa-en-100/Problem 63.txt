Topic: Logic
Context: The characteristic of capital is the pursuit of profit.In the first half of 2004, the price increase in China exceeded the interest rate of bank deposits.From January to July, residents 'income continued to increase, but the growth rate of residents' savings deposits continued to decline.Outflow deposits in July reached about 100 billion yuan, and the proportion of time deposits in all deposits continued to decline.
Question: Which of the following, if true, can best explain the flow of most of the 100 billion yuan savings funds?
Choices:
  A: As the expected price continues to rise, many residents' funds can only survive, so that they can buy the goods they need at any time.
  B: Due to the expected increase in bank interest rates, many residents' funds can only survive for a period of time.
  C: As the state controls the scale of loans, the funds of the majority of private enterprises are tight, and private lending is active.The interest on lending has been much higher than the bank deposit interest rate.
  D: Because bank deposit interest rates are too low, many residents consider whether to buy stocks or funds.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The context mentions that the price increase in China exceeded the interest rate of bank deposits. This means that the money kept in the bank is not growing as fast as the prices are increasing. Therefore, keeping money in the bank is not profitable. The context also mentions that the growth rate of residents' savings deposits continued to decline, which means people are not depositing as much money in the banks. The best explanation for this would be that people are looking for more profitable ways to use their money.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
