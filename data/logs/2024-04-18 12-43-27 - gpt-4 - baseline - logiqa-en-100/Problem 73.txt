Context: In a magic show, from the seven magicians-G.H.K.L.N.P and Q, choose 6 people to play, and the performance is divided into two teams? 1 team and 2 teams.Each team consists of three positions? front, middle, and back.The magicians on the field happen to occupy one position each.The choice and location of the magician must meet the following conditions? (1) If G or H is arranged to play, they must be in the front.Bit.(2) If K is scheduled to play, he must be in the middle.(3) If L is scheduled to play, he must be on team 1.(4) Neither P nor K can be in the same team as N.(5) P cannot be in the same team as Q.(6) If H is in team 2, Q is in the middle of team 1.
Question: If G is in team 1, which pair of magicians can be in team 1?
Choices:
  A: K and L
  B: K and P
  C: L and N
  D: L and Q
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
If G is in team 1, he must be in the front position according to condition (1). 
From condition (3), L must be in team 1, but he can't be in the front position because G is already there. So, L can be either in the middle or at the back.
From condition (2), if K is in team 1, he must be in the middle. But if L is in the middle, K can't be in team 1. So, K can't be in team 1.
From condition (4), neither P nor K can be in the same team as N. Since K can't be in team 1, N can be in team 1. But if N is in team 1, P can't be in team 1.
From condition (5), P can't be in the same team as Q. Since P can't be in team 1, Q can be in team 1.
So, the possible pairs of magicians that can be in team 1 with G are L and N, or L and Q.
Action: Answer("C") and Answer("D")
