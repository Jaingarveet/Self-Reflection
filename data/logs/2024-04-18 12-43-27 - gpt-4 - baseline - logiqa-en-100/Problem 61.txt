Context: A company has six general manager assistants F, G, H, I, M and P, and three departments, each of which is in charge of three general manager assistants.Each assistant general manager is in charge of at least one department.The following conditions must be met? (1) There is only one assistant to the general manager in charge of three departments at the same time.(2) F and G are not in charge of the same department.(3) H and I are not in charge of the same department.
Question: If F and M are not in charge of the same department, which of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: F and H are in charge of the same department.
  B: F and I are in charge of the same department.
  C: I and P are in charge of the same department.
  D: M and G are in charge of the same department.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Given that each assistant is in charge of at least one department and there are three departments, there must be at least one assistant in charge of two departments. Since F and M are not in charge of the same department, and F and G are not in charge of the same department, F must be in charge of a department alone. Similarly, since H and I are not in charge of the same department, one of them must be in charge of a department alone. Therefore, the assistant in charge of three departments must be one of G, M, or P. This means that the remaining two must share a department. 
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D

Score: 0
