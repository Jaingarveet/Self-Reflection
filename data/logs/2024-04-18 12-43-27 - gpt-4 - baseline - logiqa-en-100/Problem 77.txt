Context: The members of the printing group and the binding group are mainly from the following seven employees-F, G, H, J, K, L and M.The members of each group must meet the following conditions? (1) Each group has at least 3 employees .(2) F and K cannot be in the same group.(3) If K is in a certain group, J must also be in this group.(4) M is at least one of the members of these two groups.(5) At least one of the same employees in both groups.
Question: If the printing group has only three members, G, H, and L, and under sufficient conditions, the two groups have as many common members as possible, then which of the following statements must be true?
Choices:
  A: The binding group and the printing group happen to have a common member.
  B: The binding group and the printing group have exactly two members in common.
  C: The number of members in the binding and printing groups is the same.
  D: The number of members of the bookbinding group is at least one more than that of the printing group.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The printing group has G, H, and L. 
Condition (4) states that M must be in at least one of the groups, and since M is not in the printing group, M must be in the binding group. 
Condition (5) states that there must be at least one common member in both groups. Since the printing group is already full, the common member must be either G, H, or L. 
Therefore, the binding group must have at least two members (M and one of G, H, or L). 
The binding group can have more members, but it cannot have F and K together (condition 2), and if it has K, it must also have J (condition 3). 
So, the binding group can have at most 5 members (M, G/H/L, F, K, J). 
Therefore, the binding group has at least one more member than the printing group.
Action: Answer("D")
