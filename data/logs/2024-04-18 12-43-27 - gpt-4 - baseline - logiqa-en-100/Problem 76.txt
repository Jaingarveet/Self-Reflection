Topic: Logic
Context: Some Taiwan independence elements argue that all people under the jurisdiction of the People ’s Republic of China are Chinese, and Taiwanese are not under the jurisdiction of the People ’s Republic of China.Therefore, Taiwanese are not Chinese.
Question: Which of the following reasoning clearly shows that the above argument is not valid?
Choices:
  A: All successful people have to eat in clothes.I am not a successful person now, so I do n’t have to eat in clothes.
  B: Commodities have use value, and air certainly has use value, so air is of course a commodity.
  C: All technical backbones study hard.Xiao Zhang is a technical backbone.Therefore, Xiao Zhang is a hard-working person.
  D: Criminal behaviors are illegal behaviors, and violations should be condemned by the society, so all criminal behaviors should be condemned by the society.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The argument in the context is a logical fallacy known as denying the antecedent. It assumes that if a condition is true for a certain case, it must be true for all related cases. The choice that best illustrates this fallacy is A, where the reasoning incorrectly assumes that if all successful people eat in clothes, then anyone who is not successful does not need to eat in clothes. This is the same type of fallacy as the argument in the context.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
