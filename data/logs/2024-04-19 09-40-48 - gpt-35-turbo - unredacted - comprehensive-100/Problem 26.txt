Topic: Law
Context: A shopping center has exactly seven spaces—space 1 through space 7—arranged in a straight row. Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
Question: If the shoe store is in space 2, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: The optometrist is in space 5.
  B: The pharmacy is in space 1.
  C: A restaurant is in space 3.
  D: The toy store is in space 6.
  E: The veterinarian is in space 4.

Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I made an error in my reasoning about the possible locations of the optometrist, pharmacy, and veterinarian.
If the shoe store is in space 2, then the pharmacy must be in space 1 or space 7.
The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, so the restaurant cannot be in space 3.
The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, so if the pharmacy is in space 1, then the optometrist or the veterinarian must be in space 2.
The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so if the veterinarian is in space 4, then the toy store cannot be in space 3 or space 5.
However, I did not consider the fact that the optometrist could be in space 5, which would satisfy all of the constraints.
Error Keywords:
 - Misunderstanding constraints
 - Overlooking possibilities
 - Incorrect reasoning
Solution:
If the shoe store is in space 2, then the pharmacy must be in space 1 or space 7.
The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, so the restaurant cannot be in space 3.
The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, so if the pharmacy is in space 1, then the optometrist or the veterinarian must be in space 2.
The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so if the veterinarian is in space 4, then the toy store cannot be in space 3 or space 5.
However, the optometrist could be in space 5, which would satisfy all of the constraints.
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and understand the constraints.
2. Identify the fixed locations of the pharmacy and the two restaurants.
3. Determine the possible locations of the shoe store based on the fixed locations.
4. Consider the possible locations of the optometrist and the veterinarian based on the location of the pharmacy.
5. Check the possible locations of the toy store based on the locations of the veterinarian and the shoe store.
6. Double-check your reasoning to ensure that you have considered all possibilities.
7. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the constraints.
 - Always consider all possibilities and do not overlook any constraints.
 - Always double-check your reasoning to ensure that you have considered all possibilities.
 - Remember that the fixed locations of some businesses can help you determine the possible locations of other businesses.
