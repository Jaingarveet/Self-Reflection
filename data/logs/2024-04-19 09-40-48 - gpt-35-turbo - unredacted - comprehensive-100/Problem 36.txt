Context: Editorial: Painting involves a sequential application of layers, each of which adheres satisfactorily only if the underlying layer has been properly applied. Education is, in this respect, like the craft of painting. Since the most important steps in painting are preparation of the surface to be painted and application of the primer coat, it makes sense to suppose that .
Question: Which one of the following most logically completes the editorial's argument?
Choices:
  A: in the educator's initial contact with a student, the educator should be as undemanding as possible
  B: students who have a secure grasp of the fundamentals of a subject are likely to make progress in that subject
  C: educators who are not achieving the goals they intended should revise their teaching methods
  D: teaching new students is rewarding but much more difficult than teaching more advanced students
  E: the success of a student's overall educational experience depends above all upon that student's initial educational experience

Reflection:
I incorrectly answered this question by not fully understanding the editorial's argument. I focused too much on the comparison between painting and education and did not consider the main point of the argument. 
Error Keywords:
 - Misunderstanding the argument
 - Focusing on a minor detail
 - Not considering the main point
Solution:
The editorial compares education to painting and states that preparation and application of the primer coat are important steps in painting. The editorial then suggests that a similar approach should be taken in education. The missing statement should support this idea. 
Option E states that the success of a student's overall educational experience depends above all upon that student's initial educational experience. This statement supports the idea that proper preparation and foundation are important in education, just as they are in painting. Therefore, Option E logically completes the editorial's argument.
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and understand the argument.
2. Identify the main point of the argument.
3. Consider each option and evaluate how it supports or refutes the main point.
4. Choose the option that best supports the main point of the argument.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the argument.
 - Identify the main point of the argument.
 - Consider each option and evaluate how it supports or refutes the main point.
 - Choose the option that best supports the main point of the argument.
 - Do not get distracted by minor details or comparisons.
