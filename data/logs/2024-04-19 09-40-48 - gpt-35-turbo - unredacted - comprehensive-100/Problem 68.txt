Explanation:
I correctly identified that the equation of the line passing through $(2,k)$ and $(k,32)$ is $y-k=\frac{32-k}{k-2}(x-2)$.
However, I made an error in substituting $x=0$ and $y=0$ in the equation of the line.
When $x=0$ and $y=0$, the equation becomes $-k=\frac{32-k}{k-2}(-2)$.
Simplifying this equation gives $k^2-8k+16=0$.
Factoring this equation gives $(k-4)(k-4)=0$, so $k=4$ is a repeated root.
However, the question asks for which of the following could be the value of $k$, not which is the only possible value of $k$.
Therefore, we need to check the other answer choices to see if they could also be values of $k$.
Substituting $k=0$ gives the equation $y=\frac{16}{-2}x$, which does not pass through the point $(2,k)=(2,0)$.
Substituting $k=8$ gives the equation $y-8=\frac{24}{6}(x-2)$, which simplifies to $y=4x-8$.
This equation passes through the origin and the point $(2,k)=(2,8)$, so $k=8$ is a possible value of $k$.
Substituting $k=16$ gives the equation $y-16=\frac{16}{14}(x-2)$, which simplifies to $y=\frac{8}{7}x+\frac{16}{7}$.
This equation does not pass through the point $(k,32)=(16,32)$.
Therefore, the only possible value of $k$ is $k=\boxed{\textbf{(C) }8}$.

Instructions:
1. Identify the equation of the line passing through the given points.
2. Substitute $x=0$ and $y=0$ in the equation of the line.
3. Solve the resulting equation for $k$.
4. Check each answer choice to see if it could be a value of $k$.
5. Substitute each answer choice into the equation of the line and check if it passes through both given points.
6. Choose the answer choice(s) that could be a value of $k$.
7. Double-check your calculations and final answer.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always check your work and double-check your calculations.
 - Always substitute your answer choices back into the original problem to check if they are valid.
 - Remember that a repeated root is possible, but not the only solution.
