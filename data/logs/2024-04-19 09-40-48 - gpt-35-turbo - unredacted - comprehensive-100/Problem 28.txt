Context: During a recital, two pianists—Wayne and Zara—will perform solos. There will be five solos altogether, performed one immediately after another. Each solo will be either a modern piece or a traditional piece. The choice of pianist and type of piece for the solos must conform to the following conditions: The third solo is a traditional piece. Exactly two of the traditional pieces are performed consecutively. In the fourth solo, either Wayne performs a traditional piece or Zara performs a modern piece. The pianist who performs the second solo does not perform the fifth solo. No traditional piece is performed until Wayne performs at least one modem piece.
Question: Which one of the following could be all of the solos that are traditional pieces?
Choices:
  A: the first, third, and fourth
  B: the second, third, and fourth
  C: the third and fourth
  D: the third and fifth
  E: the fourth and fifth

You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I misinterpreted the condition "No traditional piece is performed until Wayne performs at least one modem piece." I thought that Wayne must perform a modern piece first, but it is not necessary. 
Error Keywords:
 - Misinterpretation
 - Misunderstanding
 - Assumption
Solution:
The third solo is a traditional piece.
Exactly two of the traditional pieces are performed consecutively.
No traditional piece is performed until Wayne performs at least one modem piece.
It is possible that Wayne performs a traditional piece first, followed by two consecutive traditional pieces, and then Zara performs a modern piece in the fourth solo, and Wayne performs a modern piece in the fifth solo.
Therefore, the answer is C.
Instructions:
1. Read the problem carefully and understand the conditions.
2. Identify the condition that limits the placement of traditional pieces.
3. Identify the condition that limits the placement of modern pieces.
4. Identify the condition that limits the choice of pianist for the fourth solo.
5. Identify the condition that limits the choice of pianist for the fifth solo.
6. Use the conditions to eliminate impossible combinations of solos.
7. Use the remaining conditions to identify possible combinations of solos.
8. Choose the answer that matches the given condition.
Advice:
 - Always read the problem carefully and understand the conditions.
 - Always identify the constraints and limitations of the problem.
 - Never assume any condition that is not explicitly stated.
 - Always double-check your interpretation of the conditions.
 - Always eliminate impossible combinations of solutions first.
 - Always use the remaining conditions to identify possible solutions.
 - Remember that the correct answer must satisfy all of the given conditions.
