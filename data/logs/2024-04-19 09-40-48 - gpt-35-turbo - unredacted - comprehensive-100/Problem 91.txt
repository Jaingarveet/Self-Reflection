Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I correctly identified that topical antibiotics are not used to treat comedonal acne. However, I did not choose the correct answer between the remaining options. While benzoyl peroxide is a common treatment for mild to moderate acne, including comedonal acne, retinoids are the preferred treatment for comedonal acne. Estrogen is not a common treatment for acne.
Error Keywords:
 - Misunderstanding of treatment options
 - Lack of knowledge of preferred treatment
 - Failure to differentiate between treatment options
Solution:
Comedonal acne is a type of acne that is characterized by blackheads and whiteheads. 
Topical antibiotics are used to treat inflammatory acne, not comedonal acne.

Retinoids are the preferred treatment for comedonal acne.
