Error Keywords:

Solution:
Dermoid cysts are the most common ovarian tumor to undergo torsion during pregnancy. 
Dermoid cysts are also known as mature cystic teratomas and are composed of multiple germ cell layers. 
Theca lutein cysts are associated with gestational trophoblastic disease and multiple gestations, but they are not prone to torsion. 
Serous cystadenomas and mucinous cystadenomas are benign epithelial ovarian tumors that are not typically associated with torsion. 
Instructions:
1. Understand the characteristics of each ovarian tumor type.
2. Identify the ovarian tumor that is most prone to undergo torsion during pregnancy.
3. Choose the correct answer based on your knowledge of ovarian tumors and pregnancy.
4. Double-check your answer to ensure accuracy.
