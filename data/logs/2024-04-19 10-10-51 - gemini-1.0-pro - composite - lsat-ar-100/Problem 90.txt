Context: A maintenance company that takes service requests from three clients—Image, Solide, and Truvest—plans to set targets for its average service response times. Service targets will be set at 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day. Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail. The six targets are set according to the following conditions: None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
Question: Which one of the following targets CANNOT be set for more than one of the clients?
Choices:
  A: a 1-day website target
  B: a 2-day voicemail target
  C: a 2-day website target
  D: a 3-day voicemail target
  E: a 3-day website target

I incorrectly identified the target that could not be set for more than one client. I focused on the voicemail targets and overlooked the website targets.
Error Keywords:

1. Read the question and conditions carefully.
2. Break down the problem into smaller, more manageable parts.
3. Consider all aspects of the problem, not just a subset.
4. Eliminate choices that are clearly incorrect.
5. Choose the answer that satisfies all conditions.
6. Double-check your reasoning and answer.
Advice:

## Assistant 2:
## Thought process:
1. **Conditions:**
    - No client can have a website target longer than its voicemail target.
    - Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
    - Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
2. **Analyzing choices:**
    - **A: a 1-day website target:** This could be set for multiple clients as long as their voicemail targets are also 1 day or less.
    - **B: a 2-day voicemail target:** This could be set for multiple clients as long as their website targets are also 2 days or less.
    - **C: a 2-day website target:** This could be set for multiple clients as long as their voicemail targets are also 2 days or less.
    - **D: a 3-day voicemail target:** This could be set for multiple clients as long as their website targets are also 3 days or less.
    - **E: a 3-day website target:** This **cannot** be set for more than one client. If one client has a 3-day website target, the other two clients must have website targets of 2 days or less to satisfy the condition that no client can have a website target longer than its voicemail target. However, if two clients have 3-day website targets, then their voicemail targets must also be 3 days, violating the condition that Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
