Context: A maintenance company that takes service requests from three clients—Image, Solide, and Truvest—plans to set targets for its average service response times. Service targets will be set at 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day. Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail. The six targets are set according to the following conditions: None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
Question: If none of the clients has a website target of 2 days, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Image's website target is shorter than Solide's.
  B: Solide's website target is shorter than Image's.
  C: Solide's voicemail target is shorter than Truvest's.
  D: Truvest's website target is shorter than Image's.

## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Since none of the clients has a website target of 2 days, we can eliminate options B and D.
Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets, so we can eliminate option C.
Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target, so we can eliminate option E.
Therefore, the only option that could be true is A: Image's website target is shorter than Solide's.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: C
