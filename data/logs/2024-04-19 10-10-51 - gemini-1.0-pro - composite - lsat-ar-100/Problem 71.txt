## Assistant 2:
I understand the instructions and the context. I will use my previous reflection to answer this question correctly.
**Reflection:**
* **Error:** I previously selected answer choice "C: Parra, Quinn" as the correct answer. However, this is incorrect because the conditions state that Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other, and Zone 3 already has two sales representatives (Kim and Mahr).
* **Solution:** To find the correct answer, we need to consider the conditions and the number of sales representatives in each zone. Since there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, and Parra and Quinn work together, they cannot be in Zone 3. Therefore, the only possible answer is **D: Stuckey, Tiao, Udall**.
* **Instructions:** The instructions are clear and provide all the necessary information to answer the question.
* **Advice:** Pay close attention to the conditions and the number of sales representatives in each zone. Also, consider the logical implications of the conditions to eliminate incorrect answer choices.
**Answer:**
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
