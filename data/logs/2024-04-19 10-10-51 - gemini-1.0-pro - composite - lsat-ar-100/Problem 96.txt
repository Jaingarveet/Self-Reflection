Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that the information about Rottweilers not being featured on any day that features Himalayans was relevant to the question. 
The question only asks about the possibility of Himalayans being featured on day 6, not whether they are featured on day 6 in this specific scenario. 
Error Keywords:
 - Irrelevant information
 - Overthinking
 - Misinterpretation
Solution:
Himalayans are not featured on day 2.
Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.
Therefore, Himalayans are featured on day 3, day 5, and day 6.
Rottweilers are featured on day 2 and day 4.
Greyhounds are featured on day 1 and day 7.
Manx are featured on day 3 and day 5.
Siamese are featured on day 2 and day 4.
