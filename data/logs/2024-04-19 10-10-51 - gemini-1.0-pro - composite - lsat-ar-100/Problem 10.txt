## Self-Reflection on Previous Incorrect Answer
**Error Keywords:**
* **At least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected.**
* **If both French plays are selected, then the Russian play is not selected.**
**Solution:**
The previous answer incorrectly selected two French novels and one Russian novel, violating the requirement of selecting at least as many French novels as Russian novels. Additionally, it selected both French plays, which should have excluded the Russian play according to the second requirement.
**Instructions:**
* Ensure that the selection meets all the requirements stated in the context.
* Pay close attention to the minimum and maximum limits for each category (French works, novels, plays).
* Consider the conditional statement regarding the selection of French plays and the Russian play.
**Advice:**
* Break down the requirements into smaller, more manageable parts.
* Use a systematic approach to check each requirement against the selected works.
* Double-check the answer to ensure it fulfills all the conditions.
## Applying Self-Reflection to the Current Question
Based on the self-reflection, let's analyze the answer choices:
**A:** This violates the requirement of selecting at least as many French novels as Russian novels.
**B:** This violates the requirement of selecting at least three novels.
**C:** This violates the requirement of selecting at least as many French novels as Russian novels.

    * 3 French novels (meets the minimum requirement)
    * 2 Russian novels (meets the minimum requirement)
    * 1 French play and 1 Russian play (meets the conditional statement)
Therefore, the correct answer is:
