Context: A government needs to assign new ambassadors to Venezuela, Yemen, and Zambia. The candidates for these ambassadorships are Jaramillo, Kayne, Landon, Novetzke, and Ong. One ambassador will be assigned to each country, and no ambassador will be assigned to more than one country.

* Use a systematic approach to eliminate options that violate the constraints.
**Advice:**
* Pay close attention to conditional statements and their implications.
* Double-check your reasoning and calculations before selecting an answer.
* If unsure, consider alternative interpretations and test them against the constraints.
