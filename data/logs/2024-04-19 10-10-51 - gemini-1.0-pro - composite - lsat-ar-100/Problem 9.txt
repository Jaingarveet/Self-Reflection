Context: An administrator must assign parking spaces to six new employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young. Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
Question: If Young is assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Togowa is assigned parking space #1.
  B: Young is assigned parking space #2.

## Assistant 2:
I understand. I will use my self-reflection to answer this question correctly.
**Error Keywords:**
* **Young is assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza:** This means that Young cannot be assigned parking spaces #1, #2, or #3.
* **Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young:** This means that Robertson cannot be assigned parking spaces #1 or #2.
**Solution:**
1. **Assign Robertson parking space #1.** This satisfies the rule that Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
2. **Assign Young parking space #2.** This satisfies the rule that Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
3. **Assign Souza parking space #3.** This satisfies the rule that Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
4. **Assign Xu parking space #4.** This satisfies all remaining rules.
5. **Assign Togowa parking space #5.**
6. **Assign Vaughn parking space #6.**
**Answer:**
C: Robertson is assigned parking space #3.
**Reflection:**
I previously made the mistake of assigning Robertson parking space #2, which violated the rule that Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. By carefully considering the rules and the available parking spaces, I was able to find the correct solution.
