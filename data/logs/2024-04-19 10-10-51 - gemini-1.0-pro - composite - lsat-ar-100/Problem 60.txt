## Self-Reflection
**Error Keywords:**
* **"Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7."** This condition was not considered in my previous attempt.
* **"Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans."** This condition was also not fully considered.
**Solution:**
1. **Greyhounds are featured on day 1.**
2. **Rottweilers are not featured on day 7.** This eliminates options A, B, and E.
3. **Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.** This eliminates option D.
4. **Rottweilers are not featured on any day that features Himalayans.** This eliminates option C.
Therefore, the only possible order is:
**Manx, Himalayan, Siamese, Himalayan, Manx, Himalayan, Siamese**
**Instructions:**
* Carefully read and understand all conditions.
* Pay close attention to negative conditions (e.g., "not featured").
* Use a systematic approach to eliminate options that violate the conditions.
**Advice:**
* Double-check your work before submitting your answer.
* Consider using a table or diagram to visualize the possible combinations.
