Topic: Law
Context: Of the eight students—George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert—in a seminar, exactly six will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
Question: Which one of the following could be the schedule of the students' reports?
Choices:
  A: Mon. morning: Helen; Mon. afternoon: Robert Tues. morning: Olivia; Tues. afternoon: Irving Wed. morning: Lenore; Wed. afternoon: Kyle
  B: Mon. morning: Irving; Mon. afternoon: Olivia Tues. morning: Helen; Tues. afternoon: Kyle Wed. morning: Nina; Wed. afternoon: Lenore
  C: Mon. morning: Lenore; Mon. afternoon: Helen Tues. morning: George; Tues. afternoon: Kyle Wed. morning: Robert; Wed. afternoon: Irving
  D: Mon. morning: Nina; Mon. afternoon: Helen Tues. morning: Robert; Tues. afternoon: Irving Wed. morning: Olivia; Wed. afternoon: Lenore

## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
* George can only give a report on Tuesday.
* Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports.
* If Nina gives a report, then Helen and Irving must both give reports the next day, unless Nina's report is on Wednesday.
Let's analyze the answer choices:
**A:** This violates the condition that Olivia cannot give an afternoon report.
**B:** This violates the condition that if Nina gives a report, then Helen and Irving must both give reports the next day.
**C:** This violates the condition that George can only give a report on Tuesday.
**D:** This satisfies all the conditions. Nina gives a report on Monday, so Helen and Irving give reports on Tuesday. George gives a report on Tuesday, and Olivia and Robert do not give afternoon reports.
**E:** This violates the condition that Olivia cannot give an afternoon report.
Therefore, the only possible schedule is:
**Mon. morning: Nina; Mon. afternoon: Helen**
**Tues. morning: Robert; Tues. afternoon: Irving**
**Wed. morning: Olivia; Wed. afternoon: Lenore**
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: C
