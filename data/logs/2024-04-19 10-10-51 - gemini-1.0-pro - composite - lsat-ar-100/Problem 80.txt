  A: #1: Young; #2: Souza; #3: Vaughn; #4: Robertson; #5: Togowa; #6: Xu
  B: #1: Vaughn; #2: Togowa; #3: Young; #4: Souza; #5: Robertson; #6: Xu
  C: #1: Togowa; #2: Young; #3: Xu; #4: Robertson; #5: Souza; #6: Vaughn

## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Let's analyze each option:
A: #1: Young; #2: Souza; #3: Vaughn; #4: Robertson; #5: Togowa; #6: Xu
This option violates the rule that Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
B: #1: Vaughn; #2: Togowa; #3: Young; #4: Souza; #5: Robertson; #6: Xu
This option violates the rule that Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
C: #1: Togowa; #2: Young; #3: Xu; #4: Robertson; #5: Souza; #6: Vaughn
This option violates the rule that Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
D: #1: Togowa; #2: Robertson; #3: Young; #4: Souza; #5: Vaughn; #6: Xu
This option satisfies all the rules.
E: #1: Souza; #2: Togowa; #3: Young; #4: Robertson; #5: Xu; #6: Vaughn
This option violates the rule that Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
