# Model: mistral-large | Agent: explanation | Exam: aqua-rat-100 | Problem 76 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:

Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")

Question: If n is such that 36 ≤ n ≤ 72, then x = (n2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16) / (n+ 4√n+ 4) satisfies
Choices:
  A: 20 < x < 54
  B: 23 < x < 58
  C: 25 < x < 64
  D: 28 < x < 60
  E: None of these

Explanation:
I made an error in simplifying the expression for x.
The gap in my knowledge was in algebraic manipulation.
I incorrectly canceled out the common factor of (n + 4√n + 4) from the numerator and denominator.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
To solve this problem, I need to simplify the expression for x.
The expression for x is a quadratic equation in disguise.
I can simplify it by factoring the numerator and denominator.
The numerator can be factored as (n + 4√n + 4)^2.
The denominator can be factored as (n + 4√n + 4).
Therefore, x = (n + 4√n + 4).
Now, I can substitute the minimum and maximum values of n to find the range of x.
If n = 36, then x = 40.
If n = 72, then x = 80.
Therefore, the range of x is 40 ≤ x ≤ 80.
Action: Answer("None of these")

Reflection:
I made an error in my previous response by not checking if the given answer choices were correct.
The gap in my knowledge was in not double-checking the answer choices.
I will make sure to double-check the answer choices in the future to avoid making the same mistake.
