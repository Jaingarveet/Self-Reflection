Question: A car is being driven, in a straight line and at a uniform speed, towards the base of a vertical tower. The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower?
Choices:
  A: 5(√3 + 1)
  B: 6(√3 + √2)
  C: 7(√3 – 1)
  D: 8(√3 – 2)
  E: None of these

## Assistant 2:
Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly by not considering the uniform speed of the car.

To solve this problem, I need to use the properties of similar triangles and the fact that the car is moving at a uniform speed.

Let's denote the distance between the car and the tower when the angle of elevation is 45° as x, and the distance between the car and the tower when the angle of elevation is 60° as y.

Since the car is moving at a uniform speed, the ratio of the distances x and y is equal to the ratio of the times it takes to cover these distances.

Let's denote the height of the tower as h.

Using the properties of similar triangles, we can write the following equations:

h / x = tan(45°) = 1

h / y = tan(60°) = √3

From the first equation, we get x = h.

From the second equation, we get y = h / √3.

The ratio of the distances x and y is equal to the ratio of the times it takes to cover these distances.

So, y / x = (t - 10) / 10, where t is the total time it takes for the car to reach the base of the tower.

Substituting the expressions for x and y from the previous equations, we get:

(h / √3) / h = (t - 10) / 10

Simplifying this equation, we get:

t = 10 / (1 - 1 / √3) = 10 * √3 / (√3 - 1) = 10 * (√3 + 1) / 2 = 5 * (√3 + 1)

Action: Answer("A")
