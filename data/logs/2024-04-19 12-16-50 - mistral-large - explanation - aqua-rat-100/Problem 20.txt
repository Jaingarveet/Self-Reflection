Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I made an error in my calculation of the new ratio of boys to girls.
The gap in my knowledge was not in understanding the problem but in correctly interpreting the given information.
I knew the correct initial ratio and the correct new ratio but misinterpreted the information about the same number of boys and girls joining the group.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The initial ratio of boys to girls is 64:40, which simplifies to 4:2.5.
The new ratio of boys to girls is 4:3.
Since the same number of boys and girls joined the group, the difference between the initial and new ratios of girls is equal to the number of girls who joined.
The difference between the initial and new ratios of girls is 3 - 2.5 = 0.5.
Therefore, 0.5 girls joined the group, which means 1 girl joined the group (since we cannot have a fraction of a person).
Since the same number of boys and girls joined the group, 1 boy also joined the group.
The new number of boys is 64 + 1 = 65.
The new number of girls is 40 + 1 = 41.
The total number of members in the group now is 65 + 41 = 106.
However, none of the available choices match this answer.
I must have made an error in my calculation or interpretation of the problem.
Let me try again.

Thought:
The initial ratio of boys to girls is 64:40, which simplifies to 4:2.5.
The new ratio of boys to girls is 4:3.
Since the same number of boys and girls joined the group, the difference between the initial and new ratios of boys is equal to the number of boys who joined.
The difference between the initial and new ratios of boys is 4 - 4 = 0.
Therefore, no boys joined the group, which contradicts the given information.
I must have made an error in my interpretation of the problem.
Let me try again.

Thought:
The initial ratio of boys to girls is 64:40, which simplifies to 16:10.
The new ratio of boys to girls is 4:3.
Since the same number of boys and girls joined the group, let x be the number of boys and girls who joined.
The new number of boys is 64 + x.
The new number of girls is 40 + x.
The new ratio of boys to girls is (64 + x) / (40 + x) = 4/3.
Cross-multiplying and simplifying, we get 192 + 3x = 160 + 4x, which simplifies to x = 32.
Therefore, 32 boys and 32 girls joined the group.
The new number of boys is 64 + 32 = 96.
The new number of girls is 40 + 32 = 72.
The total number of members in the group now is 96 + 72 = 168.
Action: Answer("E")
