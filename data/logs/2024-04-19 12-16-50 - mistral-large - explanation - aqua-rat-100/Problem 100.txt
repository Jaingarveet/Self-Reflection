Explanation:
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let's denote the breadth as b. According to the problem, the length is 4b + 1.
The area of the rectangle is given as 150 sq m. Therefore, we can write the equation:
b \* (4b + 1) = 150
Expanding and rearranging the equation, we get:
4b^2 + b - 150 = 0
Solving this quadratic equation, we find that b = 5 (ignoring the negative root as it doesn't make sense in this context).
So, the breadth is 5 m, and the length is 4 \* 5 + 1 = 21 m.
The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula 2 \* (length + breadth). Substituting the values, we get:
2 \* (21 + 5) = 2 \* 26 = 52 m
However, none of the given choices match this answer. It seems there might be an error in the question or the provided choices.
Action: Cannot answer as the correct choice is not available.
