## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:
Topic: Geography
Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: Points A, B, C, D lie in this order on the circumference of a circle. Minor arc AC is 160°, and minor arc BD is 150°. If B bisects minor arc AC, then what is the measure of minor arc AD?
Choices:
  A: 80°
  B: 130°
  C: 140°
  D: 160°
  E: 220°

Explanation:
I miscalculated the product of the number of letters in the city and state names.
The gap in my knowledge was not in geography but in basic arithmetic.
I knew the correct city and state but made a calculation error.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Since B bisects minor arc AC, minor arc AB and minor arc BC are equal.
The measure of minor arc AC is given as 160°, so minor arc AB and minor arc BC each measure 80°.
Minor arc AD is the sum of minor arc AB and minor arc BD.
Minor arc BD is given as 150°.
So, minor arc AD = minor arc AB + minor arc BD = 80° + 150° = 230°.
However, the measure of a minor arc cannot exceed 180°.
Therefore, I made a mistake in my calculation.
I need to subtract the measure of minor arc AB from 180° to find the measure of minor arc AD.
Minor arc AD = 180° - minor arc AB = 180° - 80° = 100°.
Action: Answer("C")

Reflection:
I made a mistake in my initial calculation by adding the measures of minor arc AB and minor arc BD instead of subtracting them.
I also overlooked the fact that the measure of a minor arc cannot exceed 180°.
I corrected my mistake by subtracting the measure of minor arc AB from 180° to find the measure of minor arc AD.
I need to be more careful in my calculations and consider the properties of circles when solving problems.
