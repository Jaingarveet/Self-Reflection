## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Explanation:
I made an error in my understanding of the problem and the concept of least common multiple (LCM).
The gap in my knowledge was in understanding that the LCM is not applicable in this problem.
I incorrectly assumed that the LCM of the percentages would give me the least possible number of students.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The least possible number of students in the school must be a multiple of both 20% and 28%.
To find the least possible number of students, I need to find the smallest number that is divisible by both 20 and 28.
I can do this by finding the least common multiple (LCM) of 20 and 28.
However, I made an error in my previous answer by assuming that the LCM of the percentages would give me the least possible number of students.
Instead, I need to find the LCM of the denominators of the percentages, which are 5 and 7.
The LCM of 5 and 7 is 35.
Therefore, the least possible number of students in the school must be a multiple of 35.
Action: Answer("C") (600 is the smallest multiple of 35 that is greater than 501)
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: E
Score: 0
