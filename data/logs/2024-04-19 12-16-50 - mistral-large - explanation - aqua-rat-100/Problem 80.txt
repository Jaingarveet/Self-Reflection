Explanation:
I made an incorrect assumption about the cost of the brown sharpeners.
The gap in my knowledge was in understanding the problem statement.
I assumed that the cost of brown sharpeners was 1 rupee, but the problem states that Jack pays 1 rupee more for each white than brown sharpeners.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let's denote the number of white sharpeners as w and the number of brown sharpeners as b.
We know that w + b = 18 (since Jack bought 18 sharpeners in total) and that the cost of white sharpeners is 1 rupee more than the cost of brown sharpeners.
Let's denote the cost of brown sharpeners as x. Then the cost of white sharpeners is x + 1.
We also know that the total cost of all sharpeners is 100 rupees. Therefore, we can write the equation:
x \* b + (x + 1) \* w = 100
We have two equations and three unknowns, so we need to find another equation to solve the problem.
Since w + b = 18, we can rewrite the second equation as:
x \* (18 - w) + (x + 1) \* w = 100
Simplifying this equation, we get:
18x - xw + xw + w = 100
18x + w = 100
Now we have two equations with two unknowns:
w + b = 18
18x + w = 100
We can solve the first equation for w:
w = 18 - b
Substituting this expression for w into the second equation, we get:
18x + 18 - b = 100
18x - b = 82
Now we can solve for b:
b = 18x - 82
Since x is the cost of brown sharpeners, it must be a positive integer. We can try different values of x until we find an integer value for b.
If x = 4, then b = 18 \* 4 - 82 = 2
If x = 5, then b = 18 \* 5 - 82 = 13
If x = 6, then b = 18 \* 6 - 82 = 24
If x = 7, then b = 18 \* 7 - 82 = 35
If x = 8, then b = 18 \* 8 - 82 = 46
If x = 9, then b = 18 \* 9 - 82 = 57
If x = 10, then b = 18 \* 10 - 82 = 68
If x = 11, then b = 18 \* 11 - 82 = 79
If x = 12, then b = 18 \* 12 - 82 = 90
We can see that when x = 5, b = 13, which is an integer value. Therefore, the cost of brown sharpeners is 5 rupees, and the cost of white sharpeners is 6 rupees.
Substituting x = 5 into the equation w = 18 - b, we get:
w = 18 - 13 = 5
Therefore, Jack bought 5 white sharpeners and 13 brown sharpeners.
