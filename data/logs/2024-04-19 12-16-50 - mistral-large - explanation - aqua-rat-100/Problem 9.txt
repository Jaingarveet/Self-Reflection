Explanation:
I miscalculated the product of the number of letters in the city and state names.
The gap in my knowledge was not in geography but in basic arithmetic.
I knew the correct city and state but made a calculation error.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The profit made on each bag is 25% of the selling price, which is $100. So, the profit made on each bag is $25.
The total profit made is $3,000.
To find out how many bags were sold, we need to divide the total profit by the profit made on each bag.
Action: Answer("C")
