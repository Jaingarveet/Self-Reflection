## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: A student instead of finding the value of 7/8 of a number, found the value of 7/18 of the number. If his answer differed from the actual one by 770, find the that number.
Choices:
  A: 1584
  B: 2520
  C: 1728
  D: 1656
  E: None

Explanation:
I made an arithmetic error in calculating the product of the number of letters in the city and state names.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let x be the number.
The difference between 7/8 of x and 7/18 of x is 770.
So, (7/8)x - (7/18)x = 770
Simplifying the equation, we get (7/16)x = 770
Solving for x, we get x = 16 \* 770 / 7 = 16 \* 110 = 1760
However, 1760 is not one of the choices.
I must have made a mistake in my calculation.
Let me double-check my work.

However, 1760 is not one of the choices.
I made a mistake in my calculation.
The correct equation should be (7/8)x - (7/18)x = 770
Simplifying the equation, we get (7/24)x = 770
Solving for x, we get x = 24 \* 770 / 7 = 24 \* 110 = 2640
The closest choice to 2640 is 2520.
Action: Answer("B")

Reflection:
I made an arithmetic error in simplifying the equation.
I should have simplified the equation to (7/24)x = 770 instead of (7/16)x = 770.
I also made a mistake in calculating the value of x.
I should have calculated x as 24 \* 770 / 7 instead of 16 \* 770 / 7.
I need to be more careful in simplifying equations and calculating values.
I also need to double-check my work before submitting my answer.
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
