Explanation:
I made an error in my calculation when solving the quadratic equation.
The gap in my knowledge was not in understanding the concept of arithmetic progression but in solving the quadratic equation.
I knew the correct formula for the sum of an arithmetic progression but made a calculation error.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The ages of the members are in an arithmetic progression with a common difference of 3 months (or 0.25 years). The youngest member is 7 years old, so the first term (a) is 7. The sum of the ages is 250 years.

The formula for the sum of an arithmetic progression is:

S = n/2 * (2a + (n-1)d)

where S is the sum, n is the number of terms, a is the first term, and d is the common difference.

Substituting the given values into the formula, we get:

250 = n/2 * (2*7 + (n-1)*0.25)

Simplifying and rearranging the equation, we get a quadratic equation in n:

0.125n^2 - 1.75n + 250 = 0

Solving this quadratic equation, we find that n = 20.

Action: Answer("B")
