You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I made a calculation error. I knew the correct city and state but multiplied the number of letters incorrectly.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The team lost 30% of their matches.
Let's assume the total number of matches played is x.
Then, 0.3x represents the number of matches lost.
We know that the team won 20 matches, so the number of matches won can be represented as 0.7x (since the team won 70% of their matches).
Therefore, we can set up the equation 0.7x = 20 and solve for x.

0.7x = 20
x = 20 / 0.7
x ≈ 28.57

Since the number of matches must be a whole number, we can round up to 29 matches played in total.
Then, we can find the number of matches lost by multiplying the total number of matches by the percentage lost:

0.3 * 29 = 8.7 ≈ 9

However, we know that the team won 20 matches, so they must have lost 29 - 20 = 9 matches.

Action: Answer("E") (The correct answer is not available in the given choices, but based on my calculation, the team lost 9 matches. However, I will select the closest answer, which is "E: 5".)
## Result:
Agent Answer: E
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
