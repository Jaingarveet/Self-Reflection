## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Explanation:
I made an error in my calculation of the ratio of W2 to W1.
The gap in my knowledge was not in understanding the concept of work but in basic algebra.
I knew the correct equation for work but made a calculation error.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The amount of work done is proportional to the number of workers and the number of hours worked per day, and inversely proportional to the number of days taken to complete the work.
Let W1 be the amount of work done by x men working x hours per day in x days, and W2 be the amount of work done by y men working y hours per day in y days.
Then, W1/W2 = (x*x*x)/(x*x) = x
And, W2/W1 = (y*y*y)/(y*y) = y^3/x^2
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
