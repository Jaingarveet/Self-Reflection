## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I made a calculation error.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The sum of 5 consecutive odd numbers is always divisible by 5. Since the sum is also divisible by 10, it must be divisible by the least common multiple of 5 and 10, which is 10. Therefore, the sum of the 5 consecutive odd numbers must end in a 0.

Let's denote the first of the 5 consecutive odd numbers as x. Then the sum of the 5 consecutive odd numbers is:
x + (x + 2) + (x + 4) + (x + 6) + (x + 8) = 5x + 20

Since the sum is divisible by 10, x must be even. Therefore, the first of the 5 consecutive odd numbers must be an even number plus 1, which is an odd number.

Let's check the answer choices:
A: 47 - This is an odd number, but it's not an even number plus 1.
B: 91 - This is an odd number, but it's not an even number plus 1.
C: 41 - This is an odd number, but it's not an even number plus 1.
D: 67 - This is an odd number, but it's not an even number plus 1.
E: 44 - This is an even number, so it can't be one of the 5 consecutive odd numbers.

None of the answer choices can be one of the 5 consecutive odd numbers. However, since I must select one of the available choices, I will eliminate the even number and choose the answer that is closest to an even number plus 1.

Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
