Topic: Math
Context: $$.a=1,052+1.08 t.$$.The speed of a sound wave in air depends on the air temperature. The formula above shows the relationship between $a$, the speed of a sound wave, in feet per second, and $t$, the air temperature, in degrees Fahrenheit $\left({ }^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\right)$.
Question: At which of the following air temperatures will the speed of a sound wave be closest to 1,000 feet per second?
Choices:
  A: $-46^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$
  B: $-48^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$
  C: $-49^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$
  D: $-50^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$

## Assistant 2:
Reflection: I made a calculation error when solving this question previously. To find the temperature at which the speed of sound is closest to 1000 ft/s, I should have substituted values into the equation and solved for $t$. Instead, I incorrectly treated the values as absolute values and chose the answer that seemed closest to the calculated value. For a more accurate solution, I should ensure that I follow the equation precisely and check my calculations carefully.

Thought: 
To find the air temperature that results in a sound wave speed closest to 1000 ft/s, we need to substitute the given values into the equation and solve for $t$. 

Given equation: $a = 1,052 + 1.08t$

We want to find $t$ when $a$ is closest to 1000.

$1000 = 1,052 + 1.08t$

To isolate $t$, subtract 1,052 from both sides:

$1000 - 1,052 = 1,052 + 1.08t - 1,052$

$-52 = 1.08t$

Now, divide by 1.08 to solve for $t$:

$t = \frac{-52}{1.08} \approx -48.15$

The temperature closest to $-48.15^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$ is $-48^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$.
Action: Answer("B")
