## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Solution:
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
We can simplify the equation as follows:
\[
\begin{aligned}
\frac{24 x^{2}+25 x-47}{a x-2} &=-8 x-3-\frac{53}{a x-2} \\
\frac{24 x^{2}+25 x-47+53 a x-106}{a x-2} &=-8 x-3 \\
\frac{24 x^{2}+(25+53 a) x-153}{a x-2} &=-8 x-3 .
\end{aligned}
\]

For the equation to be true for all values of $x \neq \frac{2}{a}$, the numerator of the left-hand side must be zero, and the coefficient of $x$ must be zero.

Therefore, we set $(25+53 a)=0$, and solve for $a$, finding $a=-\frac{25}{53}$.

Checking the answer choices, we find that the closest value to this is $a=-3$.

So, the value of $a$ is $-3$.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
