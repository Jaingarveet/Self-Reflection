## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Question: Alan drives an average of 100 miles each week. His car can travel an average of 25 miles per gallon of gasoline. Alan would like to reduce his weekly expenditure on gasoline by $\$ 5$. Assuming gasoline costs $\$ 4$ per gallon, which equation can Alan use to determine how many fewer average miles, $m$, he should drive each week?
Choices:
  A: $\frac{25}{4} m=95$
  B: $\frac{25}{4} m=5$
  C: $\frac{4}{25} m=95$
  D: $\frac{4}{25} m=5$

You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
 - Alan currently drives $100$ miles per week and wants to save $\$5$ on gasoline. 
 - Gasoline costs $\$4$ per gallon, and his car's mileage is $25$ miles per gallon. 
 - To determine how many fewer miles he should drive, we need to find the number of miles represented by $\$5$ worth of gasoline at the given rate. 
 - $\$5$ worth of gasoline at $\$4$ per gallon is $5/4 = 1.25$ gallons. 
 - This amount of gasoline, at a rate of $25$ miles per gallon, will allow him to drive $1.25 * 25 = 31.25$ miles. 
 - So, the equation representing this relationship is $\frac{25}{4}m = 31.25$, where $m$ is the number of fewer miles driven. 
 - Simplifying the equation, we get $\frac{25}{4}m = \frac{5}{4} * 12.5 = 5$, which is choice $D$.

Thought: 
Alan wants to reduce his expenditure by $5$ dollars. 
At $4$ dollars per gallon, this means he wants to spend $5$ dollars less on $1.25$ gallons of gas. 
This amount of gas will allow him to travel 1.25 * 25 = 31.25 miles. 
So, the equation representing this relationship is $\frac{25}{4}m = 31.25$, where 'm' is the number of fewer miles driven. 
Simplifying the equation: $\frac{25}{4}m = \frac{5}{4} * 12.5 = 5
Action: Answer("D")
