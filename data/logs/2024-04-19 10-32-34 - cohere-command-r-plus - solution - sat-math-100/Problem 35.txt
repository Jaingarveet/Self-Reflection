Solution:

Given equation: $\sqrt{4x} = x - 3$ 

First, square both sides: $4x = (x - 3)^2 = x^2 - 6x + 9$ 

This simplifies to: $3x^2 - 6x - 9 = 0$ 

Using the quadratic formula: $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{36 + 108}}{6} = \frac{6 \pm 6\sqrt{3}}{6}$ 

This gives two values: $x = 1$ and $x = 9$. 

However, we must now check which of these values satisfy the original equation. 

For $x = 1$: $\sqrt{4(1)} = 1 - 3$, which is not true. 

For $x = 9$: $\sqrt{4(9)} = 9 - 3$, which simplifies to $6 = 6$, a true statement. 

Therefore, the correct solution is $x = 9$.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: Squaring both sides of the equation leads to the quadratic equation $3x^2 - 6x - 9 = 0$. Using the quadratic formula, we find the values $x = 1$ and $x = 9$. However, we must check these values in the original equation. For $x = 1$, the equation does not hold, but for $x = 9$, it does. Therefore, only choice II is correct.
Action: Answer("B")
