Solution:

The table shows that as x increases by 3a, y decreases by a. This indicates a linear relationship with a slope of -1/3. The y-intercept is at (0,0), as when x=a, y=0. 

The equation for this line is y = (-1/3)x, or, rearranging to make 'x' the subject: 

$2x - 3y = 0 \times 5a$. 

Multiplying by 5a gives: 

$2x - 3y = 0$, or $2x - 3y = a \times 0$, which simplifies to $x + 2y = 0 \times a$, or $x + 2y = a$.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The equation should represent the relationship between $x$ and $y$.
Given that the table shows a linear relationship with a negative slope, the equation should be of the form $y = mx, where m is the negative ratio of the change in 'y' to the change in 'x'. 

From the table, as $x$ increases by $3a, y$ decreases by $a$. So, the slope $m = \frac{y}{x} = \frac{-1}{3}$. 

Substituting this value of $m$ into the equation $y = mx$, we get $y = \left(\frac{-1}{3}\right)x$. 

To make $x$ the subject, we can rearrange to get $2x - 3y = 0$. 

This equation represents the relationship where the y-intercept is $0$, and the slope is $-\frac{1}{3}$, which is consistent with the table. 

Therefore, the correct answer is $x + 2y = a$, as it simplifies to $2x - 3y = 0$ when simplified.
Action: Answer("A")
