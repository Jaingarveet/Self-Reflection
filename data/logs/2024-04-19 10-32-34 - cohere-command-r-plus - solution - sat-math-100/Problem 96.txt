Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
Let $L$ be the length and $W$ be the width of the rectangle.
The original area of the rectangle is $LW$.
After altering the rectangle, the new length is $1.1L$, and the new width is $(1-p/100)W$.
The new area of the rectangle is $A' = (1.1L)(1-p/100)W$.
We are given that this alteration results in a [REDACTED]% decrease in the area, so $A' = 0.88 \times LW$.

Now, we set up the equation:
$$0.88LW = (1.1)(1-p/100)LW$$

Simplifying the equation:
$$0.88 = 1.1(1-p/100)$$

Multiplying both sides by 100:
$$88 = 110 - 110p/100$$

Isolating $p$:
$$-110p/100 = -[REDACTED]$$
$$p = [REDACTED]$$

Thought: 
Let $L$ be the length and $W$ be the width of the original rectangle. 
The original area of the rectangle is $LW$. 

After altering the rectangle, the new length is $110\% \times L = 1.1L$, and the new width is $W\% \times W = (1 - \frac{p}{100})W$. 

The new area of the rectangle, $A'$, is given by:
$$A' = LW \times \left( \frac{1.1}{100} \right) \times \left( 1 - \frac{p}{100} \right)$$

We know that this alteration results in a $12\%$ decrease in the area, so:
$$A' = LW \times 0.88$$

Setting the equations equal to each other and simplifying:
$$LW \times \left( \frac{1.1}{100} \right) \times \left( 1 - \frac{p}{100} \right) = LW \times 0.88$$
$$1.1 \times \left( 1 - \frac{p}{100} \right) = 0.88$$
$$1.1 - 1.1p/100 = 0.88$$
$$1.1 - 0.88 = 1.1p/100$$
$$0.22 = 1.1p/100$$
$$0.22 \times 100 = 1.1p$$
$$22 = 1.1p$$
$$p = \frac{22}{1.1}$$
$$p \approx \boxed{20}$$
