# Model: cohere-command-r-plus | Agent: solution | Exam: sat-math-100 | Problem 98 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Solution:
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
First, we solve for $x$ in the second equation to get $x = 2y - 19$. Substituting this into the first equation gives:
$3(2y - 19) + 4y = -23$, which simplifies to $6y - 57 = -23$, and then $6y = 34$, so $y = \frac{17}{3}$. Substituting $y$ back into the equation for $x$, we get $x = 2(\frac{17}{3}) - 19 = -5$. Thus, the solution is $(x, y) = (-5, \frac{17}{3})$, which is not among the choices.

Reflection:
My previous solution was incorrect because I made a mistake in solving for one of the variables. I correctly solved for $y$ but made a calculation error when substituting back to find $x$. I should have found $x = -5$, but instead, I incorrectly calculated it as $3$. This led me to choose the wrong answer. To avoid such mistakes in the future, I need to be more careful with my calculations and double-check my substitutions.
