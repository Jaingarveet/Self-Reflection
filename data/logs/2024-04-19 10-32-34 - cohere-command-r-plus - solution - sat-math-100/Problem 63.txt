Question: A television with a price of $\$ 300$ is to be purchased with an initial payment of $\$ 60$ and weekly payments of $\$ 30$. Which of the following equations can be used to find the number of weekly payments, $w$, required to complete the purchase, assuming there are no taxes or fees?
Choices:
  A: $300=30 w-60$
  B: $300=30 w$
  C: $300=30 w+60$
  D: $300=60 w-30$

Solution:

Given: 
- Total cost of television ($T$) = $\$300$
- Initial payment ($I$) = $\$60$
- Weekly payment ($P$) = $\$30$
- Number of weekly payments ($w$) is what we need to find. 

We know that the total cost of the television is the sum of the initial payment and the weekly payments multiplied by the number of weeks: 
$T = I + P \times w$ 

Plugging in the values: 
$300 = 60 + 30w$ 

Now, we need to isolate $w$ to find the number of weekly payments. 

$240 = 30w$ 

Dividing both sides by $30$, we get: 
$w = 8$ 

Therefore, the correct equation is $300 = 60 + 30w$, which can be rearranged to $300 = 30w + 60$, choice [REDACTED].

Thought: To find the number of weekly payments, we need to use the equation that represents the total price of the television ($300$) as the sum of the initial payment ($60$) and the weekly payments ($30w$).

The correct equation is: $300 = 60 + 30w$, which can be rearranged to $300 = 30w + 60$.
