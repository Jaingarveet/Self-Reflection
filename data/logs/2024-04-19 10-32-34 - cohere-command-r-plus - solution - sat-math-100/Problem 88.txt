Question: $$h=-4.9 t^{2}+25 t$$The equation above expresses the approximate height $h$, in meters, of a ball $t$ seconds after it is launched vertically upward from the ground with an initial velocity of 25 meters per second. After approximately how many seconds will the ball hit the ground?
Choices:
  A: 3.5
  B: 4.0
  C: 4.5
  D: 5.0

Solution:

The equation $h=-4.9t^2 + 25t$ describes the height of the ball over time. We want to find when the ball hits the ground, i.e., when $h=0$. 

Setting $h=0$, we get:
$0=-4.9t^2 + 25t$

Using the quadratic formula:
$t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$

Plugging in the values:
$t = \frac{-25 \pm \sqrt{25^2 - 4 \cdot -4.9 \cdot 0}}{2 \cdot -4.9} = \frac{-25 \pm 25}{2 \cdot -4.9} = -50/(-9.8) \approx 5.10$ seconds

Now, we consider the context: the ball is launched upward, so the relevant solution is the positive one, approximately $5.10$ seconds. This is closer to $[REDACTED]$ seconds, so the correct answer is **D**.
