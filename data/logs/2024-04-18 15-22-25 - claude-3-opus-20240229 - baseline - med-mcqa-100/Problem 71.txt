## System:
You are an expert in Medicine.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Question: Positive feedback action of estrogen for inducing luteinizing hormone surge is associated with which of the following steroid hormone ratios in peripheral circulation?
Choices:
  A: High estrogen : low progesterone
  B: Low estrogen : high progesterone
  C: Low estrogen : low progesterone
  D: High estrogen : high progesterone
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. Estrogen has a positive feedback effect on luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion. This means that high levels of estrogen stimulate the release of LH, leading to the LH surge.
2. The LH surge typically occurs just before ovulation in the menstrual cycle.
3. In the follicular phase leading up to ovulation, estrogen levels are rising due to the growing follicle, while progesterone levels remain low.
4. It is this high estrogen, low progesterone environment that triggers the positive feedback effect on LH, causing the LH surge.
5. After ovulation, in the luteal phase, both estrogen and progesterone levels are elevated, but this is after the LH surge has already occurred.
Therefore, the steroid hormone ratio associated with the positive feedback action of estrogen on LH is:
Action: Answer("A")
High estrogen : low progesterone
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
