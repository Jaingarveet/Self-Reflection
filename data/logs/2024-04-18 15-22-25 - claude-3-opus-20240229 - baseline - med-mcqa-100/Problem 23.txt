Question: Expanisle type osseous metastases are characteristic of primary malignancy of:
Choices:
  A: Kidney
  B: Bronchus
  C: Breast
  D: Prostate
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. Expansile osseous metastases are characterized by bone destruction with adjacent bone expansion, resulting in a "blown-out" appearance on imaging.
2. This type of metastasis is most commonly associated with certain primary malignancies:
   - Kidney (renal cell carcinoma)
   - Thyroid
   - Melanoma
   - Lymphoma
3. Among the given choices, the primary malignancy most likely to cause expansile osseous metastases is kidney (renal cell carcinoma).
4. Bronchus (lung cancer), breast, and prostate cancers more typically cause osteolytic or osteoblastic metastases, rather than the expansile type.
Therefore, the best answer is:
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
