## System:
You are an expert in Medicine.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.

Question: Flexion extension in neck occurs at -
Choices:
  A: Atlanto-axial joint
  B: Atlanto-occipital joint
  C: C6-C7 joint
  D: C7-T1 joint
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. Flexion and extension are movements that occur in the sagittal plane, i.e., forward and backward bending of the neck.
2. The atlanto-occipital joint is the articulation between the atlas (C1 vertebra) and the occipital bone of the skull. This joint primarily allows for nodding movements (flexion and extension).
3. The atlanto-axial joint is the articulation between the atlas (C1) and the axis (C2). This joint is responsible for the majority of rotation in the neck.
4. The C6-C7 and C7-T1 joints are lower in the cervical spine and contribute less to flexion and extension compared to the atlanto-occipital joint.
Therefore, the majority of flexion and extension in the neck occurs at the atlanto-occipital joint.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
