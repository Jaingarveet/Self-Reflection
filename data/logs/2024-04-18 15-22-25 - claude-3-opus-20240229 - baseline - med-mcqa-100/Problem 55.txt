Question: A 60 year old male was diagnosed as carcinoma right lung. On CECT chest there was a tumor of 5x5 cm in upper lobe and another 2x2 cm size tumor nodule in middle lobe. The primary modality of treatment is :
Choices:
  A: Radiotherapy
  B: Chemotherapy
  C: Surgery
  D: Suppoive treatment
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The patient has a primary tumor in the right upper lobe and a separate nodule in the middle lobe. This suggests the cancer has spread within the lung.
2. The presence of two separate tumors in different lobes indicates that the cancer is at least stage III (T4 or N2/N3 depending on lymph node involvement).
3. For stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the primary treatment modality is typically a combination of chemotherapy and radiation therapy (concurrent chemoradiation).
4. Surgery is generally not the primary treatment for stage III NSCLC because the disease has already spread beyond a single localized area. Surgery may be considered after chemoradiation if there is a good response and the tumors become resectable.
5. Supportive care is important for managing symptoms and side effects, but it is not the primary treatment modality.
Therefore, the best answer is:
Action: Answer("A")
Radiotherapy, likely combined with chemotherapy, would be the primary treatment approach for this stage III NSCLC patient. Surgery and supportive care play important roles but are not the primary modality.
