Question: Which one of the following is NOT a feature of Kaagener's syndrome -
Choices:
  A: Bronchiectasis
  B: Ciliary dyskinesia
  C: Pancreatic insufficiency
  D: Situs inversus
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. Kartagener's syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that affects the cilia, which are the tiny hair-like structures that line the airways and other organs.
2. The main features of Kartagener's syndrome are:
   - Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD): The cilia do not function properly, leading to chronic respiratory infections.
   - Situs inversus: The internal organs are positioned in a mirror image of their normal locations.
   - Bronchiectasis: The airways become abnormally widened and damaged due to chronic infections.
3. Pancreatic insufficiency is not a typical feature of Kartagener's syndrome. It is more commonly associated with cystic fibrosis, another genetic disorder that affects the lungs and digestive system.
Therefore, the correct answer is:
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
