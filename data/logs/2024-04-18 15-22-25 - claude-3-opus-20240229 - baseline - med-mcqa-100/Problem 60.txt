Question: For an epidemiological study, every 10th person is selected from a population. This type of sampling is known as:
Choices:
  A: Simple random sampling
  B: Statified random sampling
  C: Systemic random sampling
  D: Cluster random sampling
## Assistant 2:
To determine the correct type of sampling, let's consider each option:
A. Simple random sampling: Each member of the population has an equal chance of being selected. This is not the case here, as a specific pattern (every 10th person) is being followed.
B. Stratified random sampling: The population is divided into subgroups (strata) based on shared characteristics, and then a random sample is taken from each stratum. This is not the method described in the question.
C. Systematic random sampling: A fixed interval (in this case, every 10th person) is used to select members from the population after a random starting point. This matches the description in the question.
D. Cluster random sampling: The population is divided into clusters (usually based on geographic location), and then a random sample of clusters is selected. This is not the method described in the question.
Therefore, the correct answer is C: Systematic random sampling.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
