Question: Most common type of malignancy of stomach is: September 2007
Choices:
  A: Adenocarcinoma
  B: Squamous carcinoma
  C: Anaplastic carcinoma
  D: Lymphoma
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The stomach is lined by a type of epithelial tissue known as glandular epithelium.
2. Cancers are typically named based on the cell type they originate from. Carcinomas arise from epithelial cells, while sarcomas arise from mesenchymal cells, and lymphomas from lymphoid cells.
3. Adenocarcinoma is a type of cancer that develops in glandular epithelial cells. Given that the stomach lining is made up of glandular epithelium, adenocarcinoma would be the most likely type of cancer to develop here.
4. Squamous carcinoma arises from squamous epithelial cells, which are not present in the stomach lining. 
5. Anaplastic carcinoma is a term used for an undifferentiated, high-grade malignant epithelial neoplasm. While it can occur in the stomach, it is much less common than adenocarcinoma.
6. Lymphoma is a malignancy of lymphoid cells. While it can occur in the stomach (known as gastric lymphoma), it is less common than adenocarcinoma.
Therefore, the most common type of malignancy in the stomach is adenocarcinoma.
