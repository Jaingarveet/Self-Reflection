Choices:
  A: 25U/ml
  B: 30U/ml
  C: 35 U/ml
  D: 40U/ml
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. CA-125 (cancer antigen 125) is a protein that is often elevated in the blood of women with ovarian cancer.
2. However, CA-125 can also be elevated in other conditions such as endometriosis, pelvic inflammatory disease, and even in normal healthy women.
3. The normal range for CA-125 is typically less than 35 U/ml.
4. Levels above 35 U/ml are considered elevated and may indicate the presence of ovarian cancer or other conditions.
Therefore, the upper limit of normal for CA-125 is 35 U/ml.
Action: Answer("C")
