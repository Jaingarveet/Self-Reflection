Question: Major complication of cyst-gastrostomy for pseudo pancreatic cyst is?
Choices:
  A: Infection
  B: Obstruction
  C: Fistula
  D: Hemorrhage
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. Cyst-gastrostomy is a surgical procedure that creates a connection between a pancreatic pseudocyst and the stomach.
2. The main purpose of this procedure is to drain the contents of the pseudocyst into the stomach, thereby relieving pressure and preventing further complications.
3. Potential complications of this procedure include:
   - Infection: While possible, infection is not the most common major complication as the stomach is a relatively sterile environment.
   - Obstruction: The connection between the pseudocyst and stomach is unlikely to cause significant obstruction.
   - Fistula: A fistula, which is an abnormal connection between two organs or vessels, is a possible complication but not the most common major one.
   - Hemorrhage: The creation of the connection between the pseudocyst and stomach involves cutting through tissue and blood vessels. If not properly controlled, this can lead to significant bleeding, making hemorrhage the most likely major complication.
4. Therefore, among the given choices, hemorrhage is the most likely major complication of cyst-gastrostomy for pancreatic pseudocysts.
