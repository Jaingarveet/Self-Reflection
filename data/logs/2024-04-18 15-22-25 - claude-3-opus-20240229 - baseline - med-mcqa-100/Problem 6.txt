## System:
You are an expert in Medicine.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:
Topic: Geography
Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Medicine
Subtopic: Pathology
Question: Necrosis of cell is due to -
Choices:
  A: Ca+2 efflux in cell
  B: Fat depostion in cells
  C: Water imbibition in cells
  D: Enzymatic digestion
## Assistant 2:
To determine the cause of cell necrosis, let's consider each choice:
A. Ca+2 efflux in cell: Calcium efflux from cells is a consequence of cell injury and necrosis, not the primary cause.
B. Fat deposition in cells: While fat accumulation can lead to cell dysfunction, it is not a direct cause of necrosis.
C. Water imbibition in cells: Water influx into cells (cellular swelling) is a feature of cell injury, but it is not the primary cause of necrosis.
D. Enzymatic digestion: During necrosis, there is a loss of membrane integrity, leading to an influx of calcium. This calcium influx activates enzymes like phospholipases, proteases, and endonucleases, which break down cell components. The enzymatic digestion of cellular contents is a key feature of necrosis.
Therefore, the correct answer is:
Action: Answer("D")
Enzymatic digestion is the primary cause of cell necrosis among the given choices.
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
