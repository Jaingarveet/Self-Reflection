Question: Cut-off value for CA-125 is :
Choices:
  A: 15 units/ml
  B: 25 units/ml
  C: 35 units/ml
  D: 45 units/ml
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. CA-125 (Cancer Antigen 125) is a protein that is often elevated in the blood of women with ovarian cancer.
2. However, CA-125 can also be elevated in other conditions such as endometriosis, pelvic inflammatory disease, and even in normal healthy women.
3. Therefore, a single cut-off value is used to decide whether a CA-125 level is considered high or normal.
4. The most widely accepted cut-off value for CA-125 is 35 units/ml.
5. Levels above 35 units/ml are considered high and may indicate the presence of ovarian cancer or other conditions, while levels below 35 units/ml are considered normal.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
