Question: A 5-day-old term male neonate presents with delayed passage of meconium, abdominal distension and bilious vomiting. Barium enema and intestinal biopsy findings are shown below. What is the diagnosis?
Choices:
  A: Congenital aganglionic megacolon
  B: Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis
  C: Cystic fibrosis
  D: Intestinal malrotation
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The patient is a 5-day-old term male neonate, so we're dealing with a newborn condition.
2. Key symptoms are:
   - Delayed passage of meconium
   - Abdominal distension 
   - Bilious vomiting
3. These symptoms suggest a bowel obstruction or motility disorder.
4. The barium enema and intestinal biopsy findings would be very helpful in making the diagnosis, but that information is not provided in the question stem.
5. Looking at the answer choices:
   A. Congenital aganglionic megacolon (Hirschsprung's disease) fits with delayed meconium passage and bowel obstruction in a neonate.
   B. Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis typically presents a few weeks later and with non-bilious vomiting.
   C. Cystic fibrosis can cause meconium ileus and obstruction, but bilious vomiting is atypical. 
   D. Intestinal malrotation presents with bilious vomiting, but delayed meconium passage is not a typical feature.
6. Without the biopsy findings, a definitive diagnosis is difficult, but congenital aganglionic megacolon (Hirschsprung's disease) best fits the clinical presentation.
