## System:
You are an expert in Medicine.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: The principal site of acidification of urine is
Choices:
  A: Loop of henle
  B: Collecting duct
  C: DCT
  D: PCT
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. Urine acidification is the process of lowering the pH of urine, which is primarily done by secreting H+ ions into the tubular lumen.
2. The proximal convoluted tubule (PCT) is responsible for the reabsorption of the majority of the filtered bicarbonate (HCO3-), but it does not significantly contribute to urine acidification.
3. The loop of Henle and the distal convoluted tubule (DCT) also do not play a significant role in urine acidification.
4. The collecting duct is the principal site of urine acidification. It has two types of cells that are involved in this process:
   - Type A intercalated cells secrete H+ ions into the lumen via H+-ATPase pumps.
   - Type B intercalated cells secrete bicarbonate (HCO3-) into the lumen and reabsorb H+ ions.
Therefore, the principal site of acidification of urine is the collecting duct.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
