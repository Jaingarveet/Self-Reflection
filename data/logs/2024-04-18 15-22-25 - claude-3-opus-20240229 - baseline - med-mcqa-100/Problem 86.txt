Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Question: A young male presents with abdominal pain. CT scan shows heterogenous necrotizing mass at left renal hilum. His AFP or hCG levels are elevated. The MOST likely diagnosis is:
Choices:
  A: Lymphoma
  B: Transitional cell carcinoma
  C: Metastatic melanoma
  D: Metastatic germ cell tumour
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The patient is a young male with abdominal pain.
2. CT scan shows a heterogeneous necrotizing mass at the left renal hilum. This suggests a tumor or malignancy.
3. The patient has elevated AFP (alpha-fetoprotein) or hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin) levels. These are tumor markers.
   - AFP is often elevated in liver cancer, testicular cancer, and ovarian germ cell tumors.
   - hCG is often elevated in gestational trophoblastic disease, testicular cancer, and ovarian germ cell tumors.
4. Considering the patient's age, sex, and elevated tumor markers, the most likely diagnosis is a germ cell tumor.
   - Lymphoma, transitional cell carcinoma, and metastatic melanoma are less likely to cause elevated AFP or hCG.
   - Germ cell tumors are more common in young males and can cause elevated AFP and hCG.
5. The location of the mass (left renal hilum) suggests that this is a metastatic germ cell tumor, likely originating from the testis.
