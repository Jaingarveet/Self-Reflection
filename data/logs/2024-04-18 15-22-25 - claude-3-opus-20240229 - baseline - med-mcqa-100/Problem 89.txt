Question: In Spondylolisthesis, which of the following is NOT useful investigation?
Choices:
  A: Anteroposterior X-ray
  B: Lateral view X-ray
  C: CT
  D: MRI
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. Spondylolisthesis is a condition where one vertebra slips forward over the vertebra below it.
2. To diagnose and evaluate spondylolisthesis, imaging studies are essential.
3. Anteroposterior (AP) X-ray: This view can show the alignment of the vertebrae and any slippage from the front-to-back perspective. It is a useful investigation.
4. Lateral view X-ray: This view is crucial as it can clearly demonstrate the forward slippage of the vertebra, which is the hallmark of spondylolisthesis. It is a useful investigation.
5. CT (Computed Tomography): CT scans provide detailed cross-sectional images of the spine. They can help assess the extent of the slippage and any bony abnormalities. It is a useful investigation.
6. MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging): MRI scans are excellent for visualizing soft tissues, such as the spinal cord, nerves, and intervertebral discs. They can help identify any nerve compression or disc herniation associated with spondylolisthesis. It is a useful investigation.
All of the listed investigations - AP X-ray, lateral X-ray, CT, and MRI - are useful in the diagnosis and evaluation of spondylolisthesis. There is no option for "None of the above".
