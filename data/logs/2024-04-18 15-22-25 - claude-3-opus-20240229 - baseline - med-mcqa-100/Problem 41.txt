Question: Which of the following is not an agent used in chemical peeling?
Choices:
  A: Glycolic acid
  B: Kojic acid
  C: Phenol
  D: Salicylic acid
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. Chemical peeling is a procedure used to improve the appearance of the skin by applying a chemical solution that causes the skin to exfoliate and eventually peel off.
2. Glycolic acid is an alpha-hydroxy acid (AHA) commonly used in chemical peels. It helps to remove the outer layer of dead skin cells, promoting cell turnover and improving skin texture.
3. Phenol is a deep peeling agent used to treat more severe skin issues such as deep wrinkles, precancerous growths, and uneven skin tone caused by sun damage or aging.
4. Salicylic acid is a beta-hydroxy acid (BHA) that is lipid-soluble, making it effective for penetrating and exfoliating oily skin. It is often used in peels to treat acne, blackheads, and whiteheads.
5. Kojic acid, on the other hand, is not typically used as a peeling agent. It is a skin-lightening agent derived from fungi and is used to treat hyperpigmentation, age spots, and melasma by inhibiting the production of melanin.
Therefore, the agent not used in chemical peeling is kojic acid.
