Question: 60-year-old male complaints of right-sided nasal obstruction and nasal discharge, which sometimes is blood tinged. Biopsy finding is also shown below. What is your diagnosis?
Choices:
  A: Rhinoscleroma
  B: Wegener's granulomatosis
  C: Stewa's granuloma
  D: Rhinosporidiosis
## Assistant 2:
To determine the diagnosis, let's analyze the key information provided:
1. The patient is a 60-year-old male.
2. He has right-sided nasal obstruction and nasal discharge, which is sometimes blood-tinged.
3. A biopsy was performed, and the findings are shown (although no image is provided in this question).
Now, let's consider each of the choices:
A. Rhinoscleroma: This is a chronic granulomatous infection caused by the bacterium Klebsiella rhinoscleromatis. It typically presents with nasal obstruction and a characteristic histopathological appearance.
B. Wegener's granulomatosis (now known as Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis): This is a systemic vasculitis that can involve the upper and lower respiratory tract. It often presents with nasal obstruction, bloody nasal discharge, and granulomatous inflammation on biopsy.
C. Stewart's granuloma: This is not a commonly recognized medical term or condition in ENT.
D. Rhinosporidiosis: This is a chronic granulomatous infection caused by the fungus Rhinosporidium seeberi. It typically presents with nasal obstruction, nasal mass, and characteristic histopathological findings of fungal sporangia.
Based on the patient's age, symptoms of right-sided nasal obstruction, blood-tinged nasal discharge, and the mention of biopsy findings (although not provided), the most likely diagnosis among the given choices is Wegener's granulomatosis (Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis).
