Question: Which of the following ovarian tumor is most prone to undergo torsion during pregnancy :
Choices:
  A: Serous cystadenoma
  B: Mucinous cystadenoma
  C: Dermoid cyst
  D: Theca lutein cyst
## Assistant 2:
Thought process:
1. Ovarian torsion is more common in tumors with a long pedicle, allowing them to rotate freely.
2. Dermoid cysts (mature cystic teratomas) are the most common ovarian germ cell tumors and often have a long pedicle.
3. Dermoid cysts are also more common in younger women, including those of reproductive age.
4. Serous and mucinous cystadenomas are less likely to have a long pedicle compared to dermoid cysts.
5. Theca lutein cysts are usually bilateral and associated with conditions like gestational trophoblastic disease or multiple pregnancies, but they are less likely to undergo torsion compared to dermoid cysts.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
