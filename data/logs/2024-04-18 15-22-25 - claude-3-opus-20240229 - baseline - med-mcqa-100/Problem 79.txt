Question: What is the average gain in lenght in 4 years?
Choices:
  A: 25 cm
  B: 50 cm
  C: 75 cm
  D: 100 cm
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. Infants typically double their birth length by age 4. 
2. The average length at birth is about 50 cm (20 inches).
3. So by age 4, the average child would be about 100 cm tall.
4. The question is asking about the gain in length, not the total length at age 4.
5. To calculate the gain, we take the length at age 4 (100 cm) and subtract the length at birth (50 cm).
6. 100 cm - 50 cm = 50 cm
Therefore, the average gain in length from birth to 4 years old is 50 cm.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
