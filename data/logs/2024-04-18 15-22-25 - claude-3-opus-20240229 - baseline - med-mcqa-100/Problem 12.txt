# Model: claude-3-opus-20240229 | Agent: baseline | Exam: med-mcqa-100 | Problem 12 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Medicine.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:
Topic: Geography
Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?

  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought:

The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:

Subtopic: Biochemistry
Question: Aminoacyl t-RNA is not require for ?
Choices:
  A: Proline
  B: Lysine
  C: Hydroxylysine
  D: Methionine
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. Aminoacyl tRNA is required for the incorporation of amino acids into a growing polypeptide chain during protein synthesis.
2. Most amino acids, including proline, lysine, and methionine, are directly attached to their specific tRNA by aminoacyl tRNA synthetases.
3. However, hydroxylysine is not one of the 20 standard amino acids. It is a post-translationally modified amino acid derived from lysine.
4. The hydroxylation of lysine to form hydroxylysine occurs after the lysine has been incorporated into the polypeptide chain. This process is catalyzed by lysyl hydroxylase enzymes and requires vitamin C as a cofactor.
5. Since hydroxylysine is not directly incorporated by the ribosome during translation, it does not require a specific aminoacyl tRNA.
Therefore, the correct answer is:
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
