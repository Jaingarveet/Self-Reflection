Question: Keratoderma blenorrhagica is seen in:
Choices:
  A: Ankylosing spondylitis
  B: Gouty arthritis
  C: Reactive arthritis
  D: Psoriatic arthritis
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. Keratoderma blenorrhagica is a skin condition characterized by thickening of the skin on the palms and soles, often with pustular lesions.
2. It is commonly associated with reactive arthritis, which is a type of arthritis that develops in response to an infection in another part of the body, most often the genitourinary tract or gastrointestinal tract.
3. Reactive arthritis is part of a group of conditions known as spondyloarthropathies, which also includes ankylosing spondylitis and psoriatic arthritis. However, keratoderma blenorrhagica is most characteristically seen in reactive arthritis.
4. Gouty arthritis is a different type of arthritis caused by the deposition of uric acid crystals in the joints, and is not typically associated with keratoderma blenorrhagica.
Therefore, the correct answer is:
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
