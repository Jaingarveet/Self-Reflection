## System:
You are an expert in Medicine.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: In Cicatricial pemphigoid, which antigen is bound by IgG on the epidermal side of the salt split skin technique?
Choices:
  A: XVII collagen
  B: Epiligrin
  C: Laminin 5
  D: BP antigen 1 & 2
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. Cicatricial pemphigoid is an autoimmune blistering disorder that primarily affects mucous membranes.
2. In this condition, autoantibodies target components of the basement membrane zone (BMZ).
3. The salt split skin technique is used to differentiate pemphigoid disorders based on the location of IgG binding.
4. In cicatricial pemphigoid, the target antigens are typically laminin 5 (also known as laminin 332) and BP antigen 2 (also known as type XVII collagen or BP180).
5. When the salt split skin technique is performed, IgG autoantibodies in cicatricial pemphigoid bind to the epidermal side of the split skin.
6. Among the given choices, both laminin 5 and type XVII collagen are correct answers, as they are the target antigens in cicatricial pemphigoid and are located on the epidermal side of the split skin.
7. However, the question asks for a single antigen, and type XVII collagen (choice A) is the most specific answer.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
