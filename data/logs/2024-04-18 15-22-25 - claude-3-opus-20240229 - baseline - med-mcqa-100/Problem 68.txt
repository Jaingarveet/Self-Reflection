Question: Shoest acting skeletal muscle relaxant is
Choices:
  A: Suxamethonium
  B: Mivacurium
  C: Pancuronium
  D: Vecuronium
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. Skeletal muscle relaxants are drugs used to cause temporary paralysis or muscle relaxation during surgical procedures.
2. Suxamethonium (also known as succinylcholine) is a depolarizing neuromuscular blocker. It has a rapid onset of action (within 30-60 seconds) and a short duration of action (5-10 minutes).
3. Mivacurium, pancuronium, and vecuronium are non-depolarizing neuromuscular blockers. They generally have a slower onset and longer duration of action compared to suxamethonium.
4. Among the given choices, suxamethonium has the fastest onset of action and shortest duration, making it the shortest acting skeletal muscle relaxant.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
