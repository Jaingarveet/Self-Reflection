Question: Which is not a branch of cavernous part of internal carotid artery -
Choices:
  A: Cavernous branch
  B: Inferior hypophyseal
  C: Meningeal artery
  D: Ophthalmic artery
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The internal carotid artery has several branches in the cavernous sinus region.
2. The cavernous branch is a small branch that supplies the walls of the cavernous sinus. So this is a branch of the cavernous part of the internal carotid artery.
3. The inferior hypophyseal artery supplies the posterior pituitary gland and is a branch of the cavernous part of the internal carotid artery.
4. The meningeal artery (or meningohypophyseal trunk) is a branch of the cavernous part of the internal carotid artery that supplies the dura mater of the cavernous sinus and the tentorium cerebelli.
5. The ophthalmic artery, however, arises from the internal carotid artery just as it emerges from the cavernous sinus. It is not a branch of the cavernous part of the internal carotid artery.
Therefore, the ophthalmic artery is not a branch of the cavernous part of the internal carotid artery.
Action: Answer("D")

Agent Answer: D
