Question: Most common muscle affected in rotator cuff group is -
Choices:
  A: Supraspinatus
  B: Infraspinatus
  C: Teres minor
  D: Subscapularis
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The rotator cuff is a group of four muscles that stabilize the shoulder joint. These are:
   - Supraspinatus
   - Infraspinatus
   - Teres minor
   - Subscapularis
2. Among these, the supraspinatus muscle is the most frequently injured. This is because:
   - It runs under the acromion process of the scapula, making it susceptible to impingement.
   - It is heavily involved in overhead movements, which can lead to overuse injuries.
3. The other rotator cuff muscles (infraspinatus, teres minor, and subscapularis) can also be injured, but less frequently than the supraspinatus.
Therefore, the most common muscle affected in the rotator cuff group is the supraspinatus.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
