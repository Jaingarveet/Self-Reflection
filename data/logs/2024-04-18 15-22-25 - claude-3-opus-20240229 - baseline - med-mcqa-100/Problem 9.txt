Question: Bishop scoring of more than ----- indicates labor has begun?
Choices:
  A: 3
  B: 5
  C: 6
  D: 7
## Assistant 2:
To determine the Bishop score that indicates labor has begun, let's think through the components of the Bishop score and their typical values at the onset of labor:
The Bishop score assesses the following five factors:
1. Cervical dilation (0-3 points)
2. Cervical effacement (0-3 points)
3. Cervical consistency (0-2 points)
4. Cervical position (0-2 points)
5. Fetal station (-3 to +2 points)
At the onset of labor, the cervix typically begins to dilate, efface, and soften. The cervical position moves from posterior to anterior, and the fetal station becomes less negative or even positive.
Considering these changes, a Bishop score of 6 or more is generally considered favorable for labor progression and vaginal delivery. A score of 6 would likely include:
- Cervical dilation of 2-3 cm
- Effacement of 50-80%
- Cervix that is moderately soft
- Cervix in a mid or anterior position
- Fetal station at -1 or 0
Therefore, a Bishop score of more than 6 would indicate that labor has begun.
