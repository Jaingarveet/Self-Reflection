Question: Site of transplantation in Islet cell transplant for Diabetes mellitus is
Choices:
  A: Skin
  B: Injected into the poal vein
  C: Liver
  D: Pelvis
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. Islet cell transplantation is a procedure to treat type 1 diabetes mellitus.
2. In this procedure, islet cells (which produce insulin) are harvested from a donor pancreas.
3. The harvested islet cells need to be transplanted into a site where they can receive good blood supply and be able to secrete insulin effectively into the bloodstream.
4. The liver is a highly vascularized organ that receives a large portion of the blood supply from the intestines and pancreas via the portal vein.
5. By injecting the islet cells into the portal vein, they are carried into the liver sinusoids, where they can engraft and start producing insulin.
6. The liver also provides a relatively immunologically privileged site for the transplanted cells.
Therefore, the site of transplantation for islet cells in the treatment of diabetes mellitus is the liver, via injection into the portal vein.
Action: Answer("C")

Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: B
