Question: At 34 weeks multigravida with previous 2 normal delivery has an unstable lie with the present pregnancy. It can be due to:
Choices:
  A: Oligohydramnios
  B: Placenta pre
  C: Pelvic tumor
  D: Uterine anomalies
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. An unstable lie at 34 weeks in a multigravida (a woman who has been pregnant more than once) can be caused by various factors that prevent the fetus from settling into a stable position.
2. Oligohydramnios (choice A) is a condition with decreased amniotic fluid. This can allow the fetus to move more freely and change position, leading to an unstable lie.
3. Placenta previa (choice B) is a condition where the placenta partially or completely covers the cervix. This can prevent the fetal head from engaging in the pelvis, potentially causing an unstable lie.
4. A pelvic tumor (choice C) can obstruct the pelvis and prevent the fetus from descending into a stable position, leading to an unstable lie.
5. Uterine anomalies (choice D), such as a bicornuate uterus or a septate uterus, can distort the shape of the uterine cavity and prevent the fetus from settling into a stable lie.
In conclusion, all of the listed choices - oligohydramnios, placenta previa, pelvic tumor, and uterine anomalies - can potentially cause an unstable lie at 34 weeks in a multigravida.
