Question: A 48-year-old man presents for a routine physical examination. The patient has a history of hyperlipidemia and nodular prostatic hyperplasia. Physical examination reveals a large mass on the lateral side of the scrotum, which can be transilluminated. It is found to be composed of dilated blood vessels draining the left testicle. The patient is at increased risk for which of the following complications?
Choices:
  A: Adenocarcinoma
  B: Embryonal carcinoma
  C: Infertility
  D: Nodular prostatic hyperplasia
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The patient has a large mass on the lateral side of the scrotum that can be transilluminated and is composed of dilated blood vessels draining the left testicle. This description is consistent with a varicocele.
2. A varicocele is an abnormal dilation of the veins in the spermatic cord, typically on the left side. It can cause a feeling of heaviness or discomfort in the scrotum and may be visible as a mass.
3. Varicoceles are associated with male infertility. The dilated veins can cause an increase in temperature in the scrotum, which can negatively impact sperm production and quality.
4. The other choices (adenocarcinoma, embryonal carcinoma, and nodular prostatic hyperplasia) are not directly related to the presence of a varicocele.
Therefore, the patient with a varicocele is at increased risk for infertility.
