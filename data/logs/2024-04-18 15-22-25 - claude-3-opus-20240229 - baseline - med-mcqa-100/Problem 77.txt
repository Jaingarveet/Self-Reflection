Question: Which of the following drug is NOT a Gp IIb/IIIa antagonist?
Choices:
  A: Tirofiban
  B: Abciximab
  C: Eptifibatide
  D: Prasugrel
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. Gp IIb/IIIa antagonists are a class of antiplatelet drugs that inhibit the final common pathway of platelet aggregation.
2. Tirofiban, abciximab, and eptifibatide are all well-known Gp IIb/IIIa antagonists.
3. Prasugrel, on the other hand, is a thienopyridine, which is a different class of antiplatelet drug. It works by irreversibly inhibiting the P2Y12 receptor on platelets.
Therefore, the drug that is NOT a Gp IIb/IIIa antagonist is prasugrel.
