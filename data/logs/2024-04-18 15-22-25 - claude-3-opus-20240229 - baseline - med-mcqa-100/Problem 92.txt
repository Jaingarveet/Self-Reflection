  B: Maxillary artery
  C: Superficial temporal artery
  D: Middle cerebral artery
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The middle meningeal artery supplies the dura mater, the outer layer of the meninges that cover the brain and spinal cord.
2. It runs through the middle cranial fossa, supplying blood to the bones of the skull and the dura mater.
3. The external carotid artery is a major artery of the head and neck, supplying oxygenated blood to the face, neck, and outer portions of the head.
4. The maxillary artery is a branch of the external carotid artery. It supplies deep structures of the face and the dura mater.
5. The superficial temporal artery is another branch of the external carotid artery, supplying the scalp and side of the head.
6. The middle cerebral artery is a branch of the internal carotid artery, supplying a large portion of the lateral surface of the cerebral hemispheres.
Therefore, the middle meningeal artery is a direct branch of the maxillary artery, which is a branch of the external carotid artery.
