Question: Which antithyroid drug can be safely used in pregnancy
Choices:
  A: Propylthiouracil
  B: I121
  C: Methimazole
  D: Carbimazole
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. Antithyroid drugs are used to treat hyperthyroidism, which can occur during pregnancy.
2. Propylthiouracil (PTU) and methimazole are the two main antithyroid drugs.
3. Methimazole and carbimazole (a prodrug of methimazole) have been associated with congenital malformations, particularly when used in the first trimester of pregnancy.
4. In contrast, propylthiouracil has not been linked to congenital malformations and is considered safer for use during pregnancy, especially in the first trimester.
5. I121 (Radioactive iodine) is contraindicated in pregnancy as it can cause fetal thyroid dysfunction.
Therefore, the antithyroid drug that can be safely used in pregnancy is propylthiouracil.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
