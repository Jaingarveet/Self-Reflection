## System:
You are an expert in Medicine.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: In anaerobic glycolysis, end product is -
Choices:
  A: 2 ATP + 2 NAD
  B: 2 ATP
  C: 2 ATP + 2 NADH
  D: 4 ATP + 2 FADH2
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. Glycolysis is the metabolic pathway that converts glucose into pyruvate.
2. In anaerobic conditions (without oxygen), pyruvate is converted to lactate.
3. During glycolysis, there is a net production of 2 ATP molecules.
4. In the glycolysis pathway, there are two steps where NAD+ is reduced to NADH:
   - In the first step, glucose is oxidized to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, reducing NAD+ to NADH.
   - In the second step, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate is oxidized to 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate, again reducing NAD+ to NADH.
5. Therefore, in anaerobic glycolysis, the end products are 2 ATP molecules and 2 NADH molecules.
6. FADH2 is not involved in the glycolysis pathway.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
