## System:
You are an expert in Medicine.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:

Subtopic: Dental
Question: The sticky polysaccharide present in dental plague is
Choices:
  A: Dextran
  B: dextrin
  C: Glycogen
  D: sucrose
## Assistant 2:
To determine the sticky polysaccharide present in dental plaque, let's consider each choice:
A. Dextran: Dextran is a complex branched glucan (polysaccharide made of many glucose molecules) produced by certain lactic acid bacteria, including Streptococcus mutans, which is a significant contributor to dental plaque formation. Dextran is known for its sticky and adhesive properties, allowing bacteria to adhere to tooth surfaces.
B. Dextrin: Dextrins are a group of low-molecular-weight carbohydrates produced by the hydrolysis of starch. While they can be found in some food products, they are not typically associated with dental plaque formation.
C. Glycogen: Glycogen is a polysaccharide that serves as an energy storage molecule in animals and fungi. It is not commonly found in dental plaque or associated with its formation.
D. Sucrose: Sucrose is a disaccharide composed of glucose and fructose. While sucrose is a substrate for oral bacteria to produce extracellular polysaccharides like dextran, it is not itself the sticky polysaccharide in dental plaque.
Based on the information provided, the correct answer is:
Action: Answer("A")
Dextran, a complex branched glucan produced by certain oral bacteria like Streptococcus mutans, is the sticky polysaccharide present in dental plaque that contributes to its formation and adhesion to tooth surfaces.
## Result:
