Question: A patient underwent lateral skull base surgery few months back and has presented with complaints of recurrent aspirations. There is no change in voice of the patient. Which of the following nerve is most likely injured during surgery?
Choices:
  A: Vagus nerve
  B: Glossopharyngeal nerve
  C: SLN nerve
  D: RLN nerve
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The patient has undergone lateral skull base surgery and is now experiencing recurrent aspirations. This suggests a problem with the swallowing mechanism.
2. Swallowing is a complex process involving several cranial nerves, including the trigeminal (V), facial (VII), glossopharyngeal (IX), vagus (X), and hypoglossal (XII) nerves.
3. The superior laryngeal nerve (SLN) and recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) are branches of the vagus nerve (X) that innervate the larynx. Injury to these nerves would likely cause voice changes, which are not present in this patient.
4. The glossopharyngeal nerve (IX) plays a crucial role in the swallowing reflex. It provides sensory innervation to the posterior third of the tongue, the pharynx, and the upper esophagus. Stimulation of these areas by food or liquid triggers the swallowing reflex.
5. Damage to the glossopharyngeal nerve can lead to difficulty swallowing and an increased risk of aspiration, as the swallowing reflex may be impaired.
Given the patient's symptoms and the absence of voice changes, the most likely nerve injured during the lateral skull base surgery is the glossopharyngeal nerve.
Action: Answer("B")
