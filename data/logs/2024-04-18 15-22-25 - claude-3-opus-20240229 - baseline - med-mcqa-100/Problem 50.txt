Question: Which of the following drains directly into inferior vena cava?
Choices:
  A: Superior mesenteric vein
  B: Inferior mesenteric vein
  C: Right suprarenal vein
  D: Renal vein
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The inferior vena cava is a large vein that carries deoxygenated blood from the lower and middle body into the right atrium of the heart.
2. The superior mesenteric vein drains blood from the small intestine, cecum, ascending colon, and transverse colon. It joins with the splenic vein to form the hepatic portal vein, which then carries blood to the liver, not directly to the inferior vena cava.
3. The inferior mesenteric vein drains blood from the rectum, sigmoid colon, and descending colon. It empties into the splenic vein, which then joins the superior mesenteric vein to form the hepatic portal vein, not directly into the inferior vena cava.
4. The right suprarenal vein drains the right adrenal gland and empties directly into the inferior vena cava.
5. The renal veins drain the kidneys and empty directly into the inferior vena cava.
Therefore, both the right suprarenal vein and renal veins drain directly into the inferior vena cava. However, the question asks for a single answer.
Action: Answer("C")
The right suprarenal vein drains directly into the inferior vena cava, while the renal veins are a separate answer choice.
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
