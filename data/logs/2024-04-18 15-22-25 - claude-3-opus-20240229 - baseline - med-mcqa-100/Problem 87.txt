## System:
You are an expert in Medicine.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: An infant is brought in by his mother, who says that his skin tastes salty. With time this patient's pancreas is expected to undergo progressive fibrosis with atrophy of the exocrine glands and cystic dilation of the ducts. The basic abnormality in this infant involves
Choices:
  A: Decreased synthesis of surface receptor
  B: Decreased intracellular cAMP
  C: Decreased glycosylated chloride channel
  D: Increased phosphorylation of chloride channel
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The key symptoms mentioned are salty-tasting skin and progressive pancreatic fibrosis with exocrine gland atrophy and cystic duct dilation.
2. These symptoms are characteristic of cystic fibrosis, an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the CFTR gene.
3. CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) is a chloride channel that regulates the transport of chloride ions across epithelial cell membranes.
4. In cystic fibrosis, the CFTR protein is either not synthesized correctly, not processed and transported to the cell surface properly, or does not function correctly as a chloride channel.
5. The basic abnormality is not related to cAMP levels or phosphorylation of the chloride channel.
6. The most likely answer is that there is a decrease in the functional chloride channel at the cell surface, which could be due to decreased synthesis or improper glycosylation of the CFTR protein.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
