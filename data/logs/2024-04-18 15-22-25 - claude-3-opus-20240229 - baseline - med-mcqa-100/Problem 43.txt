Question: Antisera is obtained from:
Choices:
  A: Guinea pig
  B: Rabbit
  C: Rat
  D: Horse
## Assistant 2:
To determine the correct answer, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. Antisera, also known as antiserum, is a blood serum that contains antibodies against a specific antigen or toxin.
2. Antisera is produced by injecting an animal with an antigen and then collecting the animal's blood, which will contain antibodies against that antigen.
3. The animal chosen for producing antisera should have a robust immune response and be easy to handle and maintain.
4. Horses are commonly used for the production of antisera because:
   - They have a large blood volume, which allows for the collection of large quantities of antisera.
   - They have a strong immune response to a wide range of antigens.
   - They are relatively easy to handle and maintain compared to smaller animals.
5. While other animals like rabbits, guinea pigs, and rats can also be used to produce antisera, horses are the most common choice for large-scale production.
