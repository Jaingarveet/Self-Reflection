## System:
You are an expert in Medicine.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Subtopic: Anatomy
Question: In obstruction of second pa of axillary aery, the anastomosis between the following aery will maintain the blood supply of upper limb
Choices:
  A: Deep branch of transverse cervical aery & subscapular aery
  B: Anterior & posterior circumflex humeral
  C: Posterior circumflex humeral & circumflex scapular aery
  D: Suprascapular & anterior circumflex humeral aery
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The axillary artery is the main artery of the upper limb. It is divided into three parts by the pectoralis minor muscle.
2. If the second part of the axillary artery is obstructed, blood supply to the upper limb can be maintained by anastomoses (connections) between branches of the axillary artery.
3. The branches of the second part of the axillary artery are:
   - Lateral thoracic artery
   - Thoracoacromial artery
   - Subscapular artery, which gives off the circumflex scapular artery
4. The posterior circumflex humeral artery is a branch of the third part of the axillary artery.
5. The suprascapular artery and the deep branch of the transverse cervical artery are not branches of the axillary artery. They arise from the thyrocervical trunk of the subclavian artery.
6. Therefore, the anastomosis that would maintain blood supply in case of obstruction of the second part of the axillary artery is between the subscapular artery (a branch of the second part) and the posterior circumflex humeral artery (a branch of the third part).
Action: Answer("C")
