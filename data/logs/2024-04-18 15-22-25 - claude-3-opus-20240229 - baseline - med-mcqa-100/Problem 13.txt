## System:
You are an expert in Medicine.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: Investigation of choice in pyloric stenosis-
Choices:
  A: USG
  B: UGI series
  C: CT
  D: MRI
## Assistant 2:
To determine the best investigation for pyloric stenosis, let's consider each option:
A. USG (Ultrasonography):
- Ultrasonography is non-invasive, readily available, and does not involve radiation exposure.
- It can visualize the pyloric muscle thickness and length, and assess for gastric outlet obstruction.
- Ultrasonography is highly sensitive and specific for diagnosing pyloric stenosis.
B. UGI series (Upper Gastrointestinal series):
- UGI series involves radiographic imaging of the upper gastrointestinal tract using contrast material.
- It can demonstrate the narrowed pyloric channel and elongated pylorus, but may not provide as much detail as ultrasonography.
- UGI series involves radiation exposure.
C. CT (Computed Tomography):
- CT scans provide detailed cross-sectional images but involve significant radiation exposure.
- CT is not typically used as a first-line investigation for pyloric stenosis due to the radiation risk, especially in infants.
D. MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging):
- MRI provides excellent soft tissue detail without radiation exposure.
- However, it is not commonly used for diagnosing pyloric stenosis due to its high cost, limited availability, and the need for sedation in infants.
Considering the advantages and disadvantages of each option, ultrasonography (USG) is the investigation of choice for pyloric stenosis. It is non-invasive, highly accurate, and does not involve radiation exposure, making it the preferred method for diagnosing pyloric stenosis in infants.
Action: Answer("A")
