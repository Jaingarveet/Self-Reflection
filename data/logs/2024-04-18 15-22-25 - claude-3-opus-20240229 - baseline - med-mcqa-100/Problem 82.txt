Question: Which of the following is NOT a branch of intracranial part of Internal carotid artery(103 - BDC- 3) 4th edition
Choices:
  A: Anterior communicating
  B: Anterior cerebral
  C: Middle cerebral
  D: Posterior communicating
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The internal carotid artery enters the cranial cavity and gives off several branches.
2. The main branches of the intracranial part of the internal carotid artery are:
   - Ophthalmic artery
   - Posterior communicating artery
   - Anterior choroidal artery
   - Anterior cerebral artery
   - Middle cerebral artery
3. The anterior communicating artery is not a direct branch of the internal carotid artery. Instead, it connects the left and right anterior cerebral arteries.
Therefore, the correct answer is:
Action: Answer("A")
The anterior communicating artery is not a direct branch of the intracranial part of the internal carotid artery.
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
