## System:
You are an expert in Medicine.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:

Subtopic: Radiology
Question: Collimators in X ray Depament are used to:
Choices:
  A: Reduce the radiation beam spread.
  B: Filter the radiation beam.
  C: Increase film latitude.
  D: Decrease film latitude.
## Assistant 2:
To determine the correct answer, let's consider the purpose and function of collimators in X-ray imaging:
1. Collimators are devices that narrow and shape the X-ray beam to the specific area of interest.
2. By reducing the beam size, collimators minimize unnecessary radiation exposure to the patient and improve image quality by reducing scatter radiation.
3. Collimators do not directly affect the film latitude, which is the range of exposures that can be recorded on the film.
4. Collimators do not filter the radiation beam; filtration is typically done using aluminum or copper filters to remove low-energy photons.
Based on these points, the correct answer is:
Action: Answer("A")
Collimators in X-ray departments are used to reduce the radiation beam spread, which helps to minimize patient exposure and improve image quality by reducing scatter radiation.
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
