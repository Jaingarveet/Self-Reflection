## System:
You are an expert in Medicine.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: In a solution the concentration of hydrogen ion (H+) is 1 x 10-6 moles/litre. The pH of the solution will be -
Choices:
  A: Three
  B: Six
  C: Nine
  D: Twelve
## Assistant 2:
To determine the pH of the solution, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The pH of a solution is defined as the negative logarithm (base 10) of the hydrogen ion concentration [H+].
2. The formula for pH is: pH = -log10[H+]
3. In this case, the hydrogen ion concentration [H+] is given as 1 x 10^-6 moles/litre.
4. Plugging this into the formula:
   pH = -log10(1 x 10^-6)
      = -(-6 log10(1))  (using the logarithm property: log(a^b) = b log(a))
      = -(-6 * 0)      (since log10(1) = 0)
      = 0 * 6
      = 6
5. Therefore, the pH of the solution is 6.
