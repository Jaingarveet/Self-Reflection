## System:
You are an expert in Medicine.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Question: Which of the following shows crescent shaped deposits under light microscope?
Choices:
  A: RPGN
  B: Acute GN
  C: Membranous GN
  D: Membranoproliferative GN
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. RPGN stands for Rapidly Progressive Glomerulonephritis. It is characterized by the presence of crescents in the glomeruli, which are formed by the proliferation of parietal epithelial cells in Bowman's space.
2. Acute GN (Glomerulonephritis) is usually caused by post-streptococcal infection and typically shows diffuse proliferation of endothelial and mesangial cells, along with neutrophil infiltration. Crescents are not a typical feature.
3. Membranous GN is characterized by thickening of the glomerular basement membrane due to subepithelial immune complex deposits. Crescents are not typically seen.
4. Membranoproliferative GN (MPGN) shows mesangial proliferation and thickening of the capillary walls due to subendothelial deposits. Crescents can be seen in some cases of MPGN, but they are not the defining feature.
Therefore, the condition that characteristically shows crescent-shaped deposits under light microscope is RPGN.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
