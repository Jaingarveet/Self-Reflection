Context: A shopping center has exactly seven spaces—space 1 through space 7—arranged in a straight row. Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
Question: If the optometrist is next to the shoe store, the businesses immediately on either side of this pair must be
Choices:
  A: the pharmacy and a restaurant
  B: the pharmacy and the toy store
  C: the two restaurants

Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misunderstood the constraints. I assumed that the pharmacy and the veterinarian had to be next to the optometrist and shoe store pair, but the constraints only state that the pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, not both. 
Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation
- Logical reasoning error
- Constraint misunderstanding
Solution:
Given the constraints, if the optometrist is next to the shoe store, the pharmacy must be on one side of this pair (since the pharmacy must be next to the optometrist). The other side cannot be a restaurant because the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. It also cannot be the veterinarian because the pharmacy is already next to the optometrist. Therefore, the other side of the pair must be the toy store. 
Instructions:
1. Understand the constraints of the problem.
2. Identify the businesses that must be next to the optometrist and shoe store pair based on the constraints.
3. Eliminate the businesses that cannot be next to the pair based on the constraints.
4. Choose the answer that includes the remaining businesses.
Advice:
- Always read the question and constraints carefully.
- Break down the problem and understand each part before attempting to solve it.
- Use logical reasoning to eliminate incorrect choices.
- Double-check your understanding of the constraints and your solution before finalizing your answer.
