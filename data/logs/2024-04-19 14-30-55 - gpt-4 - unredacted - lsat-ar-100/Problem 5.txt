Topic: Law
Context: Exactly eight books—F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O—are placed on a bookcase with exactly three shelves—the top shelf, the middle shelf, and the bottom shelf. At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.
Question: Which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: O is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf M is placed on.
  B: K is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf G is placed on.
  C: I is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf F is placed on.
  D: G is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf O is placed on.
  E: F is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf L is placed on.

Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I incorrectly interpreted the conditions of the problem. I focused on the placement of K, F, and M, but overlooked the condition that O is placed on a higher shelf than L. This led me to the wrong conclusion.
Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation
- Overlooking information
- Logical reasoning error
Solution:
From the conditions, we know that I is on the middle shelf, K is higher than F, and O is higher than L. F and M are on the same shelf. Since K is higher than F, and F is with M, K cannot be on the bottom shelf. Therefore, K must be on the middle or top shelf. Since more books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, the top shelf can have at most 3 books. Therefore, F and M must be on the bottom shelf because if they were on the top shelf, K would have to be on the middle shelf, and there would be 4 books on the top shelf, which is not allowed. Since F and M are on the bottom shelf, and O is higher than L, O must be on a shelf higher than M.
Instructions:
1. Understand the conditions of the problem.
2. Identify the relationships between the books.
3. Determine the possible placements of each book based on the conditions.
4. Consider all conditions when making conclusions.
5. Double-check your reasoning and answer.
Advice:
- Always read the question and conditions carefully.
- Break down complex problems into simpler parts.
- Consider all conditions and information given in the problem.
- Double-check your reasoning and answer.
- Practice logical reasoning problems to improve your skills.
