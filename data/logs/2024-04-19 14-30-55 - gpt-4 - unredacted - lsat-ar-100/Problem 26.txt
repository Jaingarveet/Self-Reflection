Context: During a recital, two pianists—Wayne and Zara—will perform solos. There will be five solos altogether, performed one immediately after another. Each solo will be either a modern piece or a traditional piece. The choice of pianist and type of piece for the solos must conform to the following conditions: The third solo is a traditional piece. Exactly two of the traditional pieces are performed consecutively. In the fourth solo, either Wayne performs a traditional piece or Zara performs a modern piece. The pianist who performs the second solo does not perform the fifth solo. No traditional piece is performed until Wayne performs at least one modem piece.
Question: What is the minimum number of solos in which Wayne performs a traditional piece?
Choices:
  A: zero
  B: one
  C: two
  D: three
  E: four
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I misunderstood the conditions of the problem. I assumed that Wayne had to perform the fourth solo because it was a traditional piece. However, the conditions allow for Zara to perform a modern piece in the fourth solo, which means Wayne could potentially not perform any traditional pieces.
Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation
- Conditional reasoning error
- Assumption error
Solution:
The third and fourth solos are traditional pieces. The fourth solo can be performed by Wayne with a traditional piece or Zara with a modern piece. Since Zara can perform a modern piece in the fourth solo, Wayne doesn't necessarily have to perform a traditional piece. The condition that no traditional piece is performed until Wayne performs at least one modern piece also doesn't require Wayne to perform a traditional piece. Therefore, the minimum number of solos in which Wayne performs a traditional piece could be zero.
Instructions:
1. Understand the conditions of the problem.
2. Identify the constraints for each solo.
3. Determine the possibilities for each solo based on the constraints.
4. Consider all possible scenarios, not just the ones that seem obvious.
5. Choose the answer that fits all conditions and scenarios.
Advice:
- Always read the question and conditions carefully.
- Don't make assumptions that are not supported by the conditions.
- Consider all possible scenarios.
- Practice conditional reasoning problems to improve your skills.
