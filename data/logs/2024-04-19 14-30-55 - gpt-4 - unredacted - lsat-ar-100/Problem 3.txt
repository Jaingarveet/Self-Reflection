Topic: Law
Context: An administrator must assign parking spaces to six new employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young. Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
Question: If Robertson is assigned parking space #3, then which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Souza is assigned parking space #4.
  B: Togowa is assigned parking space #2.
  C: Vaughn is assigned parking space #5.
  D: Xu is assigned parking space #6.
  E: Young is assigned parking space #2.

Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I misunderstood the rules governing the assignment of parking spaces. I incorrectly assumed that Young and Togowa must be assigned parking spaces #1 or #2, which led me to the wrong conclusion that Souza must be assigned parking space #4. 
Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation
- Logical reasoning error
- Rule application error
Solution:
Given that Robertson is assigned parking space #3, and the rules state that Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa, and Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young, it means that Young and Togowa must be assigned parking spaces #1 or #2. However, since Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa, Young cannot be assigned parking space #1. Therefore, Young must be assigned parking space #2.
Instructions:
1. Understand the rules governing the assignment of parking spaces.
2. Apply the rules to the given scenario.
3. Determine the possible parking spaces for each employee based on the rules.
4. Identify the constraints for each employee.
5. Use logical reasoning to determine the correct answer.
Advice:
- Always read the question and the rules carefully.
- Understand the constraints and apply them correctly.
- Use logical reasoning to solve the problem.
- Double-check your answer to ensure it aligns with the rules and constraints.

However, since Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa, Young cannot be assigned parking space #1. Therefore, Young must be assigned parking space #2.
