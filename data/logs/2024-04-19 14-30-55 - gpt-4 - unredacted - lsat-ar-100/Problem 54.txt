Topic: Law
Context: For the school paper, five students—Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, Megregian, and O'Neill—each review one or more of exactly three plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation, but do not review any other plays. The following conditions must apply: Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
Question: If Jiang does not review Tamerlane, then which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Jiang reviews Sunset.
  B: Lopez reviews Undulation.
  C: Megregian reviews Sunset.
  D: Megregian reviews Tamerlane.
  E: O'Neill reviews Undulation.
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I misunderstood the conditions of the problem. I incorrectly assumed that since Jiang does not review Tamerlane, Lopez and Megregian also do not review Tamerlane. However, the condition only states that Lopez and Megregian do not review any play that Jiang reviews, not that they cannot review Tamerlane if Jiang does not. This led me to the wrong conclusion.
Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation
- Logical reasoning error
- Condition misunderstanding
Solution:
Given that Jiang does not review Tamerlane, and neither Lopez nor Megregian review any play Jiang reviews, it does not necessarily mean that Lopez and Megregian also do not review Tamerlane. 
Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, and since Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian, it means that Megregian must review Tamerlane as well. Therefore, the correct answer is D: Megregian reviews Tamerlane.
Instructions:
1. Understand the conditions of the problem.
2. Identify the plays each student reviews based on the conditions.
3. If Jiang does not review Tamerlane, it does not mean that Lopez and Megregian also do not review Tamerlane.
4. Since Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, and Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian, Megregian must review Tamerlane.
5. Choose the answer that matches your conclusion.
Advice:
- Always read the conditions carefully and understand them correctly.
- Do not make assumptions that are not supported by the conditions.
- Use logical reasoning to solve the problem step-by-step.
- Double-check your understanding of the conditions and your conclusion.
