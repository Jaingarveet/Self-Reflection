Context: For the school paper, five students—Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, Megregian, and O'Neill—each review one or more of exactly three plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation, but do not review any other plays. The following conditions must apply: Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
Question: If exactly three of the students review Undulation, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Megregian does not review Undulation.
  B: O'Neill does not review Undulation.
  C: Jiang reviews Undulation.
  D: Lopez reviews Tamerlane.
  E: O'Neill reviews Sunset.
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misunderstood the conditions. I assumed that Megregian had to review Undulation because they review more plays than Kramer and Lopez. However, the conditions do not specify which plays each student reviews, only the relative quantity.
Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation
- Assumption
- Logical reasoning error
Solution:
Given the conditions, we know that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews, so Jiang cannot review Tamerlane. This means Jiang must review Undulation and/or Sunset. Since exactly three students review Undulation, and we know that Megregian reviews more plays than Kramer and Lopez, it's possible that Megregian reviews all three plays, including Undulation. However, the conditions do not specify that Megregian must review Undulation. Therefore, it is possible that O'Neill reviews Sunset, making choice E the correct answer.
Instructions:
1. Understand the conditions given in the question.
2. Identify the constraints for each student.
3. Determine the possible plays each student can review based on the constraints.
4. Consider the question, which asks for a possible truth given the conditions.
5. Evaluate each answer choice based on the constraints and the question.
6. Choose the answer that fits within the constraints and could be true.
Advice:
- Always read the question and conditions carefully.
- Do not make assumptions that are not supported by the conditions.
- Evaluate each answer choice individually.
- Use logical reasoning to determine the possible scenarios.
- Remember that the question asks for a possible truth, not a definite one.
