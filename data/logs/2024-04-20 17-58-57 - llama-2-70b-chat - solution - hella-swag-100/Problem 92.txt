In my previous answer, I chose option B, "tries once more and ends up having to solve the puzzle alone." However, upon reflection, I realized that the given information does not suggest that the young man is struggling to solve the cube or needs help from another person. Therefore, option C, "then solves the cube and pans the camera back to show his time," is the most appropriate choice.
