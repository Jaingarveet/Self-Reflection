## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Context: \begin{center}.\begin{tabular}{|l|c|}.\hline.\multicolumn{1}{|c|}{Planet} & Acceleration due to gravity $\left(\frac{\mathrm{m}}{\mathrm{sec}^{2}}\right)$ \\.\hline\hline.Mercury & 3.6 \\.\hline.Venus & 8.9 \\.\hline.Earth & 9.8 \\.\hline.Mars & 3.8 \\.\hline.Jupiter & 26.0 \\.\hline.Saturn & 11.1 \\.\hline.Uranus & 10.7 \\.\hline.Neptune & 14.1 \\.\hline.\end{tabular}.\end{center}.The chart above shows approximations of the acceleration due to gravity in meters per.second squared $\left(\frac{\mathrm{m}}{\sec ^{2}}\right)$ for the eight planets in our solar system. The weight of an object on a given planet can be found by using the formula $W=m g$, where $W$ is the weight of the object measured in newtons, $m$ is the mass of the object measured in kilograms, and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity on the planet measured in $\frac{m}{\sec ^{2}}$
Question: An object on Earth has a weight of 150 newtons. On which planet would the same object have an approximate weight of 170 newtons?
Choices:
  A: Venus
  B: Saturn
  C: Uranus
  D: Neptune
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always identify the known and unknown variables.
 - Always use the appropriate formula to solve the problem.
 - Always be mindful of the units and ensure consistency throughout the calculations.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that the weight of an object is directly proportional to its mass and the acceleration due to gravity.
## Assistant 2:
Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly because I did not carefully consider the units of measurement. I calculated the weight of the object on each planet using the acceleration due to gravity on that planet, but I did not convert the weight to newtons. As a result, my answer was incorrect.
To answer this question correctly, I will need to use the formula $W=mg$ and convert the weight of the object on Earth to kilograms. Then, I can use the acceleration due to gravity on each planet to calculate the weight of the object on that planet. Finally, I will need to convert the weight of the object on each planet to newtons.
Thought:
The weight of an object on Earth is 150 newtons.
The acceleration due to gravity on Earth is 9.8 $\frac{m}{\sec ^{2}}$.
The mass of the object on Earth is $m=\frac{W}{g}=\frac{150 \text{ newtons}}{9.8 \frac{m}{\sec ^{2}}}=15.31 \text{ kg}$.
The weight of the object on Venus is $W=mg=(15.31 \text{ kg})(8.9 \frac{m}{\sec ^{2}})=136 \text{ newtons}$.
The weight of the object on Saturn is $W=mg=(15.31 \text{ kg})(11.1 \frac{m}{\sec ^{2}})=169 \text{ newtons}$.
The weight of the object on Uranus is $W=mg=(15.31 \text{ kg})(10.7 \frac{m}{\sec ^{2}})=163 \text{ newtons}$.
The weight of the object on Neptune is $W=mg=(15.31 \text{ kg})(14.1 \frac{m}{\sec ^{2}})=216 \text{ newtons}$.
