Question: Shipping Charges\begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}\hline$\begin{array}{c}\text { Merchandise weight } \\ \text { (pounds) }\end{array}$ & $\begin{array}{c}\text { Shipping } \\ \text { charge }\end{array}$ \\\hline5 & $\$ 16.94$ \\\hline10 & $\$ 21.89$ \\\hline20 & $\$ 31.79$ \\\hline40 & $\$ 51.59$ \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}The table above shows shipping charges for an online retailer that sells sporting goods. There is a linear relationship between the shipping charge and the weight of the merchandise. Which function can be used to determine the total shipping charge $f(x)$, in dollars, for an order with a merchandise weight of $x$ pounds?
Choices:
  A: $f(x)=0.99 x$
  B: $f(x)=0.99 x+11.99$
  C: $f(x)=3.39 x$
  D: $f(x)=3.39 x+16.94$

## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The shipping charge increases by a constant amount for each additional pound of merchandise.
This means that the relationship between the shipping charge and the weight of the merchandise is linear.
We can use the slope-intercept form of a linear equation to represent this relationship: $y = mx + b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the $y$-intercept.
The slope represents the rate of change of the shipping charge per pound of merchandise.
The $y$-intercept represents the shipping charge for an order with a weight of 0 pounds.
We can find the slope by calculating the change in the shipping charge divided by the change in the weight of the merchandise.
For example, between 5 pounds and 10 pounds, the shipping charge increases by $\$21.89 - \$16.94 = \$4.95$.
The slope is therefore $\$4.95 \div 5 = \$0.99$ per pound.
We can find the $y$-intercept by substituting the slope and one of the points from the table into the slope-intercept form of a linear equation.
For example, using the point $(5, 16.94)$, we get $16.94 = 0.99 \cdot 5 + b$.
Solving for $b$, we get $b = 11.99$.
Therefore, the function that can be used to determine the total shipping charge $f(x)$, in dollars, for an order with a merchandise weight of $x$ pounds is $f(x) = 0.99x + 11.99$.
Action: Answer("B")
