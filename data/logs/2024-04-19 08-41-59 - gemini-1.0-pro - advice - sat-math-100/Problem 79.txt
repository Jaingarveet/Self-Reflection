# Model: gemini-1.0-pro | Agent: advice | Exam: sat-math-100 | Problem 79 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: A helicopter, initially hovering 40 feet above the ground, begins to gain altitude at a rate of 21 feet per second. Which of the following functions represents the helicopter's altitude above the ground $y$, in feet, $t$ seconds after the helicopter begins to gain altitude?
Choices:
  A: $y=40+21$
  B: $y=40+21 t$
  C: $y=40-21 t$
  D: $y=40 t+21$
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Advice:
 - Pay close attention to the units of the variables involved.
 - Make sure to distinguish between initial values and rates of change.
 - Double-check the units of the slope and y-intercept to ensure they are consistent with the units of the variables.
 - Remember that the slope-intercept form of a linear equation is $y=mx+b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept.
## Assistant 2:
Self-reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly because I did not pay close attention to the units of the variables involved. I confused the initial altitude with the rate of change, which led me to choose the wrong answer.
I have learned from my mistake and will be more careful in the future.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
