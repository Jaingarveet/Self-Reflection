# Model: gemini-1.0-pro | Agent: advice | Exam: sat-math-100 | Problem 91 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:
Topic: Geography
Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: \begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|c||c|c|c|c|}\hline$n$ & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\\hline$f(n)$ & -2 & 1 & 4 & 7 \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}The table above shows some values of the linear function $f$. Which of the following defines $f$ ?
Choices:
  A: $f(n)=n-3$
  B: $f(n)=2 n-4$
  C: $f(n)=3 n-5$
  D: $f(n)=4 n-6$
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Advice:
 - When analyzing linear functions, pay close attention to the change in the output value for each change in the input value.
 - Remember that the slope of a linear function represents the rate of change of the function.
 - Remember that the y-intercept of a linear function represents the value of the function when the input value is zero.
 - Always double-check your calculations and reasoning before selecting your final answer.
## Assistant 2:
Self-reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly because I did not pay close attention to the change in the output value for each change in the input value. I also did not remember that the slope of a linear function represents the rate of change of the function.
I will now analyze the table of values and use the information to determine the correct answer.
Analysis:
The output value increases by 3 for each increase of 1 in the input value. This means that the slope of the linear function is 3.
The output value is -2 when the input value is 1. This means that the y-intercept of the linear function is -2.
Therefore, the linear function is $f(n)=3 n-2$.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
