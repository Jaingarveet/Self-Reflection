## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:

## Assistant 2:
I understand. I will use my self-reflection to answer this question correctly.
**Self-reflection:**
* I initially made a mistake by not squaring both sides of the equation.
* I realized my mistake by checking the answer choices and seeing that none of them satisfied the original equation.
* I corrected my mistake by squaring both sides of the equation and solving for x.
**Solution:**
1. Square both sides of the equation:
$$\sqrt{4 x} = x - 3$$
$$4x = (x - 3)^2$$
2. Expand the right side of the equation:
$$4x = x^2 - 6x + 9$$
3. Move all terms to the left side of the equation:
$$0 = x^2 - 10x + 9$$
4. Factor the quadratic equation:
$$0 = (x - 1)(x - 9)$$
5. Solve for x:
$$x = 1 \text{ or } x = 9$$
**Answer:**
Therefore, the values of x that satisfy the given equation are **I and II**.
**Action:** Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
