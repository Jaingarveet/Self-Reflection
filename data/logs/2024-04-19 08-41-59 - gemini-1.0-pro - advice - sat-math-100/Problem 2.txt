# Model: gemini-1.0-pro | Agent: advice | Exam: sat-math-100 | Problem 2 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")

Topic: Math
Question: $$\left(x^{2} y-3 y^{2}+5 x y^{2}\right)-\left(-x^{2} y+3 x y^{2}-3 y^{2}\right)$$Which of the following is equivalent to the expression above?
Choices:
  A: $4 x^{2} y^{2}$
  B: $8 x y^{2}-6 y^{2}$
  C: $2 x^{2} y+2 x y^{2}$
  D: $2 x^{2} y+8 x y^{2}-6 y^{2}$

## Assistant 2:
I understand. I will use my self-reflection to answer this question correctly.
Thought:
The expression is a difference of two polynomials. To find the difference, we subtract the second polynomial from the first.
First, we distribute the negative sign in the second polynomial:
$$\left(x^{2} y-3 y^{2}+5 x y^{2}\right)-\left(-x^{2} y+3 x y^{2}-3 y^{2}\right)$$
$$=x^{2} y-3 y^{2}+5 x y^{2}+x^{2} y-3 x y^{2}+3 y^{2}$$
Next, we group like terms:
$$(x^{2} y+x^{2} y)+(-3 y^{2}+3 y^{2})+(5 x y^{2}-3 x y^{2})$$
Finally, we combine like terms:
$$2 x^{2} y+2 x y^{2}$$
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
