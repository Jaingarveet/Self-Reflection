## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

 - If you get stuck, try to break down the problem into smaller steps or seek help from others.
## Assistant 2:
## Self-reflection on previous incorrect answer:
**Mistake:** I incorrectly calculated the value of $k$ that would result in a system with no solution.
**Reasoning:** I made a sign error when multiplying the second equation by $\frac{3}{5}$ to eliminate $y$. This led to an incorrect value for $k$.
**Correction:** I will carefully review my calculations and double-check the signs and coefficients at each step.
## Solution:
To find the value of $k$ for which the system has no solution, we can try to eliminate one of the variables. Let's eliminate $y$:
1. Multiply the first equation by $\frac{5}{3}$:
$$\frac{5}{3}kx - 5y = \frac{20}{3}$$
2. Multiply the second equation by $-1$:
$$-4x + 5y = -7$$
3. Add the two equations:
$$\frac{5}{3}kx - 4x = \frac{13}{3}$$
4. Solve for $x$:
$$x = \frac{13}{5k + 12}$$
For the system to have no solution, the value of $x$ must be undefined. This occurs when the denominator of the fraction is equal to zero:
$$5k + 12 = 0$$
$$k = -\frac{12}{5}$$
Therefore, the value of $k$ for which the system has no solution is $-\frac{12}{5}$.
