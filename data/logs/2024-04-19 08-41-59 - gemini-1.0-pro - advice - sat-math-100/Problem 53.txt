# Model: gemini-1.0-pro | Agent: advice | Exam: sat-math-100 | Problem 53 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:
Topic: Geography
Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: A line in the $x y$-plane passes through the origin and has a slope of $\frac{1}{7}$. Which of the following points lies on the line?
Choices:
  A: $(0,7)$
  B: $(1,7)$
  C: $(7,7)$
  D: $(14,2)$
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Advice:
 - Carefully read the problem and identify all given information.
 - Do not make assumptions that are not explicitly stated in the problem.
 - Consider all possible scenarios and eliminate answer choices that do not fit.
 - Use the given information to calculate the unknown values step-by-step.
 - Double-check your calculations and reasoning before choosing an answer.
## Assistant 2:
Self-Reflection:
- I initially made the mistake of assuming that the point $(0,7)$ would lie on the line because of the slope.
- However, I realized that the slope only tells us the direction and steepness of the line, not its exact position.
- The correct approach is to use the slope to find the equation of the line and then check which of the given points satisfies that equation.
Following this approach:
- The equation of the line with a slope of $\frac{1}{7}$ and passing through the origin is $y = \frac{1}{7}x$.
- Checking each answer choice:
    - $(0,7)$: $7 = \frac{1}{7} \cdot 0 = 0$, not true.
    - $(1,7)$: $7 = \frac{1}{7} \cdot 1 = \frac{1}{7}$, not true.
    - $(7,7)$: $7 = \frac{1}{7} \cdot 7 = 1$, not true.
    - $(14,2)$: $2 = \frac{1}{7} \cdot 14 = 2$, true.
Therefore, only point $(14,2)$ lies on the line.
Action: Answer("D")
