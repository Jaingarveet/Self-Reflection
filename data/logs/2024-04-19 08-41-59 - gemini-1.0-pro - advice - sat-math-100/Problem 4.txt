## Solution for the Current Question:
The line passes through the origin, so the equation of the line can be written in the form:
$$y = mx$$
where $m$ is the slope of the line.
Using the two given points, we can find the slope:
$$m = \frac{32 - k}{k - 2}$$
Since the line passes through the origin, we know that $y = 0$ when $x = 0$. Substituting these values into the equation above, we get:
$$0 = m \cdot 0$$
This implies that $m = 0$.
Now, we can use the slope to find the value of $k$:
$$0 = \frac{32 - k}{k - 2}$$
$$0 = 32 - k$$
$$k = 32$$
Therefore, the value of $k$ that makes the line pass through the origin is 32.
Action: Answer("D")

Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
