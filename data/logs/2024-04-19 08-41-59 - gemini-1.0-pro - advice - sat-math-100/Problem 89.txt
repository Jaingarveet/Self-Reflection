Context: $$.\begin{aligned}.& S(P)=\frac{1}{2} P+40 \\.& D(P)=220-P.\end{aligned}.$$.The quantity of a product supplied and the quantity of the product demanded in an economic market are functions of the price of the product. The functions above are the estimated supply and demand functions for a certain product. The function $S(P)$ gives the quantity of the product supplied to the market when the price is $P$ dollars, and the function $D(P)$ gives the quantity of the product demanded by the market when the price is $P$ dollars.
Question: Graphene, which is used in the manufacture of integrated circuits, is so thin that a sheet weighing one ounce can cover up to 7 football fields. If a football field has an area of approximately $1 \frac{1}{3}$ acres, about how many acres could 48 ounces of graphene cover?
Choices:
  A: 250
  B: 350
  C: 450
  D: 1,350

## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
One ounce of graphene can cover 7 football fields.
One football field has an area of approximately $1 \frac{1}{3}$ acres.
Therefore, one ounce of graphene can cover $7 \times 1 \frac{1}{3} = \frac{28}{3}$ acres.
48 ounces of graphene can cover $48 \times \frac{28}{3} = 448$ acres.
Action: Answer("D")
