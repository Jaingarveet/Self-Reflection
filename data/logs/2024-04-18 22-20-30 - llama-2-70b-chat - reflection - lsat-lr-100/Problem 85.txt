The gap in my knowledge was not in geography but in basic arithmetic. 
I knew the correct city and state but made a calculation error.
Error Keywords:

  D: Game Review Monthly, the most commonly read magazine among people who frequently copy computer games, generally gives favorable reviews to Ditalgame games.
  E: Computer games produced by Ditalgame are copied more frequently than computer games produced by other companies.

Answer: C

Explanation:
The fact that the copy protection feature makes the game playable for a short period before the user decides to purchase it supports the president's prediction of increased sales. This feature will encourage people who would otherwise copy the game to purchase it instead, thereby increasing sales.

Option A does not directly support the president's prediction. The fact that Ditalgame has spent millions of dollars developing the feature and needs to recoup the cost does not necessarily mean that sales will increase.

Option B does not provide support for the president's prediction. The fact that Ditalgame's market share has shrunk does not necessarily mean that the new copy protection feature will increase sales.

Option D does not provide support for the president's prediction. Even if Game Review Monthly gives favorable reviews to Ditalgame games, it does not mean that people who frequently copy games will purchase Ditalgame games instead of copying them.

Option E does not provide support for the president's prediction. The fact that Ditalgame games are copied more frequently than other games does not necessarily mean that the new copy protection feature will increase sales.

## Assistant 2:
Response:
  Action: Answer("C")

Explanation:
The correct answer is C, as it provides the most support for the president's prediction. The fact that the copy protection feature causes a copied game to be playable just long enough for most people to come to enjoy it so much that they decide they have to have it, suggests that people who would otherwise copy the game will instead purchase it, leading to increased sales.

Option A does not directly support the president's prediction, as the fact that Ditalgame has spent millions of dollars developing the feature and needs to recoup the cost does not necessarily mean that sales will increase.

Option B does not provide support for the president's prediction, as the fact that Ditalgame's market share has shrunk does not necessarily mean that the new copy protection feature will increase sales.

Option D does not provide support for the president's prediction, as even if Game Review Monthly gives favorable reviews to Ditalgame games, it does not mean that people who frequently copy games will purchase Ditalgame games instead of copying them.

Option E does not provide support for the president's prediction, as the fact that Ditalgame games are copied more frequently than other games does not necessarily mean that the new copy protection feature will increase sales.
