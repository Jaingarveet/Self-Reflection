Topic: Law
Context: Many of the presidents and prime ministers who have had the most successful foreign policies had no prior experience in foreign affairs when they assumed office. Although scholars and diplomats in the sacrosanct inner circle of international affairs would have us think otherwise, anyone with an acute political sense, a disciplined temperament, and a highly developed ability to absorb and retain information can quickly learn to conduct a successful foreign policy. In fact, prior experience alone will be of little value to a foreign policymaker who lacks all three of these traits.
Question: If all of the statements above are true, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Scholars and diplomats have more experience in foreign affairs than most presidents and prime ministers bring to office.
  B: Prior experience in foreign affairs is neither a sufficient nor a necessary condition for a president or prime minister to have a successful foreign policy.
  C: Prior experience in foreign affairs is a necessary but not sufficient condition for a president or prime minister to have a successful foreign policy.
  D: An acute political sense, a disciplined temperament, and a highly developed ability to absorb and retain information are each necessary conditions for a president or prime minister to have a successful foreign policy.
  E: A president or prime minister with years of experience in foreign affairs will have a more successful foreign policy than one who does not have experience in foreign affairs.

  Answer: B

The statement suggests that prior experience in foreign affairs is not a requirement for a successful foreign policy, and that other qualities such as an acute political sense, a disciplined temperament, and the ability to absorb and retain information are more important. Therefore, option B, "Prior experience in foreign affairs is neither a sufficient nor a necessary condition for a president or prime minister to have a successful foreign policy," must be true.
