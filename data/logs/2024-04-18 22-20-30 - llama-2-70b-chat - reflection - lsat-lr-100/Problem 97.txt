The gap in my knowledge was not in geography but in basic arithmetic. 
I knew the correct city and state but made a calculation error.
Error Keywords:

Topic: Law
Context: Editorial: Cell-phone usage on buses and trains is annoying to other passengers. This suggests that recent proposals to allow use of cell phones on airplanes are ill-advised. Cell-phone use would be far more upsetting on airplanes than it is on buses and trains. Airline passengers are usually packed in tightly. And if airline passengers are offended by the cell-phone excesses of their seatmates, they often cannot move to another seat.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes the role played in the editorial's argument by the statement that cell-phone use would be far more upsetting on airplanes than it is on buses and trains?
Choices:
  A: It is the main conclusion of the argument.
  B: It is a claim that the argument tries to rebut.
  C: It is a premise that indirectly supports the main conclusion of the argument by supporting a premise for that conclusion.
  D: It is a conclusion for which support is provided and that itself is used in turn to directly support the argument's main conclusion.
  E: It provides background information that plays no role in the reasoning in the argument.

  C: The statement that cell-phone use would be far more upsetting on airplanes than it is on buses and trains is a premise that indirectly supports the main conclusion of the argument by supporting a premise for that conclusion. The argument's main conclusion is that recent proposals to allow the use of cell phones on airplanes are ill-advised. The statement that cell-phone use would be far more upsetting on airplanes than it is on buses and trains helps to support this conclusion by highlighting the potential negative impact of cell-phone use in a confined space such as an airplane. Therefore, option C is the best answer.
