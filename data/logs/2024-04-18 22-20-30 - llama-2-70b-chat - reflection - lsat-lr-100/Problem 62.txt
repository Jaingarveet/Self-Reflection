Topic: Law
Context: Peter: Unlike in the past, most children's stories nowadays don't have clearly immoral characters in them. They should, though. Children need to learn the consequences of being bad. Yoko: Children's stories still tend to have clearly immoral characters in them, but now these characters tend not to be the sort that frighten children. Surely that's an improvement.
Question: Peter and Yoko disagree over whether today's children's stories
Choices:
  A: should be less frightening than they are
  B: tend to be less frightening than earlier children's stories were
  C: differ significantly in overall quality from earlier children's stories
  D: tend to have clearly immoral characters in them
  E: should help children learn the consequences of being bad

  Thought: 
Peter believes that children's stories should have clearly immoral characters to teach children the consequences of being bad. Yoko, on the other hand, believes that children's stories still have immoral characters, but they are not as frightening as they used to be, which is an improvement.
Action: Answer("B")
