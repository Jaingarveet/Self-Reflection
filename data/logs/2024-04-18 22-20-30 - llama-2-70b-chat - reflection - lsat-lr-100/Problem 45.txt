The gap in my knowledge was not in geography but in basic arithmetic. 
I knew the correct city and state but made a calculation error.
Error Keywords:

Topic: Law
Context: Art critic: The Woerner Journalism Award for criticism was given to Nan Paulsen for her reviews of automobiles. This is inappropriate. The criticism award should be given for criticism, which Paulsen's reviews clearly were not. After alL cars are utilitarian things, not works of art. And objects that are not works of art do not reveal important truths about the culture that produced them.
Question: Which one of the following principles, if valid, most helps to justiJY the reasoning in the art critic's argument?
Choices:
  A: The Woemer Journalism Award for criticism should not be given to a writer who portrays utilitarian objects as works of art.
  B: Reviews of objects cannot appropriately be considered to be criticism unless the objects reveal important truths about the culture that produced them.
  C: Unless a review is written for the purpose of revealing important truths about the writer's culture, that review should not be considered to be criticism.
  D: The Woerner JournalismAward for criticism should not be given to writers who do not consider themselves to be critics.
  E: All writing that reveals important truths about a culture should be considered to be criticism.

  Answer: B

Explanation:
The art critic argues that Nan Paulsen's reviews of automobiles should not have received the Woerner Journalism Award for criticism because cars are utilitarian objects, not works of art, and therefore, they do not reveal important truths about the culture that produced them. This argument is supported by choice B, which states that reviews of objects cannot appropriately be considered criticism unless the objects reveal important truths about the culture that produced them. This principle suggests that criticism should focus on objects that have cultural significance and reveal important truths about society, rather than utilitarian objects like cars. Therefore, choice B most helps to justify the reasoning in the art critic's argument.
