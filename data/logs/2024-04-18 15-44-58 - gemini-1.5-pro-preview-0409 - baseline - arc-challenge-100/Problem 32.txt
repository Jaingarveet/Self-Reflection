Topic: Science
Question: Students are learning about different types of waves. Which is the least likely way for the students to generate a wave?
Choices:
  A: by tossing a ball in the air
  B: by shaking the ends of a rope
  C: by throwing a pebble into a pool of water
  D: by pulling on a coiled spring toy
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Options B, C, and D all involve a disturbance in a medium (rope, water, spring) that can propagate as a wave. 
Tossing a ball in the air doesn't create a wave; it follows a parabolic trajectory due to gravity.
