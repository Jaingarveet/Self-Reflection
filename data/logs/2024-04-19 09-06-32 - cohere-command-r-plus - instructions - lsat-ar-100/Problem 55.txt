Instructions:
1. Identify the conditions that must be met for the witness schedule.
2. Break down the conditions step-by-step to create a logical sequence.
3. Start with the conditions that eliminate specific options.
4. Continue with conditions that provide specific scheduling requirements.
5. Ensure that the schedule meets all conditions before selecting it as the answer.

1. Franco and Garcia cannot testify on the same day.
2. Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
3. Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
4. Hong does not testify on Monday.
5. At least one witness testifies on Monday.

Now, let's analyze the choices given:

Option A: This does not meet the condition that Franco and Garcia cannot testify on the same day.

Option B: This meets all the conditions except that Hong testifies on Monday, contradicting the condition that Hong does not testify on Monday.

Option C: This option schedules both Franco and Garcia on Tuesday, which contradicts the first condition.

Option D: This option schedules three witnesses on Tuesday, contradicting the condition that exactly two witnesses testify on that day.

Option E: This option meets all the conditions provided. Franco and Garcia testify on different days, Iturbe testifies on Wednesday, two witnesses testify on Tuesday, Hong does not testify on Monday, and there is one witness testifying on Monday.

Therefore, the correct answer is E.
