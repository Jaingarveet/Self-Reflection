## Assistant 2:
Reflection: The correct answer is ['Lopez and Megregian review the same plays. Kramer and O’Neill review Tamerlane and possibly other plays, so they are not suitable choices for reviewing only Sunset. Jiang does not review any plays that Lopez reviews, so they could have distinct plays or there could be overlap; therefore, Jiang could potentially review only Sunset, but we cannot definitively place her with this play.'](https://www.arsbot.io/reflect/law-multiple-choice-question-5-reflection/)

Thought: Given that exactly two students review the same plays, and Kramer and O'Neill review Tamerlane, it can be deduced that Lopez and Megregian review the same plays, and these plays are distinct from those reviewed by Jiang. This is because neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any plays that Jiang reviews. Therefore, Lopez and Megregian could have reviewed Sunset and/or Undulation, but not Tamerlane. As Sunset is the only play they could have reviewed, this must be the play they both reviewed.
Action: Answer("E")
