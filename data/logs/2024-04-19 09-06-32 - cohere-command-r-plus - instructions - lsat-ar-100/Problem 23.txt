Context: Of the eight students—George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert—in a seminar, exactly six will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
Question: If Kyle gives the afternoon report on Tuesday, and Helen gives the afternoon report on Wednesday, which one of the following could be the list of the students who give the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively?
Choices:
  A: Irving, Lenore, and Nina

3. Determine the impact of Nina's report on the schedule and identify the students who must give reports on subsequent days. 
4. Fill in the gaps in the schedule with the remaining students. 
5. Ensure that the final schedule adheres to all conditions. 
6. Choose the answer choice that matches your deduced schedule.
## Assistant 2:
Reflection: I made a mistake in my previous reflection and answer attempt. I incorrectly assumed that Nina's report on Tuesday would automatically result in Helen and Irving giving reports on Wednesday. However, upon closer inspection, I realized that Nina could also present on Monday or Wednesday, which would affect the order of presentations by Helen and Irving. Therefore, I need to be more thorough in my analysis and consider all possible scenarios for Nina's report.

Action: Answer("C")
