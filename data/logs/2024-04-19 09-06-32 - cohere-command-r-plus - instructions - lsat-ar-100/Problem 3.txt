Topic: Law
Context: An administrator must assign parking spaces to six new employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young. Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
Question: If Robertson is assigned parking space #3, then which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Souza is assigned parking space #4.
  B: Togowa is assigned parking space #2.
  C: Vaughn is assigned parking space #5.
  D: Xu is assigned parking space #6.
  E: Young is assigned parking space #2.
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Assign Robertson parking space #3 as given.
2. Identify the conditions that must be satisfied regarding Young, Xu, and Souza in relation to Robertson's assigned space.
3. Deduce the possible assignments for Young, Xu, Souza, Togowa, and Vaughn based on these conditions and the available parking spaces.
4. Determine which of the answer options is a definite consequence of the given conditions and assignments.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Given that Robertson is assigned parking space #3, we can deduce the following:
- Young must be assigned a higher-numbered space than #3 since Robertson must be assigned a higher number than Young.
- Xu must also be assigned a higher number than Souza, and as Souza and Young must be below Robertson's space, Xu will be above.
- This leaves us with the following possibilities: Xu could be in space #4, #5, or #6. Young could then take #4 or #5 if Xu is not in #4.
- We cannot say for certain which spaces Togowa, Souza, Vaughn, or Xu are assigned as there are multiple combinations that would work.
- Therefore, the only statement that must be true is Answer C: Vaughn is assigned parking space #5. This is because, with Robertson in space #3 and Young in a higher space, there is only one space left that satisfies the conditions of being lower-numbered than Robertson's space and higher-numbered than Togowa's space.
Action: Answer("C")
