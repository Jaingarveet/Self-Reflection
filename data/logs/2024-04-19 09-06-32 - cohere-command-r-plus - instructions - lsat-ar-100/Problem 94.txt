Context: A shopping center has exactly seven spaces—space 1 through space 7—arranged in a straight row. Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
Question: If the veterinarian is in space 5, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: The optometrist is in space 2.
  B: The pharmacy is in space 7.

Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Understand the constraints and their implications: 
    - Pharmacy and veterinarian must be next to each other. 
    - Restaurants must be at opposite ends with at least two businesses between them. 
2. Identify the fixed positions: 
    - If the veterinarian is in space 5, the pharmacy must be in space 4. 
3. Determine the implications for restaurant placement: 
    - With the pharmacy in space 4, one restaurant must be at the opposite end (space 1 or 7) to ensure separation. 
4. Analyze the remaining options: 
    - Space 5: Veterinarian
    - Space 4: Pharmacy
    - Space 3, 2, or 1: Open for other businesses
    - Space 1 or 7: Restaurant
5. Conclude that a restaurant in space 4 fulfills all the constraints.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: If the veterinarian is in space 5, the pharmacy must be in space 4 (as they must be next to each other). This means that a restaurant must go in either space 1 or space 7 to ensure separation of at least two businesses between the restaurants. Therefore, the correct answer is that a restaurant must be in space 4.
