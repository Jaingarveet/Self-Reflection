Context: A realtor will show a prospective buyer seven houses—J, K, L, M, N, 0, and P—during a single day. The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning; the third, fourth, and fifth houses to be shown will be shown in the afternoon; the sixth and seventh houses to be shown will be shown in the evening. The houses will be shown according to the following rules: J must be shown in the evening. K cannot be shown in the morning. L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
Question: Which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: K is shown in the evening.
  B: L is shown in the afternoon.
  C: L is shown in the evening.
  D: M is shown in the morning.
  E: M is shown in the afternoon.

Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:
- Identify the given rules and constraints regarding the showing order of the houses. 
- Interpret the rules accurately, paying close attention to the specific requirements for each house. 
- Consider all the options for the showing times of J, K, and L, as they are interconnected. 
- Deduce the possible showing times for M based on the constraints imposed by L. 
- Evaluate each choice carefully, considering the must-be-true condition.
## Assistant 2:
Reflection: I missed that L must be shown between K and M, which gives a clearer structure to the order of viewings. L must be in the afternoon, as it cannot be in the morning (as K is shown then) or the evening (as J and possibly K are shown then). This means M cannot be shown in the morning or afternoon, so it must be in the evening.

Thought: We know that J is shown in the evening and K is shown in the morning. The key constraint is that L must be shown after K and before M. 

As K is shown in the morning, L must be shown in the afternoon or evening. If L is shown in the afternoon, M can be shown in the afternoon or evening. However, if L is shown in the evening, M must be shown in the evening, as there is only one remaining slot. 

Therefore, the only statement that must be true is that M is shown in the evening.
Action: Answer("E")
## Result:
Agent Answer: E
Correct Answer: B
