Context: An administrator must assign parking spaces to six new employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young. Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.

Choices:
  A: #1: Young; #2: Souza; #3: Vaughn; #4: Robertson; #5: Togowa; #6: Xu
  B: #1: Vaughn; #2: Togowa; #3: Young; #4: Souza; #5: Robertson; #6: Xu
  C: #1: Togowa; #2: Young; #3: Xu; #4: Robertson; #5: Souza; #6: Vaughn

## Assistant 2:
Thought: First, Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.

Young must have a higher number than Togowa, and Robertson must have a higher number than Young, so Young must be #3, #4, #5, or #6.

Xu must have a higher number than Souza, so Xu must be #4, #5, or #6, depending on the placement of Young.

Option A: This violates the condition that Robertson must be assigned a higher number than Young.

Option B: This violates the condition that Xu must be assigned a higher number than Souza.

Option C: This violates the conditions for both Robertson vs. Young and Xu vs. Souza.

Option D: This meets the conditions for Robertson vs. Young and Xu vs. Souza, and Togowa is also correctly placed relative to Young. All other employees' placements are permissible given the conditions.

Option E: This violates the condition that Xu must be assigned a higher number than Souza.

Therefore, the correct answer is option D.

Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: E
Score: 0
