## User 2:
Topic: Law
Context: An administrator must assign parking spaces to six new employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young. Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
Question: For how many of the six new employees is the assignment of a parking space limited to one of only two possible spaces?
Choices:
  A: none
  B: two
  C: three
  D: four
  E: five
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Identify the fixed starting point: Robertson must be assigned #1 to #4. 
2. Understand the conditions for Young, Xu, and Souza in relation to other employees' assignments. 
3. Consider the best-case scenario for Young, Xu, and Souza, where their options are most flexible. 
4. Count the number of employees with limited options.
## Assistant 2:
Reflection: I understand that Robertson has four options. Young, Xu, and Souza's parking spaces depend on other employees' assignments, so their options are limited. Togowa and Vaughn have all six options available, so they do not impact the answer.

Young must be assigned a higher number than Togowa, so Young has five options (#2 to #6). Xu must be higher than Souza, so Xu also has five options (#3 to #6), assuming Souza is assigned #2. Souza's options depend on Robertson's placement; if Robertson is assigned #2, then Souza has five options (#1 or #3 to #6), but if Robertson is in #3, then Souza is limited to two spaces (#1 or #2). 

The best-case scenario for the group is Robertson in space #2, limiting Souza to five options. So, there are three employees with limited options: Robertson, Young, and Xu.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
