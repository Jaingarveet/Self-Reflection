Context: During a recital, two pianists—Wayne and Zara—will perform solos. There will be five solos altogether, performed one immediately after another. Each solo will be either a modern piece or a traditional piece. The choice of pianist and type of piece for the solos must conform to the following conditions: The third solo is a traditional piece. Exactly two of the traditional pieces are performed consecutively. In the fourth solo, either Wayne performs a traditional piece or Zara performs a modern piece. The pianist who performs the second solo does not perform the fifth solo. No traditional piece is performed until Wayne performs at least one modem piece.
Question: What is the minimum number of solos in which Wayne performs a traditional piece?
Choices:
  A: zero
  B: one
  C: two
  D: three
  E: four
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let's analyze the conditions one by one:
1. The third solo is a traditional piece.
2. Exactly two of the traditional pieces are performed consecutively.
3. In the fourth solo, either Wayne performs a traditional piece or Zara performs a modern piece.
4. The pianist who performs the second solo does not perform the fifth solo.
5. No traditional piece is performed until Wayne performs at least one modern piece.
From condition 1, we know that the third solo is traditional.
From condition 2, we know that either the second and third solos or the third and fourth solos are traditional.
From condition 3, we know that if the third and fourth solos are traditional, then the fourth solo must be performed by Wayne.
From condition 4, we know that if the second and third solos are traditional, then the second solo must be performed by Zara.
From condition 5, we know that Wayne must perform at least one modern piece before the third solo.
Combining these conditions, we can see that the following scenarios are possible:
Scenario 1:
- Second solo: Zara (modern)
- Third solo: Traditional
- Fourth solo: Wayne (traditional)
- Fifth solo: Zara (modern)
Scenario 2:
- Second solo: Wayne (modern)
- Third solo: Traditional
- Fourth solo: Zara (modern)
- Fifth solo: Wayne (traditional)
In both scenarios, Wayne performs one traditional piece. Therefore, the minimum number of solos in which Wayne performs a traditional piece is one.
Action: Answer("B")

Agent Answer: B
