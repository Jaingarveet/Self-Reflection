Context: For the school paper, five students—Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, Megregian, and O'Neill—each review one or more of exactly three plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation, but do not review any other plays. The following conditions must apply: Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
Question: Which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Jiang reviews more of the plays than Lopez does.
  B: Megregian reviews more of the plays than Jiang does.
  C: Megregian reviews more of the plays than O'Neill does.
  D: O'Neill reviews more of the plays than Jiang does.
  E: O'Neill reviews more of the plays than Kramer does.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
- Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
- Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
- Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
- Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
Let's analyze the choices:
A: Jiang reviews more of the plays than Lopez does. This could be true, but we don't have enough information to confirm it. 
B: Megregian reviews more of the plays than Jiang does. This could be true, but we don't have enough information to confirm it. 
C: Megregian reviews more of the plays than O'Neill does. This could be true, but we don't have enough information to confirm it. 
D: O'Neill reviews more of the plays than Jiang does. This could be true, but we don't have enough information to confirm it. 
E: O'Neill reviews more of the plays than Kramer does. This MUST be true. Since Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, and exactly two students review the same plays, O'Neill must review at least one more play than Kramer.
Action: Answer("E")
## Result:
Agent Answer: E
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
