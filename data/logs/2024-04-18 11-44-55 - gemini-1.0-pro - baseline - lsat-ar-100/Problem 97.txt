The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
Therefore, the first batch of sugar cookies is made on Wednesday.
The third batch of sugar cookies is made on Friday.
Therefore, the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
The first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Monday.
Therefore, the third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Friday.
The first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday.
Therefore, the third batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Thursday.
The only option that is not possible is that two different kinds of cookie have their second batch made on Wednesday.
