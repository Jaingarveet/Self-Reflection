Context: On the first day of a two-day study for a cycling magazine, four riders—Reynaldo, Seamus, Theresa, and Yuki—will each test one of four bicycles—F, G, H, and J. Each rider will then test a different one of the bicycles on the second day. Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day. The assignment of riders to bicycles is subject to the following conditions: Reynaldo cannot test F. Yuki cannot test J. Theresa must be one of the testers for H. The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
Question: If Theresa tests G on the second day, then which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Reynaldo tests H on the first day.
  B: Reynaldo tests J on the first day.
  C: Theresa tests H on the second day.
  D: Theresa tests J on the first day.
  E: Yuki tests H on the second day.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let's analyze the given information step-by-step:
1. **Theresa tests G on the second day:** This means Theresa cannot test G on the first day.
2. **Theresa must be one of the testers for H:** Since Theresa cannot test G on the first day and H must be tested by someone on the first day, Theresa must test H on the first day.
3. **Yuki cannot test J:** This means Yuki cannot test J on either day.
4. **The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day:** Since Yuki cannot test J, and Seamus must test one of the remaining bicycles (F, G, or H) on the second day, Seamus must test the bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day.
Therefore, the following must be true:
* **Theresa tests H on the first day.**
* **Yuki tests the bicycle that Seamus tests on the second day.**
Since we don't know which bicycle Yuki tests on the first day, we cannot determine whether Reynaldo tests H or J on the first day.
Action: Answer("C")
