Context: Exactly eight books—F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O—are placed on a bookcase with exactly three shelves—the top shelf, the middle shelf, and the bottom shelf. At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.
Question: Which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: O is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf M is placed on.
  B: K is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf G is placed on.
  C: I is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf F is placed on.
  D: G is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf O is placed on.
  E: F is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf L is placed on.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
- I is placed on the middle shelf.
- More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
- At least two books are placed on each shelf.
- K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
- O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
- F is placed on the same shelf as M.
Based on these conditions, we can eliminate options A, B, and E:
- A: O is placed on a higher shelf than the shelf M is placed on. This is not necessarily true. O could be on the middle shelf with I, while M and F are on the bottom shelf.
- B: K is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf G is placed on. This is not necessarily true. K could be on the middle shelf with I, while G and F are on the bottom shelf.
- E: F is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf L is placed on. This is not necessarily true. F could be on the bottom shelf with M, while L is on the middle shelf with I.
Now, let's consider options C and D:
- C: I is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf F is placed on. This is true. Since I is on the middle shelf and F is on the bottom shelf, I is on a higher shelf than F.
- D: G is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf O is placed on. This is not necessarily true. G could be on the middle shelf with I, while O is on the top shelf.
Therefore, the only option that must be true is C: I is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf F is placed on.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
