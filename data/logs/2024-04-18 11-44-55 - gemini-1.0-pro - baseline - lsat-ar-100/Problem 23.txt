Topic: Law
Context: Of the eight students—George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert—in a seminar, exactly six will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
Question: If Kyle gives the afternoon report on Tuesday, and Helen gives the afternoon report on Wednesday, which one of the following could be the list of the students who give the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively?
Choices:
  A: Irving, Lenore, and Nina
  B: Lenore, George, and Irving
  C: Nina, Irving, and Lenore
  D: Robert, George, and Irving
  E: Robert, Irving, and Lenore
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
- Kyle gives the afternoon report on Tuesday.
- Helen gives the afternoon report on Wednesday.
- Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
- Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report.
- Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
Let's analyze the choices:
- A: Irving, Lenore, and Nina. This violates the condition that Helen and Irving must both give reports on the next day if Nina gives a report.
- B: Lenore, George, and Irving. This violates the condition that George can only give a report on Tuesday.
- C: Nina, Irving, and Lenore. This satisfies all the conditions. Nina gives a report on Monday, so Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday. George gives the morning report on Tuesday, and Kyle gives the afternoon report. Helen gives the afternoon report on Wednesday.
- D: Robert, George, and Irving. This violates the condition that neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
- E: Robert, Irving, and Lenore. This violates the condition that George can only give a report on Tuesday.
Action: Answer("C")
