Topic: Law
Context: Exactly eight books—F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O—are placed on a bookcase with exactly three shelves—the top shelf, the middle shelf, and the bottom shelf. At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.
Question: If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: F and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  B: G and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  C: H and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  D: I and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  E: K and O are placed on the same shelf as each other.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on.
This means that H is either on the bottom shelf or the middle shelf.
If H is on the bottom shelf, then L must be on the middle shelf.
If H is on the middle shelf, then L must be on the top shelf.
In either case, H and L cannot be on the same shelf.
Therefore, C is not true.
F is placed on the same shelf as M.
This means that F and M are either on the bottom shelf or the middle shelf.
If F and M are on the bottom shelf, then H cannot be on the bottom shelf.
If F and M are on the middle shelf, then H cannot be on the middle shelf.
Therefore, H cannot be on the same shelf as F or M.
Therefore, C is not true.
I is placed on the middle shelf.
This means that I cannot be on the same shelf as F or M.
Therefore, C is not true.
K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
This means that K is either on the middle shelf or the top shelf.
If K is on the middle shelf, then F cannot be on the middle shelf.
If K is on the top shelf, then F cannot be on the top shelf.
Therefore, F cannot be on the same shelf as K.
Therefore, C is not true.
O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
This means that O is either on the middle shelf or the top shelf.
If O is on the middle shelf, then L cannot be on the middle shelf.
If O is on the top shelf, then L cannot be on the top shelf.
Therefore, L cannot be on the same shelf as O.
Therefore, C is not true.
Therefore, none of the answer choices are true.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
