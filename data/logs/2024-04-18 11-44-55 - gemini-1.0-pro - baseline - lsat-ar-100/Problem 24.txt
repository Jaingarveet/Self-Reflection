Context: A government needs to assign new ambassadors to Venezuela, Yemen, and Zambia. The candidates for these ambassadorships are Jaramillo, Kayne, Landon, Novetzke, and Ong. One ambassador will be assigned to each country, and no ambassador will be assigned to more than one country. The assignment of the ambassadors must meet the following constraints: Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships. If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne. If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen. If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
Question: Which one of the following, if substituted for the constraint that if Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne, would have the same effect in determining the assignment of the ambassadors?
Choices:
  A: If Kayne is assigned to an ambassadorship, then so is Jaramillo.
  B: If Landon and Ong are both assigned to ambassadorships, then so is Novetzke.
  C: If Ong is not assigned to an ambassadorship, then Kayne is assigned to an ambassadorship.
  D: Jaramillo and Novetzke are not both assigned to ambassadorships.
  E: Novetzke and Ong are not both assigned to ambassadorships.
## Assistant 2:
## Analysis:
Let's analyze each option and see how it affects the assignment compared to the original constraint:
**A: If Kayne is assigned to an ambassadorship, then so is Jaramillo.**
This is the converse of the original constraint. While it seems similar, it's not the same. The original constraint restricts Jaramillo's assignment based on Kayne's, but this converse restricts Kayne's assignment based on Jaramillo's. This can lead to different outcomes. For example, if Jaramillo is assigned to Venezuela, the original constraint would require Kayne to be assigned as well. However, under this converse, Kayne could be assigned to any other country as long as Jaramillo is assigned somewhere. 
**B: If Landon and Ong are both assigned to ambassadorships, then so is Novetzke.**
This constraint is completely unrelated to the original constraint. It focuses on a different combination of candidates and doesn't influence the assignment of Jaramillo and Kayne.
**C: If Ong is not assigned to an ambassadorship, then Kayne is assigned to an ambassadorship.**
This constraint is the contrapositive of the original constraint. The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning it will have the same effect on the assignment. If Ong is not assigned, then the original constraint wouldn't restrict Kayne's assignment. Similarly, under this contrapositive, if Ong is not assigned, Kayne is free to be assigned to any country.
**D: Jaramillo and Novetzke are not both assigned to ambassadorships.**
This constraint is independent of the original constraint. It restricts the assignments of Jaramillo and Novetzke but doesn't influence whether Kayne needs to be assigned if Jaramillo is.
**E: Novetzke and Ong are not both assigned to ambassadorships.**
Similar to option D, this constraint focuses on a different pair of candidates and doesn't influence the relationship between Jaramillo and Kayne's assignments.
## Conclusion:
Therefore, the only option that has the same effect as the original constraint is **C: If Ong is not assigned to an ambassadorship, then Kayne is assigned to an ambassadorship.**
