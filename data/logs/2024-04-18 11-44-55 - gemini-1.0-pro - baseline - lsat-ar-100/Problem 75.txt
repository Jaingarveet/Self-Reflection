The following conditions must apply: Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.

## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
If Lopez reviews only Sunset, then Megregian must review both Tamerlane and Undulation.
If Kramer reviews only Sunset, then Megregian must review both Tamerlane and Undulation.
If O'Neill reviews only Sunset, then Megregian must review both Tamerlane and Undulation.
If Jiang reviews only Sunset, then Megregian must review both Tamerlane and Undulation.
If Megregian reviews only Sunset, then Kramer and Lopez must review both Tamerlane and Undulation.
Therefore, the only possible list of students who review only Sunset is Lopez.
