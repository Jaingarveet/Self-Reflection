Context: During a recital, two pianists—Wayne and Zara—will perform solos. There will be five solos altogether, performed one immediately after another. Each solo will be either a modern piece or a traditional piece. The choice of pianist and type of piece for the solos must conform to the following conditions: The third solo is a traditional piece. Exactly two of the traditional pieces are performed consecutively. In the fourth solo, either Wayne performs a traditional piece or Zara performs a modern piece. The pianist who performs the second solo does not perform the fifth solo. No traditional piece is performed until Wayne performs at least one modem piece.
Question: Which one of the following could be all of the solos that are traditional pieces?
Choices:
  A: the first, third, and fourth
  B: the second, third, and fourth
  C: the third and fourth
  D: the third and fifth
  E: the fourth and fifth

Let's analyze the conditions one by one:
1. The third solo is a traditional piece.
2. Exactly two of the traditional pieces are performed consecutively.
3. In the fourth solo, either Wayne performs a traditional piece or Zara performs a modern piece.
4. The pianist who performs the second solo does not perform the fifth solo.
5. No traditional piece is performed until Wayne performs at least one modern piece.
Let's start with the third condition. Since the third solo is traditional, and exactly two traditional pieces are performed consecutively, the fourth solo must also be traditional. This eliminates options A, B, and E.
Now, let's consider the fifth condition. Since no traditional piece is performed until Wayne performs at least one modern piece, and the fourth solo is traditional, Wayne must have performed a modern piece in the first or second solo. This eliminates option D.
Therefore, the only option that satisfies all the conditions is C: the third and fourth.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
