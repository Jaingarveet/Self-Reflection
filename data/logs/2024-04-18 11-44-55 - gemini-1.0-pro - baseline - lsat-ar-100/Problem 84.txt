C: G, H, K - This violates condition 4 as L and O are on the same shelf.
D: F, G, M, O - This violates condition 1 as only four books are on the bottom shelf.
E: G, H, L, M - This satisfies all conditions. G and H are on the top shelf, I is on the middle shelf, K and O are on the bottom shelf, and F and M are on the bottom shelf.
