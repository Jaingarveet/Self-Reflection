Context: An administrator must assign parking spaces to six new employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young. Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
Question: If Young is assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Togowa is assigned parking space #1.
  B: Young is assigned parking space #2.
  C: Robertson is assigned parking space #3.
  D: Souza is assigned parking space #3.
  E: Vaughn is assigned parking space #4.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
If Young is assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, then Souza cannot be assigned parking space #5 or #6.
If Young is assigned parking space #5 or #6, then Souza must be assigned parking space #4.
If Souza is assigned parking space #4, then Xu must be assigned parking space #3, #5, or #6.
If Xu is assigned parking space #3, then Togowa must be assigned parking space #1 or #2.
If Xu is assigned parking space #5 or #6, then Togowa must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
If Togowa is assigned parking space #1, then Robertson must be assigned parking space #2, #3, or #4.
If Togowa is assigned parking space #2, then Robertson must be assigned parking space #3 or #4.
If Togowa is assigned parking space #3 or #4, then Robertson must be assigned parking space #1 or #2.
Therefore, the only possible assignment that satisfies all the rules is:
Robertson: #1
Togowa: #2
Young: #3
Souza: #4
Xu: #5
Vaughn: #6
Action: Answer("C")
