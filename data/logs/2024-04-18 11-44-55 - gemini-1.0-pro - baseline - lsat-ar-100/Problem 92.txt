Context: A software company employs exactly seven sales representatives—Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall—to work in its three sales zones—Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3. Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Question: Quinn CANNOT work in the same sales zone as which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: Kim
  B: Mahr
  C: Stuckey
  D: Tiao
  E: Udall
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let's analyze the given information step-by-step:
1. **Zone 1:** Either Parra or Tiao works here, but not both.
2. **Zone 2:** Either Tiao or Udall works here, but not both.
3. **Zone 3:** More representatives work here than in Zone 2.
4. **Parra and Quinn:** Same sales zone.
5. **Stuckey and Udall:** Same sales zone.
Now, let's consider Quinn:
* **Zone 1:** If Parra is in Zone 1, then Tiao cannot be there. This leaves only Kim and Mahr for Zone 2, which contradicts the information that Zone 3 has more representatives than Zone 2. Therefore, Quinn cannot be in Zone 1.
* **Zone 2:** If Tiao is in Zone 2, then Udall cannot be there. This leaves only Kim and Mahr for Zone 1, which again contradicts the information about Zone 3. Therefore, Quinn cannot be in Zone 2.
* **Zone 3:** This is the only remaining option for Quinn.
Based on this analysis, Quinn cannot be in the same sales zone as either Kim or Mahr.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
