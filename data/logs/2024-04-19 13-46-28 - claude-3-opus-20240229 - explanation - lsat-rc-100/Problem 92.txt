Context: Many educators in Canada and the United States advocate multicultural education as a means of achieving multicultural understanding. There are, however, a variety of proposals as to what multicultural education should consist of. The most modest of these proposals holds that schools and colleges should promote multicultural understanding by teaching about other cultures, teaching which proceeds from within the context of the majority culture. Students should learn about other cultures, proponents claim, but examination of these cultures should operate with the methods, perspectives, and values of the majority culture. These values are typically those of liberalism: democracy, tolerance, and equality of persons. Critics of this first proposal have argued that genuine understanding of other cultures is impossible if the study of other cultures is refracted through the distorting lens of the majority culture's perspective. Not all cultures share liberal values. Their value systems have arisen in often radically different social and historical circumstances, and thus, these critics argue, cannot be understood and adequately appreciated if one insists on approaching them solely from within the majority culture's perspective. In response to this objection, a second version of multicultural education has developed that differs from the first in holding that multicultural education ought to adopt a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures. The values of one culture should not be standards by which others are judged; each culture should be taken on its own terms. However, the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in this second version of multicultural education are still identifiably Western. They are the methods of anthropology, social psychology, political science, and sociology. They are, that is, methods which derive from the Western scientific perspective and heritage. Critics of this second form of multicultural education argue as follows: The Western scientific heritage is founded upon an epistemological system that prizes the objective over the subjective, the logical over the intuitive, and the empirically verifiable over the mystical. The methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are thus already value laden; the choice to examine and understand other cultures by these methods involves a commitment to certain values such as objectivity. Thus, the second version of multicultural education is not essentially different from the first. Scientific discourse has a privileged place in Western cultures, but the discourses of myth, tradition, religion, and mystical insight are often the dominant forms of thought and language of non-Western cultures. To insist on trying to understand nonscientific cultures by the methods of Western science is not only distorting, but is also an expression of an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism: the chauvinism of science. According to this objection, it is only by adopting the (often nonscientific) perspectives and methods of the cultures studied that real understanding can be achieved.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would provide the strongest objection to the criticism in the passage of the second version of multicultural education?
Choices:
  A: It is impossible to adopt the perspectives and methods of a culture unless one is a member of that culture.
  B: Many non-Western societies have value systems that are very similar to one another.
  C: Some non-Western societies use their own value system when studying cultures that have different values.
  D: Students in Western societies cannot understand their culture's achievements unless such achievements are treated as the subject of Western scientific investigations.
  E: Genuine understanding of another culture is necessary for adequately appreciating that culture.

Explanation:
I incorrectly chose answer choice [REDACTED] as the strongest objection to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education. While [REDACTED] points out that some non-Western societies also use their own methods to study other cultures, it does not directly address the key point of the criticism - that using external methods prevents genuine understanding. Answer choice [REDACTED], on the other hand, directly challenges the criticism's claim that real understanding requires adopting the internal perspectives of the studied culture.
## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
The key points of the criticism of the second version of multicultural education are:
1) The Western scientific methods used are value-laden and distorting when applied to non-Western cultures. 
2) Real understanding requires adopting the internal, often non-scientific perspectives of the cultures being studied.
To provide the strongest objection, we need to find a choice that undermines one or both of these points.
Choice A says it's impossible to truly adopt another culture's perspectives unless you are a member of that culture. However, this actually seems to support the criticism rather than object to it. 
Choice B notes similarities between many non-Western value systems. But this is tangential and doesn't address the core of the criticism about methodology.
Choice C says some non-Western societies use their own values to study other cultures. This somewhat parallels the criticism, but doesn't directly refute the key claim that external methods prevent genuine understanding.
Choice D is about Western students understanding their own culture's achievements through a scientific lens. This seems unrelated to the specific criticism being made.
Choice E states that genuine understanding is necessary to appreciate another culture. This aligns with and supports the criticism rather than objecting to it.
After analyzing each choice, A seems to provide the strongest counter to the criticism. If it is in fact impossible for outsiders to truly adopt another culture's perspectives, then the criticism's proposed solution of using internal viewpoints is untenable. This strikes at a core premise of the argument.
