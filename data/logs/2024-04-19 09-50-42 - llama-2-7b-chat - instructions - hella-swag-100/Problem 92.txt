## Assistant 2:
  Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand that I need to pay closer attention to the text and the actions of the young man in the video. Based on the information provided, the young man is trying to solve a Rubik's cube, and he is seen speaking to the camera. The most likely completion to the text is that the young man will continue solving the Rubik's cube alone (B). This is because the text does not mention any other people helping him, and the young man is seen speaking to the camera, indicating that he is trying to solve the puzzle on his own.
