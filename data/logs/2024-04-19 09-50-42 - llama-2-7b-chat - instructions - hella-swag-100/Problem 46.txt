  Topic: Common Sense
Subtopic: Spread mulch
Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
A man dumps a wheelbarrow of mulch on the lawn. He rakes it out over the ground. He [REDACTED]
Choices:
A: rakes up dirt over the mulch.
B: uses a leaf blower to blow it around.
C: brings another wheelbarrow full of mulch and rakes it out over the lawn.
D: scoops out a puddle with the rake.

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I realized that I misunderstood the situation. The correct answer is (C) brings another wheelbarrow full of mulch and rakes it out over the lawn. This is because the text states that the man rakes the mulch out over the ground, indicating that he is adding more mulch to the lawn, not removing dirt or blowing it around.

In my previous answer, I misunderstood the context of the situation and selected (A) rakes up dirt over the mulch. This was incorrect because the text does not mention anything about raking up dirt, and the man is actively adding mulch to the lawn.

To avoid making the same mistake again, I will carefully read the text and consider the context of the situation before answering the question.
## Result:
Agent Answer: None
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
