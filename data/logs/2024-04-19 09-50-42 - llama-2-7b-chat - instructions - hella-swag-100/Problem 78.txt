Passage:

Reflection:
In my previous answer, I chose option (C) You don't want to risk being stuck somewhere without the skin care items you need. However, upon reflection, I realize that this answer is not the best completion to the text. The passage mentions packing the basic products you use every day, which suggests that it is important to bring your usual hygiene products, such as toothbrush, toothpaste, antiperspirant, sunscreen, moisturizer, and SPF. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) Since traveling can get expensive, some drug stores sell makeup and toiletry bags. You don't necessarily need to purchase waterproof brushes, but you do need a cleansing cloth.

Error Keywords:

* Risk
* Stuck

Patterns or areas for improvement:
I tend to be overly cautious in my previous answer, and I should have been more focused on the practicality of packing the basic products.

In conclusion, the correct answer is (B) Since traveling can get expensive, some drug stores sell makeup and toiletry bags.
