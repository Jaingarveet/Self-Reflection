## User 2:
Topic: Science
Question: Using nonrenewable resources for energy produces waste products that can have long-term, negative effects on Earth's subsystems. Which energy source produces waste products that can have these effects for the longest amount of time?
Choices:
  A: natural gas
  B: uranium
  C: crude oil
  D: coal
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
All of the listed energy sources are nonrenewable and produce waste products that can have long-term, negative effects on Earth's subsystems.
However, the waste products from nuclear power plants, which use uranium as fuel, have the longest-lasting negative effects. This is because nuclear waste remains radioactive for thousands of years and requires special handling and storage to prevent environmental contamination.
Action: Answer("B")
