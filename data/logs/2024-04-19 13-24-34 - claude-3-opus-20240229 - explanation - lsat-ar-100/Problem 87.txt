Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I focused too much on trying to construct a specific scenario that satisfied all the constraints, rather than analyzing what must be true in all possible valid scenarios. By doing so, I overlooked that regardless of the specific works chosen, the organizer must always select at least [REDACTED] to satisfy the requirement that at least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected.
## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The organizer must select at least 5 works total.
2. At least 3 but no more than 4 novels must be selected. This leaves room for 1-2 plays.
3. No more than 4 French works can be selected. So there must be at least 1 Russian work.
4. The key constraint is: "At least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected." 
5. If 0 Russian novels are selected, at least 0 French novels must be selected.
   If 1 Russian novel is selected, at least 1 French novel must be selected. 
   If 2 Russian novels are selected, at least 2 French novels must be selected.
6. Since there are only 3 Russian novels total, the maximum number of Russian novels that could be selected is 3. But in that case, 4 novels would be selected (3 Russian + at least 1 French), violating the "no more than 4 novels" constraint.
7. Therefore, at most 2 Russian novels can be selected. And if 2 Russian novels are selected, then exactly 2 French novels must be selected to satisfy the "at least as many French novels as Russian novels" constraint.
8. In all valid scenarios, regardless of the specific works chosen, the organizer must select at least 2 French novels to ensure there are at least as many French novels as Russian novels.
Action: Answer("D")
