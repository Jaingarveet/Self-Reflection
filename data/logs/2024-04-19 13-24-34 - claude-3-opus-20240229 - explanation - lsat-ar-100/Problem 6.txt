Context: For the school paper, five students—Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, Megregian, and O'Neill—each review one or more of exactly three plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation, but do not review any other plays. The following conditions must apply: Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.

  A: Jiang reviews more of the plays than Lopez does.
  B: Megregian reviews more of the plays than Jiang does.

Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I focused too much on the information given about specific students and plays, and failed to consider the implications of the total number of plays. There are only three plays in total, so Megregian reviewing at least 2 plays necessarily means he reviews more plays than Jiang.
## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. There are only 3 plays total: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation.
2. Kramer and Lopez each review fewer plays than Megregian. So Megregian must review at least 2 plays.
3. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. This means the play(s) Jiang reviews must be different from the ones Megregian reviews.
4. Since there are only 3 plays total, and Megregian reviews at least 2 of them, Jiang can review at most 1 play. 
5. Therefore, Megregian must review more plays than Jiang.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
