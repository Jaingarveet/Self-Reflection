## User 2:
Topic: Law
Context: An administrator must assign parking spaces to six new employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young. Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
Question: If Robertson is assigned parking space #3, then which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Souza is assigned parking space #4.
  B: Togowa is assigned parking space #2.
  C: Vaughn is assigned parking space #5.
  D: Xu is assigned parking space #6.
  E: Young is assigned parking space #2.

Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I made an error in my logical reasoning. I correctly determined that Young must be in space #1 or #2, and that Togowa must be in the other of those two spaces. However, I then incorrectly focused on the relationship between Xu and Souza, ignoring the key fact that Robertson was assigned space #3. Since Robertson is in space #3, and Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered space than Young, Young must be assigned space #2 (since #1 is the only lower number than #3), and Togowa must therefore be assigned space #1.
## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. Robertson is assigned parking space #3. This is given in the question.
2. One rule states that Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. 
3. Since Robertson is in space #3, Young must be in either space #1 or #2 to satisfy this rule.
4. Another rule states that Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. 
5. Since Young is in either space #1 or #2, Togowa must be in the other of these two spaces to satisfy this rule.
6. If Young is in space #2, then Togowa must be in space #1. This is the only arrangement that satisfies both rules involving Young and Togowa, given that Robertson is in space #3.
Therefore, if Robertson is assigned parking space #3, then Young must be assigned parking space #2.
Action: Answer("E")
