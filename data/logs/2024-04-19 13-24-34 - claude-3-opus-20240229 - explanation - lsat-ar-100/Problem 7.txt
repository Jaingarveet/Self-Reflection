Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I made an error in my reasoning. I incorrectly concluded that the scenario was impossible if Jackson was the only witness on Monday. However, it is possible to schedule the other witnesses to meet all the conditions.
## Assistant 2:
You're right, I made an error in my previous reasoning. Let's think through this step-by-step to determine the correct answer.
Given:
- Iturbe testifies on Wednesday
- Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday
- Hong does not testify on Monday
- Jackson is the only witness scheduled to testify on Monday
If Jackson testifies alone on Monday, that leaves Franco, Garcia, Hong and Iturbe to be scheduled on Tuesday and Wednesday.
We know Iturbe must testify on Wednesday. That leaves Franco, Garcia and Hong for the two Tuesday slots.
The conditions state that Franco and Garcia cannot testify on the same day. So if two of Franco, Garcia and Hong are scheduled on Tuesday, it must be Hong plus either Franco or Garcia. 
The remaining witness out of Franco and Garcia would then be scheduled on Wednesday with Iturbe.
Therefore, the correct statement is:
Action: Answer("B")
Hong must be one of the two witnesses scheduled to testify on Tuesday, since Franco and Garcia cannot be scheduled together.
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
