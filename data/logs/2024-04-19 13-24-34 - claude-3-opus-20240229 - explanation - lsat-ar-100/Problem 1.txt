Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Law
Context: Exactly five witnesses—Franco, Garcia, Hong, Iturbe, and Jackson—are to be scheduled to testify at a hearing that is to take exactly three days of one week—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Each witness testifies on exactly one day of the hearing. The schedule must meet the following conditions: Franco does not testify on the same day that Garcia testifies. Iturbe testifies on Wednesday. Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday. Hong does not testify on Monday. At least one witness testifies on Monday.
Question: Which one of the following CANNOT be true of the schedule?
Choices:
  A: Franco is the only witness scheduled to testify on Monday.
  B: Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Iturbe.
  C: Garcia and Hong are both scheduled to testify on Tuesday.
  D: Garcia is the only witness scheduled to testify on Monday and Hong is one of two witnesses scheduled to testify on Wednesday.
  E: Jackson is scheduled to testify on Tuesday and two witnesses are scheduled to testify on Monday.
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I incorrectly determined that choice [REDACTED] was possible, but it actually violates the conditions. I failed to consider that if Jackson testifies on Tuesday, and two witnesses testify on Monday, then the condition that exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday would be violated.
## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. Iturbe must testify on Wednesday. This is a fixed condition.
2. Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday. This is also a fixed condition.
3. At least one witness testifies on Monday. So Monday cannot be empty.
4. Hong does not testify on Monday. 
5. Franco and Garcia cannot testify on the same day.
Now let's look at each choice:
A. Franco being the only witness on Monday is possible. It satisfies all conditions.
B. Franco testifying the same day as Iturbe (Wednesday) is possible. It satisfies all conditions.
C. Garcia and Hong both testifying Tuesday is possible. It would satisfy the "exactly two on Tuesday" condition.
D. Garcia being the only witness Monday, with Hong being one of two on Wednesday is possible. It satisfies all conditions.
E. If Jackson testifies Tuesday, and two testify Monday, that would mean 3 testify Tuesday (Jackson + the required two). This violates the "exactly two on Tuesday" condition.
Therefore, E is the only choice that CANNOT be true.
Action: Answer("E")
## Result:
Agent Answer: E
Correct Answer: E
Score: 1
