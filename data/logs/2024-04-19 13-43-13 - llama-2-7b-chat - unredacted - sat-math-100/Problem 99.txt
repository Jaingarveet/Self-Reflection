## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: $$f(x)=\frac{x+3}{2}$$For the function $f$ defined above, what is the value of $f(-1)$ ?
Choices:
  A: -2
  B: -1
  C: 1
  D: 2
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I made a mistake in my answer. I incorrectly identified the value of $f(-1)$.

The correct calculation is:

$$f(-1) = \frac{-1 + 3}{2} = \frac{-4}{2} = -2$$

So, the correct answer is (C) $f(-1) = -2$.

Error Keywords:

* Plugging in incorrect values
* Miscalculation
* Error in simplification

Solution:

To find the value of $f(-1)$, we need to plug $-1$ into the formula for $f(x)$:

$$f(-1) = \frac{-1 + 3}{2}$$

Step-by-step calculation:

1. Subtract $3$ from $-1$ to get $2$.
2. Divide by $2$ to simplify the fraction.

Therefore, $f(-1) = -2$.

Instructions:

1. Identify the function $f(x)$ and its formula.
2. Plug in the value $-1$ into the formula for $f(x)$.
3. Simplify the fraction and calculate the result.
4. Double-check your calculation to ensure accuracy.
5. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.

Advice:

* Always check your work by plugging in different values and verifying the results.
* Be careful when simplifying fractions, as small mistakes can lead to incorrect answers.
* Make sure to read the question carefully and understand what is being asked.
