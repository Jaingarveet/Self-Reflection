## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

  D: 66
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I correctly identified the formula for the volume of a right circular cylinder (V = πr^2h) and applied it to the problem. However, I made an error in my calculation.

Error Keywords:

* Calculation error
* Formula application error
* Radius miscalculation

Solution:
The volume of the first cylinder is 22 cubic centimeters.
The radius of the first cylinder is twice the radius of the second cylinder, so the radius of the second cylinder is 1/2 of the radius of the first cylinder.
The height of the first cylinder is half the height of the second cylinder, so the height of the second cylinder is 2 times the height of the first cylinder.
Using the formula V = πr^2h, we can calculate the volume of the second cylinder as follows:
V = π(1/2)^2 \* 2h = π \* 1/4 \* 2 \* 22 = 44 cubic centimeters

Instructions:

1. Identify the formula for the volume of a right circular cylinder.
2. Apply the formula to the problem, using the given information.
3. Calculate the volume of the second cylinder using the formula and the given information.
4. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
5. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:

* Always use the correct formula for the problem, and apply it correctly.
* Always calculate each subproblem step-by-step, and double-check your calculations.
* Always use the correct units for the problem, and make sure they are consistent throughout the calculation.
* Always read the question carefully and understand the problem before starting the calculation.
