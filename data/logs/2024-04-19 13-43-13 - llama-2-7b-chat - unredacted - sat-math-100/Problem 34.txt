Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Great job! You correctly solved the problem step by step. Here's a breakdown of your thought process:

1. You recognized that the book was on sale for $40\%$ off its original price.
2. You calculated the discount by multiplying the sale price by the discount percentage ($0.40$ in this case).
3. You used the discount to find the original price of the book by multiplying the sale price by the inverse of the discount percentage ($1 - $0.40$ in this case).
4. You arrived at the correct answer, $10.80$, by simplifying the calculation.

Excellent work! Here are some tips to help you solve similar problems in the future:

1. Always read the question carefully and identify the key information. In this case, the question told you that the book was on sale for $40\%$ off its original price.
2. Break down complex problems into smaller, manageable steps. This helps you avoid getting overwhelmed and ensures that you don't miss any important calculations.
3. Use visual aids, such as diagrams or mental calculations, to help you solve problems. This can make the calculation process more intuitive and easier to understand.
4. Double-check your calculations to ensure that they are correct. In this case, you correctly calculated the discount and used it to find the original price of the book.
5. Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them. This is an important concept to keep in mind when solving multiplication problems.

Great job on this problem, and keep practicing to improve your math skills!
