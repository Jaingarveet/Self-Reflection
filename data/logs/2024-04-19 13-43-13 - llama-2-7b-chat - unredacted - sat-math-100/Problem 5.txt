## Assistant 2:
  Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, selecting choice (A) $30x=2$. However, upon further reflection, I realized that the correct answer is choice (B) $2x=30$.

Explanation:
The problem states that the number of states that joined the United States between 1776 and 1849 is twice the number of states that joined between 1850 and 1900. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

Number of states that joined between 1776 and 1849 = 2 x Number of states that joined between 1850 and 1900

Rearranging the equation, we get:

Number of states that joined between 1850 and 1900 = Number of states that joined between 1776 and 1849 / 2

So, the correct equation is:

2x = 30

Solving for x, we get:

x = 30 / 2 = 15

Therefore, the correct answer is choice (B) $2x=30$.
## Result:
Agent Answer: None
Correct Answer: B
