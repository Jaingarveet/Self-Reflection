## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Context: \begin{center}.\begin{tabular}{|l|c|}.\hline.\multicolumn{1}{|c|}{Planet} & Acceleration due to gravity $\left(\frac{\mathrm{m}}{\mathrm{sec}^{2}}\right)$ \\.\hline\hline.Mercury & 3.6 \\.\hline.Venus & 8.9 \\.\hline.Earth & 9.8 \\.\hline.Mars & 3.8 \\.\hline.Jupiter & 26.0 \\.\hline.Saturn & 11.1 \\.\hline.Uranus & 10.7 \\.\hline.Neptune & 14.1 \\.\hline.\end{tabular}.\end{center}.The chart above shows approximations of the acceleration due to gravity in meters per.second squared $\left(\frac{\mathrm{m}}{\sec ^{2}}\right)$ for the eight planets in our solar system. The weight of an object on a given planet can be found by using the formula $W=m g$, where $W$ is the weight of the object measured in newtons, $m$ is the mass of the object measured in kilograms, and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity on the planet measured in $\frac{m}{\sec ^{2}}$
Question: An object on Earth has a weight of 150 newtons. On which planet would the same object have an approximate weight of 170 newtons?
Choices:
  A: Venus
  B: Saturn
  C: Uranus
  D: Neptune

You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.

Explanation:
You are correct that the weight of an object on a planet can be found using the formula $W = mg$, where $W$ is the weight of the object measured in newtons, $m$ is the mass of the object measured in kilograms, and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity on the planet measured in $\frac{m}{\sec ^{2}}$.

However, in this problem, you made an error in your calculation. You calculated the weight of the object on Earth as $150 \times 9.8$ m/s$^2$, which is incorrect. The acceleration due to gravity on Earth is actually 9.8 m/s$^2$, not 9.8 $\frac{m}{\sec ^{2}}$.

So, the weight of the object on Earth would be $150 \times 9.8$ N/kg, not $150 \times 9.8$ m/s$^2$.

Now, let's solve the problem again:

The object has a weight of 150 newtons on Earth. We want to find the planet where the object would have an approximate weight of 170 newtons.

From the table, we can see that the acceleration due to gravity on Venus is 8.9 m/s$^2$. So, the weight of the object on Venus would be:

$W = mg$
$= 150$ N
$= 150 \times 8.9$ m/s$^2$
$= 1365$ N/kg

Since the weight of the object on Venus is closer to 170 newtons than any other planet, the answer is (B) Venus.

Advice:

* Always check your calculations carefully, especially when working with units.
* Make sure you understand the units of each quantity and how they are related.
* Use the correct formula for the problem, and make sure you are using the correct units for each quantity.
* Double-check your work to ensure accuracy.
