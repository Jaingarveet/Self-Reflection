## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Explanation:

The given equation is $\sqrt{4x} = x - 3$. To solve for the values of $x$ that satisfy this equation, we need to isolate the variable $x$.

I. $x = 4$

So, $x - 3 = 4 - 3 = 1$

Therefore, the value of $x$ that satisfies the equation is $x = 4$.

II. $x = 9$

So, $\sqrt{4x} = \sqrt{4(9)} = 9 - 3 = 6$

Therefore, the value of $x$ that satisfies the equation is $x = 9$.

Action: Answer("B")

Correct Answer: B

Explanation of the Correct Answer:

The correct answer is (B) because the equation $\sqrt{4x} = x - 3$ can be solved for $x$ in two ways: $x = 4$ and $x = 9$. Therefore, the values of $x$ that satisfy the equation are $x = 4$ and $x = 9$.
