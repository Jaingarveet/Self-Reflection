## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

  D: 16
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
You are correct in your thought process and answer choice. Well done!

To break it down, you correctly simplified the equation by combining like terms, which gave you a quadratic equation:

$$\frac{24 x^2 + 25 x - 47}{a} = -8x - 3 - \frac{53}{a}$$

You then identified the solutions to the quadratic equation, which are $x = -3$ and $x = 2$. Since the equation is true for all values of $x$ except when $x = \frac{2}{a}$, we can conclude that $a$ must be a non-zero integer.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) $a = -3$.

Well done!

Here are some general tips to help you with similar problems in the future:

1. Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
2. Break down the equation into simpler terms and identify the variables and constants involved.
3. Use algebraic manipulation to simplify the equation and identify the solutions.
4. Check your solutions by plugging them back into the original equation.
5. Double-check your work by verifying that the equation is true for all values of the variable except when it is equal to the specified value.

Remember, practice makes perfect! Keep practicing and you will become more confident and proficient in solving math problems.
