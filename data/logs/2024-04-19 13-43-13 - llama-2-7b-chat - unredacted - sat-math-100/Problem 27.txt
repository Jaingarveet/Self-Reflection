You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I made a mistake in my reasoning and calculation. I incorrectly set up the equation and arrived at the wrong solution.

Error Keywords:

* Misunderstanding the problem
* Incorrect equation setup
* Calculation error

Solution:
The correct equation is:

$16 + 4x = 14 + 10$

Simplifying the equation:

$4x = 30$

Dividing both sides by $4$:

$x = 7$

Therefore, the value of $8x$ is $56$.

Instructions:

1. Read the problem carefully and understand the given information.
2. Set up the equation based on the given information.
3. Simplify and solve the equation.
4. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
5. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.

Advice:

* Always read the problem carefully and understand the given information.
* Take your time to set up the equation correctly.
* Simplify the equation as much as possible before solving.
* Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
* Use the correct mathematical operations (e.g., multiplication, division) for the given problem.
