Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Context: $$.\begin{aligned}.& S(P)=\frac{1}{2} P+40 \\.& D(P)=220-P.\end{aligned}.$$.The quantity of a product supplied and the quantity of the product demanded in an economic market are functions of the price of the product. The functions above are the estimated supply and demand functions for a certain product. The function $S(P)$ gives the quantity of the product supplied to the market when the price is $P$ dollars, and the function $D(P)$ gives the quantity of the product demanded by the market when the price is $P$ dollars.
Question: Graphene, which is used in the manufacture of integrated circuits, is so thin that a sheet weighing one ounce can cover up to 7 football fields. If a football field has an area of approximately $1 \frac{1}{3}$ acres, about how many acres could 48 ounces of graphene cover?
Choices:
  A: 250
  B: 350
  C: 450
  D: 1,350

I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand the mistake. The correct answer is (C) 450 acres.

To arrive at this answer, we need to use the information provided in the problem. The area of a football field is approximately $1 \frac{1}{3}$ acres, and we know that a sheet of graphene weighing one ounce can cover up to 7 football fields. Therefore, we can calculate the area covered by 48 ounces of graphene as follows:

$ \text {Area covered by 48 ounces of graphene} = \text {Area of one football field} \times \text {Number of football fields covered by 1 ounce of graphene} $

$ \text {Area of one football field} = \frac{1}{3} \text {acres} $

$ \text {Number of football fields covered by 1 ounce of graphene} = 7 $

Now, we can plug in the values to get the area covered by 48 ounces of graphene:

$ \text {Area covered by 48 ounces of graphene} = \frac{1}{3} \text {acres} \times 7 = \frac{21}{3} \text {acres} $

Finally, we can convert the area to acres by dividing by 40 (since there are 40 acres in one acre):

$ \text {Area covered by 48 ounces of graphene} = \frac{21}{3} \text {acres} \div 40 = 52.5 \text {acres} $

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 450 acres.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.
