## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: \begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}\cline { 2 - 3 }\multicolumn{1}{c|}{} & \multicolumn{2}{c|}{Handedness} \\\hlineGender & Left & Right \\\hline\hlineFemale &  &  \\\hlineMale &  &  \\\hline\hlineTotal & 18 & 122 \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}The incomplete table above summarizes the number of left-handed students and right-handed students by gender for the eighth-grade students atKeisel Middle School. There are 5 times as many right-handed female students as there are left-handed female students, and there are 9 times as many right-handed male students as there are left-handed male students. If there is a total of 18 left-handed students and 122 right-handed students in the school, which of the following is closest to the probability that a right-handed student selected at random is female? (Note: Assume that none of the eighth-grade students are both right-handed and left-handed.)
Choices:
  A: 0.410
  B: 0.357
  C: 0.333
  D: 0.250
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Great, let's break down the solution step by step:

1. From the table, we can see that there are 18 left-handed students and 122 right-handed students in the school.
2. We are asked to find the probability that a right-handed student selected at random is female.
3. Let's use the information given in the problem to find the number of female right-handed students:

Female right-handed students = 122 - 18 = 104
4. Now, we can find the probability of a right-handed student being female:

Probability of a right-handed student being female = Number of female right-handed students / Total number of right-handed students
= 104 / 122
= 0.86
5. So, the closest answer is (B): 0.357.

Action: Answer("B")

Great, let's review the steps and key points:

* Identified the information given in the problem: number of left-handed and right-handed students by gender.
* Used the information to find the number of female right-handed students.
* Calculated the probability of a right-handed student being female.
* Compared the calculated probability to the choices given in the question.
* Chose the closest answer: (B): 0.357.

By following these steps and using the information given in the problem, we can solve the problem accurately. Remember to always read the question carefully, identify the relevant information, and use logical reasoning to find the solution.
