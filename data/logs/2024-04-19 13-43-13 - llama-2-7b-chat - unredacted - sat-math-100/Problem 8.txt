Question: Alma bought a laptop computer at a store that gave a 20 percent discount off its original price. The total amount she paid to the cashier was $p$ dollars, including an 8 percent sales tax on the discounted price. Which of the following represents the original price of the computer in terms of $p$ ?
Choices:
  A: $0.88 p$
  B: $\frac{p}{0.88}$
  C: $(0.8)(1.08) p$
  D: $\frac{p}{(0.8)(1.08)}$
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
You are correct that the original price of the laptop computer in terms of $p$ is:

Original price = $p / $0.88
= $p / (0.88)
= B: $\frac{p}{0.88}$

However, the correct answer is (D): $\frac{p}{(0.8)(1.08)}$.

Here's why:

The problem states that the total amount Alma paid to the cashier is $p$, including an 8% sales tax on the discounted price. The discounted price is given as $0.80p$, which means the original price of the laptop computer was:

Original price = $0.80p / 0.80
= $p / (0.80)
= D: $\frac{p}{(0.8)(1.08)}$

So, the correct answer is (D): $\frac{p}{(0.8)(1.08)}$.

I apologize for the mistake in my previous response. Thank you for pointing it out!

I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand why. I made a mistake in my calculation of the original price of the laptop computer. Thank you for pointing out the error.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to find the original price of the laptop computer in terms of $p$. We know that the total amount Alma paid to the cashier is $p$, including an 8% sales tax on the discounted price. The discounted price is given as $0.80p$, which means the original price of the laptop computer was:

Original price = $0.80p / 0.80
= $p / (0.80)
= D: $\frac{p}{(0.8)(1.08)}$

So, the correct answer is (D): $\frac{p}{(0.8)(1.08)}$.

I apologize for any confusion caused by my previous mistake. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to reflect on the problem and correct my answer.
