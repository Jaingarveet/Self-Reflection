## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: $$\begin{aligned}& 3 x^{2}-5 x+2 \\& 5 x^{2}-2 x-6\end{aligned}$$Which of the following is the sum of the two polynomials shown above?
Choices:
  A: $8 x^{2}-7 x-4$
  B: $8 x^{2}+7 x-4$
  C: $8 x^{4}-7 x^{2}-4$
  D: $8 x^{4}+7 x^{2}-4$
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I made a mistake in my answer by selecting option B, which is not the correct sum of the two polynomials.

The correct answer is option A, $8 x^{2}-7 x-4$.

Here's why:

When adding the like terms of the two polynomials, we need to combine the identical terms, which are the terms that have the same degree (or power) and the same variable. In this case, the like terms are $x^2$ and $x^2$.

So, we can add the two $x^2$ terms to get:

$3 x^{2}-5 x+2 + 5 x^{2}-2 x-6 = 8 x^{2}-7 x-4$

Therefore, the correct answer is option A, $8 x^{2}-7 x-4$.

Error Keywords:

* Like terms
* Degree (or power)
* Variable

Instructions:

1. Identify the like terms of the two polynomials.
2. Add the like terms by combining them.
3. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.
4. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
5. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.

Advice:

* Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
* Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
* Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
* Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
* Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
* Remember that like terms are terms that have the same degree (or power) and the same variable.
