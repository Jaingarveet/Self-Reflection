## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: Which of the following is equivalent to $9^{\frac{3}{4}}$ ?
Choices:
  A: $\sqrt[3]{9}$
  B: $\sqrt[4]{9}$
  C: $\sqrt{3}$
  D: $3 \sqrt{3}$
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I made a mistake in my answer by selecting option A, which is not equivalent to $9^{\frac{3}{4}}$.

The correct answer is option D, $3 \sqrt{3}$.

Here's why:

$9^{\frac{3}{4}} = 9 \times \sqrt[4]{9} = 9 \times \sqrt{3} \times 3 = 3 \sqrt{3}$

So, the equivalent of $9^{\frac{3}{4}}$ is $3 \sqrt{3}$.

Error Keywords:

* Misunderstanding the problem
* Confusion with exponents
* Incorrect calculation

Solution:

To find the equivalent of $9^{\frac{3}{4}}$, we need to find the number that has the same power of 9 as $9^{\frac{3}{4}}$. In this case, the power of 9 is 3/4, which means we need to find a number that has a power of 3/4.

The correct calculation is:

$9^{\frac{3}{4}} = 9 \times \sqrt[4]{9} = 9 \times \sqrt{3} \times 3 = 3 \sqrt{3}$

So, the equivalent of $9^{\frac{3}{4}}$ is $3 \sqrt{3}$.

Instructions:

1. Read the problem carefully and understand the question.
2. Identify the power of the number in the question.
3. Find the number that has the same power as the number in the question.
4. Calculate the equivalent of the number in the question using the correct formula.
5. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
6. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.

Advice:

* Always read the question carefully and understand the problem before answering.
* Always decompose complex problems into smaller, manageable subproblems.
* Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
* Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
* Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
* Remember that the power of a number is the result of raising it to that power, not the result of adding it to itself.
