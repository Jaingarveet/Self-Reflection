## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

## Assistant 2:
  Thought: I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I realize that I made a mistake in my calculation. I will reflect on the problem, my solution, and the correct answer to ensure that I provide the correct response this time.

The model given in the question is:

$$h = 3a + 28.6$$

To find the increase in height each year, we need to find the derivative of the function with respect to age.

$$\frac{d}{da} (3a + 28.6) = 3$$

So, the estimated increase in height each year is $3$ inches.

Action: Answer("B") $5.7$ inches.
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
