# Model: llama-2-7b-chat | Agent: unredacted | Exam: sat-math-100 | Problem 87 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: In the $x y$-plane, the parabola with equation $y=(x-11)^{2}$ intersects the line with equation $y=25$ at two points, $A$ and $B$. What is the length of $\overline{A B}$ ?
Choices:
  A: 10
  B: 12
  C: 14
  D: 16

Ah, my apologies! Thank you for pointing that out. Here's the corrected response:

Action: Answer("B")
## Assistant 2:
  Thought: 
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand the mistake now. The equation of the parabola is $y=(x-11)^2$, and it intersects the line $y=25$ at two points, $A$ and $B$. To find the length of $\overline{A B}$, we need to use the distance formula, which is $ \sqrt {(x_B - x_A)^2 + (y_B - y_A)^2} $.

Reflection:
I realized that I made a mistake in my previous answer. I mistakenly used the equation of the line $y=25$ instead of the equation of the parabola. Thankfully, I caught the error and corrected it.

Action: Answer("B")

Explanation:
The length of $\overline{A B}$ is $ \sqrt {(10 - 5)^2 + (25 - 10)^2} = 12 $.
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
