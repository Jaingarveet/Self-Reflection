## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) We know Li was hired by Tianshu. 
2) Li and Zhao were hired by different units. Since Li is at Tianshu, Zhao must be at either Tianji or Tianxuan.
3) Liu and Zhao were hired by the same unit. So Liu must also be at either Tianji or Tianxuan, the same as Zhao.
4) The conditional statement says IF Zhang was hired by Tianxuan, THEN Wang was also hired by Tianxuan. But it doesn't say anything about what happens if Zhang was not hired by Tianxuan. So Zhang and Wang could be at any of the units.
5) Let's look at each answer choice:
A) This can't be correct, because we know Li is at Tianshu while Liu is at the same unit as Zhao, which is either Tianji or Tianxuan.
B) This could be correct. Zhao and Liu are together at one unit, which could be Tianji. And Wang could also be at Tianji.
C) This can't be correct. Liu and Zhao are together, so they can't be the only one at a unit. 
D) This can't be correct. If Wang is the only one at Tianxuan, then Zhang can't be there (contradicting the conditional). And Zhao and Liu need to be together somewhere else.
Therefore, the only choice that could be correct is B.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
