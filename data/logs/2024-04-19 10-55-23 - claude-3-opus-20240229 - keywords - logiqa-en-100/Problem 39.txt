## System:
You are an expert in Logic.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:

Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Logic
Context: A laboratory has three types of robots, A.B, and C.Type A can recognize colors, type B can recognize shapes, and type C can neither recognize colors nor shapes.The laboratory experimented with robots 1 and 2 with red balls, blue balls, red squares, and blue squares, and ordered them to pick up the red balls, but number 1 picked up the red squares, and number 2 picked up the blue balls.
Question: Based on the above experiment, which of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Both No.1 and No.2 are type C.
  B: Only one of No.1 and No.2 is C type.
  C: No.1 is type A and No.2 is type B.
  D: No.1 is not Type B and No.2 is not Type A.

## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. Robot 1 picked up the red squares instead of the red balls. This means it can recognize color (red) but not shape. So Robot 1 must be Type A.
2. Robot 2 picked up the blue balls instead of the red balls. This means it can recognize shape (balls) but not color. So Robot 2 must be Type B.
3. We can rule out choices A and B, because neither robot behaved like a Type C that can recognize neither color nor shape.
4. Choice C matches our deductions - Robot 1 is Type A and Robot 2 is Type B. 
5. Choice D is incorrect, because we determined Robot 1 is Type A (not "not Type B") and Robot 2 is Type B (not "not Type A").
Therefore, the answer that must be true is C - Robot 1 is Type A and Robot 2 is Type B.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: D
