## System:
You are an expert in Logic.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. E or F has one person to participate, but not both. So we have two possibilities:
   - E participates, F does not
   - F participates, E does not
2. One of J or K will participate, but not both. Again, two possibilities:
   - J participates, K does not 
   - K participates, J does not
3. If J participates, then G participates. 
   - This means if we choose J in step 2, we must also choose G.
4. Unless F participates, M does not participate.
   - This means if we don't choose F in step 1, we can't choose M.
   - Conversely, if we do choose F, we can (but don't have to) choose M.
5. Now, let's look at the answer choices. We need a pair that, when chosen, uniquely determines the other two members.
   - Choice A: F and H. If we choose F, then we can choose M. But this doesn't determine whether we choose J or K, so it's not enough.
   
   - Choice B: G and J. If we choose J, we must choose G. This also means we can't choose K. And since J is participating, the condition for M is not met, so we can't choose M. The only remaining choice is between E and F. So this could work.
   
   - Choice C: G and M. Choosing M implies we must choose F. But this doesn't determine whether we choose J or K, so it's not enough.
   
   - Choice D: H and M. Similar to C, choosing M implies we must choose F. But it doesn't determine J or K.
Therefore, the only choice that uniquely determines the team is B: G and J.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: D
