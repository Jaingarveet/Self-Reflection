Topic: Logic
Context: Since 1993, sand and dust storms have frequently occurred in the Inner Mongolia region of our country, causing major economic losses.Some people think that sand and dust storms are caused by grassland degradation and desertification caused by climate drought.They are natural disasters, so they are inevitable.
Question: If the following items are true, can the above opinions be questioned, except?
Choices:
  A: In the 1950s, grass in Xilin Gol grassland in Inner Mongolia was as tall as a horse's belly, and now grass can't even cover mice.
  B: Opposite the degraded grasslands of Hulunbeier and Xilinguole in Inner Mongolia, the grasslands of Mongolian grassland are about 1 meter high.
  C: On the almost uninhabited border line of 10 kilometers wide between China and Mongolia, grass still maintains the height of the 1950s.
  D: The increase in dust storms is mainly due to human factors such as overloaded grazing and predatory management of grasslands.

## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
The given opinion states that sand and dust storms in Inner Mongolia are natural disasters caused by climate drought, grassland degradation and desertification. It claims they are inevitable.
To question this opinion, we need to find evidence that the storms are not inevitable natural disasters, but rather caused by human factors.
Choice A: The fact that grass used to be much taller in the 1950s compared to now in Xilin Gol grassland suggests that the degradation is not just due to natural climate change, but other factors over time. This choice questions the given opinion.
Choice B: Grass being much taller in Mongolian grasslands compared to the degraded grasslands of Inner Mongolia also implies that the degradation is not purely due to the regional climate, since the grasslands are in a similar area. This also questions the opinion.
Choice C: If the grass height is maintained in the uninhabited border area, that strongly suggests human factors are the primary cause of the degradation, not inevitable natural causes. This choice substantially questions the opinion.
Choice D: This choice directly states that human factors like overgrazing are the main cause of increased dust storms, as opposed to the opinion that they are inevitable natural disasters. 
Therefore, Choice D is the only one that does not question the given opinion, since it states it outright. All the other choices provide evidence against the idea that the sand and dust storms are inevitable natural disasters.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
