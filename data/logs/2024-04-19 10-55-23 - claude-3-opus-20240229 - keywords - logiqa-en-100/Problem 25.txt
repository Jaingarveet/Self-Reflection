## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step using the information provided:
1. There are 3 tall men, 2 doctors, and 1 handsome man among the 4 men. 
2. Wang Wei and Wu Gang are both doctors.
3. Liu Dawei and Li Qiang are the same height.
4. Li Qiang and Wang Wei are not both tall.
Since the man Li Na is looking for needs to be tall, handsome and a doctor, we can deduce:
- The handsome man must also be tall and a doctor to meet all criteria.
- Wang Wei and Wu Gang are the only doctors. One of them must be the handsome man.
- Since Li Qiang and Wang Wei are not both tall, and there are 3 tall men total, Liu Dawei and Wu Gang must be tall.
Therefore, Wu Gang is the only man who could be tall, handsome and a doctor.
