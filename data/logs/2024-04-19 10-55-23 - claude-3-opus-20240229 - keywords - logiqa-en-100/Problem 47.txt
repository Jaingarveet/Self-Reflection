## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The first statement says that for listed companies, only those with dividends can issue new stocks. 
2. The second statement says that if a company has a dividend, it does not need funds.
3. The third statement says that if a company needs financing, there is no way for it to pay dividends.
From these statements, we can deduce:
- If a listed company needs financing, it cannot have dividends (from statement 3)
- If a listed company does not have dividends, it cannot issue new stocks (contrapositive of statement 1)
- Therefore, if a listed company needs financing, it cannot issue new stocks.
Now let's look at the answer choices:
A: This is the contrapositive of statement 2. It must be true if statement 2 is true.
B: This is not necessarily true. A listed company could have dividends and not need financing.
C: This follows from our deduction above. If a company needs financing, it cannot have dividends, and therefore cannot issue new stocks. So this must be true.
D: This is false based on our deduction. If a listed company needs financing, issuing new stocks is not a way for it to get financing, because it cannot issue new stocks in that situation.
Therefore, the answer that cannot be false is C.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
