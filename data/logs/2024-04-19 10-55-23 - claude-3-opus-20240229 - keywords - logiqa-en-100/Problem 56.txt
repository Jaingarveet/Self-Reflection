## System:
You are an expert in Logic.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

## User 2:
Topic: Logic
Context: The Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge, built in 1968, has a clear height of 24 meters in the Fengshui area.Theoretically, it can pass a maximum of 3,000 tons of ships.Today, with the rapid economic development, it has become a building that “cuts the waist” of the Yangtze River waterway and hinders the passage of giant ships.A bridge expert asserted that the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge must be demolished and rebuilt in order to dredge the golden waterways of the Yangtze River completely.
Question: If any of the following is true, can you raise the most doubts about this expert's point of view?
Choices:
  A: Due to the inability of large ships to pass through the Nanjing Bridge, a large number of exported goods in the middle and upper reaches of the Yangtze River can only be taken by road or railway.
  B: 99% of international ships entering the Yangtze River are moored at ports below the Nanjing Bridge, and dozens of foreign trade terminals above Nanjing rarely have large external ships berthed.
  C: It is not enough to dismantle only the Nanjing Bridge.The Yangtze River Bridge, which was built in Wuhu, Tongling, Anqing and other places, has a clear height of 24 meters.
  D: Shipbuilding technology is highly developed, and 8000-ton ships designed for adapting to the passage of the Yangtze River abroad have passed through Nanjing to Wuhan.

## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
The expert's main argument is that the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge must be demolished and rebuilt in order to allow giant ships to pass through and fully utilize the Yangtze River waterway.
Looking at the answer choices:
A) This supports the expert's view by highlighting the negative economic impact of the bridge limiting ship passage. It does not raise doubts.
B) This suggests that 99% of international ships don't even go past the Nanjing Bridge, and the ports above it rarely have large ships. If true, this would mean demolishing the bridge to allow large ship passage is not actually necessary, contradicting the expert. 
C) This just says there are other low bridges that also limit ships. It doesn't contradict the need to address the Nanjing Bridge specifically.
D) 8000-ton ships being able to pass through to Wuhan suggests the bridge is not actually preventing large ships as the expert claims. However, those ships are specially designed for the Yangtze, so this doesn't fully refute the expert's broader point about enabling giant ships in general.
Considering the reflection keywords, B most directly provides evidence contradicting the expert's central claim. The other choices either support the expert, are not directly relevant, or only partially refute the argument.
Therefore, B raises the most doubts about the expert's view.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
