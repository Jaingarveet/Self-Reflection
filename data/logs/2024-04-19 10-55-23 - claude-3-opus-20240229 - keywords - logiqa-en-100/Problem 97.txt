## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
The argument's conclusion is that the social atmosphere is rapidly deteriorating. The evidence provided is:
1) Posts about positive social issues like charity and bravery increased by 50% compared to 5 years ago
2) Posts about negative issues like crime and violence increased by 90% compared to 5 years ago
The argument assumes these percentage increases are meaningful indicators of the overall social atmosphere. 
To weaken this argument, we need to find information that casts doubt on that assumption. Let's consider each answer choice:
A) This is just a general saying. It doesn't directly address the argument or provide any new information to evaluate it. 
B) If the total number of internet users quadrupled in the past 5 years, that means even if the absolute number of both positive and negative posts increased, they may not have increased as a proportion of total posts. The percentage increases cited could just be due to the user base growth, not a real shift in social atmosphere. This weakens the argument.
C) The existence of some people spreading online rumors for profit doesn't really affect the overall argument about broad social trends one way or the other. It's not directly relevant.
D) The forum being legal also doesn't impact the reasoning of the argument. The legality of the forum is tangential to the question of whether post percentages reflect social atmosphere.
Therefore, B is the best answer. The information that the total number of users quadrupled casts the most doubt on whether the percentage increases in certain post topics are truly meaningful indicators of social atmosphere as the argument assumes.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
