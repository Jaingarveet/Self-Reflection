## System:
You are an expert in Logic.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.

## User 2:
Topic: Logic
Context: The intelligence department intercepted the three pieces of cryptographic information sent by the terrorists.After analysis by cryptographers, "Alingoits Doximayo Makasey" means "kidnapping student (host) hostage", and "Huholikaso Makasey Mugbudengs" means "hostage holding (see) "Reporter", "Mugbudengs Ftoufgke Alingoits" means "kidnapping reporters away".
Question: Regarding the meaning of the relevant words in this cryptographic language, which of the following statements may be true?
Choices:
  A: "Doximayo" means "hostage"
  C: "Mugbudengs" means "kidnapping".
  B: "Doximayo" means "student"
  D: I don't know what they mean.

## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. "Alingoits Doximayo Makasey" means "kidnapping student (host) hostage"
2. "Huholikaso Makasey Mugbudengs" means "hostage holding (see) reporter"  
3. "Mugbudengs Ftoufgke Alingoits" means "kidnapping reporters away"
From sentence 1, we can deduce that either "Doximayo" means "student" or "hostage". We don't have enough information yet to determine which.
Looking at sentence 2, we see "Makasey" appears again, paired with "hostage". So "Makasey" likely means "hostage". 
That means in sentence 1, "Doximayo" must mean "student", since "Makasey" is already identified as "hostage".
Finally, sentence 3 pairs "Mugbudengs" with "reporters". From sentence 2 we saw "Mugbudengs" in the context of "holding/seeing reporters". 
Therefore, the only statement we can logically deduce as true is:
"Doximayo" means "student"
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
