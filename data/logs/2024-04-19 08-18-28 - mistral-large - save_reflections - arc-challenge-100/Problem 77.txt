## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I made an incorrect assumption about the relationship between the sheep's physical traits and their vulnerability to predation.
The gap in my knowledge was in understanding the concept of natural selection and how it applies to this scenario.
I assumed that larger and stronger sheep would be more vulnerable to predation, but in reality, they are more likely to survive and reproduce.
Error Keywords:
 - Incorrect assumption
 - Misunderstanding of natural selection
 - Misinterpretation of physical traits
Solution:
The introduction of a new predator to the island will likely affect the sheep population based on their physical traits, such as size and color.
Since the dark wool sheep are larger and stronger, they are more likely to survive and reproduce, making them less vulnerable to predation.
On the other hand, the light wool sheep are smaller and weaker, making them more vulnerable to predation.
Therefore, the population of sheep with light wool is more likely to decrease first.
Instructions:
1. Identify the new factor introduced to the environment (i.e., the predator).
2. Consider how this factor may affect the sheep population based on their physical traits.
3. Evaluate the relationship between the sheep's physical traits and their vulnerability to predation.
4. Determine which sheep population is more likely to be affected first based on this relationship.
5. Choose the answer that matches your prediction.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always consider the relationship between the new factor introduced to the environment and the population being studied.
 - Always evaluate the relationship between the population's physical traits and their vulnerability to the new factor.
 - Never make assumptions about the relationship between physical traits and vulnerability without considering the specific context of the problem.
 - Always double-check your reasoning and final answer.
 - Remember that natural selection favors traits that increase an organism's chances of survival and reproduction in a given environment.
