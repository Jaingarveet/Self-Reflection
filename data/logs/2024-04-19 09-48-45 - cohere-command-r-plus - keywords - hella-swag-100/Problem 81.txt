Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to use dowsing or divining rods [title] Find dowsing or divining rods. [step] You can use natural items as dowsing or divining rods, such as tree branches or sticks. Often, diviners use forked sticks from trees such as willow, peach, and witch hazel.
Choices:
  A: [substeps] Some people also use exaggerated branches or canes because canes have been used so often in witchcraft. There may even be string hung from the branches before getting started on your project.
  B: Look for a stick that has a fork with branches of equal length on either end of the fork. [substeps] If you do not want to use a forked stick, you can use coat hanger, two wire rods, or a pendulum as a dowsing rod.
  C: You will buy one in a hardware store or hunting store. [substeps] Dowsing or divining rods are no different than sticks, and will require signatures on the stick, such as a helix, that you'll use to figure out how to cast your spells.
  D: These cast sparks, and are useful tools for lighting up a fire. [title] Bring a 9 " x 5 " square.

## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The text describes what to use as dowsing or divining rods, so the most coherent completion of the text would be to continue describing what to use and how to use it. Choice B is the only answer that does this.

Choice A mentions exaggerated branches and canes in the context of witchcraft and strings hung from branches, which is irrelevant to the topic and introduces the unrelated concept of spellcasting. Choice C states that dowsing rods can be bought in hardware or hunting stores, which is untrue as these are natural items typically sourced directly from trees. Choice D is incoherent and doesn't make sense in the context of the topic.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
