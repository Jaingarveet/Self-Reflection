## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: $$\begin{array}{r}3 x+4 y=-23 \\2 y-x=-19\end{array}$$What is the solution $(x, y)$ to the system of equations above?
Choices:
  A: $(-5,-2)$
  B: $(3,-8)$
  C: $(4,-6)$
  D: $(9,-6)$
## Assistant 2:
Let's solve this step-by-step:
1) First, let's solve for y in the second equation:
   $2y - x = -19$
   $2y = -19 + x$
   $y = \frac{-19 + x}{2}$
2) Now, let's substitute this expression for y into the first equation:
   $3x + 4y = -23$
   $3x + 4(\frac{-19 + x}{2}) = -23$
   $3x + (-38 + 2x) = -23$
   $3x - 38 + 2x = -23$
   $5x - 38 = -23$
   $5x = 15$
   $x = 3$
3) Now that we know x = 3, let's substitute this back into the equation for y:
   $y = \frac{-19 + x}{2}$
   $y = \frac{-19 + 3}{2}$
   $y = \frac{-16}{2}$
   $y = -8$
Therefore, the solution is (3, -8).
Action: Answer("B")
