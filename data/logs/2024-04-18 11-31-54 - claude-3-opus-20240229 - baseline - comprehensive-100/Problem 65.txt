## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: The first year Eleanor organized a fund-raising event, she invited 30 people. For each of the next 5 years, she invited double the number of people she had invited the previous year. If $f(n)$ is the number of people invited to the fund-raiser $n$ years after Eleanor began organizing the event, which of the following statements best describes the function $f$ ?
Choices:
  A: The function $f$ is a decreasing linear function.
  B: The function $f$ is an increasing linear function.
  C: The function $f$ is a decreasing exponential function.
  D: The function $f$ is an increasing exponential function.
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1) In the first year (n = 0), Eleanor invited 30 people. So, f(0) = 30.
2) Each year after that, for the next 5 years, she doubled the number of people invited from the previous year.
   So, in the second year (n = 1), she invited 30 * 2 = 60 people. f(1) = 60.
   In the third year (n = 2), she invited 60 * 2 = 120 people. f(2) = 120.
   In the fourth year (n = 3), she invited 120 * 2 = 240 people. f(3) = 240.
   And so on.
3) This doubling each year suggests an exponential function, not a linear function.
4) The number of people invited is increasing each year, not decreasing.
Therefore, the function f is an increasing exponential function.
Action: Answer("D")
