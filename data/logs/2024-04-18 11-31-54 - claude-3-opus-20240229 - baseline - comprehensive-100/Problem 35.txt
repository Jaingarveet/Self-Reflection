Topic: Law
Context: Mayor: There has been a long debate in city council about how to accommodate projected increases in automobile traffic. Today, our choice is clear: either we adopt my plan to build a new expressway, or we do nothing. Doing nothing is not a viable option because our existing system of roads would be in gridlock within ten years given even a conservative estimate of future traffic levels. City council should therefore adopt my plan.
Question: The reasoning in the mayor's argument is most vulnerable to which one of the following criticisms?
Choices:
  A: It bases a projection only on conservative estimates rather than considering a wider range of estimates.
  B: It takes for granted that the options it considers are mutually exclusive.
  C: It fails to consider the possibility that the rate of increase in traffic will start to diminish after ten years.
  D: It fails to address the issue of the cost of traffic gridlock to the city's economy.
  E: It presents a choice that is limited to two options, without giving reasons for not considering any other options
## Assistant 2:
Let's analyze the mayor's argument step-by-step:
1. The mayor presents two options: either adopt the plan to build a new expressway or do nothing.
2. The mayor argues that doing nothing is not viable because the existing road system would be in gridlock within ten years, based on conservative traffic estimates.
3. Therefore, the city council should adopt the mayor's plan.
Now, let's consider each answer choice:
A: The argument does consider conservative estimates, but this is not the main vulnerability.
B: The argument does assume the options are mutually exclusive, but this is not necessarily a flaw.
C: The argument only considers traffic up to ten years, but this is not the main vulnerability.
D: The argument does not address the cost of gridlock, but this is not the main vulnerability.
E: The argument presents a limited choice between two options without considering other possibilities. This is a significant vulnerability because there may be alternative solutions that the mayor has not considered.
Therefore, the reasoning in the mayor's argument is most vulnerable to criticism E.
Action: Answer("E")
