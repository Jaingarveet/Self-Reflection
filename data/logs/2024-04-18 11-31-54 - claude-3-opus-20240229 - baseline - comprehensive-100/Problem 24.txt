Topic: Law
Context: Of the eight students—George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert—in a seminar, exactly six will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
Question: If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, could be given by
Choices:
  A: Helen, George, and Nina
  B: Irving, Robert, and Helen
  C: Nina, Helen, and Olivia
  D: Olivia, Robert, and Irving
  E: Robert, George, and Helen
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. We know that Kyle and Lenore do not give reports. This leaves us with George, Helen, Irving, Nina, Olivia, and Robert.
2. George can only give a report on Tuesday. So, George must give the Tuesday morning report.
3. Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports. This means they must give morning reports if they are to give reports at all.
4. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. 
   - If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday. But this is not possible because George must give the Tuesday morning report.
   
   - If Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Wednesday. But this is not possible because there are only two slots on Wednesday.
   
   - Therefore, if Nina gives a report, it must be on Wednesday.
5. Given the constraints, the only possible arrangement for the morning reports is:
   - Monday: Robert
   - Tuesday: George
   - Wednesday: Helen
Therefore, the correct answer is:
Action: Answer("E")
## Result:
Agent Answer: E
Correct Answer: D
