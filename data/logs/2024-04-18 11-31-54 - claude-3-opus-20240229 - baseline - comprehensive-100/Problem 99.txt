Question: Which of the following is not an agent used in chemical peeling?
Choices:
  A: Glycolic acid
  B: Kojic acid
  C: Phenol
  D: Salicylic acid
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. Chemical peeling is a technique used to improve the appearance of the skin by applying a chemical solution that causes the skin to exfoliate and eventually peel off.
2. Glycolic acid is an alpha-hydroxy acid (AHA) commonly used in chemical peels. It helps to remove the outer layer of dead skin cells.
3. Phenol is a strong chemical used for deep peels. It penetrates the skin deeply and is used to treat more severe skin issues.
4. Salicylic acid is a beta-hydroxy acid (BHA) used in chemical peels. It is oil-soluble and can penetrate into the pores, making it useful for treating acne.
5. Kojic acid is a skin lightening agent derived from fungi. It is used to treat pigmentation issues like age spots and melasma. However, it is not typically used as a peeling agent.
Therefore, among the given choices, kojic acid is not an agent used in chemical peeling.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
