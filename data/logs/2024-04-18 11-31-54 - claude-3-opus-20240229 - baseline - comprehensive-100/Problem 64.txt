## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: In planning maintenance for a city's infrastructure, a civil engineer estimates that, starting from the present, the population of the city will decrease by 10 percent every 20 years. If the present population of the city is 50,000, which of the following expressions represents the engineer's estimate of the population of the city $t$ years from now?
Choices:
  A: $50,000(0.1)^{20 t}$
  B: $50,000(0.1)^{\frac{t}{20}}$
  C: $50,000(0.9)^{20 t}$
  D: $50,000(0.9)^{\frac{t}{20}}$
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1) The population is decreasing by 10% every 20 years. This means that every 20 years, the population is multiplied by 0.9 (because if it decreases by 10%, it retains 90% of its value, which is 0.9).
2) If $t$ represents the number of years from now, then $\frac{t}{20}$ represents the number of 20-year periods that have passed.
3) For each 20-year period, we multiply the population by 0.9. So if $\frac{t}{20}$ periods have passed, we need to multiply the initial population by $0.9^{\frac{t}{20}}$.
4) The initial population is 50,000. So the expression for the population $t$ years from now is $50,000(0.9)^{\frac{t}{20}}$.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
