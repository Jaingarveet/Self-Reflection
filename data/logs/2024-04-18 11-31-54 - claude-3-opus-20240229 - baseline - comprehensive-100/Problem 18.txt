## System:
You are an expert in Logic.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

## User 2:
Topic: Logic
Context: A laboratory has three types of robots, A.B, and C.Type A can recognize colors, type B can recognize shapes, and type C can neither recognize colors nor shapes.The laboratory experimented with robots 1 and 2 with red balls, blue balls, red squares, and blue squares, and ordered them to pick up the red balls, but number 1 picked up the red squares, and number 2 picked up the blue balls.
Question: Based on the above experiment, which of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Both No.1 and No.2 are type C.
  B: Only one of No.1 and No.2 is C type.
  C: No.1 is type A and No.2 is type B.
  D: No.1 is not Type B and No.2 is not Type A.
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. Robot No.1 picked up red squares instead of red balls. This means it can recognize color (red) but not shape (square vs ball). So, No.1 must be type A.
2. Robot No.2 picked up blue balls instead of red balls. This means it can recognize shape (ball) but not color (blue vs red). So, No.2 must be type B.
3. We can eliminate choices A and B because we know that neither No.1 nor No.2 is type C (which can recognize neither color nor shape).
4. Choice C correctly identifies the types of No.1 and No.2.
5. Choice D is incorrect because we know No.1 is type A and No.2 is type B.
Therefore, the correct answer is C: No.1 is type A and No.2 is type B.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
