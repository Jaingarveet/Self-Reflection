## System:
You are an expert in Medicine.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:

## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.

Question: Protein structure not lost in denaturation is ?
Choices:
  A: Primary structure
  B: Secondary structure
  C: Teiary structure
  D: Quaternary structure
## Assistant 2:
To determine which protein structure is not lost during denaturation, let's consider the different levels of protein structure:
1. Primary structure: The sequence of amino acids in the polypeptide chain, held together by covalent peptide bonds.
2. Secondary structure: The local folding of the polypeptide chain into α-helices, β-sheets, or other patterns, stabilized by hydrogen bonds.
3. Tertiary structure: The three-dimensional folding of the entire polypeptide chain, stabilized by various interactions such as hydrogen bonds, disulfide bridges, and hydrophobic interactions.
4. Quaternary structure: The arrangement of multiple polypeptide chains (subunits) into a larger protein complex.
Denaturation is the process by which a protein loses its native conformation and becomes unfolded. During denaturation:
- Quaternary structure is disrupted as the subunits dissociate.
- Tertiary structure is lost as the three-dimensional folding is disrupted.
- Secondary structure is lost as hydrogen bonds are broken, and α-helices and β-sheets unravel.
- Primary structure remains intact because the covalent peptide bonds between amino acids are not broken during denaturation.
Therefore, the protein structure that is not lost during denaturation is the primary structure.
