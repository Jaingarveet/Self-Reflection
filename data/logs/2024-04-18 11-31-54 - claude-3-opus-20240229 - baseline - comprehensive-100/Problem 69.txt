## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: $$\begin{aligned}& 2 x-3 y=-14 \\& 3 x-2 y=-6\end{aligned}$$If $(x, y)$ is a solution to the system of equations above, what is the value of $x-y$ ?
Choices:
  A: -20
  B: $\quad-8$
  C: -4
  D: 8
## Assistant 2:
Let's solve this step-by-step:
1) We have a system of two linear equations with two variables:
   
   $2x - 3y = -14$
   $3x - 2y = -6$
2) We can solve this using the substitution method. Let's solve the second equation for $y$:
   
   $3x - 2y = -6$
   $-2y = -3x - 6$
   $y = \frac{3x + 6}{2}$
3) Now substitute this value of $y$ into the first equation:
   
   $2x - 3(\frac{3x + 6}{2}) = -14$
   $2x - \frac{9x + 18}{2} = -14$
   $4x - (9x + 18) = -28$
   $4x - 9x - 18 = -28$
   $-5x - 18 = -28$
   $-5x = -10$
   $x = 2$
4) Now that we have $x$, we can find $y$ by substituting $x = 2$ into either of the original equations. Let's use the first one:
   
   $2(2) - 3y = -14$
   $4 - 3y = -14$
   $-3y = -18$
   $y = 6$
5) So the solution is $(x, y) = (2, 6)$. The question asks for the value of $x - y$:
   
   $x - y = 2 - 6 = -4$
Action: Answer("C")
