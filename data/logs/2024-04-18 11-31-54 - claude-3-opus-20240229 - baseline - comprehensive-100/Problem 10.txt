Question: A man divides Rs 8600 among 5 sons, 4 daughters and 2 nephews. If each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, and each son receives five as much as each nephew. How much does each daughter receive ?
Choices:
  A: Rs 400
  B: Rs 500
  C: Rs 600
  D: Rs 700
  E: Rs 800
## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1. Let's assume each nephew gets 'x' rupees. 
2. Then, each daughter will get 4x rupees (as each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew).
3. And each son will get 5x rupees (as each son receives five times as much as each nephew).
4. Now, we can set up an equation:
   * Total money = (Number of nephews × money each nephew gets) + (Number of daughters × money each daughter gets) + (Number of sons × money each son gets)
   * 8600 = (2 × x) + (4 × 4x) + (5 × 5x)
   * 8600 = 2x + 16x + 25x
   * 8600 = 43x
5. Solving for x:
   * x = 8600 ÷ 43
   * x = 200
6. So, each nephew gets Rs 200. 
   Each daughter gets 4x = 4 × 200 = Rs 800.
Therefore, each daughter receives Rs 800.
