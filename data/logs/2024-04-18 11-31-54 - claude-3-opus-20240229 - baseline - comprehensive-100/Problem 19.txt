## System:
You are an expert in Logic.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Topic: Logic
Context: The late famous logician Jin Yuelin of China heard the words "Money is like dung" and "Friends are worth a thousand dollars" when he was a child, and found that there are logical problems because they can lead to the absurd conclusion of "friends are like dung".
Question: Since the conclusion of "friends like dung" is not true, it can be logically derived?
Choices:
  A: The expression "money is like dung" is false.
  B: If a friend is indeed worth a lot of money, then money is not like dung.
  C: The statement that "friends are valuable" is true.
  D: The words "Money is like dung" and "Friends are worth a thousand dollars" are either true or false.
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The two given statements are:
   - "Money is like dung"
   - "Friends are worth a thousand dollars"
2. If we combine these statements, it could lead to the conclusion "Friends are like dung". However, we know this conclusion is absurd and not true.
3. The question asks what can be logically derived from the fact that the conclusion "friends are like dung" is not true.
4. Looking at the choices:
   - A: This could be true, but we can't definitively say the statement "money is like dung" is false just because the conclusion is absurd.
   - B: This seems logical. If friends are indeed worth a lot of money (as per the second statement), and the conclusion "friends are like dung" is false, then it implies that money is not like dung.
   - C: While this may be a generally accepted truth, it doesn't directly follow from the given statements and the absurd conclusion.
   - D: This is true in general (statements are either true or false), but it doesn't specifically address the logical problem at hand.
5. Therefore, choice B seems to be the most logical derivation from the given information.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
