Context: The organizer of a reading club will select at least five and at most six works from a group of nine works. The group consists of three French novels, three Russian novels, two French plays, and one Russian play. The organizer's selection of works must conform to the following requirements: No more than four French works are selected. At least three but no more than four novels are selected. At least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected. If both French plays are selected, then the Russian play is not selected.
Question: Any one of the following could be true about the organizer's selections of works EXCEPT:
Choices:
  A: No Russian novels and exactly one play are selected.
  B: Exactly one Russian novel and both French plays are selected.
  C: Exactly two French novels and the Russian play are selected.
  D: Exactly two French novels and exactly two plays are selected.
  E: Exactly two Russian novels and exactly one play are selected.
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The total number of works selected must be 5 or 6.
2. No more than 4 French works can be selected.
3. 3 or 4 novels must be selected.
4. The number of French novels must be greater than or equal to the number of Russian novels.
5. If both French plays are selected, the Russian play cannot be selected.
Now, let's examine each choice:
A. If no Russian novels and exactly one play are selected, then all 5 or 6 selected works must be French (3 novels and 1 or 2 plays). This violates the requirement that no more than 4 French works can be selected.
B. If exactly one Russian novel and both French plays are selected, the remaining 2 or 3 works must be French novels to satisfy the requirement that at least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected. This is possible.
C. If exactly two French novels and the Russian play are selected, the remaining 2 or 3 works can be any combination of one Russian novel and one or two French novels. This is possible.
D. If exactly two French novels and exactly two plays are selected, the plays could be both French, or one French and one Russian. The remaining 1 or 2 works could be Russian novels. This is possible.
E. If exactly two Russian novels and exactly one play are selected, the play could be French or Russian, and the remaining 2 or 3 works must include at least two French novels to satisfy the requirement that at least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected. This is possible.
Therefore, the only choice that could not be true is A.
Action: Answer("A")
