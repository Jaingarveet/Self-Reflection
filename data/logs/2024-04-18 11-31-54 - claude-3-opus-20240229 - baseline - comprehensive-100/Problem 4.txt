Question: At its maximum speed, a space shuttle can travel 700m high in 40 seconds. It will also take 5 seconds to pass a point. What then is the length of the space shuttle?
Choices:
  A: 50 m
  B: 75 m
  C: 100 m
  D: 125 m
  E: 150 m
## Assistant 2:
Let's approach this step-by-step:
1. Find the speed of the space shuttle:
   * In 40 seconds, it travels 700m high.
   * Speed = Distance / Time
   * Speed = 700m / 40s = 17.5 m/s
2. Now, we know that at this speed, it takes 5 seconds for the shuttle to pass a point.
   * This means that in 5 seconds, the shuttle will travel a distance equal to its own length.
3. Calculate the distance traveled in 5 seconds:
   * Distance = Speed × Time
   * Distance = 17.5 m/s × 5s = 87.5 m
Therefore, the length of the space shuttle is 87.5 meters.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
