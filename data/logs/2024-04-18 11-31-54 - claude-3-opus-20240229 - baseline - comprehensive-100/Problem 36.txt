Context: Editorial: Painting involves a sequential application of layers, each of which adheres satisfactorily only if the underlying layer has been properly applied. Education is, in this respect, like the craft of painting. Since the most important steps in painting are preparation of the surface to be painted and application of the primer coat, it makes sense to suppose that .
Question: Which one of the following most logically completes the editorial's argument?
Choices:
  A: in the educator's initial contact with a student, the educator should be as undemanding as possible
  B: students who have a secure grasp of the fundamentals of a subject are likely to make progress in that subject
  C: educators who are not achieving the goals they intended should revise their teaching methods
  D: teaching new students is rewarding but much more difficult than teaching more advanced students
  E: the success of a student's overall educational experience depends above all upon that student's initial educational experience
## Assistant 2:
To determine which choice most logically completes the editorial's argument, let's analyze the given information:
1. The editorial compares education to the craft of painting.
2. In painting, the most important steps are preparing the surface and applying the primer coat.
3. Each layer in painting adheres satisfactorily only if the underlying layer has been properly applied.
Now, let's examine each choice:
A. This choice suggests being undemanding in the initial contact, which does not align with the importance of proper preparation in painting.
B. This choice focuses on students with a secure grasp of fundamentals, but does not address the initial educational experience.
C. This choice is about revising teaching methods when goals are not met, which is not directly related to the initial educational experience.
D. This choice compares teaching new students to teaching advanced students, but does not address the importance of the initial educational experience.
E. This choice directly relates the success of a student's overall educational experience to their initial educational experience, which aligns with the importance of surface preparation and primer coat application in painting.
Therefore, choice E most logically completes the editorial's argument.
Action: Answer("E")
