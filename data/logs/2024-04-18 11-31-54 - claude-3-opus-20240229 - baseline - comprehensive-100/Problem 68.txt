Question: In the $x y$-plane, the line determined by the points $(2, k)$ and $(k, 32)$ passes through the origin. Which of the following could be the value of $k$ ?
Choices:
  A: 0
  B: 4
  C: 8
  D: 16
## Assistant 2:
Let's approach this step-by-step:
1) For a line to pass through the origin (0, 0), it must satisfy the equation $y = mx$, where $m$ is the slope of the line.
2) The slope of a line can be calculated using the formula:
   $m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$
   where $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ are any two points on the line.
3) Using the given points $(2, k)$ and $(k, 32)$, we can calculate the slope:
   $m = \frac{32 - k}{k - 2}$
4) Since the line passes through the origin, we can use the point-slope form of a line equation:
   $y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$
   Substituting the point $(2, k)$ and the slope we found:
   $y - k = \frac{32 - k}{k - 2}(x - 2)$
5) Now, for the line to pass through the origin, the equation must be satisfied when $x = 0$ and $y = 0$. Substituting these values:
   $0 - k = \frac{32 - k}{k - 2}(0 - 2)$
   Simplifying:
   $-k = \frac{32 - k}{k - 2}(-2)$
   $-k = \frac{2k - 64}{k - 2}$
6) For this to be true, the numerators must be equal:
   $-k(k - 2) = 2k - 64$
   $-k^2 + 2k = 2k - 64$
   $-k^2 = -64$
   $k^2 = 64$
   $k = \pm 8$
7) Since $k$ is a coordinate, it must be a real number. Therefore, $k$ could be either 8 or -8.
Looking at the choices, the only value of $k$ that satisfies the equation is 8.
Action: Answer("C")
