Context: Prince Lima in Li Na's mind is tall, handsome and doctor.She knew four men, Wang Wei, Wu Gang, Li Qiang, and Liu Dawei, and one of them met all the conditions she required.(1) Among the 4 men, there are 3 tall men, 2 doctors, and 1 is handsome; (2) Wang Wei and Wu Gang are both doctors; (3) Liu Dawei and Li Qiang are the same height; (4) Li Qiang and Wang Wei Not all are tall.
Question: Who can meet all the requirements of Li Na?
Choices:
  A: Liu Dawei
  B: Li Qiang
  C: Wu Gang
  D: Wang Wei
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. We know that among the 4 men, there are 3 tall men, 2 doctors, and 1 is handsome.
2. Wang Wei and Wu Gang are both doctors. This means they account for the 2 doctors mentioned in point 1.
3. Liu Dawei and Li Qiang are the same height. We don't know if they are tall or not.
4. Li Qiang and Wang Wei are not both tall. This means at least one of them is not tall.
5. Since there are 3 tall men in total, and Li Qiang and Wang Wei are not both tall, it means Liu Dawei must be tall (because he is the same height as Li Qiang).
6. The man who meets all of Li Na's requirements must be tall, handsome, and a doctor.
7. Among Wang Wei and Wu Gang (the doctors), one of them must be the handsome one, as the other two men are of the same height and thus can't be differentiated by the 'handsome' characteristic.
8. Since Li Qiang and Wang Wei are not both tall, and we need a tall doctor, Wu Gang must be the tall and handsome doctor.
Therefore, Wu Gang is the one who meets all of Li Na's requirements.
