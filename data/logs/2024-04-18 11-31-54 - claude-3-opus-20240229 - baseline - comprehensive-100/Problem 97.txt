Question: Hypophosphatemic Vitamin D Resistant Rickets is?
Choices:
  A: AR
  B: AD
  C: XD
  D: XR
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. Hypophosphatemic Vitamin D Resistant Rickets is a genetic disorder affecting bone mineralization.
2. The inheritance pattern of this disorder is important to determine the correct answer.
3. The key word in the question is "Resistant". This suggests the disorder is not responsive to normal vitamin D regulation.
4. Vitamin D resistance is commonly associated with X-linked dominant (XD) inheritance patterns.
5. In X-linked dominant disorders, the gene mutation is located on the X chromosome, and only one copy of the mutated gene is sufficient to cause the disorder.
6. Therefore, Hypophosphatemic Vitamin D Resistant Rickets is most likely an X-linked dominant (XD) disorder.
Action: Answer("C")
