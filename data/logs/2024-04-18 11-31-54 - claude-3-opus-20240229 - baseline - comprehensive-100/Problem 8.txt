Question: Two cars start at the same time from opposite ends of a highway that is 50 miles long. One car is riding at 12 mph and the second car is riding at 13 mph. How long after they begin will they meet?
Choices:
  A:  1
  B:  1.25
  C:  1.50
  D:  1.75
  E:  2
## Assistant 2:
Let's approach this step-by-step:
1) Let's say the time they meet is t hours after they start.
2) In t hours, the first car covers a distance of 12t miles (distance = speed Ã— time).
3) In t hours, the second car covers a distance of 13t miles.
4) When they meet, the total distance covered by both cars should be equal to the length of the highway, which is 50 miles.
   So, 12t + 13t = 50
5) Simplifying, 25t = 50
6) Dividing both sides by 25, we get t = 2
Therefore, they will meet 2 hours after they begin.
Action: Answer("E")
