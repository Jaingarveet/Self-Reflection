Question: The monthly salary S of a shop assistant is the sum of a fixed salary of $500 plus 5% of all monthly sales. What should the monthly sales be so that her monthly salary reaches $1500?
Choices:
  A: $50000
  B: $40000
  C: $30000
  D: $20000
  E: None of these
## Assistant 2:
Let's approach this step-by-step:
1. The monthly salary S is composed of a fixed salary of $500 plus 5% of monthly sales. Let's call the monthly sales x.
2. We can write an equation:
   S = 500 + 0.05x
3. We want to find x when S = 1500. So, let's substitute 1500 for S:
   1500 = 500 + 0.05x
4. Subtract 500 from both sides:
   1000 = 0.05x
5. Divide both sides by 0.05:
   1000/0.05 = x
   20000 = x
Therefore, the monthly sales should be $20000 for the shop assistant's monthly salary to reach $1500.
