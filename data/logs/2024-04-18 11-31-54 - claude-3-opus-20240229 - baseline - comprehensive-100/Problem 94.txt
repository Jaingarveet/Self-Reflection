Question: Who has given root canal isthmus classification?
Choices:
  A: Kim
  B: Schielder
  C: Krasner and Rankow
  D: Vertucci
## Assistant 2:
To determine who has given the root canal isthmus classification, let's consider each choice:
A. Kim: I am not aware of a widely used root canal isthmus classification by Kim.
B. Schielder: Schielder is known for his work on root canal preparation techniques, but I don't recall a specific isthmus classification attributed to him.
C. Krasner and Rankow: Krasner and Rankow published a study in 2004 titled "Anatomy of the Pulp-Chamber Floor" in the Journal of Endodontics. In this study, they described the anatomy of the pulp chamber floor and classified the isthmus types based on their morphology. This classification is widely recognized in endodontics.
D. Vertucci: Vertucci is well-known for his root canal morphology classification, which describes the different types of root canal configurations. However, this classification does not specifically focus on isthmus types.
Based on this information, the correct answer is:
Action: Answer("C")
Krasner and Rankow have given the most widely recognized root canal isthmus classification in their 2004 study "Anatomy of the Pulp-Chamber Floor."
