Question: In 2015 the populations of City $\mathrm{X}$ and City $\mathrm{Y}$ were equal. From 2010 to 2015, the population of City X increased by $20 \%$ and the population of City $\mathrm{Y}$ decreased by $10 \%$. If the population of City $\mathrm{X}$ was 120,000 in 2010, what was the population of City Y in 2010 ?
Choices:
  A: 60,000
  B: 90,000
  C: 160,000
  D: 240,000
## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's approach this step-by-step:
1) Let's define some variables:
   - Let $X_{2010}$ and $X_{2015}$ be the populations of City X in 2010 and 2015 respectively.
   - Let $Y_{2010}$ and $Y_{2015}$ be the populations of City Y in 2010 and 2015 respectively.
2) We're told that $X_{2010} = 120,000$ and that $X_{2015} = Y_{2015}$ (the populations were equal in 2015).
3) We're also told that City X's population increased by 20% from 2010 to 2015. This means:
   
   $X_{2015} = X_{2010} + 20\% \times X_{2010} = 120,000 + 0.2 \times 120,000 = 144,000$
4) Since $X_{2015} = Y_{2015}$, we know that $Y_{2015} = 144,000$ as well.
5) Now, we're told that City Y's population decreased by 10% from 2010 to 2015. Let's use this to find $Y_{2010}$:
   
   $Y_{2015} = Y_{2010} - 10\% \times Y_{2010}$
   
   $144,000 = Y_{2010} - 0.1 \times Y_{2010} = 0.9 \times Y_{2010}$
   
   $Y_{2010} = 144,000 \div 0.9 = 160,000$
Therefore, the population of City Y in 2010 was 160,000.
Action: Answer("C")
