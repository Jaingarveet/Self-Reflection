Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to register a car in texas without going to texas [title] Print and fill out form 130-u]. [substeps] On line 14, put your name and address. On line 14a, put the name and address of the person who is registering the car for you.
Choices:
  A: On line 1b, put your zip code. On line 17b, put your departure location.
  B: On line 15a, put the state in which the car is registered. On line 12b, type the address of the car into line 10-1 and hit call.
  C: On line 14a, you will get the ability to keep your plate number, but you will not need it when registering your car. You can only enter your full name and address on the form, and may leave the tag blank or print it out.
  D: Note that this is where the registration renewal forms will get sent, so make sure the person is willing and able to take that action down the line. On line 14b, put the address where the car will be stored or parked.
## Assistant 2:
To determine the most likely completion, let's think through the key points:
1. The question is about registering a car in Texas without being physically present in Texas.
2. The form being filled out is 130-U, which is likely a vehicle registration form.
3. Lines 14 and 14a are for the name and address of the person registering the car and the person assisting with the registration, respectively.
4. The completion should logically follow and provide additional relevant information.
Considering the choices:
A and B mention lines and information that don't seem directly relevant, like zip code, departure location, and state of current registration.
C discusses plate numbers, which while related to vehicle registration, doesn't fit the context of the question.
D provides the most relevant information by noting that the address in 14a is where the registration renewal forms will be sent in the future, and 14b is for the address where the car will be primarily located. This logically follows the information provided and is pertinent to registering a vehicle.
Therefore, choice D is the most likely and appropriate completion.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
