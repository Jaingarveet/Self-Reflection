Question: A 48-year-old man presents for a routine physical examination. The patient has a history of hyperlipidemia and nodular prostatic hyperplasia. Physical examination reveals a large mass on the lateral side of the scrotum, which can be transilluminated. It is found to be composed of dilated blood vessels draining the left testicle. The patient is at increased risk for which of the following complications?
Choices:
  A: Adenocarcinoma
  B: Embryonal carcinoma
  C: Infertility
  D: Nodular prostatic hyperplasia
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The patient has a large mass on the lateral side of the scrotum that can be transilluminated and is composed of dilated blood vessels draining the left testicle. This description is consistent with a varicocele.
2. A varicocele is an abnormal dilation of the veins that drain the testicle. It is more common on the left side due to the anatomical differences in venous drainage between the left and right testicles.
3. Varicoceles can cause a decrease in sperm quality and quantity, leading to infertility. This is thought to be due to the increased temperature of the testicle caused by the dilated veins, which can negatively impact spermatogenesis.
4. While varicoceles are associated with infertility, they are not directly linked to adenocarcinoma, embryonal carcinoma, or nodular prostatic hyperplasia.
Therefore, the patient with a varicocele is at increased risk for infertility.
