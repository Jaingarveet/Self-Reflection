Question: A straight picket fence is composed of x pickets each of which is 1/2 inch wide. If there are 6 inches of space between each pair of pickets, which of the following represents the length of fence in feet?
Choices:
  A: 13x/2
  B: 13x/2 - 6
  C: 13x/24
  D: (13x+1)/24
  E: (13x-12)/24
## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Each picket is 1/2 inch wide.
2) There are 6 inches of space between each pair of pickets.
3) So, the total width of one picket plus one space is 1/2 + 6 = 13/2 inches.
4) The total length of the fence will be the number of pickets (x) multiplied by the width of one picket plus one space (13/2 inches).
   So, the total length in inches is: x * 13/2 = 13x/2 inches
5) But the question asks for the length in feet. To convert inches to feet, we need to divide by 12.
   So, the length in feet is: (13x/2) / 12 = 13x/24 feet
Therefore, the correct answer is C: 13x/24.
Action: Answer("C")

Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: E
