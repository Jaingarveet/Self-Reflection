Topic: Law
Context: Violent crime in this town is becoming a serious problem. Compared to last year, local law enforcement agencies have responded to 17 percent more calls involving violent crimes, showing that the average citizen of this town is more likely than ever to become a victim of a violent crime.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument?
Choices:
  A: The town's overall crime rate appears to have risen slightly this year compared to the same period last year.
  B: In general, persons under the age of 65 are less likely to be victims of violent crimes than persons over the age of 65.
  C: As a result of the town's community outreach programs, more people than ever are willing to report violent crimes to the proper authorities.
  D: In response to worries about violent crime, the town has recently opened a community center providing supervised activities for teenagers.
  E: Community officials have shown that a relatively small number of repeat offenders commit the majority of violent crimes in the town.
## Assistant 2:
To determine which choice most seriously weakens the argument, let's analyze the argument and each choice:
The argument states that violent crime is becoming a serious problem in the town, and the average citizen is more likely to become a victim of a violent crime. The evidence provided is that law enforcement agencies have responded to 17% more calls involving violent crimes compared to last year.
Choice A: A slight rise in the overall crime rate does not directly weaken the argument about violent crime specifically.
Choice B: The likelihood of being a victim based on age does not address the argument about the increase in violent crime.
Choice C: If more people are willing to report violent crimes due to community outreach programs, this could explain the 17% increase in calls to law enforcement. It weakens the argument by providing an alternative explanation for the increase in reported violent crimes, rather than an actual increase in violent crimes committed.
Choice D: The opening of a community center for teenagers does not directly address the argument about the increase in violent crime.
Choice E: The fact that a small number of repeat offenders commit the majority of violent crimes does not weaken the argument about the increase in violent crime.
Therefore, Choice C most seriously weakens the argument.
Action: Answer("C")

Agent Answer: C
