## System:
You are an expert in Science.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:
Topic: Geography
Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Science
Question: Which of these indicates a physical change that occurs during the process of digestion?
Choices:
  A: the addition of acids to create a ball of food
  B: the secretion of pepsin to change proteins to peptides
  C: the breakdown of food substances by digestive juices
  D: the squeezing of food through the intestines
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. Digestion involves both physical and chemical changes to food.
2. Physical changes alter the form of a substance without changing its chemical composition. Examples include grinding, mashing, and mixing.
3. Chemical changes alter the chemical composition of a substance, forming new chemical compounds. Examples include the breakdown of nutrients by enzymes.
Now, let's examine each choice:
A. Adding acids to create a ball of food is a physical change as it alters the form without changing the chemical composition.
B. Pepsin changing proteins to peptides is a chemical change as it breaks down proteins into smaller compounds (peptides).
C. The breakdown of food substances by digestive juices is a chemical change as it alters the chemical composition of the food.
D. Squeezing food through the intestines is a physical change as it alters the form and location of the food without changing its chemical composition.
Therefore, the correct answer is D, as it is the only choice that describes a physical change.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
