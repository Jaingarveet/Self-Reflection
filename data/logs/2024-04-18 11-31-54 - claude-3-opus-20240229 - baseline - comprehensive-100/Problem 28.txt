Context: During a recital, two pianists—Wayne and Zara—will perform solos. There will be five solos altogether, performed one immediately after another. Each solo will be either a modern piece or a traditional piece. The choice of pianist and type of piece for the solos must conform to the following conditions: The third solo is a traditional piece. Exactly two of the traditional pieces are performed consecutively. In the fourth solo, either Wayne performs a traditional piece or Zara performs a modern piece. The pianist who performs the second solo does not perform the fifth solo. No traditional piece is performed until Wayne performs at least one modem piece.
Question: Which one of the following could be all of the solos that are traditional pieces?
Choices:
  A: the first, third, and fourth
  B: the second, third, and fourth
  C: the third and fourth
  D: the third and fifth
  E: the fourth and fifth
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. We know that the third solo is a traditional piece.
2. Exactly two of the traditional pieces are performed consecutively. This means that either the second and third solos are traditional, or the third and fourth solos are traditional.
3. In the fourth solo, either Wayne performs a traditional piece or Zara performs a modern piece. If the fourth solo is traditional, then the second and third must also be traditional (to satisfy the condition of two consecutive traditional pieces). But this would violate the condition that no traditional piece is performed until Wayne performs at least one modern piece.
   Therefore, the fourth solo must be a modern piece performed by Zara.
4. The pianist who performs the second solo does not perform the fifth solo. This doesn't directly affect which solos are traditional.
5. No traditional piece is performed until Wayne performs at least one modern piece. This means that the first traditional piece can't be the first or second solo.
Putting this all together:
- The third solo is traditional.
- Either the second or the fourth solo is also traditional.
- The fourth solo is modern.
- Therefore, the second and third solos are the only ones that could be traditional.
