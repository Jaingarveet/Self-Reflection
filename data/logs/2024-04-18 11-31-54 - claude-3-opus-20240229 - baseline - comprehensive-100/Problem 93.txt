## System:
You are an expert in Medicine.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: Which of the following anti-Parkinson drugs acts by decreasing brain cholinergic activity
Choices:
  A: Levodopa
  B: Benserazide
  C: Selegiline
  D: Biperiden
## Assistant 2:
To determine which anti-Parkinson drug acts by decreasing brain cholinergic activity, let's consider the mechanism of action for each choice:
A. Levodopa: It is a precursor to dopamine and is converted to dopamine in the brain, increasing dopaminergic activity. It does not primarily affect cholinergic activity.
B. Benserazide: It is a peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor that prevents the conversion of levodopa to dopamine outside the brain, allowing more levodopa to reach the brain. It does not directly affect cholinergic activity.
C. Selegiline: It is a selective monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) inhibitor that prevents the breakdown of dopamine in the brain, thus increasing dopaminergic activity. It does not primarily target cholinergic activity.
D. Biperiden: It is an anticholinergic drug that blocks the action of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter involved in the control of movement. By decreasing cholinergic activity in the brain, it helps to restore the balance between dopaminergic and cholinergic systems in Parkinson's disease.
Therefore, the anti-Parkinson drug that acts by decreasing brain cholinergic activity is Biperiden.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
