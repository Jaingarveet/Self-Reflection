Question: If $(a x+2)(b x+7)=15 x^{2}+c x+14$ for all values of $x$, and $a+b=8$, what are the two possible values for $c$ ?
Choices:
  A: 3 and 5
  B: 6 and 35
  C: 10 and 21
  D: 31 and 41
## Assistant 2:
Let's approach this step-by-step:
1) If the equation $(ax+2)(bx+7)=15x^2+cx+14$ holds for all values of $x$, then it's an identity. This means that the coefficients of like terms on both sides must be equal.
2) Expand the left side of the equation:
   
   $(ax+2)(bx+7) = abx^2 + 7ax + 2bx + 14 = abx^2 + (7a+2b)x + 14$
3) Equating the coefficients of $x^2$, $x$, and the constant terms on both sides:
   
   $ab = 15$
   $7a + 2b = c$
   $14 = 14$
4) We're given that $a + b = 8$. Let's solve for $a$ and $b$.
   
   From $ab = 15$, we can write $b = 15/a$.
   Substituting this in $a + b = 8$:
   
   $a + 15/a = 8$
   
   Multiplying by $a$:
   
   $a^2 + 15 = 8a$
   $a^2 - 8a + 15 = 0$
   
   This is a quadratic equation. Let's solve it:
   
   $(a - 3)(a - 5) = 0$
   
   So, $a = 3$ or $a = 5$. Correspondingly, $b = 5$ or $b = 3$.
5) Now, let's find the values of $c$. From $7a + 2b = c$:
   
   If $a = 3$ and $b = 5$, then $c = 7(3) + 2(5) = 21 + 10 = 31$.
   If $a = 5$ and $b = 3$, then $c = 7(5) + 2(3) = 35 + 6 = 41$.
Therefore, the two possible values for $c$ are 31 and 41.
