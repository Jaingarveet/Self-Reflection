Topic: Law
Context: Carl is clearly an incompetent detective. He has solved a smaller percentage of the cases assigned to him in the last 3 years—only 1 out of 25—than any other detective on the police force.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument above?
Choices:
  A: Because the police chief regards Carl as the most capable detective, she assigns him only the most difficult cases, ones that others have failed to solve.
  B: Before he became a detective, Carl was a neighborhood police officer and was highly respected by the residents of the neighborhood he patrolled.
  C: Detectives on the police force on which Carl serves are provided with extensive resources, including the use of a large computer database, to help them solve crimes.
  D: Carl was previously a detective in a police department in another city, and in the 4 years he spent there, he solved only 1 out of 30 crimes.
  E: Many of the officers in the police department in which Carl serves were hired or promoted within the last 5 years.
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The argument states that Carl is an incompetent detective because he has solved a smaller percentage of cases (1 out of 25) than any other detective in the last 3 years.
2. To weaken this argument, we need to find a choice that provides an alternative explanation for Carl's low success rate, suggesting that it may not be due to his incompetence.
3. Choice A states that the police chief assigns Carl the most difficult cases that others have failed to solve. This could explain why Carl has solved fewer cases, as he is given the toughest assignments. It weakens the argument by suggesting that Carl's low success rate may be due to the difficulty of his cases rather than his incompetence.
4. Choices B, C, D, and E do not directly address why Carl has solved fewer cases compared to other detectives. They provide additional information about Carl's background or the police department, but they don't offer a compelling alternative explanation for his low success rate.
Therefore, Choice A most seriously weakens the argument.
Action: Answer("A")
