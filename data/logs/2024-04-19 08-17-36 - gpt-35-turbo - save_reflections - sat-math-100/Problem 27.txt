## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I correctly translated the problem into an equation, but I made a mistake in solving for $x$. 
The correct solution is $x=2$, but I incorrectly chose answer choice A, which is $8x=16$. 
The correct answer is C, which is $8x=16$.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Algebraic manipulation error
 - Substitution error
Solution:
The problem can be translated into an equation: $16+4x=14+10$. 
Simplifying the right side of the equation, we get $16+4x=24$.
Solving for $x$, we get $x=2$.
To find the value of $8x$, we substitute $x=2$ into $8x$.
$8x=8(2)=16$.
