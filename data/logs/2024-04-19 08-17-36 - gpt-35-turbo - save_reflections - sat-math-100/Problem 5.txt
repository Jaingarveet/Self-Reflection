## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I made an error in calculating the number of states that joined between 1850 and 1900. 
The correct number of states that joined between 1850 and 1900 is $2 \times 30 = 60$, not 15. 
Therefore, the correct equation is $2x=60$, which simplifies to $x=30$.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Division error
 - Misinterpretation of the problem
Solution:
Let $y$ be the number of states that joined between 1850 and 1900.
We know that $30+x=2y$ and $y=2(30-x)$.
Simplifying the second equation, we get $y=60-2x$.
Equating the two expressions for $y$, we get $60-2x=30+x$.
Solving for $x$, we get $x=30$.
Therefore, the correct equation is $2x=60$, which simplifies to $x=30$.
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and understand the problem.
2. Identify the variables and equations involved.
3. Solve for the unknown variable using the given equations.
4. Double-check your calculations and final answer.
5. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always identify the variables and equations involved.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that solving equations involves isolating the unknown variable on one side of the equation.
