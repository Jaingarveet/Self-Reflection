## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I chose the answer C, 0.8, because it appeared to be the $x$-coordinate of the intersection point on the graph. However, I did not read the graph accurately, and I made an error in my visual estimation. 
Error Keywords:
 - Estimation error
 - Graphical error
 - Reading error
Solution:
To find the $x$-coordinate of the intersection point, we need to solve the system of equations. We can use elimination or substitution to solve the system. Here, we will use elimination:
$$\begin{aligned}& 2.4 x-1.5 y=0.3 \\& 1.6 x+0.5 y=-1.3\end{aligned}$$
Multiplying the second equation by $3$ and adding it to the first equation, we get:
$$\begin{aligned}2.4 x-1.5 y+4.8 x+1.5 y&=0.3-3(1.3)\\6.8 x&=-3.6\\x&=-\frac{18}{34}\\x&=-\frac{9}{17}\end{aligned}$$
Therefore, the $x$-coordinate of the intersection point is $-\frac{9}{17}$, which is answer choice $\boxed{\textbf{(A)}\ -0.5}$.
Instructions:
1. Read the problem carefully and understand the question.
2. Identify the system of equations and the unknown variable.
3. Choose a method to solve the system of equations.
4. Solve the system of equations step-by-step.
5. Check your solution by substituting the values back into the original equations.
6. Read the answer choices carefully and choose the correct answer.
7. Double-check your answer to ensure accuracy.
Advice:
 - Always read the problem carefully and understand the question.
 - Always double-check your work and answer to ensure accuracy.
 - Always use a systematic approach to solve problems.
 - Always check your solution by substituting the values back into the original equations.
 - Remember that estimation is not a substitute for accurate calculation.
