## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I made a mistake in the calculation of $x$.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Algebraic error
 - Substitution error
Solution:
We can solve the system of equations using substitution or elimination method.
Let's use the elimination method to solve the system of equations.
Multiplying the second equation by 3 and adding it to the first equation, we get:
$$\begin{array}{r}3 x+4 y=-23 \\6 y-3 x=-57\end{array}$$
Adding the two equations, we get:
$$7y=-80$$
Therefore, $y=-\frac{80}{7}$.
Substituting $y$ in the second equation, we get:
$$2\left(-\frac{80}{7}\right)-x=-19$$
Simplifying, we get:
$$x=3$$
Therefore, the solution to the system of equations is $(x,y)=(3,-\frac{80}{7})$.
Instructions:
1. Identify the system of equations.
2. Choose a method to solve the system of equations.
3. Work step-by-step through the chosen method.
4. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
5. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always choose a method that you are comfortable with.
 - Always work step-by-step through the chosen method.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that there are multiple methods to solve a system of equations.
