Explanation:
I incorrectly chose the mean as the answer. The range will change the most if the outlier measurement of 24 inches is removed from the data. 
The gap in my knowledge was not in understanding the definitions of mean, median, and range, but in understanding the impact of outliers on these measures of central tendency. 
I knew the definitions of mean, median, and range, but did not consider the impact of outliers on these measures.
Error Keywords:
 - Outlier error
 - Impact of outliers
 - Misunderstanding of measures of central tendency
Solution:
The outlier measurement of 24 inches is an error.
If the outlier is removed, the range will change the most because it is the difference between the largest and smallest values in the data set.
The smallest value is 8 inches and the largest value is 16 inches.
The range is 16 - 8 = 8 inches.
If the outlier is removed, the largest value is 15 inches.
The range is 15 - 8 = 7 inches.
Instructions:
1. Identify the measures of central tendency: mean, median, and range.
2. Identify the outlier in the data set.
3. Consider the impact of the outlier on each measure of central tendency.
4. Remove the outlier from the data set.
5. Recalculate the mean, median, and range.
6. Determine which measure of central tendency changes the most.
7. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always consider the impact of outliers on measures of central tendency.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that the range is the difference between the largest and smallest values in the data set.
 - Remember that the mean is the average of the data set.
 - Remember that the median is the middle value of the data set.
