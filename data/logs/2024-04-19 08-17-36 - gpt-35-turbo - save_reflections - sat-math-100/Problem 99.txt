## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I incorrectly calculated the value of $f(-1)$.
The correct calculation is $f(-1)=\frac{-1+3}{2}=1$.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Substitution error
 - Arithmetic error
Solution:
The function $f(x)$ is defined as $f(x)=\frac{x+3}{2}$.
To find $f(-1)$, substitute $-1$ for $x$ in the function $f(x)$.
$f(-1)=\frac{-1+3}{2}=1$.
Instructions:
1. Identify the function and the value of $x$.
2. Substitute the value of $x$ into the function.
3. Simplify the expression by performing the arithmetic operations.
4. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
5. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always substitute the given value of $x$ into the function.
 - Always simplify the expression by performing the arithmetic operations.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
