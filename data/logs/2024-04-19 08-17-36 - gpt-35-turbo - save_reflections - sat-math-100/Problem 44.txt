## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I correctly identified the area of the entire field and the area of each region. However, I made an error in my calculation of the total number of earthworms. Instead of taking the average number of earthworms per region, I took the sum of the number of earthworms in each region and divided by the number of regions. 
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Average error
 - Addition error
Solution:
The area of the entire field is $10 \text{ m} \times 10 \text{ m} = 100 \text{ m}^2$.
The area of each region is $1 \text{ m} \times 1 \text{ m} = 1 \text{ m}^2$.
There are 10 regions in total.
To approximate the number of earthworms in the entire field, we can take the average number of earthworms per region and multiply it by the total number of regions.
The total number of earthworms is approximately $\frac{107+147+146+135+149+141+150+154+176+166}{10} \cdot 100 = 14,250$.
Instructions:
1. Identify the area of the entire field.
2. Identify the area of each region.
3. Count the number of regions.
4. Calculate the total number of earthworms in all regions.
5. Divide the total number of earthworms by the number of regions to find the average number of earthworms per region.
6. Multiply the average number of earthworms per region by the total number of regions to find the total number of earthworms in the entire field.
7. Round the answer to the nearest reasonable approximation.
8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that the average of a set of numbers is the sum of the numbers divided by the number of numbers in the set.
 - Remember to round your answer to the nearest reasonable approximation.
