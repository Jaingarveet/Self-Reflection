## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I correctly solved the equation, but I misread the question. The question asks for all values of $x$ that satisfy the equation, but I only considered the values given in the choices. 
Error Keywords:
 - Misreading
 - Misinterpreting
 - Not considering all possible solutions
Solution:
We can solve the equation by squaring both sides and then simplifying.
$$\begin{aligned} \sqrt{4 x}&=x-3 \\ 4x&=(x-3)^2 \\ 4x&=x^2-6x+9 \\ x^2-10x+9&=0 \\ (x-1)(x-9)&=0 \end{aligned}$$
So, the solutions are $x=1$ and $x=9$.
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and understand the problem.
2. Solve the equation step-by-step.
3. Consider all possible solutions, not just the ones given in the choices.
4. Check your answer against the choices.
5. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always consider all possible solutions, not just the ones given in the choices.
 - Always double-check your answer against the choices.
 - Remember that the answer choices may not include all possible solutions.
