## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I made an error in simplifying the expression. 
The correct way to simplify $9^{\frac{3}{4}}$ is to recognize that it is equal to $(\sqrt[4]{9})^3$. 
Then, we can simplify $\sqrt[4]{9}$ to $3^{\frac{1}{2}}$ or $\sqrt{3}$, and then cube it to get $3\sqrt{3}$. 
Error Keywords:
 - Simplification error
 - Exponentiation error
 - Misapplication of rules
Solution:
$9^{\frac{3}{4}}$ can be written as $(\sqrt[4]{9})^3$.
$\sqrt[4]{9}$ can be simplified to $3^{\frac{1}{2}}$ or $\sqrt{3}$.
$(\sqrt[4]{9})^3$ is equal to $(\sqrt{3})^3$.
$(\sqrt{3})^3$ is equal to $3\sqrt{3}$.
Instructions:
1. Recognize that $9^{\frac{3}{4}}$ can be written as $(\sqrt[4]{9})^3$.
2. Simplify $\sqrt[4]{9}$ to $3^{\frac{1}{2}}$ or $\sqrt{3}$.
3. Cube the result from step 2 to get $3\sqrt{3}$.
4. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always simplify expressions step-by-step.
 - Always apply the rules of exponents carefully.
 - Always double-check your simplification and calculations.
 - Remember that $(a^b)^c$ is equal to $a^{bc}$.
