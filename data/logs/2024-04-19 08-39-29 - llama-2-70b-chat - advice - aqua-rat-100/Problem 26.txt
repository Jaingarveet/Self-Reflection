## Assistant 2:
  My previous answer was incorrect because I made a mistake in my calculation. I misunderstood the formula for finding the perimeter of a rectangle and used the formula for the area instead.

The correct formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is P = 2(l + w), where l is the length and w is the width.

In this case, the length of the wire is 27 cm, and the width is 17 cm. Therefore, the perimeter of the wire before it is bent into a square is P = 2(27 + 17) = 2 x 44 = 88 cm.

After the wire is bent into a square, each side of the square will have a length equal to half the perimeter of the original rectangle. Therefore, the length of each side of the square is (88/2) = 44 cm.

So, the correct answer is (B) 11 cm.

Action: Answer("B")
