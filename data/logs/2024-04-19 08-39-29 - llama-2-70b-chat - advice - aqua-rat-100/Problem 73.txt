## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Assistant 2:
  My previous response:
Answer: C: 600

My reflection:
I made a mistake in my previous response. I didn't consider the fact that the number of students who took physics and math together should be a subset of the total number of students in the school.

Let's analyze the problem again:
We know that 20% of the students took physics, which means that 80% did not take physics.
We also know that 28% of the students took math, which means that 72% did not take math.
We can assume that there are x students in the school.

We can calculate the number of students who took physics as 20% of x: 0.2x.
We can calculate the number of students who took math as 28% of x: 0.28x.

Since some students took both physics and math, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 0.2x and 0.28x.
The LCM of 0.2x and 0.28x is 0.056x.

Now, we need to find the least possible value of x that satisfies the condition that 0.056x is an integer.
We can start by trying the smallest possible values of x: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
We can see that 0.056x is an integer when x = 5.

Therefore, the least possible number of students in the school is 500 (since we cannot have a fraction of a student).
