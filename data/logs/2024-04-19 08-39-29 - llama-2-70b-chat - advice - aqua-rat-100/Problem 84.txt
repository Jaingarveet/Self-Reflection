## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Advice:
- Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
- Always list out all possible options before selecting an answer.
- Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
- In combinatorics problems, consider all possible outcomes and count them carefully.
- Remember that the order of elements in a sequence matters.
## Assistant 2:
  My previous answer was incorrect, and I realized that I made a mistake in my calculation.
I incorrectly calculated the number of ways to arrange the children as 6, which is the number of ways to arrange 3 objects in a row.
However, the question specifically states that Susan must be on the left of Tim, which reduces the number of ways to arrange the children.

To solve this problem correctly, I should have listed out all possible options:
1. Susan, Tim, Zen
2. Susan, Zen, Tim
3. Tim, Susan, Zen
4. Tim, Zen, Susan
5. Zen, Susan, Tim
6. Zen, Tim, Susan

As you can see, there are only 3 ways to arrange the children so that Susan is on the left of Tim.
Therefore, the correct answer is C: 3.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
