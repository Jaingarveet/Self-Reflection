## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly.
I realized that I made a mistake in my calculation.
I misunderstood the problem and calculated the perimeter of the rectangular piece instead of the original square piece.
I also realized that I didn't check my answer to ensure it was reasonable and made sense in the context of the problem.

Action: Answer("B")

Explanation:
Let's call the side length of the original square piece "s".
The area of each triangle is given as 70 square feet, so the area of the rectangular piece is 70/2 = 350 square feet.
The perimeter of the rectangular piece is 2(s - 4) + 2s = 4s - 8 + 2s = 6s - 8.
Since the original piece was a square, its perimeter is equal to the side length squared, so s^2 = 6s - 8.
Solving for s, we get s = 8.
Therefore, the perimeter of the original piece of square cloth was 8^2 = 64 feet.

The correct answer is choice E: 64.

I hope this answer is correct, and I apologize for any confusion caused by my previous mistake.
## Result:
