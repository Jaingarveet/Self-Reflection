## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

## Assistant 2:
  Sure, here's a revised version of the reflection that includes the correct answer and explanation:

Reflection:
Previously, I incorrectly answered this question as choice B, y3/x2 units.
However, upon reflection, I realized that I made a mistake in my calculation.
The correct answer is choice A, x2/y2 units.

To solve this problem, we need to set up a proportion:
Let x men working x hours per day complete x units of work in x days.
Let y men working y hours per day complete y units of work in y days.

We can set up a proportion using the number of units completed per day:
x units/day = y units/day

We know that x men working x hours per day complete x units of work in x days,
So x units/day = x/x = 1.

Similarly, y men working y hours per day complete y units of work in y days,
So y units/day = y/y = 1.

Now we can set up a proportion using the number of men and hours per day:
x men x hours/day = y men y hours/day

We know that x men working x hours per day complete x units of work in x days,
So x men x hours/day = x2.

Similarly, y men working y hours per day complete y units of work in y days,
So y men y hours/day = y2.

Now we can solve for the number of units completed by y men working y hours per day in y days:
y units = y2/x2 x units

Plugging in the values, we get:
y units = (y2/x2) x units

Therefore, the correct answer is choice A, x2/y2 units.

I made a mistake in my previous answer by not setting up the proportion correctly and not paying attention to the units.
I hope this reflection helps me avoid similar mistakes in the future.

Action: Answer("A")
