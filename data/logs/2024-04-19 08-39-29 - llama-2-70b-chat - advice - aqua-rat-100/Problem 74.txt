## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Assistant 2:
  My previous answer was incorrect because I made a mistake in my calculation. I misunderstood the question and thought it was asking about the number of triangles that could be formed by joining 4 of the points.

To find the correct answer, I need to consider the number of ways to choose 4 points from the 6 points (A, B, C, D, E, and F) and the number of ways to form a quadrilateral with those 4 points.

There are 6C4 ways to choose 4 points from the 6 points:

6C4 = 6! / (4! \* 2!) = 15

For each set of 4 points, there is only one way to form a quadrilateral, since the 4 points are coplanar and lie in a straight line.

Therefore, the total number of different quadrilaterals that can be formed by joining 4 of the points A, B, C, D, E, and F is 15.

Action: Answer("B")
