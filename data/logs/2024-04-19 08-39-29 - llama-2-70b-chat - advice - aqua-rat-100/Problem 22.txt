Advice:
- Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
- Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
- Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
- Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
- Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
- Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them.
- In a problem involving rates, make sure to use the correct units for the rates.
## Assistant 2:
  My previous answer was incorrect because I made a mistake in my calculation. I added 7 and 9 instead of multiplying them.
The rate at which Alex and Jacob make toys is 7 and 9 toys per hour, respectively.
Since they work for almost the same number of hours, let's say Alex works for x hours, then Jacob works for x+2 hours.
The total number of toys they make is 35.
The number of toys Alex makes is 7x.
The number of toys Jacob makes is 9(x+2).
Since they make a total of 35 toys, we can set up the equation:
7x + 9(x+2) = 35

Expanding and simplifying the equation:
7x + 9x + 18 = 35
16x + 18 = 35
16x = 17
x = 17/16

Now we can find out how many toys Jacob makes:
9(x+2) = 9(17/16 + 2) = 9(19) = 171

Therefore, the number of toys Jacob makes is 171.
