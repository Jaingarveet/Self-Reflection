## Assistant 2:
  My apologies for my previous mistake. Let's break down the problem step by step:
Roy has been given 5 tablets and has been asked to take one tablet every 15 minutes.
To find the total time taken to consume all 5 tablets, we need to calculate 5 x 15 minutes.
When we multiply 5 by 15, we get 75 minutes.
Therefore, the answer is B: 75 minutes.

Action: Answer("B")
