## Assistant 2:
  My previous answer was incorrect because I made a mistake in my calculation. I misunderstood the problem and calculated the wrong percentage.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The man spends Rs. 3500 per month.
2. He saves 12 1/2% of his income.

To find his monthly income, we need to calculate the amount he saves first:

12 1/2% of his income = 0.125 x income

Now, we know that he saves Rs. 3500 per month, so:

0.125 x income = 3500

Now, dividing both sides by 0.125:

Income = 3500 / 0.125

Income = 28,000

Now, we have found his monthly income, which is Rs. 28,000.

Action: Answer("B")
