## Assistant 2:
  My apologies for my previous mistake. Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The total amount of money is Rs 8600.
2. Each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew.
3. Each son receives five times as much as each nephew.

Let's assume the amount each nephew receives is x.

1. The total amount of money is Rs 8600.
2. Each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, so each daughter receives 4x.
3. Each son receives five times as much as each nephew, so each son receives 5x.

The total amount of money distributed among the daughters and sons is:
4x + 5x = 9x.

Since there are 5 sons and 4 daughters, the total amount of money distributed among them is:
9x / 9 = x.

So, each daughter receives 4x, and each son receives 5x.

Now, we can calculate the amount each daughter receives:
4x = Rs 8600 / 4 = Rs 2150.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: E
Score: 0
