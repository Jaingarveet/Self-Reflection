## Assistant 2:
  My previous answer was incorrect, and after reflecting on the problem, I realized that I made a mistake in my calculation.
The profit made by the grocer is 25% of the selling price, which means the cost price of each bag of flour is $100 / (1 + 0.25) = $80.
The total cost of the bags sold is $80 x number of bags = $8000.
The profit made by the grocer is $3000, so the total revenue is $8000 + $3000 = $11,000.
The number of bags sold is $11,000 / $100 = 110 bags.
The correct answer is B: 16 bags.

Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
