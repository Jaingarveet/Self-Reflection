## Assistant 2:
  My previous answer was incorrect because I made a mistake in my calculation. I misunderstood the question and thought it was asking for the number of men required to complete the same work in 6 days instead of 1/2 day.

To solve this problem, we need to find the number of men required to complete the same work in 1/2 day. We can start by finding the number of men required to complete the work in 1 day.

8 men can complete the work in 6 days, so 1 man can complete the work in 6 days x 8 men = 48 men.

Now, we need to find the number of men required to complete the work in 1/2 day.

1/2 day is equal to 12 hours, so we need to find the number of men required to complete the work in 12 hours.

48 men can complete the work in 24 hours, so 1 man can complete the work in 24 hours / 48 men = 1/2 man.

Therefore, the number of men required to complete the same work in 1/2 day is 1/2 man, which rounds up to 1 man.
