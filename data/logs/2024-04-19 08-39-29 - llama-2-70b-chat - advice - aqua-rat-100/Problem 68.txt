## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Advice:

* Always double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
* Make sure to consider all possible factorizations of a number before making a conclusion.
* Use a systematic approach to factoring, such as factoring by prime factors or common factors.
* Take your time and work carefully through each step of the problem.
## Assistant 2:
  My previous answer was incorrect because I made a mistake in my calculation. I incorrectly found the greatest common factor of 350 and 7700, which led to the wrong answer.

Let's reflect on the problem:
The greatest common factor of two positive integers is 11. The least common multiple of these two integers is 7700. If one of the integers is 350, what is the other?

I will start by factoring 350:
350 = 2 x 3 x 5 x 7

Now, I will factor 7700:
7700 = 2 x 2 x 5 x 5 x 7

The greatest common factor of 350 and 7700 is indeed 11, as previously stated.

Now, let's find the other integer:
We know that 350 and the other integer have an LCM of 7700. Therefore, the other integer must be a multiple of 7700/350 = 22.

The only choice that is a multiple of 22 is:
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
