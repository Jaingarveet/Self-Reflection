## Assistant 2:
  My previous answer was incorrect because I made a mistake in my calculation. I misunderstood the information given in the question and calculated the time taken by Mr. Blue to complete the contract incorrectly.

Let's break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. Mr. Brown paints a house in 6 days.
2. Mr. Brown goes on vacation after 8 days.
3. Mr. Black starts working for a period of 6 days.
4. Mr. Blue paints a house in 12 days.

Now, let's calculate the time taken by Mr. Blue to complete the contract:

1. Mr. Blue starts painting a house after Mr. Brown goes on vacation, so the time taken by Mr. Blue to complete the contract is 12 - 8 = 4 days.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 10 days.

Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
