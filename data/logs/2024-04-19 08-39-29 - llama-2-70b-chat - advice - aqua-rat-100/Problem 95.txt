## Assistant 2:
  My apologies for my previous mistake. Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. John replaces 15% of the 50% strong milk tea with milk twice.

After the first replacement, the concentration of tea is:
50% - (15% of 50%) = 50% - 7.5% = 42.5%

After the second replacement, the concentration of tea is:
42.5% - (15% of 42.5%) = 42.5% - 6.375% = 36.125%

2. Then, he replaces 10% of the resultant solution with more milk.

The concentration of tea after this step is:
36.125% - (10% of 36.125%) = 36.125% - 3.6125% = 32.51%

The final concentration of tea John drinks is 32.51%.

Action: Answer("E")
