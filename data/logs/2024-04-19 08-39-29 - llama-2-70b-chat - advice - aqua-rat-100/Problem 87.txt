## Assistant 2:
  My previous answer was incorrect because I made a mistake in my calculation. I misunderstood the concept of permutation and combination.

The correct answer is C: 120.

The formula for the number of ways to choose 2 oranges from 10 oranges is C(10, 2) = 10! / (2! x 8!) = 120.

I will double-check my calculations to ensure accuracy.
