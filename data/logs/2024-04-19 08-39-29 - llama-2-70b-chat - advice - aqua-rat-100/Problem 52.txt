## Assistant 2:
  My previous answer was incorrect because I made a mistake in my calculation. I misunderstood the question and used the wrong ratio to find the proportion of zinc and copper in alloy Z.

To find the ratio of zinc and copper in alloy Z, we need to find the proportion of zinc and copper in each alloy, X and Y, and then use those proportions to find the proportion of zinc and copper in alloy Z.

The proportion of zinc in alloy X is 6/15, and the proportion of copper in alloy X is 9/15.
The proportion of zinc in alloy Y is 7/18, and the proportion of copper in alloy Y is 11/18.

To find the proportion of zinc and copper in alloy Z, we can set up a system of linear equations using the proportions of zinc and copper in each alloy:
Let Z be the proportion of zinc in alloy Z, and C be the proportion of copper in alloy Z.
We know that Z + C = 1 (since zinc and copper add up to 100%)
We can write the equation for the proportion of zinc in alloy Z as:
Z = (40 grams of alloy X) / (40 grams of alloy X + 60 grams of alloy Y)
Z = (6/15) / (6/15 + 7/18)
Z = 6/15 / (6/15 + 7/18)
Z = 6/15 / 13/15
Z = 6/13

We can write the equation for the proportion of copper in alloy Z as:
C = (9/15) / (6/15 + 7/18)
C = 9/15 / (6/15 + 7/18)
C = 9/15 / 13/15
C = 9/13

Now we have the system of linear equations:
Z + C = 1
Z = 6/13
C = 9/13

Solving for Z and C, we get:
Z = 59/91
C = 9/91

Therefore, the ratio of zinc and copper in alloy Z is 59:91.
