## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
From the context, we know that:
1. Only companies with dividends can issue new stocks.
2. If a company has a dividend, it does not need funds.
3. If it needs financing, there is no way to pay dividends.
From these, we can infer that:
- A company that needs financing cannot have dividends (from 2 and 3).
- A company that does not have dividends cannot issue new stocks (from 1).
So, the statement "A listed company needs financing, or a company without dividends" cannot be false, because if a company needs financing, it must be a company without dividends, and vice versa.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
