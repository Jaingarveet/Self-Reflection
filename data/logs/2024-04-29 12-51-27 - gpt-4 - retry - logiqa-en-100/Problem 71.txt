## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The contradiction here is that while a majority of respondents favor college students as nannies, a similar majority would not hire them as such. We need to find a reason that explains this contradiction. 
Choice A does not explain the contradiction because it does not address why people who favor college students as nannies would not hire them. 
Choice B could explain the contradiction if the salary they are willing to pay is considered too low for college students, but this is not explicitly stated. 
Choice C does not explain the contradiction because it only provides reasons why people favor college students as nannies, not why they would not hire them. 
Choice D does not explain the contradiction because it only provides reasons why some people do not approve of college students being nannies, not why people who do approve would not hire them.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
