## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The Human Resources Department is not above the Administration Department, which means it must be below it. Since the Administration Department is above the Planning Department and below the Human Resources Department, the Planning Department must be on the first floor, the Administration Department on the second floor, and the Human Resources Department on the third floor. The Finance Department is next to the Planning Department, so it must be on the fourth floor. The Sales Department is not adjacent to the Human Resources Department, so it must be on the fifth or sixth floor. The Research and Development Department will occupy the remaining floor.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
