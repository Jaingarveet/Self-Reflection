Thought: 
From the context, we know that paper E cannot be used. This means that paper F can be used and paper K is not necessary. From rule (2), we know that either paper G or paper H can be used, but not both. From rule (3), since paper G is not necessary, paper K is also not necessary. From rule (4), since paper E is not used, paper J can be used.
