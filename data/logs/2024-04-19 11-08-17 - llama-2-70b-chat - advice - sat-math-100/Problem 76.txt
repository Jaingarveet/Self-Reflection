## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

## Assistant 2:
  My previous answer was incorrect because I made a mistake in my calculation. I misunderstood the question and didn't read it carefully.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. We are given two equivalent ratios: $\frac{5}{x} = \frac{15}{x+20}$
2. We can cross-multiply and simplify: $5x = 15(x+20)$
3. We can expand and simplify: $5x = 15x + 300$
4. We can subtract 15x from both sides: $5x - 15x = 300$
5. We can simplify: $-10x = 300$
6. We can divide both sides by -10: $\frac{x}{5} = 30$

So, the correct answer is B: 5.

Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: C
