## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

- Simplify the equation to avoid confusion.
- Practice using the formula for the equation of a circle to become more comfortable with it.
## Assistant 2:
  My previous answer was incorrect because I made a mistake in the formula. I must have gotten confused and used the formula for the equation of a sphere instead of a circle.
The correct formula for the equation of a circle with center $(a, b)$ and radius $r$ is:
$(x-a)^2 + (y-b)^2 = r^2$

Now, let's apply this formula to the given circle:
Center: $(5, 7)$
Radius: 2

So, the equation of the circle is:
$(x-5)^2 + (y-7)^2 = 2^2$

Simplifying, we get:
$(x-5)^2 + (y-7)^2 = 4$

Therefore, the correct answer is:
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
