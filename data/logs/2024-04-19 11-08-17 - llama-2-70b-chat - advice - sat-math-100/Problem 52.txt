## Assistant 2:
  My previous answer was incorrect because I made a mistake in my calculation. I misunderstood the problem and used the wrong variables in my calculation.
Let's break down the problem step by step:
1. Type A trees produced 20% more pears than Type B trees.
2. Type A trees produced 144 pears.
3. To find the number of pears produced by Type B trees, we need to subtract 20% of 144 from 144.
4. 20% of 144 is 28.8 (rounded to the nearest whole number is 29).
5. Subtracting 29 from 144 gives us 115.
Therefore, the correct answer is A: 115.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
