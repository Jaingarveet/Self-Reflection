## Assistant 2:
  My previous answer was incorrect because I made a mistake in my calculation. I added $0.25 x$ and $0.40 x$ instead of adding $b$ and $c$.
The correct way to find when the price per pound of beef is equal to the price per pound of chicken is to set $b$ equal to $c$ and solve for $x$.
So, we have:
$$2.35 + 0.25 x = 1.75 + 0.40 x$$
Subtracting $0.25 x$ from both sides gives:
$$2.10 = 1.35 + 0.40 x$$
Subtracting $1.35$ from both sides gives:
$$0.75 = 0.40 x$$
Dividing both sides by $0.40$ gives:
$$1.875 = x$$
Now, we need to find the price per pound of beef when $x = 1.875$.
We can do this by substituting $x = 1.875$ into the equation for $b$:
$$b = 2.35 + 0.25(1.875) = 2.35 + 0.46875 = 2.81875$$
So, the price per pound of beef when it was equal to the price per pound of chicken was $\$2.81875$.
The correct answer is (B) $\$2.85$.

Action: Answer("B")
