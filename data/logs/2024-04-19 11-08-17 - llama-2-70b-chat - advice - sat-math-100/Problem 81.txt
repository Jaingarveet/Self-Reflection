## Assistant 2:
  My previous answer was incorrect because I made a mistake in my calculation. I added 4z + 8y instead of using the distributive property to expand the expression.

The correct answer is choice D: $(4a + 8b)^2$.

To get this answer, we can start with the given equation $a^2 + b^2 = z$ and $ab = y$.

First, we can expand the right-hand side of the second equation: $ab = y$ as $a(b) = y$.

Next, we can substitute this expression for $y$ into the first equation: $a^2 + b^2 = z$ to get $a^2 + (a(b))^2 = z$.

Using the distributive property, we can expand the expression $(a(b))^2$ as $(ab)^2 = a^2b^2$.

Therefore, we have $a^2 + a^2b^2 = z$.

Simplifying, we get $2a^2 + 2b^2 = z$.

Finally, we can rewrite this expression as $(2a + 2b)^2 = z$.

Since we are asked to find an equivalent expression for $4z + 8y$, we can rewrite $(2a + 2b)^2$ as $(4a + 8b)^2$ to get the desired expression.

Therefore, the correct answer is choice D: $(4a + 8b)^2$.
