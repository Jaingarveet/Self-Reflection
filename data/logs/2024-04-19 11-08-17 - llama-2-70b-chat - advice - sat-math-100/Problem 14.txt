## Assistant 2:
  My previous answer was incorrect because I made a mistake in my calculation. I misunderstood the values of $x$ and $y$ in the table and wrote the equation of the line in the wrong form.

Let's analyze the table again carefully. The table shows that $x$ increases by $a$ when $y$ decreases by $a$. Therefore, the relationship between $x$ and $y$ is linear, and we can write the equation of the line in the slope-intercept form, which is $y=mx+b$.

We can see that the slope of the line is $m=-1/2$, as the ratio of the change in $y$ to the change in $x$ is $-1/2$. Therefore, the equation of the line is $y=-(1/2)x+b$.

Now, let's check the given options:

Option A: $x+2y=a$
This equation is not in the slope-intercept form, and it does not match the relationship between $x$ and $y$ in the table. Therefore, this is not the correct equation.

Option B: $x+2y=5a$
This equation is also not in the slope-intercept form, and it does not match the relationship between $x$ and $y$ in the table. Therefore, this is not the correct equation.

Option C: $2x-y=-5a$
This equation is in the slope-intercept form, and the slope matches the slope of the line we calculated earlier, which is $-1/2$. The $y$-intercept is $-5a$, which is not the same as the $b$ we calculated earlier. However, we can see that the line represented by this equation passes through the point $(0,0)$, which means that $b=0$. Therefore, this is the correct equation.

Option D: $2x-y=7a$
This equation is also in the slope-intercept form, but the slope does not match the slope of the line we calculated earlier, which is $-1/2$. Therefore, this is not the correct equation.

Action: Answer("C")
