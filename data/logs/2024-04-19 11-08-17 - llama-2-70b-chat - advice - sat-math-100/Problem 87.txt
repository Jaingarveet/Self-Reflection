## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Advice:
- Always double-check your calculations, especially when working with square roots.
- Make sure to simplify your answer to the correct number of significant figures.
- Use the correct formula for the distance between two points in the plane.
## Assistant 2:
  My previous answer was incorrect, and I realize that I made a mistake in my calculation. I mistakenly took the square root of the sum of the squares of the distances between the two points instead of taking the square root of the sum of the squares of the differences between the coordinates of the two points.

The correct formula for the distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is:

distance = sqrt((x2-x1)^2 + (y2-y1)^2)

Now, let's apply this formula to find the length of $\overline{AB}$:

(x1, y1) = (11, 0)
(x2, y2) = (11, 25)

distance = sqrt((11-11)^2 + (25-0)^2)
distance = sqrt(0 + 625)
distance = sqrt(625)
distance = 25

So, the length of $\overline{AB}$ is 25.

Action: Answer("B")
