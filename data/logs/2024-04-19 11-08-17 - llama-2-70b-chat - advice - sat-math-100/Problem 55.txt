# Model: llama-2-70b-chat | Agent: advice | Exam: sat-math-100 | Problem 55 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: $$y=-(x-3)^{2}+a$$In the equation above, $a$ is a constant. The graph of the equation in the $x y$-plane is a parabola. Which of the following is true about the parabola?
Choices:
  A: Its minimum occurs at $(-3, a)$.
  B: Its minimum occurs at $(3, a)$.
  C: Its maximum occurs at $(-3, a)$.
  D: Its maximum occurs at $(3, a)$.
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Advice:
 - Always graph the parabola to visualize its nature and identify its minimum or maximum.
 - Always double-check your answer by plugging in the $x$-coordinate into the equation.
 - Remember that the minimum value of a quadratic function occurs at the vertex of the parabola, which can be found by setting the first derivative equal to zero and solving for $x$.

My previous answer was incorrect because I made a mistake in my calculation. I incorrectly identified the minimum value of the parabola.

The correct answer is B: Its minimum occurs at $(3, a)$.

My reasoning is as follows:

1. The equation of the parabola is $y=-(x-3)^{2}+a$.
2. To find the minimum value of the parabola, I need to find the vertex of the parabola.
3. The vertex of the parabola occurs when the first derivative of the function is equal to zero.
4. The first derivative of the function is $f'(x)=-2(x-3)$.
5. Setting $f'(x)=0$ and solving for $x$ gives $x=3$.
6. Therefore, the minimum value of the parabola occurs at $(3, a)$.

Action: Answer("B")
