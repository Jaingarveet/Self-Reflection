## Assistant 2:
  My previous answer was incorrect because I made a mistake in my calculation. I squared both sides of the equation instead of taking the square root of both sides.

To solve the equation, we need to isolate the variable x. We can start by taking the square root of both sides of the equation:

$$\sqrt{4x} = x - 3$$

$$4x = (x - 3)^2$$

$$4x = x^2 - 6x + 9$$

Now, we can expand the right-hand side of the equation:

$$4x = x^2 - 6x + 9$$

$$4x = (x - 3)(x + 3)$$

Now, we can factor the left-hand side of the equation:

$$4x = (x - 3)(x + 3)$$

We can see that (x - 3) and (x + 3) are both factors of 4x, so we can set them equal to each other:

$$x - 3 = 0$$

$$x + 3 = 0$$

Now, we can solve for x:

$$x - 3 = 0 \Rightarrow x = 3$$

$$x + 3 = 0 \Rightarrow x = -3$$

So, the values of x that satisfy the equation are x = 3 and x = -3.

Action: Answer("C")
