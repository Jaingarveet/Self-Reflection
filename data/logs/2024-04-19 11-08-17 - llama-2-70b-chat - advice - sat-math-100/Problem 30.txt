You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Context: $$.\begin{aligned}.& S(P)=\frac{1}{2} P+40 \\.& D(P)=220-P.\end{aligned}.$$.The quantity of a product supplied and the quantity of the product demanded in an economic market are functions of the price of the product. The functions above are the estimated supply and demand functions for a certain product. The function $S(P)$ gives the quantity of the product supplied to the market when the price is $P$ dollars, and the function $D(P)$ gives the quantity of the product demanded by the market when the price is $P$ dollars.
Question: How will the quantity of the product supplied to the market change if the price of the product is increased by $\$ 10$ ?
Choices:
  A: The quantity supplied will decrease by 5 units.
  B: The quantity supplied will increase by 5 units.
  C: The quantity supplied will increase by 10 units.
  D: The quantity supplied will increase by 50 units.

* Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
* Always verify your answer by plugging it back into the original equation.
## Assistant 2:
  My previous answer was incorrect because I made a mistake in my calculation. I misunderstood the meaning of the coefficients in the supply function and demand function.

The supply function is given by $S(P) = \frac{1}{2} P + 40$. To find the quantity supplied when the price is increased by $\$ 10$, we need to substitute $P + 10$ into the function:

$S(P + 10) = \frac{1}{2} (P + 10) + 40$

Expanding and simplifying, we get:

$S(P + 10) = \frac{1}{2} P + 10 + 40$

Comparing this with the original function $S(P)$, we can see that the coefficient of $P$ has changed from $\frac{1}{2}$ to $\frac{1}{2} + 10$. This means that the quantity supplied will increase by 10 units for every unit increase in price.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: B
