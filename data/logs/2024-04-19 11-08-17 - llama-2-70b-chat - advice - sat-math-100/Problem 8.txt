## Assistant 2:
  My previous answer was incorrect because I made a mistake in my calculation. I misunderstood the problem and wrote the equation incorrectly.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The original price of the laptop was $p dollars.
2. The store gave a 20% discount, so the discounted price was $p \* 0.8 = 0.8p dollars.
3. The 8% sales tax was applied to the discounted price, so the total amount Alma paid to the cashier was $0.8p \* 1.08 = 0.872p dollars.
4. Now, we can write an equation to represent the original price of the laptop in terms of the amount Alma paid:

p = 0.872p

Simplifying the equation:

p = 0.872p

p / 0.872 = p

p / 0.872 - p = 0

0.872p - p = 0

0.128p = 0

Since p is a positive number, we can divide both sides by 0.128:

p = 8

Therefore, the original price of the laptop was $800.

Action: Answer("B")
