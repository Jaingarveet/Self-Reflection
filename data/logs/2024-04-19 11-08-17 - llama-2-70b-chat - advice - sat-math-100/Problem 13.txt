## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Advice:

* Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
* Be cautious when squaring both sides of an equation, as it can introduce errors.
* Check your calculations carefully, especially when solving for a constant.
* Use the correct order of operations when solving equations.
* Double-check your final answer to ensure it is correct.
## Assistant 2:
  My apologies for my previous mistake. Let's try again.

The equation is:

$$\sqrt{k+2}-x=0$$

If $x=9$, we can substitute this into the equation:

$$\sqrt{k+2}-9=0$$

Squaring both sides gives:

$$k+2-9=0$$

Expanding and simplifying:

$$k=7$$

Therefore, the value of $k$ is 7.

Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: D
