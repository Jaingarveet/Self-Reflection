## Assistant 2:
  My previous answer was incorrect because I made a mistake in my calculations. I misunderstood the question and wrote the equations incorrectly.

Let's analyze the system of equations:

$$\begin{aligned}
k x - 3 y &= 4 \\
4 x - 5 y &= 7
\end{aligned}$$

We can solve the system of equations by substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution. Solving the first equation for $x$, we get:

$$x = \frac{4}{k} + \frac{3 y}{k}$$

Substituting this expression for $x$ into the second equation, we get:

$$4 \left(\frac{4}{k} + \frac{3 y}{k}\right) - 5 y = 7$$

Expanding and simplifying, we get:

$$\frac{16}{k} + 4 \frac{3 y}{k} - 5 y = 7$$

Moving all terms to the left-hand side and simplifying, we get:

$$\frac{16}{k} - 5 y = 7$$

Now, we can see that the left-hand side is a constant expression, and the right-hand side is a constant value. For the system of equations to have no solution, the left-hand side must be equal to zero.

Therefore, we have:

$$\frac{16}{k} - 5 y = 0$$

Solving for $k$, we get:

$$k = \frac{16}{5 y}$$

Since $k$ is a constant, $5 y$ must be equal to 16. Therefore, $y$ must be equal to $\frac{16}{5}$.

Now, we can find the value of $k$ by substituting $y$ into one of the original equations. For example, using the first equation, we get:

$$k x - 3 \left(\frac{16}{5}\right) = 4$$

Solving for $k$, we get:

$$k = \frac{4}{3 \cdot \frac{16}{5}} = \frac{4}{16} = \frac{1}{4}$$

Therefore, the value of $k$ that will result in no solution is $\frac{1}{4}$.
