## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Topic: Math
Question: $$h=3 a+28.6$$A pediatrician uses the model above to estimate the height $h$ of a boy, in inches, in terms of the boy's age $a$, in years, between the ages of 2 and 5. Based on the model, what is the estimated increase, in inches, of a boy's height each year?
Choices:
  A: 3
  B: $\quad 5.7$
  C: 9.5
  D: 14.3
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Advice:

* Always pay attention to units when calculating and interpreting slopes.
* Make sure to choose appropriate values for the variables when finding the slope.
* Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
* Use the equation to find the estimated increase in height for a specific age, rather than relying on the slope alone.
## Assistant 2:
  My previous answer was incorrect because I made a mistake in my calculation. I misunderstood the units of measurement and calculated the slope of the equation as 3, which is not correct.
The correct slope of the equation is 5.7, which means that for every year of age, the boy's height increases by 5.7 inches.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
