## User 2:
Topic: Math
Context: $$.a=1,052+1.08 t.$$.The speed of a sound wave in air depends on the air temperature. The formula above shows the relationship between $a$, the speed of a sound wave, in feet per second, and $t$, the air temperature, in degrees Fahrenheit $\left({ }^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\right)$.
Question: At which of the following air temperatures will the speed of a sound wave be closest to 1,000 feet per second?
Choices:
  A: $-46^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$
  B: $-48^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$
  C: $-49^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$
  D: $-50^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$

## Assistant 2:
  My previous answer was incorrect because I made a mistake in my calculation. I misunderstood the formula and wrote it as $a=1,052+1.08t$ instead of $a=1,052+1.08t^2$. I also didn't pay attention to the units of measurement, as the formula has degrees Fahrenheit squared while the choices are in degrees Fahrenheit.

To find the air temperature at which the speed of a sound wave will be closest to 1,000 feet per second, we need to find the value of $t$ that makes $a$ closest to 1,000.

We can start by graphing the function $f(t)=1,052+1.08t^2$ and looking for the point where the graph is closest to 1,000.

The graph of $f(t)$ is a parabola that opens upwards, meaning that the sound wave speed increases as the air temperature increases. The vertex of the parabola is at $t=0$, where the speed of the sound wave is 1,052 feet per second. As we move towards negative temperatures, the speed of the sound wave decreases.

To find the point where the speed of the sound wave is closest to 1,000 feet per second, we can look for the point where the tangent line of the parabola is closest to the x-axis. This occurs at $t=-48.5^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$, where the speed of the sound wave is 996.3 feet per second.

Since we are looking for the closest temperature to 1,000 feet per second, we can round $t=-48.5^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$ to $t=-49^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$, which is the closest choice available.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
