Question: $$h=-4.9 t^{2}+25 t$$The equation above expresses the approximate height $h$, in meters, of a ball $t$ seconds after it is launched vertically upward from the ground with an initial velocity of 25 meters per second. After approximately how many seconds will the ball hit the ground?
Choices:
  A: 3.5
  B: 4.0
  C: 4.5
  D: 5.0

Advice:

* Always double-check your units to ensure they are consistent.
* Be careful when calculating square roots, especially when using a calculator.
* Always round up to the nearest whole number when approximating a solution.
* Take your time and work carefully through calculations to avoid simple mistakes.
## Assistant 2:
  My previous answer was incorrect because I made a mistake in my calculation. I mistakenly took the square root of a negative number, which is not possible.
I have realized that the equation given in the question is a quadratic equation, and to find when the ball hits the ground, I need to find when the height is equal to zero.
So, I will set h = 0 and solve for t:
0 = -4.9t^2 + 25t

I will factor the left-hand side of the equation:
(-4.9t + 12.5)(t - 2) = 0

Now, I will solve for t:
-4.9t + 12.5 = 0
t - 2 = 0

I will add 2 to both sides of the second equation:
t = 2

Now, I will check my answer by plugging t = 2 into the original equation:
h = -4.9(2)^2 + 25(2)
h = -19.8 + 50
h = 30.2

Since the height is positive, I know that the ball has not yet hit the ground. Therefore, I will round up to the nearest whole number, which is 4.
Action: Answer("B")
