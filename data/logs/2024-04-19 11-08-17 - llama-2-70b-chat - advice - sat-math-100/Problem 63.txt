## Assistant 2:
  My apologies for my previous mistake. Let's carefully analyze the problem this time.
Given:
Television price: $300
Initial payment: $\$ 60$
Weekly payment: $\$ 30$

We need to find the number of weekly payments, $w$, required to complete the purchase.

Equation:

We can set up the equation as follows:
Total amount paid = Price of the television
Total amount paid = Initial payment + (Weekly payment x Number of weekly payments)

Now, we can substitute the given values:
Total amount paid = \$ 60 + (\$ 30 x w)

We want to find the number of weekly payments, $w$, that will make the total amount paid equal to the price of the television, \$ 300.

So, we can set up the equation:
\$ 60 + (\$ 30 x w) = \$ 300

Now, we can solve for $w$:
\$ 300 = \$ 60 + (\$ 30 x w)
\$ 300 = \$ 60 + \$ 30w
\$ 300 = \$ 90w

Now, we can divide both sides by \$ 90:
w = \$ 300/\$ 90
w = 3

Therefore, the number of weekly payments required to complete the purchase of the television is 3.

Action: Answer("B")
