# Model: llama-2-70b-chat | Agent: advice | Exam: sat-math-100 | Problem 26 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:
Topic: Geography
Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: $$\begin{aligned}& 3 x^{2}-5 x+2 \\& 5 x^{2}-2 x-6\end{aligned}$$Which of the following is the sum of the two polynomials shown above?
Choices:
  A: $8 x^{2}-7 x-4$
  B: $8 x^{2}+7 x-4$
  C: $8 x^{4}-7 x^{2}-4$
  D: $8 x^{4}+7 x^{2}-4$
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Advice:
- Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
- Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
- Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
- Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
- Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
- Remember that when adding polynomials, you must add the corresponding terms.
- Make sure to combine like terms correctly.
## Assistant 2:
  My previous answer was incorrect because I made a mistake in combining like terms.
I incorrectly added $3 x^{2}$ and $5 x^{2}}$ to get $8 x^{2}$ instead of $8 x^{2} - 2 x^{2} = 6 x^{2}$.
I also incorrectly added $-5 x$ and $-2 x$ to get $-7 x$ instead of $-5 x - 2 x = -7 x.

The correct solution is as follows:

$$\begin{aligned}
& 3 x^{2}-5 x+2 \\
& 5 x^{2}-2 x-6
\end{aligned}$$

Adding the two polynomials, we get:

$$\begin{aligned}
& 3 x^{2}-5 x+2 + 5 x^{2}-2 x-6 \\
& = 6 x^{2} - 7 x - 4 \\
& = 8 x^{2} - 7 x - 4
\end{aligned}$$

Therefore, the sum of the two polynomials is $8 x^{2} - 7 x - 4$, which corresponds to choice A.

Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
