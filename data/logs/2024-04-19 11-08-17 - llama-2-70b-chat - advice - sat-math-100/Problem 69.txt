Question: Alan drives an average of 100 miles each week. His car can travel an average of 25 miles per gallon of gasoline. Alan would like to reduce his weekly expenditure on gasoline by $\$ 5$. Assuming gasoline costs $\$ 4$ per gallon, which equation can Alan use to determine how many fewer average miles, $m$, he should drive each week?
Choices:
  A: $\frac{25}{4} m=95$
  B: $\frac{25}{4} m=5$
  C: $\frac{4}{25} m=95$
  D: $\frac{4}{25} m=5$

## Assistant 2:
  My previous answer was incorrect because I made a mistake in my calculation. I misunderstood the question and solved for the wrong variable.

To solve this problem, we need to find out how many fewer miles Alan should drive to reduce his weekly expenditure on gasoline by $\$ 5$. We know that Alan drives an average of 100 miles per week and that his car can travel an average of 25 miles per gallon of gasoline. We also know that gasoline costs $\$ 4$ per gallon.

Let's break down the problem into smaller parts:

1. First, we need to calculate how much Alan spends on gasoline per week:

Gasoline consumption per week = Total miles driven per week / Miles per gallon
Gasoline consumption per week = 100 / 25 = 4 gallons

Weekly gasoline expenditure = Gasoline consumption per week x Gasoline price per gallon
Weekly gasoline expenditure = 4 x $\$ 4$ = $\$ 16$

2. Next, we need to calculate how much Alan wants to reduce his weekly gasoline expenditure:

Desired reduction in weekly gasoline expenditure = $\$ 5$

3. Now, we can calculate how many fewer miles Alan should drive per week to achieve his desired reduction in gasoline expenditure:

Fewer miles driven per week = (Desired reduction in weekly gasoline expenditure) / (Gasoline price per gallon x Miles per gallon)
Fewer miles driven per week = $\$ 5$ / ($\$ 4$ x 25) = $\$ 5$ / 100 = 0.05

Therefore, Alan should drive 5% fewer miles per week to reduce his weekly gasoline expenditure by $\$ 5$.
