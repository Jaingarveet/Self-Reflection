## Assistant 2:
  Topic: Law
Context: University president
Question: The conclusion of the university president's argument can be properly drawn if which one of the following is assumed?

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly. Upon reflection, I realized that the conclusion of the argument is that the university must market its programs more aggressively to increase enrollment in order to maintain the quality of education.

To determine the assumption that makes the conclusion valid, I analyzed the argument and identified the key premises. The premises are:

1. The university will not maintain the quality of the education it provides if it increases its enrollment.
2. The university will not need to reduce spending next year if it increases its enrollment.

Based on these premises, the conclusion that the university must market its programs more aggressively to increase enrollment in order to maintain the quality of education is valid.

Therefore, the best answer is (C) The university will increase its enrollment if it markets its programs more aggressively.

Answer: (C) The university will increase its enrollment if it markets its programs more aggressively.
