But the press has the right to publish any story of interest to the public unless that story is libelous. So, if a story about a private individual is not libelous, the press has an obligation to publish it, for such information is clearly of interest to the public.

Reflection:

I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I realize now that I made a mistake in my reasoning. Here is my self-reflection:

* I mistakenly assumed that the argument was arguing that the press has an obligation to publish nonlibelous stories about private individuals without prying into their personal lives. However, the argument does not make this claim.
* I also mistakenly assumed that the argument was arguing that one's having a right to do something entails one's having an obligation to do it. However, the argument does not make this claim either.
* I now understand that the argument is actually arguing that the press has an obligation to publish information about the personal lives of private individuals if it is not libelous. This is because such information is clearly of interest to the public.
