Context: Violent crime in this town is becoming a serious problem. Compared to last year, local law enforcement agencies have responded to 17 percent more calls involving violent crimes, showing that the average citizen of this town is more likely than ever to become a victim of a violent crime.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument?
Choices:

  B: In general, persons under the age of 65 are less likely to be victims of violent crimes than persons over the age of 65.
  C: As a result of the town's community outreach programs, more people than ever are willing to report violent crimes to the proper authorities.
  D: In response to worries about violent crime, the town has recently opened a community center providing supervised activities for teenagers.

## Assistant 2:
  Thought: I previously answered that the opening of the community center in response to worries about violent crime (Option D) most seriously weakens the argument. However, upon further reflection, I realize that the correct answer is Option E: Community officials have shown that a relatively small number of repeat offenders commit the majority of violent crimes in the town.

Explanation: The passage states that local law enforcement agencies have responded to 17 percent more calls involving violent crimes compared to last year, indicating an increase in violent crime. Option E provides a plausible explanation for this increase, as it suggests that a small number of repeat offenders are responsible for the majority of violent crimes in the town. This means that the increase in violent crime is not necessarily a result of a broader problem in the town, but rather the actions of a few individuals.

In contrast, Options A and B do not provide a clear explanation for the increase in violent crime. Option A suggests that the overall crime rate in the town may have risen slightly, which does not necessarily address the specific issue of violent crime. Option B suggests that younger people are less likely to be victims of violent crimes, which does not account for the fact that the majority of violent crime victims are over the age of 65. Option C suggests that more people are willing to report violent crimes, which could potentially lead to an increase in reported violent crimes, but does not address the underlying cause of the increase.

Therefore, the correct answer is Option E: Community officials have shown that a relatively small number of repeat offenders commit the majority of violent crimes in the town.
