Context: Patricia: During Japan's Tokugawa period, martial arts experts known as ninjas were trained for the purposes of espionage and assassination. Yet at that time there was actually very little ninja activity in Japan, and most Japanese did not fear ninjas. Tamara: That is not true. Many wealthy Japanese during the Tokugawa period had their houses constructed with intentionally squeaky floors so that they would receive warning if a ninja were in the house.
Question: Of the following, which one, if true, is the strongest counter Patricia can make to Tamara's objection?
Choices:
  A: Many poor Japanese during the Tokugawa period also had houses constructed with intentionally squeaky floors.
  B: As part of their secret training, ninjas learned to walk on squeaky floors without making a sound.
  C: The wealthy made up a small portion of Japan's population during the Tokugawa period.
  D: The fighting prowess of ninjas was exaggerated to mythic proportions in the years following the Tokngawa period.
  E: There were very few ninjas at any time other than during the Tokugawa period.

Question: Of the following, which one, if true, is the strongest counter Patricia can make to Tamara's objection?

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand the mistake. Here is my reflection on the problem and my revised answer:

The correct answer is (B) As part of their secret training, ninjas learned to walk on squeaky floors without making a sound.

Patricia can make this counterargument to Tamara's objection by pointing out that while there may not have been much ninja activity in Japan during the Tokugawa period, the ninjas themselves were trained to be stealthy and silent, including on squeaky floors. This suggests that the fear of ninjas among the general population may have been exaggerated.

The other options do not provide a strong counterargument:

(A) Many poor Japanese during the Tokugawa period also had houses constructed with intentionally squeaky floors. While this may be true, it does not address the issue of the general population's fear of ninjas.

(C) The wealthy made up a small portion of Japan's population during the Tokugawa period. While this is true, it does not necessarily mean that the fear of ninjas was exaggerated among the general population.

(D) The fighting prowess of ninjas was exaggerated to mythic proportions in the years following the Tokugawa period. While this may be true, it does not address the issue of the fear of ninjas during the Tokugawa period itself.

(E) There were very few ninjas at any time other than during the Tokugawa period. While this is true, it does not necessarily mean that the fear of ninjas was exaggerated among the general population during the Tokugawa period.

In conclusion, the strongest counterargument to Tamara's objection is that ninjas were trained to be stealthy and silent, including on squeaky floors, which suggests that the fear of ninjas among the general population may have been exaggerated.
