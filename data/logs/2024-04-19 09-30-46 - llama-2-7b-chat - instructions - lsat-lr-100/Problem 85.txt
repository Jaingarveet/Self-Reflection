Context: Ditalgame Corporation's computer video games are subject to widespread illegal copying. To combat this piracy, Ditalgame will begin using a new copy protection feature on its games.

  C: The copy protection feature causes a copied game to be playable just long enough for most people to come to enjoy it so much that they decide they have to have it.

  Topic: Law
Question: Which one of the following, if true, provides the most support for the president's prediction?

Reflection:
Initial Answer: I previously answered this question incorrectly. I selected choice (C) as the correct answer. However, upon further reflection, I realize that this answer is not supported by the given information.

Correct Answer: The most support for the president's prediction is provided by choice (A). According to the passage, Ditalgame has spent millions of dollars developing the new copy protection feature, and the company can recoup these costs only if its sales increase substantially. This suggests that the new copy protection feature will help increase sales, which in turn will help Ditalgame recoup its investment.

Explanation:
The passage does not provide any information to support choices (B), (C), or (D). Choice (B) is irrelevant to the discussion, as the passage does not provide any information about the market size or Ditalgame's share of it. Choice (C) is also not supported by the passage, as it suggests that the copy protection feature will cause people to enjoy the game so much that they decide they have to have it, which is not a reliable way to increase sales. Choice (D) is also not relevant, as there is no information provided about Game Review Monthly's opinion on Ditalgame's games.
