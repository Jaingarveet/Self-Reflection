Context: The number of tornadoes recorded annually in North America has more than tripled since 1953. Yet meteorologists insist that the climatic factors affecting the creation of tornadoes are unchanged.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to resolve the apparent discrepancy described above?
Choices:
  A: The factors affecting the creation of tornadoes were not well known to meteorologists before 1953.
  B: The intensity of the average tornado is greater now than it was in 1953.
  C: The number of tornadoes recorded annually has increased only slightly in the last five years.
  D: The amount of property damage done by tornadoes has grown substantially since 1953.
  E: Many more citizens are helping authorities detect tornadoes now than in 1953.

## Assistant 2:
  Thought: I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I realize that I misunderstood the information provided. The correct answer is (B) The intensity of the average tornado is greater now than it was in 1953.

Self-reflection: I mistakenly selected (A) The factors affecting the creation of tornadoes were not well known to meteorologists before 1953. However, upon further reflection, I understand that the passage does not suggest that meteorologists were unaware of the factors affecting tornadoes before 1953. Instead, it implies that the intensity of tornadoes has increased over time.

Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: E
Score: 0
