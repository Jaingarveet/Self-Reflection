Topic: Law
Context: Editorial: Cell-phone usage on buses and trains is annoying to other passengers. This suggests that recent proposals to allow use of cell phones on airplanes are ill-advised. Cell-phone use would be far more upsetting on airplanes than it is on buses and trains. Airline passengers are usually packed in tightly. And if airline passengers are offended by the cell-phone excesses of their seatmates, they often cannot move to another seat.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes the role played in the editorial's argument by the statement that cell-phone use would be far more upsetting on airplanes than it is on buses and trains?
Choices:
  A: It is the main conclusion of the argument.
  B: It is a claim that the argument tries to rebut.
  C: It is a premise that indirectly supports the main conclusion of the argument by supporting a premise for that conclusion.
  D: It is a conclusion for which support is provided and that itself is used in turn to directly support the argument's main conclusion.
  E: It provides background information that plays no role in the reasoning in the argument.

  Topic: Law
Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes the role played in the editorial's argument by the statement that cell-phone use would be far more upsetting on airplanes than it is on buses and trains?

Reflection:

I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I have reflected on my mistake. Here is what I have learned:

* The statement "cell-phone use would be far more upsetting on airplanes than it is on buses and trains" is a premise that indirectly supports the main conclusion of the argument by providing a reason why airline passengers are more likely to be offended by cell-phone use than bus and train passengers.
* The argument is not directly addressing the statement, but rather using it to support a larger premise that cell-phone use on airplanes is undesirable.
* The main conclusion of the argument is that recent proposals to allow cell-phone use on airplanes are ill-advised, and the statement about cell-phone use on buses and trains is used to provide a reason why.

Based on this reflection, the best answer is (C): It is a premise that indirectly supports the main conclusion of the argument by supporting a premise for that conclusion.
