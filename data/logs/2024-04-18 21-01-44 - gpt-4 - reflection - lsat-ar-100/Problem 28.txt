## System:
You are an expert in Law.
You have incorrectly answered the following multiple-choice question.
Your task is to reflect on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
You will then use this information help you answer the same question in the future.
First, explain why you answered the question incorrectly.
Second, list the keywords that describe the type of your errors from most general to most specific. 
Third, solve the problem again, step-by-step, based on your knowledge of the correct answer.
Fourth, create a list of detailed instructions to help you correctly solve this problem in the future.
Finally, create a list of general advice to help you solve similar types of problems in the future.  
Be concise in your response; however, capture all of the essential information.  
For guidance, I will provide you with a single generic example problem and reflection (below).

Topic: Geography and Math
Question: What is the product of the number of letters contained in the name of the city where Iowa State University is located multiplied by the number of letters contained in the name of the state?
Choices:
    A: 16
    B: 20
    C: 24
    D: 32
Thought:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
ISU is located in the state of Iowa.
Action: Answer("D")
---
Correct Answer: A
## Assistant 1:
Explanation:
I miscalculated the product of the number of letters in the city and state names. 
The gap in my knowledge was not in geography but in basic arithmetic. 
I knew the correct city and state but made a calculation error.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Arithmetic error
 - Multiplication error
Solution:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
Iowa State University is located in the state of Iowa.
The city name "Ames" contains 4 letters.
The state name "Iowa" contains 4 letters.
The product of 4*4 is 16.
Instructions:
1. Identify the city where the university is located.
2. Identify the state where the university is located.
3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.
4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.
5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.
6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.
7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them.

Topic: Law
Context: A panel of five scientists will be formed. The panelists will be selected from among three botanists—F, G, and H—three chemists—K, L, and M—and three zoologists—P, Q, and R. Selection is governed by the following conditions: The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types. If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. F and K cannot both be selected. K and M cannot both be selected. If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
Question: If four of the scientists selected are F, L, Q, and R, which one of the following must be the fifth scientist selected?
Choices:
  A: G
  B: H
  C: K
  D: M
  E: P

Thought: 
The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types. We already have a botanist (F), a chemist (L), and two zoologists (Q and R). We need another chemist or botanist, but it can't be K (because F is already selected) or M (because M requires both P and R to be selected, and we can't have more than one zoologist if more than one botanist is selected). So, the fifth scientist must be either G, H, or P. But since we already have two zoologists, we can't select another one (P). So, the fifth scientist must be either G or H.
Action: Answer("B")

 --- 
Correct Answer: E
## Assistant 2:
Response:
Explanation:
I misunderstood the conditions of the problem. I incorrectly assumed that we couldn't select another zoologist because we already had two. However, the condition states that if more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. In this case, only one botanist (F) is selected, so we can have more than one zoologist. 
Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation of conditions
- Incorrect assumption
Solution:
The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types. We already have a botanist (F), a chemist (L), and two zoologists (Q and R). We need another scientist, but it can't be K (because F is already selected) or M (because M requires both P and R to be selected, and R is already selected). So, the fifth scientist must be either G, H, or P. Since only one botanist is selected, we can have more than one zoologist. Therefore, the fifth scientist must be P.
Instructions:
1. Understand the conditions of the problem.
2. Identify the scientists already selected and their types.
3. Identify the types of scientists needed to fulfill the conditions.
4. Eliminate the scientists that can't be selected based on the conditions.
5. From the remaining scientists, select the one that fulfills the conditions.
Advice:
- Always read and understand the conditions of the problem carefully.
- Don't make assumptions that are not supported by the conditions.
- Keep track of the types and number of scientists already selected.
- Eliminate options based on the conditions before making a selection.
- Double-check your understanding of the conditions and your selection.
