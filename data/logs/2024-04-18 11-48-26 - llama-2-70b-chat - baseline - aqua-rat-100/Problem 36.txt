Question: In a chocolate store, all chocolates are either vanilla or cocoa flavored only. 10% of the chocolates are cocoa flavored, 90% of the rest are squashed. What percentage of the chocolates are both vanilla flavored and not squashed?
Choices:
  A: 1%
  B: 2%
  C: 5%
  D: 9%
  E: 10%
## Assistant 2:
  Thought: 
Let's first find the percentage of chocolates that are vanilla flavored.
10% of the chocolates are cocoa flavored, so 90% are vanilla flavored.
Now, we need to find the percentage of chocolates that are not squashed.
90% of the rest (which means 90% - 10% = 80%) are squashed.
So, the percentage of chocolates that are not squashed is 20%.
Now, we need to find the percentage of chocolates that are both vanilla flavored and not squashed.
To do this, we multiply the percentage of chocolates that are vanilla flavored (90%) by the percentage of chocolates that are not squashed (20%).
90% x 20% = 18%.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
