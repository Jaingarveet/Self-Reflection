Question: [5 + ? × 19 - 15 - 7]/[13 × 13 - 156] = 6
Choices:
  A: 4
  B: 4.5
  C: 5
  D: 5.5
  E: 6.5
## Assistant 2:
  Thought: 
Let's simplify the expression:

(5 + ? × 19 - 15 - 7)/(13 × 13 - 156) = 6

First, let's calculate the numerator:
5 + ? × 19 - 15 - 7 = 5 + 19 × ? - 22

We can see that 19 × ? = 19 × 4 = 76

So, the numerator is 5 + 76 - 22 = 59

Now, let's calculate the denominator:
13 × 13 - 156 = 169 - 156 = 13

Now, we can simplify the fraction:
59/13 = 4.5

Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: C
