Question: A newspaper costs $4 on Sunday and $1 the rest of the days of the week. If a hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week and pays $210 per week for newspapers, how many newspapers does it buy on Monday?
Choices:
  A: 15
  B: 30
  C: 45
  D: 60
  E: 75
## Assistant 2:
  Let's break this down step by step:

1. The cost of a newspaper on Sunday is $4.
2. The cost of a newspaper the rest of the days of the week is $1.
3. The hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the week.
4. The hotel pays $210 per week for newspapers.

Let X be the number of newspapers the hotel orders on Sunday.
Then, the hotel orders 2X newspapers the rest of the week.

The total cost of newspapers for the hotel is:
4X + (2X)1 + (2X)1 + ... + (2X)1 = 4X + 2X(7) = 11X

Since the hotel pays $210 per week for newspapers, we can set up the equation:
11X = 210

Solving for X, we get:
X = 19

So, the hotel orders 19 newspapers on Sunday.
