## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Question: A point on the edge of a fan blade that is rotating in a plane 10 centimeters from the center of the fan. What is the distance traveled, in centimeters, by this point after 30 seconds when the fan runs at the rate of 300 revolutions per minutes?
Choices:
  A: 750pi
  B: 1500pi
  C: 1875pi
  D: 3000pi
  E: 7500pi
## Assistant 2:
  Thought: 
We can use the formula for the distance traveled by an object rotating around a circle: distance = circumference x time

We need to first find the circumference of the circle. Since we know the radius (10 cm), we can use the formula for the circumference of a circle: circumference = 2 x pi x radius

Circumference = 2 x pi x 10 cm = 20 pi cm

Now, we can use the formula for distance: distance = circumference x time

Distance = 20 pi cm x 30 seconds = 600 pi cm

Since the fan runs at 300 revolutions per minute, we need to convert the time from seconds to minutes:

30 seconds / 60 = 0.5 minutes

Now, we can use the formula for distance: distance = circumference x time

Distance = 20 pi cm x 0.5 minutes = 10 pi cm

Therefore, the distance traveled by the point on the edge of the fan blade after 30 seconds is 10 pi cm.

Action: Answer("B")
