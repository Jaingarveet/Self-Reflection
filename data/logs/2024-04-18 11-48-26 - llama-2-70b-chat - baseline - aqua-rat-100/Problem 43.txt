Question: The monthly salary S of a shop assistant is the sum of a fixed salary of $500 plus 5% of all monthly sales. What should the monthly sales be so that her monthly salary reaches $1500?
Choices:
  A: $50000
  B: $40000
  C: $30000
  D: $20000
  E: None of these
## Assistant 2:
  Let X be the monthly sales.
The monthly salary S of a shop assistant can be represented as:
S = 500 + (5/100) * X

We want S to reach $1500, so we set up an equation:
500 + (5/100) * X = 1500

Now, we can solve for X:
X = (1500 - 500) / (5/100)
X = 100000 / 5
X = 20000

Therefore, the monthly sales should be $20000 for the shop assistant's monthly salary to reach $1500.

Action: Answer("E") None of these.
## Result:
Agent Answer: E
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
