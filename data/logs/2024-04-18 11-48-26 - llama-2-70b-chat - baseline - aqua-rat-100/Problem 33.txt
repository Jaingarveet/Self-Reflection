Question: A paper is in a square form whose one side is 20 cm. Two semi circles are drawn on its opposites as diameters. If these semi circles are cut down what is the area of the remaining paper?
Choices:
  A: 8.75
  B: 8.79
  C: 8.75
  D: 8.71
  E: 8.72
## Assistant 2:
  Let's break this down step by step:

1. The paper is a square with side length 20 cm.
2. Two semi-circles are drawn on opposite sides of the square as diameters.
3. The radius of each semi-circle is half the side length of the square, which is 10 cm.
4. The area of each semi-circle is (1/2)πr^2, where r is the radius.
5. The total area of the two semi-circles is 2(1/2)π(10cm)^2 = 20π cm^2.
6. The area of the remaining paper is the area of the original square minus the total area of the two semi-circles.
7. The area of the original square is 20^2 = 400 cm^2.
8. Therefore, the area of the remaining paper is 400 - 20π = 8.75 cm^2.
