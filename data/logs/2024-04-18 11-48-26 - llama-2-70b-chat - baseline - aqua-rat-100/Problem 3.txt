Question: A square piece of cloth is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge to form a rectangular piece, which is then cut diagonally in half to create two triangles. If the area of each of triangle is 70 square feet, what was the perimeter (in feet) of the original piece of square cloth?
Choices:
  A: 56
  B: 58
  C: 60
  D: 62
  E: 64
## Assistant 2:
  Let's break this down step by step:

1. The square piece of cloth has side length x.
2. After trimming 4 feet off one edge, the rectangle has a length of x - 4 and a width of x.
3. The area of each triangle is 70 square feet, so the area of the rectangle is 2 \* 70 = 140 square feet.
4. The perimeter of the rectangle is 2(x - 4) + 2x = 2x - 8.
5. Since the original square had a perimeter of 4x, we can set up the equation:

2x - 8 = 4x

Solving for x, we get:

2x = 4x + 8
2x - 4x = 8
x = 8

So, the side length of the original square was 8 feet.
