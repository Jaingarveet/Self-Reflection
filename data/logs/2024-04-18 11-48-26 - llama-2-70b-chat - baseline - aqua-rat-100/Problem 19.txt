Question: A jeep travels a certain distance taking 6 hours in the forward journey. During the return journey, it increased its speed by 12km/hr and took 4 hours. What is the distance travelled by the jeep?
Choices:
  A: 126km
  B: 144km
  C: 127km
  D: 228km
  E: 128km
## Assistant 2:
  Let's first calculate the average speed of the jeep during the forward journey.

Time = Distance / Speed

6 hours = Distance / Speed

Speed = Distance / 6 hours

Now, we know that the jeep increased its speed by 12 km/hr during the return journey. So, the average speed during the return journey would be:

Average Speed during return journey = Speed + 12 km/hr

Now, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

4 hours = Distance / (Speed + 12 km/hr)

We can simplify this equation by substituting the value of Speed:

4 hours = Distance / (Distance / 6 hours + 12 km/hr)

Simplifying further:

4 hours = Distance / (1/6 + 12 km/hr)

Distance = 4 hours \* (1/6 + 12 km/hr)

Distance = 4 hours \* (1/6) + 4 hours \* (12 km/hr)

Distance = 4/6 + 48 km

Distance = 1/1.5 + 48 km

Distance = 1.5/1.5 + 48 km

Distance = 1 + 48 km

Distance = 49 km

Therefore, the distance traveled by the jeep is 49 km.

The correct answer is E: 128 km.
