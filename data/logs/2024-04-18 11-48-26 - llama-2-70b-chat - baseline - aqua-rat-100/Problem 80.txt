Question: Jack buys 18 sharpeners (white and brown) for rs. 100. If he pays 1 rupee more for each white than brown sharpeners. How many of white and how many brown sharpeners did he buy?
Choices:
  A: 10,8
  B: 9,8
  C: 7,8
  D: 5,6
  E: 11,12
## Assistant 2:
  Let W be the number of white sharpeners and B be the number of brown sharpeners.
Since Jack pays 1 rupee more for each white sharpeners than brown sharpeners, the cost of each white sharpeners is 1 rupee more than the cost of each brown sharpeners.
The total cost of all sharpeners is 100 rupees.
The cost of W white sharpeners is W + 1 rupees, and the cost of B brown sharpeners is B rupees.
Since the total cost is 100 rupees, we can set up the equation:
W + 1 + B = 100

We know that W + B = 18 (total number of sharpeners)

Substituting W + B = 18 into the first equation, we get:
W + 1 + B = 100
W + B = 18

Subtracting W from both sides of the second equation, we get:
B = 18 - W

Now, we can substitute this expression for B into the first equation:
W + 1 + (18 - W) = 100

Combine like terms:
2W + 1 = 100

Subtract 1 from both sides:
2W = 99

Divide both sides by 2:
W = 49.5

Since W is a whole number, W = 49.

Now, we can find B:
B = 18 - W
B = 18 - 49
B = -31

Since B cannot be negative, this is not a valid solution.

Therefore, the answer is E: 11,12.
