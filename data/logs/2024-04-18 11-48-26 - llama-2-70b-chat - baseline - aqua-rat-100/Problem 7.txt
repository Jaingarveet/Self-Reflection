## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: Amy is organizing her bookshelves and finds that she has 10 different types of books. She then codes each book with either a single letter or a pair of two different letters. If each type of book is uniquely represented by either a single letter or pair of letters, what is the smallest number of letters Amy will need to create the codes for all 10 types of books? (Assume the order of letters in a pair does not matter.)
Choices:
  A: 3
  B: 4
  C: 5
  D: 10
  E: 20
## Assistant 2:
  Thought: 
To minimize the number of letters needed, we should use single letters for some codes and pairs of letters for others. Specifically, we can use single letters for the first 5 types of books and pairs of letters for the remaining 5 types.

Let's assign single letters to the first 5 types of books:

* Type 1: A
* Type 2: B
* Type 3: C
* Type 4: D
* Type 5: E

Now, we have 5 remaining types of books. We can create pairs of letters for these types by combining the remaining letters (F, G, H, I, and J) in all possible ways:

* Type 6: FG
* Type 7: HI
* Type 8: JA
* Type 9: BF
* Type 10: DG

Action: Answer("B")

Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: D
