Question: Alex and Jacob works at a toy shop that make toys. Alex takes 7 hours to make a toy, and Jacob takes 9 hours to make a toy. During a month, both of them makes 35 toys in total. If both of them have worked for almost similar number of hours how many toys have been prepared by Jacob?
Choices:
  A: 15
  B: 16
  C: 17
  D: 18
  E: 19
## Assistant 2:
  Let's assume the number of hours Alex works be x.
Since both Alex and Jacob work for almost a similar number of hours, the number of hours Jacob works is also x.

We know that Alex makes 35 toys in x hours, so his toy-making rate is 35/x.
Similarly, Jacob makes 35 toys in x hours, so his toy-making rate is 35/x.

Since both Alex and Jacob work for the same number of hours, the total number of toys they make is the sum of their individual toy-making rates:
35/x + 35/x = 70/x

Now, we want to find out how many toys Jacob makes. We can set up the following equation:
70/x = 9(35)

Solving for x, we get:
x = 70/9
x = 7.78

Since Jacob works for 9 hours, the number of toys he makes is:
35/x = 35/7.78 = 4.55

So, Jacob makes 4 toys less than Alex. Therefore, the correct answer is:
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
