## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: A rectangular piece of 150 sq m has a length which is 1m more than the 4 times the breadth. What is the perimeter of the piece?
Choices:
  A: 60 m
  B: 61 m
  C: 62 m
  D: 63 m
  E: 64 m
## Assistant 2:
  Let's break this down step by step:

1. The length of the rectangle is 1m more than 4 times the breadth.
2. Let's call the breadth x. Then, the length is 4x + 1.
3. The area of the rectangle is given as 150 sq m.
4. The area of a rectangle is found by multiplying the length and breadth. So, we can set up the equation: (4x + 1)x = 150.
5. Simplifying the equation, we get 4x^2 + x - 150 = 0.
6. Factoring the equation, we get (2x + 75)(2x - 6) = 0.
7. Solving for x, we get x = -75/2 or x = 6/2.
8. Since the breadth cannot be negative, we know that x = 6/2 = 3.
9. Now, we can find the length: 4x + 1 = 4(3) + 1 = 13.
10. Finally, we can find the perimeter: 2(l + w) = 2(13 + 3) = 2(16) = 32 m.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
Action: Answer("C")
