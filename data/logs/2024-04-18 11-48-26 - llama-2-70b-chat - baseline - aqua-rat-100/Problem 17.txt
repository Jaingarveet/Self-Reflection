Question: A company produces 420 units of a particular computer component every month, at a production cost to the company of $110 per component, and sells all of the components by the end of each month. What is the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee that the yearly profit (revenue from sales minus production costs) will be at least $626,400 ?
Choices:
  A: 226
  B: 230
  C: 240
  D: 260
  E: 280
## Assistant 2:
  Let X be the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee a yearly profit of at least $626,400.

The yearly revenue from sales is 420 units/month x 12 months = 5,040 units.

The yearly production cost is 420 units/month x 12 months = 5,040 units x $110/unit = $554,400.

The yearly profit is 5,040 units x (X - $110) = 5,040 units x ($X - $110).

To guarantee a yearly profit of at least $626,400, we need 5,040 units x ($X - $110) >= 626,400.

Simplifying, we get:

X - $110 >= 626,400/5,040

X - $110 >= 124.8

X >= 110 + 124.8

X >= 234.8

Since X is a selling price, it must be a whole number.
The closest whole number to 234.8 is 230.

Therefore, the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee a yearly profit of at least $626,400 is $230.

Action: Answer("B")
