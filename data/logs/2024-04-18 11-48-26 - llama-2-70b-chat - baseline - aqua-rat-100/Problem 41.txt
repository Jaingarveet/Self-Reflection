Question: A number of friends decided to go on a picnic and planned to spend Rs. 96 on eatables. Four of them, however, did not turn up. As a consequence, the remaining ones had to contribute Rs. 4 extra, each. The number of those who attended the picnic was
Choices:
  A: 8
  B: 12
  C: 16
  D: 24
  E: 25
## Assistant 2:
  Let's assume the number of friends who attended the picnic is x.
Since four friends did not turn up, the number of friends who attended the picnic is x - 4.
The total amount spent on eatables was Rs. 96.
Since the four friends who did not turn up did not contribute, the amount spent by the remaining friends is Rs. 96 / (x - 4).
Since each of the remaining friends had to contribute Rs. 4 extra, the total amount spent by them is Rs. 96 / (x - 4) + 4(x - 4).
We want to find the value of x for which the above expression is equal to Rs. 96.

Rs. 96 / (x - 4) + 4(x - 4) = Rs. 96

Simplifying, we get:

x - 4 = 8

x = 12

Therefore, the number of friends who attended the picnic is 12.
