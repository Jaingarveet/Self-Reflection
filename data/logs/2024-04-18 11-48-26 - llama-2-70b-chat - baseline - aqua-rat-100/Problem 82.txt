Question: A cow is tethered in the middle of a field with a 14 feet long rope. If the cow grazes 10 sq.ft. per day, then approximately what time will be taken by the cow to graze the whole field?
Choices:
  A: 51 days
  B: 61 days
  C: 71 days
  D: 81 days
  E: 91 days
## Assistant 2:
  Thought: 
Let's assume the field is a square with side length x.
The area of the field is x^2.
The cow grazes 10 sq.ft. per day, so it will take approximately x^2/10 days to graze the whole field.
We can simplify the calculation by recognizing that x^2/10 ≈ 14^2/10 = 196/10 ≈ 19.6.
Therefore, the cow will take approximately 19.6 days to graze the whole field.
Action: Answer("E")
