Question: The price of a product is reduced by 30% . By what percentage should it be increased to make it 100%
Choices:
  A: 41.86%
  B: 42.86%
  C: 43.86%
  D: 44.86%
  E: 45.86%
## Assistant 2:
  Let's say the original price of the product was $100.
If the price is reduced by 30%, then the new price would be $100 - (30% of $100) = $100 - $30 = $70.

To find the percentage increase needed to make it 100% again, we can use the formula:
Percentage increase = (New price - Old price) / Old price

= ($100 - $70) / $70
= $30 / $70
= 42.86%

Therefore, the correct answer is B: 42.86%.
## Result:
Agent Answer: None
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
