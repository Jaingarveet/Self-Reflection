Question: A man divides Rs 8600 among 5 sons, 4 daughters and 2 nephews. If each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, and each son receives five as much as each nephew. How much does each daughter receive ?
Choices:
  A: Rs 400
  B: Rs 500
  C: Rs 600
  D: Rs 700
  E: Rs 800
## Assistant 2:
  Let's assume that each nephew receives x rupees.
Since there are 2 nephews, the total amount they receive is 2x rupees.

Each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, so each daughter receives 4x rupees.

There are 4 daughters, so the total amount they receive is 4x + 4x + 4x + 4x = 16x rupees.

Since there are 5 sons, each son receives five times as much as each nephew, so each son receives 5x rupees.

The total amount the sons receive is 5x + 5x + 5x + 5x + 5x = 25x rupees.

The total amount available to divide is Rs 8600, so we can set up the following equation:

16x + 25x = 8600

Simplifying the equation, we get:

41x = 8600

Dividing both sides by 41, we get:

x = 210

So, each daughter receives 4x = 4(210) = 840 rupees.

The correct answer is:

B: Rs 500

Therefore, the answer is B.
