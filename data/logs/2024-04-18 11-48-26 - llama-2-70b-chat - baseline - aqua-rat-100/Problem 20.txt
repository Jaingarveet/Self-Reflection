Question: 64 boys and 40 girls form a group for social work. During their membership drive, the same number of boys and girls joined the group. How many members does the group have now, if the ratio of boys to girls is 4:3?
Choices:
  A: 277
  B: 288
  C: 200
  D: 277
  E: 168
## Assistant 2:
  Let's assume that the number of boys who joined the group is 4x and the number of girls who joined the group is 3x.

We know that the total number of boys in the group is 64 + 4x, and the total number of girls in the group is 40 + 3x.

Since the ratio of boys to girls is 4:3, we can set up the equation:
(64 + 4x) / (40 + 3x) = 4/3

Simplifying the equation, we get:
4x = 120

Now, we can find the value of x:
x = 120/4
x = 30

So, the number of boys who joined the group is 4x = 4(30) = 120.
The number of girls who joined the group is 3x = 3(30) = 90.

Now, we can find the total number of members in the group:
Total members = 64 + 120 + 40 + 90 = 288

The correct answer is B: 288.

Action: Answer("B")

Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: E
