## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: there are more than 501 students in a school such that 20% of them exactly took physics and 28% of them exactly took math. What could be the least possible no of students in the school?
Choices:
  A: 550
  B: 570
  C: 600
  D: 700
  E: none of these
## Assistant 2:
  Let's assume the total number of students in the school to be x.
Since 20% of the students took physics, the number of students who took physics is 0.2x.
Similarly, since 28% of the students took math, the number of students who took math is 0.28x.
We know that 0.2x and 0.28x are both integers, so we can write:
0.2x = integer (say, k)
0.28x = integer (say, m)

We can write the equation:
k + m â‰¤ x (since some students may have taken both physics and math)

We want to find the least possible value of x.

We can start by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 0.2 and 0.28.
GCD(0.2, 0.28) = 0.04

Now, we can find the least common multiple (LCM) of 0.2 and 0.28:
LCM(0.2, 0.28) = 0.4

So, the least possible value of x is 0.4(1000) = 400.

Therefore, the answer is:
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: E
Score: 0
