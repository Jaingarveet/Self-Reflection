Question: A ship went on a voyage. After it had traveled 180 miles a plane started with 10 times the speed of the ship. Find the distance when they meet from starting point.
Choices:
  A: 238
  B: 289
  C: 200
  D: 287
  E: 187
## Assistant 2:
  Let's assume the speed of the ship to be 's' and the speed of the plane to be 'ps', where p is 10.
The distance traveled by the ship is given as 180 miles.
The distance traveled by the plane is given as x miles.

We know that the plane starts 180 miles away from the starting point of the ship, so the distance between the ship and the plane at any given time is:
x - 180

Since the plane is traveling at 10 times the speed of the ship, the time it takes for the plane to cover the distance between the ship and the plane is:
(x - 180) / (ps - s)

We want to find the distance when they meet, so we set up the equation:
(x - 180) / (ps - s) = 1

Now, we can solve for x:
x - 180 = (ps - s)
x = (ps - s) + 180

Substituting the values, we get:
x = (10s - s) + 180
x = 9s + 180

Now, we have to find the value of s. We know that the ship traveled 180 miles in some time, let's call it t.
So, the distance traveled by the ship is:
180 = st

Now, we can solve for s:
s = 180 / t

Substituting the value of s in the equation of x, we get:
x = 9(180 / t) + 180
x = 180(9/t) + 180
x = 180(1 + 9/t)

Now, we have to find the value of x. We know that the plane meets the ship after traveling 289 miles.
So, we can set up the equation:
180(1 + 9/t) = 289

Now, we can solve for t:
t = 9/10

Substituting the value of t in the equation of x, we get:
x = 180(1 + 9/9/10)
x = 180(1 + 10/9)
x = 180(11/9)
x = 200

So, the distance when they meet from the starting point is 200 miles.
