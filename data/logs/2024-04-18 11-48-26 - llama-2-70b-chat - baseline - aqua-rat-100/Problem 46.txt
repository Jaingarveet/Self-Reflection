Question: A man spends Rs. 3500 per month and saves 12 1/2% of his income. His monthly income is ?
Choices:
  A: Rs. 4400
  B: Rs. 4270
  C: Rs. 4000
  D: Rs. 3937.50
  E: None of these
## Assistant 2:
  Let X be the monthly income of the man.

We know that he spends Rs. 3500 per month, so his savings are:
S = X - 3500

We are also given that he saves 12 1/2% of his income, so:
S = 0.125X

Now, we can set up the equation:
0.125X - 3500 = 12 1/2% of X

Simplifying, we get:
0.125X = 4375

Dividing both sides by 0.125, we get:
X = 35,000

So, the man's monthly income is Rs. 35,000.

Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
