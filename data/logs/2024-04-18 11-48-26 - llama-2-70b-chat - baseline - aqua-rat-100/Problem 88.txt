Question: A train running at a speed of 100 miles/hour, takes 10 hours to reach its destination. After covering quarter of the distance, it starts raining and the train has to be slowed to speed of 75 miles/hour. What is the total journey duration?
Choices:
  A: 10
  B: 11.5
  C: 12.5
  D: 13.5
  E: 15
## Assistant 2:
  Let's break this down step by step:

1. The train's original speed is 100 miles/hour, and it takes 10 hours to reach its destination.
2. This means the train travels a total distance of 1000 miles (10 x 100).
3. The train slows down to 75 miles/hour after covering a quarter of the distance, which is 250 miles (1/4 x 1000).
4. The time taken to cover the remaining distance of 750 miles (1000 - 250) at a speed of 75 miles/hour is:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 750 / 75
Time = 10

5. The total journey duration is the sum of the time taken to cover the first quarter of the distance and the time taken to cover the remaining distance:

Total Time = 10 + 10
Total Time = 20
