## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: R, S, T, and U are points on a line, and U is the midpoint of line segment ST. If the lengths of line segments RS, RT, and ST are 5, 17, and 22, respectively. What is the length of line segment RU?
Choices:
  A: 6
  B: 7
  C: 8
  D: 9
  E: 10
## Assistant 2:
  Let's break this down step by step:

1. Since U is the midpoint of line segment ST, the distance between S and U is equal to the distance between T and U.
2. The length of line segment ST is 22. Therefore, the distance between S and T is 22/2 = 11.
3. Since R is the midpoint of line segment ST, the distance between R and S is equal to the distance between R and T.
4. The distance between R and S is 5, and the distance between R and T is 17 - 5 = 12.
5. The length of line segment RU is half the distance between R and U. Since U is the midpoint of line segment ST, the distance between R and U is half the distance between R and T.
6. Therefore, the length of line segment RU is half of 12 = 6.

Action: Answer("A")
