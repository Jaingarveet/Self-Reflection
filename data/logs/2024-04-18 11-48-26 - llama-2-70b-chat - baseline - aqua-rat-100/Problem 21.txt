You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Question: x men working x hours per day can do x units of a work in x days. How much work can be completed by y men working y hours per day in y days?
Choices:
  A: x2/y2 units
  B: y3/x2 units
  C: x3/y2 units
  D: y2/x2 units
  E: None of these
## Assistant 2:
  Thought: 
The question is asking for the ratio of work done by x men working x hours per day for x days to the work done by y men working y hours per day for y days.
We can set up a proportion to solve this problem:
Work done by x men = x units
Work done by y men = y units

We know that x men can do x units of work in x days, so the rate of work per day is x/x = 1.
We also know that y men can do y units of work in y days, so the rate of work per day is y/y = 1.

To find the ratio of work done by x men to work done by y men, we can set up a proportion using the rates:
x/x = y/y
x2/x2 = y2/y2

Therefore, the correct answer is:
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: B
