Question: Train A leaves a station every 16 minutes and Train B leaves every 17 minutes. If both trains just left the station simultaneously, how long until they do so again?
Choices:
  A: 272 minutes
  B: 304 minutes

Train A leaves every 16 minutes, so it will leave at 16, 32, 48, 64, ... minutes past the hour.
Train B leaves every 17 minutes, so it will leave at 17, 34, 51, 68, ... minutes past the hour.
The least common multiple (LCM) of 16 and 17 is 112.
Therefore, both trains will leave simultaneously again in 112 minutes.
