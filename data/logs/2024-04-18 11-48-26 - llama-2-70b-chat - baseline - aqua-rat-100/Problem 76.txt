## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: If n is such that 36 ≤ n ≤ 72, then x = (n2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16) / (n+ 4√n+ 4) satisfies
Choices:
  A: 20 < x < 54
  B: 23 < x < 58
  C: 25 < x < 64
  D: 28 < x < 60
  E: None of these
## Assistant 2:
  Thought: 
To find the range of x, we need to simplify the expression and determine the bounds of n.
Let's first simplify the expression:
x = (n2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16) / (n + 4√n + 4)
x = (n2 + 2n(n + 4) + 16) / (n(n + 4) + 4)
x = (n2 + 2n2 + 8n + 16) / (n2 + 4n + 4)
x = (2n2 + 8n + 16) / (n2 + 4n + 4)

Now, we can see that the numerator and denominator have the same factors, so we can cancel them out:
x = (2n2 + 8n + 16) / (n2 + 4n + 4)
x = 2(n2 + 4n + 8) / (n2 + 4n + 4)
x = 2(n + 2)2 / (n + 2)2
x = 2

Since n is between 36 and 72, n + 2 is between 38 and 74, and 2(n + 2)2 is between 76 and 148.
Therefore, x is between 2(76) = 152 and 2(148) = 296.

The closest choices to these bounds are:
A: 20 < x < 54 (too small)
B: 23 < x < 58 (too small)
C: 25 < x < 64 (too small)
D: 28 < x < 60 (too small)
E: None of these (correct, since none of the given ranges match the actual range of x)
Action: Answer("E")
## Result:
Agent Answer: E
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
