You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.

Question: Six pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as do two rolls. Three rolls contain the same amount of falafel as five baguettes do. Two baguettes contain the same amount of falafel as how many pita breads?
Choices:
  A: 12/25
  B: 3/2
  C: 3
  D: 2
  E: 25/3
## Assistant 2:
  Let's break this down step by step:

1. Six pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as two rolls, so the ratio of pita breads to rolls is 6:2 or 3:1.
2. Three rolls contain the same amount of falafel as five baguettes, so the ratio of rolls to baguettes is 3:5 or 1:1.
3. Two baguettes contain the same amount of falafel as x pita breads. We want to find the value of x.

Now, we can set up a system of equations using the ratios we've identified:

6 pita breads = 2 rolls (1)
3 rolls = 5 baguettes (2)
2 baguettes = x pita breads (3)

We can solve this system of equations by substituting equation (1) into equation (3):

2 baguettes = x pita breads
2 baguettes = 6 pita breads / 2 (from equation 1)
x = 6 / 2
x = 3

Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("C")
