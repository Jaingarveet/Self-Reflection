Question: A club consists of members whose ages are in A.P. The common difference being 3 months. If the youngest member of the club is just 7 years old and the sum of the ages of all the members is 250, then number of members in the club are :
Choices:
  A: 18
  B: 20
  C: 25
  D: 26
  E: 27
## Assistant 2:
  Let's break this down step by step:

1. The youngest member is 7 years old.
2. The common difference between consecutive terms in an arithmetic progression (AP) is 3 months, which means the next member's age would be 7 + 3 = 10.
3. The sum of the ages of all members is 250.

Now, let's find the number of members in the club:

The first member's age is 7.
The second member's age is 10.
The third member's age is 13 (10 + 3).
The fourth member's age is 16 (13 + 3).
The fifth member's age is 19 (16 + 3).

We can see a pattern here. Each member's age is 3 months older than the previous member's age.

The number of members in the club is the number of ages we have:
1, 2, 3, 4, 5

Therefore, the number of members in the club is 5.

Action: Answer("E")
