Question: If the population of a city increases by 5 % annually, what will be the population of the city in 2 years time if its current population is 78000?
Choices:
  A: 81900

## Assistant 2:
  Thought: 
The population of the city increases by 5% annually, so it will increase by 5% in the first year and then by 5% of the new population in the second year.
Let's calculate the population of the city in 2 years:
Year 1: 78000 x 1.05 = 81900
Year 2: 81900 x 1.05 = 85995

Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
