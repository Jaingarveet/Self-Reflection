Question: A man borrows Rs.360 If he pays it back in 12 monthly installments of Rs.31.50, what is his interest rate?
Choices:
  A: 1.5%
  B: 4.5%
  C: 10%
  D: 5%
  E: 12%
## Assistant 2:
  Thought:
The formula for calculating interest rate is: interest rate = (amount paid - amount borrowed) / amount borrowed.
Let's first calculate the total amount paid by the man:
Total amount paid = 12 x 31.50 = 382

Now, let's calculate the interest paid:
Interest paid = Total amount paid - Amount borrowed
Interest paid = 382 - 360
Interest paid = 22

Now, we can calculate the interest rate:
Interest rate = Interest paid / Amount borrowed
Interest rate = 22 / 360
Interest rate = 0.06

Now, we can convert the interest rate to a percentage:
Interest rate (%) = 0.06 x 100
Interest rate (%) = 6%

Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
