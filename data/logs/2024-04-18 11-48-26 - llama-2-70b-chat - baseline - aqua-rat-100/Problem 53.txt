Question: Arjun and Sajal are friends, each has some money. If Arun gives $30 to Sajal, the Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun. But, if Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal. How much money does each have?
Choices:
  A: 62, 35
  B: 62, 34
  C: 34, 62
  D: 42, 62
  E: 62, 42
## Assistant 2:
  Let's assume that Arjun has x dollars and Sajal has y dollars.
We know that if Arjun gives $30 to Sajal, Sajal will have twice the amount of money that Arjun has left. So, the new amounts will be:

Arjun: x - 30
Sajal: 2(x - 30) + y

We also know that if Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice the amount of money that Sajal has left. So, the new amounts will be:

Arjun: 3(y - 10) + x
Sajal: y - 10

We can set up a system of linear equations using these two equations:

2(x - 30) + y = 3(y - 10) + x

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2x - 60 = 3y - 30

Solving for x and y, we get:

x = 62
y = 34

Therefore, the correct answer is:

Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
