## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Question: A wire in the shape of rectangle of length 27 cm and breadth 17 cm is rebent to form a square. What will be the measure of each side?
Choices:
  A: 9
  B: 11
  C: 22
  D: 25
  E: 31
## Assistant 2:
  Thought: 
Let's first calculate the area of the original rectangle:
Area = Length x Breadth
= 27 x 17
= 469

Since the wire is bent to form a square, the area of the square must be equal to the area of the rectangle.
Let's call the length of each side of the square "s".

Area of the square = s^2

We know that the area of the square is equal to the area of the rectangle, so we can set up the equation:
s^2 = 469

Now, we can solve for "s":
s = sqrt(469)
= 21

So, the length of each side of the square is 21 cm.

Action: Answer("E") 
## Result:
Agent Answer: E
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
