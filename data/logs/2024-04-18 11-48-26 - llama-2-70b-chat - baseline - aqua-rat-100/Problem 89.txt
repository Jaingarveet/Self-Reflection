Question: Calculate the maximum distance you can travel with $8.50 on a cab which charges $3.50 for the first quarter-mile and 10 cents for each additional quarter mile.
Choices:
  A: 11.75 miles
  B: 12.75 miles
  C: 17.75 miles
  D: 14.75 miles
  E: 10.75 miles
## Assistant 2:
  Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The first quarter-mile costs $3.50.
2. For each additional quarter-mile, the cost is 10 cents.
3. We can calculate the cost for each mile by multiplying the number of quarter-miles by 10 cents and adding $3.50.
4. The maximum distance we can travel with $8.50 is found by dividing $8.50 by the cost per mile.

Now, let's calculate the cost per mile:

1 quarter-mile = $3.50
2 quarter-miles = $3.50 + 10 cents = $3.60
3 quarter-miles = $3.60 + 10 cents = $3.70
4 quarter-miles = $3.70 + 10 cents = $3.80
5 quarter-miles = $3.80 + 10 cents = $3.90

Now, let's calculate the maximum distance:

Maximum distance = $8.50 / $3.90 = 2.18 miles

Since we can't travel a fraction of a mile, we round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the maximum distance we can travel with $8.50 on a cab that charges $3.50 for the first quarter-mile and 10 cents for each additional quarter-mile is:

Action: Answer("B") 12.75 miles.
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
