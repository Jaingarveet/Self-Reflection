Question: An exam is given in a certain class. The average (arithmetic mean) of the highest score and the lowest score is equal to x. If the average score for the entire class is equal to y and there are z students in the class, where z > 5, then in terms of x, y, and z, what is the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers?
Choices:
  A: (zy – 2x)/z
  B: (zy – 2)/z
  C: (zx – y)/(z – 2)
  D: (zy – 2x)/(z -2)
  E: (zy – x)/(z + 2)
## Assistant 2:
  Let's break this down step by step:

1. The average of the highest score and the lowest score is equal to x.
2. The average score for the entire class is equal to y.
3. There are z students in the class, where z > 5.

We can start by finding the sum of the scores. Let's say the highest score is H and the lowest score is L. Then, the sum of all z scores can be represented as:
S = H + L + (z - 2) \* (y - H/2)

We know that the average of the highest and lowest scores is x, so we can write:
x = (H + L)/2

We also know that the average score for the entire class is y, so we can write:
y = (S)/z

Now, we want to find the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers. We can do this by subtracting the highest and lowest scores from the sum and then dividing by the number of scores remaining:
Average = (S - H - L)/(z - 2)

Now, we can substitute the expressions we derived earlier:
Average = [(H + L + (z - 2) \* (y - H/2)) - H - L]/ (z - 2)

Simplifying, we get:
Average = (zx - 2)/(z - 2)

Therefore, the correct answer is choice D: (zy – 2x)/(z -2).
