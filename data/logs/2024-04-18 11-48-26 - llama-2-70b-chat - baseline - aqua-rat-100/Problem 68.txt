## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: The greatest common factor of two positive integers is 11. The least common multiple of these two integers is 7700. If one of the integers is 350, what is the other?
Choices:
  A: 242
  B: 308
  C: 352
  D: 412
  E: 456
## Assistant 2:
  Thought:
The greatest common factor (GCF) of two positive integers is 11. The least common multiple (LCM) of these two integers is 7700. We can use the following steps to find the other integer:

1. Determine the prime factorization of 350: 350 = 2 x 3 x 5 x 7
2. Determine the prime factorization of 7700: 7700 = 2 x 2 x 5 x 5 x 7
3. Identify the common prime factors between 350 and 7700: 2, 5, and 7
4. Determine the GCF of 350 and 7700: GCF = 2 x 5 x 7 = 11
5. Determine the LCM of 350 and 7700: LCM = 2 x 2 x 5 x 5 x 7 = 7700
6. Find the other integer by factoring 7700: 7700 = 2 x 2 x 5 x 5 x 7

The other integer is 2 x 5 x 7 = 700.

Action: Answer("B")
