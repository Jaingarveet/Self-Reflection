## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: If the probability that Stock A will increase in value during the next month is 0.56, and the probability that Stock B will increase in value during the next month is 0.74. What is the greatest value for the probability that neither of these two events will occur?
Choices:
  A: 0.22
  B: 0.26
  C: 0.37
  D: 0.46
  E: 0.63
## Assistant 2:
  Thought: 
The probability that neither of the two events will occur is equal to 1 minus the probability that at least one of the events will occur.
Let's first calculate the probability that at least one of the events will occur:
P(at least one) = P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)
= 0.56 + 0.74 - (0.56 x 0.74)
= 0.56 + 0.74 - 0.41
= 0.89

Now, we can calculate the greatest value for the probability that neither of these two events will occur:
P(neither) = 1 - 0.89 = 0.11

Since the choices are not exhaustive, the greatest value for the probability that neither of these two events will occur is 0.11, which is not among the given choices.

Action: Answer("E")
## Result:
Agent Answer: E
Correct Answer: B
