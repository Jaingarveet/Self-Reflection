## Get Reflection:
  Action: Answer("C")

The passage suggests that Dostoyevsky believed a work of literature's primary goal should be to express the author's thoughts and ideas effectively, rather than serving a particular political or social purpose. Therefore, the description of a work of literature as "useful" in this context would refer to its ability to communicate the author's thoughts and ideas clearly and effectively, rather than its potential to bring about social change or serve a particular political agenda.

Option A is incorrect because while Dostoyevsky does discuss the importance of the fantastic in literature, he does not describe it as a key aspect of a work's "usefulness."

Option B is incorrect because while Dostoyevsky does discuss the importance of artistic merit in literature, he does not describe it as a key aspect of a work's "usefulness."

Option D is incorrect because while Dostoyevsky does discuss the importance of exploding the boundaries of the tangible world, he does not describe this as a key aspect of a work's "usefulness."

Option E is incorrect because Dostoyevsky does not discuss the capacity to advance a particular theory of literature as a key aspect of a work's "usefulness."

Therefore, the correct answer is C.
