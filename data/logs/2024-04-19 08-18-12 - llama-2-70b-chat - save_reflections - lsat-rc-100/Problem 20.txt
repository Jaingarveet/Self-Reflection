## Get Reflection:
  Action: Answer(E)

The author's attitude toward the twofold obligation introduced in lines 20-23 is best described as convinced that it does not represent a conflict of interest for defense lawyers. The author argues that defense lawyers have an obligation to both their clients and the court, and that this twofold obligation allows them to balance these responsibilities. The author does not suggest that this obligation represents a conflict of interest for defense lawyers, but rather a necessary balance that must be struck in order to provide the best defense possible while also upholding their duty to the court and society. Therefore, option E is the best answer.

Option A is incorrect because the author does not suggest that the twofold obligation enables defense lawyers to balance their competing responsibilities to the court and to society. While the author does argue that defense lawyers have a duty to provide the best defense possible, they also acknowledge that this duty must be balanced with their obligation to the court and society.

Option B is incorrect because the author does not suggest that the twofold obligation prevents defense lawyers from representing clients whom they know to be guilty. Instead, the author argues that defense lawyers should not present assertions that they know to be false to the court, but they should still represent their clients to the best of their ability.

Option C is also incorrect because while the author mentions that defense lawyers should uncover the relevant facts of a case, this is not the main focus of the passage. The author's primary concern is the balance between the defense lawyer's obligation to their client and their obligation to the court and society.

Option D is incorrect because the author does not suggest that the twofold obligation does not interfere with common defense strategies used by defense lawyers. In fact, the author acknowledges that defense lawyers have a duty to provide the best defense possible, but argues that this duty must be balanced with their obligation to the court and society.
