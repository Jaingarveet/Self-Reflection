## Get Reflection:
  Action: Answer("C")

Explanation:
The passage describes Thurgood Marshall's test case strategy as a deliberate and strategic approach to challenging state-sanctioned racial segregation. The author notes that Marshall carefully selected cases with sympathetic litigants and evaluated the precedential nuances and potential impact of each decision. This suggests that the strategy was not arbitrary or inflexible, but rather a carefully considered approach to achieving a specific goal. Additionally, the passage states that the test case strategy was a radical departure from accepted conventions at the time, indicating that it was unprecedented. Therefore, the best answer is (C) unprecedented.
