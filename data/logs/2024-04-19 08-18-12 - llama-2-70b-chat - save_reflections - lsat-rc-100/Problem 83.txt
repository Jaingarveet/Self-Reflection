## Get Reflection:
  Action: Answer(D)

Explanation:
The first sentence of the passage identifies Thurgood Marshall's better-known achievements (his judicial record and his work as a lawyer pursuing civil rights issues in court) and suggests that commentary has neglected certain other achievements (his strategic and methodological legacy in the field of public interest law). Therefore, option D is the best answer.

The sentence does not dispute a claim that has often been accepted (option A), establish the passage's main topic and indicate the controversial nature of Marshall's ideologies (option B), introduce two aspects of Marshall's career and outline the historical significance of both (option C), or provide a new perspective on Marshall's achievements and correct a historical inaccuracy (option E).

Therefore, option D is the best answer.
