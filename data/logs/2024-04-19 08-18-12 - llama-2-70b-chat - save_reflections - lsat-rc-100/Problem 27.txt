## Get Reflection:
  Action: Answer(A)

Explanation:
Dostoyevsky disagreed with the radical critics' view of realism in literature because he believed that reality is not independent of the experiences of individuals. He believed that what may not be reality for one person may be reality for another, and that reality is necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it. This is reflected in the passage when it states, "The radical critics' demand that reality be depicted 'as it is' was meaningless for Dostoyevsky; reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it: what may not be reality for you may be reality for me." Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
