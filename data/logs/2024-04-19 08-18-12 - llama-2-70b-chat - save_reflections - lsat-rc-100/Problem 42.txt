## Get Reflection:
  Action: Answer(E)

The correct answer is E: A painting that depicts products as they appear in magazine advertisements to comment on society's values.

Lichtenstein's work was characterized by its use of comic book imagery and stylized representations of everyday objects, with a focus on reconciling parody and true feeling. A painting that depicts products as they appear in magazine advertisements to comment on society's values aligns with Lichtenstein's style and themes, as it uses a popular genre (advertising) to make a commentary on contemporary life.

The other options do not align as closely with Lichtenstein's style and themes:

A: A painting that uses realistic techniques to represent several simple objects arranged on a table does not have the same playful, cartoonish quality that Lichtenstein's work is known for.

B: A painting that parodies human figures by depicting them as stick figures could be considered pop art, but it does not share the same focus on realism and naivete that characterizes Lichtenstein's work.

C: A painting that conveys its creator's inner turmoil through the use of bold lines and primary colors sounds more like abstract expressionism, which Lichtenstein's work was reacting against.

D: A painting that employs vague shapes and images to make a statement about consumer culture could be considered pop art, but it does not have the same focus on reconciling parody and true feeling that Lichtenstein's work does.
