## Get Reflection:
  Action: Answer(D)

The passage suggests that high lipid levels are dangerous because they lead to increased endothelial cell reactivity and platelet adhesiveness, which are contributing factors to the development of premature heart disease. The author does not suggest that doctors have access to a natural compound that breaks down blood clots. Therefore, the correct answer is D: High lipid levels are dangerous because they lead to increased endothelial cell reactivity and platelet adhesiveness.

The other choices are incorrect because:

A: Greater platelet adhesiveness increases the risk of premature heart disease. This statement is true, but it is not the main idea of the passage.

B: The body's ability to process lipids is compromised by the presence of alcohol in the bloodstream. This statement is true, but it is not the main idea of the passage.

C: Doctors have access to a natural compound that breaks down blood clots. This statement is false, and it is not suggested in the passage.

E: Moderate wine consumption appears to decrease the thickness of the interior walls of blood vessels. This statement is true, but it is not the main idea of the passage.
