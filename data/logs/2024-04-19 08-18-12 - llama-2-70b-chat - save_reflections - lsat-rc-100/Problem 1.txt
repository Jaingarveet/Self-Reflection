## Get Reflection:
  Action: Answer("C")

Explanation:
The correct answer is C, as it is the only option that involves the imposition of Western values or methods onto a non-Western culture. The study employs the methods of Western science to investigate a nonscientific culture, which would be considered objectionable by proponents of the version of multicultural education discussed in the third paragraph.

The other options do not necessarily involve the imposition of Western values or methods onto non-Western cultures and therefore would not be considered objectionable by proponents of this version of multicultural education:

A: A study of the differences between the moral codes of several Western and non-Western societies would not necessarily involve the imposition of Western values or methods onto non-Western cultures, as it would be a comparative study that aims to understand the differences between various moral codes.

B: A study of a given culture's literature to determine the kinds of personal characteristics the culture admires would not necessarily involve the imposition of Western values or methods onto non-Western cultures, as it would be a study of the culture's own values and beliefs.

D: A study that uses the literary theories of one society to criticize the literature of a society that has different values would not necessarily involve the imposition of Western values or methods onto non-Western cultures, as it would be a study that aims to understand and critique the literature of a particular society using the values and beliefs of that society.

E: A study that uses the methods of anthropology and sociology to criticize the values of Western culture would not be objectionable by proponents of this version of multicultural education, as it would be a study that aims to understand and critique the values of Western culture using the methods of Western science.
