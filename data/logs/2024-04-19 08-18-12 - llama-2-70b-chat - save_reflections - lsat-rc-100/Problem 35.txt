## Get Reflection:
  Action: Answer(E)

The passage discusses the role of corridos, a type of narrative folk song, in promoting cohesiveness in Border communities. The author argues that corridos achieve this by using familiar conventions, such as conventional imagery and ready-made lines, which reflect and strengthen the continuity of the corrido tradition. The author also notes that corridos are part of a long-standing ballad tradition that has roots in eighteenth-century Spain. Therefore, option E, which states that corridos promote cohesiveness in Border communities through the use of familiar conventions, accurately expresses the main point of the passage.

The other options do not accurately express the main point of the passage. Option A focuses on the imagery used in corridos, but does not address the role of conventions in promoting cohesiveness. Option B highlights the historical roots of corridos, but does not explain their function in promoting community cohesiveness. Option C emphasizes the use of ready-made lines in corridos, but does not discuss their impact on community cohesiveness. Option D mentions the attention to local events in corridos, but does not explain how this attention contributes to community cohesiveness.

Therefore, the correct answer is option E.
