## Get Reflection:
  Action: Answer("C")

Explanation:
According to passage B, evolutionary psychologists propose a questionable explanation for the human characteristic of forming monogamous families. The passage states that evolutionary psychologists argue that an interest in propagating genes explains monogamous families in animals whose offspring mature slowly, and that this same interest could explain why humans form monogamous families. However, the passage suggests that this explanation is not decisive and that there may be other interests that could equally explain this behavior. Therefore, choice C is the correct answer.

The other choices are not mentioned as questionable explanations in passage B. Choice A is mentioned as a characteristic of human ancestors that may have influenced the evolution of altruistic mechanisms, but it is not criticized as a questionable explanation. Choice B is mentioned as a factor that may have influenced the evolution of monogamous families, but it is not suggested to be a questionable explanation. Choice E is mentioned as a possible interest that could explain human behavior, but it is not related to the criticism of evolutionary psychology in passage B.
