## Get Reflection:
  Action: Answer(C)

The passage suggests that the rate of deliberate crimes is likely to decrease if the expected utility of lawful activities decreases. This statement is consistent with the idea that individuals will choose to commit a deliberate crime if the expected utility from doing so exceeds the expected utility from lawful activity. If the expected utility of lawful activities decreases, it becomes less likely for individuals to choose to commit deliberate crimes.

The other options are not consistent with the ideas presented in the passage:

A: The passage does not suggest that the rate at which criminals return to criminal activity is likely to fall if laws requiring stronger punishments for repeat offenders are adopted. Instead, the passage suggests that increasing penalties for crimes and strengthening law enforcement will lower the expected utility from criminal activity, making it less likely for individuals to choose to commit deliberate crimes.

B: The passage does not suggest that the rate at which criminals return to criminal activity is likely to increase if efforts to rehabilitate them are ended. Instead, the passage suggests that rehabilitating those convicted of deliberate crimes will reduce the crime rate.

D: The passage does not suggest that the rate of deliberate crimes is likely to increase if the access of individuals to economic institutions decreases. Instead, the passage suggests that increasing the access of individuals to economic institutions will reduce the crime rate.

E: The passage does not suggest that the rate of deliberate crimes will tend to vary inversely with the level of law enforcement. Instead, the passage suggests that increasing the fines and penalties associated with criminal activity, along with efficacious law enforcement, is one way to deter deliberate crimes.
