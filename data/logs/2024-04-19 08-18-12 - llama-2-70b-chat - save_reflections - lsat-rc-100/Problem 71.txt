## Get Reflection:
  Action: Answer(C)

Explanation:
The author of passage B would likely regard choice C as the mistaken assumption underlying arguments like that made in passage A. Passage A explains human behavior in evolutionary terms by showing how it would have improved the reproductive success of early humans. However, passage B argues that this approach needs to be handled with great care and that there may be other interests that explain behavior besides gene propagation. Choice C states that to explain a type of human behavior in evolutionary terms, it is sufficient to show that the behavior would have improved the reproductive success of early humans. This assumption is likely seen as mistaken by the author of passage B, who suggests that there may be other factors at play that are not necessarily related to gene propagation.

Error Keywords:

* Mistaken assumption
* Evolutionary psychology
* Gene propagation
* Altruistic behavior
* Monogamous families
* Slowly maturing offspring
* Instrumental motives
* Intrinsic motives

Solution:
1. Identify the main argument in passage A.
2. Identify the main argument in passage B.
3. Identify the shared assumption between passage A and passage B.
4. Determine which answer choice corresponds to the shared assumption.
5. Select the correct answer choice.

Instructions:
1. Read both passages carefully.
2. Identify the main argument in each passage.
3. Identify the shared assumption between the two passages.
4. Determine which answer choice corresponds to the shared assumption.
5. Select the correct answer choice.

Advice:

* Always read both passages carefully before answering the question.
* Identify the main argument in each passage to understand the author's perspective.
* Look for the shared assumption between the two passages to determine the correct answer.
* Consider all answer choices carefully before selecting the correct one.
* Use the process of elimination to narrow down the options if necessary.
