  Action: Answer("C")

The author would agree with the statement that expanded access to printed texts across a population has historically led to an increase in literacy in that population. The author mentions that before the printing press was introduced, few people had access to written materials, much less to scribes and private secretaries to produce and transcribe documents. Since printed materials have become widely available, however, people without special position or resources—and in numbers once thought impossible—can take literacy and the use of printed texts for granted. With the distribution of books and periodicals in public libraries, this process has been extended to the point where people in general can have essentially equal access to a vast range of texts that would once have been available only to a very few. This suggests that the author believes that increased access to technology, in this case, printed texts, leads to a more equal distribution of resources and opportunities, which is in line with choice C.

It is not clear from the passage whether the author would agree with the other choices. Choice A, that the democratizing influence of technology generally contributes to technological obsolescence, is not supported by the passage. The author does not mention anything about technological obsolescence, and the passage suggests that technological advancements have a positive impact on society by making resources and opportunities more accessible to a wider population.

Choice B, that wholly unregulated economies are probably the fastest in producing an equalization of social status, is not explicitly mentioned in the passage. While the author does mention that market competition drives prices down and tends to diffuse access to new technology across society, they do not explicitly state that unregulated economies are the fastest in producing an equalization of social status.

Choice D, that the invention of the telephone has had a greater democratizing influence on society than has the invention of the printing press, is not supported by the passage. The author does mention that the invention of the telephone has greatly extended the power of distant communication, but they do not suggest that it has had a greater democratizing influence than the printing press.

Choice E, that near equality of financial assets among people is a realistic goal for market economies, is not mentioned in the passage. While the author does suggest that market competition tends to diffuse access to new technology across society, they do not explicitly state that near equality of financial assets among people is a realistic goal for market economies.

Therefore, the correct answer is C.
