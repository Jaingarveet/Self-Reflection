## Get Reflection:
  I apologize for my mistake in the previous response. After reevaluating the question and the correct answer, I realize that my initial response was incorrect. The correct answer is indeed A: the results of experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium conducted by the physics community between 1934 and 1939.

The author refers to "the relevant evidence" (line 62) as the accumulation of data from experiments conducted by scientists over a period of time, which ultimately led to the discovery of nuclear fission. The results of these experiments, including the production of radioactive substances and the identification of barium, were the essential pieces of evidence that Meitner recognized as indicating that the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms.

Therefore, Choice A is the correct answer.

I apologize for any confusion caused by my previous response, and I hope this corrected answer helps clarify the correct solution to the question.
