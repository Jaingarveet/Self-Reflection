  Action: Answer(E)

Explanation:
Passage A explains how evolutionary psychology can account for altruistic behavior, which seems to be problematic for a theory that emphasizes individual reproductive success. The passage suggests that altruistic behavior can be understood as a result of psychological experiences of identification and empathy, which were initially aroused by cues of kinship or familiarity and increased the chances of related individuals receiving assistance. This would enhance the survival and replication of genes influencing the capacity for identification and empathy, thereby promoting the propagation of genetic material. Therefore, option E accurately states the main point of passage A.

Option A is incorrect because the passage does not suggest that altruistic behavior diminishes the reproductive success of individuals that exhibit it. Instead, it explains how altruistic behavior can be understood as serving evolutionary purposes.

Option B is incorrect because while the passage mentions new evidence that may explain the evolution of altruistic behavior, it does not state that this evidence shows that genes promote their own self-propagation.

Option C is incorrect because while the passage mentions that humans no longer live in small, kin-based groups, it does not suggest that altruistic behavior originally served evolutionary purposes that it does not serve today.

Option D is incorrect because while the passage mentions that critics of evolutionary psychology argue that most significant types of human behavior are not prompted by genetically selfish motivations, it does not take a position on this issue. Instead, it focuses on explaining how altruistic behavior can be understood as serving evolutionary purposes.

Therefore, the correct answer is E.
