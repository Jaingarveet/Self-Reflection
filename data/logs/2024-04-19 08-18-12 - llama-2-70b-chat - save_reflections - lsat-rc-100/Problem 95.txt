## Get Reflection:
  Action: Answer(E)

Explanation:
The scenario described in the first two paragraphs suggests that the demand for physical books will decrease as digital publishing becomes more prevalent. This decrease in demand for physical books will likely lead to a decrease in the demand for book-grade paper. Therefore, option E, "The demand for book-grade paper will decrease significantly," is the correct answer.

The other options do not logically follow from the scenario described:

A) The need for warehousing will shift mainly from that of individual books to that of paper and binding material to make books. - This option is incorrect because the scenario describes a shift from physical books to digital publications, which would reduce the need for warehousing overall, rather than shifting the need to a different type of material.

B) The patronage of stores that sell used books will increase significantly. - This option is incorrect because the scenario describes a shift to digital publications, which would likely reduce the demand for used books and therefore the patronage of stores that sell them.

C) Most publishers will sell their own books individually and will not use distributors or retailers. - This option is incorrect because the scenario does not describe a shift away from traditional publishing models, but rather a shift to digital publishing models that would still involve publishers, distributors, and retailers.

D) There will be significantly less demand by publishers for the services of copy editors and book designers. - This option is incorrect because the scenario does not describe a reduction in the need for copy editors and book designers, but rather a shift to digital publishing models that would still require these services.
