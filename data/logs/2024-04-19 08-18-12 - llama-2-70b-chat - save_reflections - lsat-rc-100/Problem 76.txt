## Get Reflection:
  I apologize for my mistake. I mistakenly chose option E, when in fact, the correct answer is option C.

The passage suggests that the author would likely agree with statement C, that moderate consumption of wine made from plums or apples rather than grapes would be unlikely to reduce the risk of premature heart disease. The passage states that "One study demonstrated a decrease in platelet adhesiveness among individuals who drank large amounts of grape juice. This finding may be the first step in confirming speculation that the potentially healthful effects of moderate wine intake may derive from the concentration of certain natural compounds found in grapes and not present in other alcoholic beverages." This implies that the author believes that the healthful effects of moderate wine consumption may be specific to wine made from grapes and may not apply to wine made from other fruits, such as plums or apples.

The other choices are not supported by the passage. There is no evidence to suggest that the author would disagree with studying the possible healthful effects of moderate consumption of beer and distilled spirits (choice A). The passage does not question the conclusion that alcohol affects lipid processing (choice B), and in fact, states that alcohol has negative physiological effects, including affecting the body's processing of lipids. The passage also does not suggest that red wine consumption has a greater effect on reducing death rates from premature heart disease than does white wine consumption (choice D).

I apologize for my mistake and I will make sure to be more careful in my analysis in the future.
