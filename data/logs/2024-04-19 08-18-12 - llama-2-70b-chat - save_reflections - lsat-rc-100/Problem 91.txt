## Get Reflection:
  Action: Answer("D")

Explanation:
The author of passage A would likely agree with choice D, as it suggests a more targeted and efficient approach to collecting overdue water bills. Placing liens on properties owned by those who are late paying their bills would be a more effective way to collect debts without imposing unnecessary social costs, which aligns with the author's views on reducing the costs of overinclusion.

The other choices do not align with the author's views or the content of passage A:

A: This choice suggests waiting until after the legislature's annual appropriations hearing to implement the plan, which is not related to the author's views on law enforcement or overinclusion.

B: This choice suggests that the plan would have a lower social cost than turning off the water of all 231,000 households that have not paid on time, but it does not address the issue of overinclusion or propose a more targeted approach.

C: This choice suggests that the plan is a reasonable response to the water department's history of enforcing overinclusive rules to the letter, but it does not align with the author's views on the limitations of law enforcement.

E: This choice suggests introducing specific laws regarding the payment of water bills to provide a more effective set of incentives, but it does not address the issue of overinclusion or propose a more targeted approach.
