## Get Reflection:
  Action: Answer("B")

The sentence at lines 7-11 and the sentence at lines 28-31 both discuss the role of defense lawyers and their obligations to the court and society. The first sentence states that defense lawyers should not present false assertions to the court, while the second sentence provides additional details on how lawyers should handle cases where they know their clients are guilty. The two sentences are not in disagreement, but rather, they complement each other by providing different perspectives on the same issue. Therefore, the relationship between the two sentences can most accurately be described as B: the author's opinion opposing another opinion reported by the author in the earlier lines.
