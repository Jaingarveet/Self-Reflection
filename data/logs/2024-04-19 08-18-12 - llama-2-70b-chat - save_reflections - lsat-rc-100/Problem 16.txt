## Get Reflection:
  Action: Answer("B")

Explanation:
The passage suggests that secondary substances in plants typically contribute to a plant's taste or smell, but not both. The passage states, "The secondary substances are a diverse and multitudinous array of chemicals that have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism." It also states, "Some secondary substances are favored by natural selection because they are scents that attract pollinating insects to blossoms." Additionally, it states, "Still, other secondary substances are not in themselves harmful to insects, but are characteristic smells or tastes that dissuade the insect from feeding by warning it of the presence of some other substance that is harmful."

Therefore, option B is the correct answer.

The other options are not supported by the passage:

Option A is incorrect because the passage does not mention recent natural mutations in plants.

Option C is incorrect because the passage does not mention any chemical reactions between secondary substances in plants and substances produced by insects.

Option D is incorrect because the passage states that only a few of these substances occur in any one species of plant, but the same or similar ones tend to occur in related plants such as the various species that constitute a single family.

Option E is incorrect because the passage does not mention anything about secondary substances acting as regulators of plants' growth or metabolism.
