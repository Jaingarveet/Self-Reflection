Question: A rectangle was altered by increasing its length by 10 percent and decreasing its width by $p$ percent. If these alterations decreased the area of the rectangle by 12 percent, what is the value of $p$ ?
Choices:
  A: 12
  B: 15
  C: 20
  D: 22
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I incorrectly set up the equation to solve for the percentage change in the width. 
I should have compared the areas of the original and altered rectangles to account for the [REDACTED]% decrease in area. 
Instead, I incorrectly equated the altered area to 88% of the original area, leading to an incorrect value for $p$.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Let $L$ be the length, $W$ be the width, and $A$ be the area of the rectangle.
The area of a rectangle is given by $A = LW$.

First, we calculate the new length and width of the rectangle.
The length increases by 10%, so the new length is $1.1L$.
The width decreases by $p$%, so the new width is $(1 - \frac{p}{100})W$.

Next, we set up an equation to account for the 12% decrease in the area.
The area of the altered rectangle is given by $A' = (1.1L)\left[(1 - \frac{p}{100})W\right]$.

We know that $A' = 0.88A$, so we can set up the following equation:
\[
0.88LW = (1.1)(1 - p/100)LW
\]

Simplifying the equation, we get:
\[
0.88 = 1.1(1 - p/100)
\]

Multiplying both sides by 100 and then dividing by 1.1, we get:
\[
96.8 = 100 - p
\]

Therefore, $p = \boxed{22}$.
