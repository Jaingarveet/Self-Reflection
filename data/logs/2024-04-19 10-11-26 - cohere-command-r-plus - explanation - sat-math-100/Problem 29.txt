## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Context: \begin{center}.\begin{tabular}{|l|c|}.\hline.\multicolumn{1}{|c|}{Planet} & Acceleration due to gravity $\left(\frac{\mathrm{m}}{\mathrm{sec}^{2}}\right)$ \\.\hline\hline.Mercury & 3.6 \\.\hline.Venus & 8.9 \\.\hline.Earth & 9.8 \\.\hline.Mars & 3.8 \\.\hline.Jupiter & 26.0 \\.\hline.Saturn & 11.1 \\.\hline.Uranus & 10.7 \\.\hline.Neptune & 14.1 \\.\hline.\end{tabular}.\end{center}.The chart above shows approximations of the acceleration due to gravity in meters per.second squared $\left(\frac{\mathrm{m}}{\sec ^{2}}\right)$ for the eight planets in our solar system. The weight of an object on a given planet can be found by using the formula $W=m g$, where $W$ is the weight of the object measured in newtons, $m$ is the mass of the object measured in kilograms, and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity on the planet measured in $\frac{m}{\sec ^{2}}$
Question: An object on Earth has a weight of 150 newtons. On which planet would the same object have an approximate weight of 170 newtons?
Choices:
  A: Venus
  B: Saturn
  C: Uranus
  D: Neptune

Explanation:
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Using the formula $W = mg$, where $W$ is weight, $m$ is mass, and $g$ is acceleration due to gravity, we can calculate the mass of the object on Earth:
$150 = m * 9.8$
$m = 15.3 kg$
Now, we can find the planet where this object would weigh approximately 170 newtons:
Venus: $W = 15.3 * 8.9 \approx 136.71$
Saturn: $W = 15.3 * 11.1 \approx 168.83$
Uranus: $W = 15.3 * 10.7 \approx 163.71$
Neptune: $W = 15.3 * 14.1 \approx 215.13$
The closest approximation to 170 newtons is on Saturn, so the answer is B.

Reflection on previous incorrect answer: I made a calculation error when multiplying the mass by the acceleration due to gravity for each planet. I also misread the question and answered based on the weight being 70 newtons instead of 170 newtons. To avoid such errors in the future, I will double-check my calculations and pay closer attention to the question details.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
