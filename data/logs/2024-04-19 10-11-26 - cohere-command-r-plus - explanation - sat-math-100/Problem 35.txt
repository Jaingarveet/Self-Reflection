## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.

Explanation:
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Squaring both sides of the equation, we get $4x = x^2 - 6x + 9$. Simplifying, we have $3x^2 - 6x - 9 = 0$. This can be factorized as $(3x+3)(x-3)=0$. Therefore, $x = -1$ or $x = 3$. Substituting these values back into the original equation, we find that $x = -1$ does not satisfy the equation, but $x = 3$ does.

Hence, the correct answer is **II only**.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
