## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Context: $$.a=1,052+1.08 t.$$.The speed of a sound wave in air depends on the air temperature. The formula above shows the relationship between $a$, the speed of a sound wave, in feet per second, and $t$, the air temperature, in degrees Fahrenheit $\left({ }^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\right)$.
Question: At which of the following air temperatures will the speed of a sound wave be closest to 1,000 feet per second?
Choices:
  A: $-46^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$
  B: $-48^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$
  C: $-49^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$
  D: $-50^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$

Explanation:
## Assistant 2:
Reflection: I made a careless mistake in my previous answer. I correctly calculated that the temperature should be around -46.43Â°F, but I mistakenly chose Answer ("A") without realizing that the given option was rounded to the nearest degree, not the exact value. To avoid this mistake in the future, I will pay closer attention to the options given and ensure that my calculations match the format provided.

Thought: 
To find the temperature at which the speed of sound is closest to 1,000 ft/s, we need to substitute $a$ with 1,000 and solve for $t$. 

$1,000=1,052+1.08t$
$-52=1.08t$
$t \approx -48.15$

Given the options, the closest value to $-48.15^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$ is $-48^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
