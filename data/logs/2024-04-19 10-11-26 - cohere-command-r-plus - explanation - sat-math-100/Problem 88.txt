Question: $$h=-4.9 t^{2}+25 t$$The equation above expresses the approximate height $h$, in meters, of a ball $t$ seconds after it is launched vertically upward from the ground with an initial velocity of 25 meters per second. After approximately how many seconds will the ball hit the ground?
Choices:
  A: 3.5
  B: 4.0
  C: 4.5
  D: 5.0

Explanation:
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The ball was launched upward, so its height will decrease over time until it hits the ground again.

The equation represents a parabola that opens downward, indicating that the height will decrease, reach a maximum, and then decrease again to zero as the ball returns to the ground.

To find when the ball hits the ground, we need to find when its height, $h$, becomes zero. 

Setting $h = 0$, we have:
$$0 = -4.9t^2 + 25t$$

This can be rewritten as:
$$4.9t^2 - 25t = 0$$

Factoring the equation gives:
$$t(4.9t - 25) = 0$$

Solving for $t$, we find:
$$t = 0\text{ seconds or } t = \frac{25}{4.9} \approx 5.10 \text{ seconds}$$

The negative value for time doesn't make sense in this context, as time can't be negative.

So, the ball hits the ground after approximately $5.10$ seconds, which is closest to **5 seconds**.
Action: Answer("D")
