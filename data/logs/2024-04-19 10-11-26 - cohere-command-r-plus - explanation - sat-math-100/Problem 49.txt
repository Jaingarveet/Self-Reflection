Explanation:
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
We can simplify the equation as follows:
$$\frac{24x^2 + 25x - 47}{ax - 2} + 8x + 3 + \frac{53}{ax - 2} = 0$$

This can be rearranged to:
$$24x^2 + (25+8a)x + (3a - 47 + 53) = 0$$

For this equation to be true for all values of $x$ other than $x = \frac{2}{a}$, the coefficients of the $x^2$, $x^1$, and constant terms on the left-hand side must be equal to zero when $x = \frac{2}{a}$. 

Plugging in $x = \frac{2}{a}$ into the simplified equation and setting each coefficient equal to zero, we get:

$$\begin{cases}
24 \left( \frac{2}{a} \right)^2 + (25+8a) \left( \frac{2}{a} \right) + (3a + 7) = 0 \\
(25+8a) + 2(3a + 7) = 0 \\
3a + 7 = 0
\end{cases}$$

Solving this set of equations simultaneously, we find $a = -3$.
