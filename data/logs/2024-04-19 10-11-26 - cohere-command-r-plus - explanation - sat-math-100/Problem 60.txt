## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: Mr. Kohl has a beaker containing $n$ milliliters of solution to distribute to the students in his chemistry class. If he gives each student 3 milliliters of solution, he will have 5 milliliters left over. In order to give each student 4 milliliters of solution, he will need an additional 21 milliliters. How many students are in the class?
Choices:
  A: 16
  B: 21
  C: 23
  D: 26

Explanation:
I incorrectly set up and solved a system of equations. I made a mistake in interpreting the information and applying the mathematical concepts. My error was in the algebraic manipulation and solution process.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Let x be the number of students in the class.
For part one, we know that $n - 3x = 5$.
For part two, we know that $n - 4x = -21$ or $n - 4x = -20$.
Multiplying the first equation by 4 and the second equation by 3 and then adding them together, we get $4n - 12x = 20$ and $3n - 12x = -63$, so $7n = -43$ and $n = \frac{-43}{7}$.
Substituting this value of n into the equation $n - 3x = 5$, we get $-\frac{43}{7} - 3x = 5$, so $-3x = \frac{61}{7}$ and $x = \frac{-61}{21} = -\frac{20}{7}$.
This means there are $\frac{20}{7}$ students in the class.

Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
