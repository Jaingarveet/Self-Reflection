## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:

## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: A line in the $x y$-plane passes through the origin and has a slope of $\frac{1}{7}$. Which of the following points lies on the line?
Choices:
  A: $(0,7)$
  B: $(1,7)$
  C: $(7,7)$
  D: $(14,2)$
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
## Assistant 2:
Reflection: The line passes through the origin $(0,0)$ and has a slope of $1/7$, which means it rises by $1$ for every $7$ units it moves to the right. Starting at the origin, moving $7$ units to the right (along the x-axis), and then rising by $1$ unit (along the y-axis) we arrive at the point $(7,1)$. This point satisfies the slope's condition of rising by $1$ after moving $7$ units to the right. Therefore, the correct answer is $(7,1)$. None of the provided options have a second coordinate of $1$, so the answer must be "None of the Above."
## Result:
Agent Answer: None
Correct Answer: D
