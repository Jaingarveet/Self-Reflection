# Model: cohere-command-r-plus | Agent: explanation | Exam: sat-math-100 | Problem 42 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Explanation:
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 

Expanding the left-hand side gives: 
$abx^2 + (7a + 2b)x + 14 = 15x^2 + cx + 14$.

Equating coefficients: 
$ab = 15 \implies ab = 15$
$7a + 2b = c \implies 7a + 2b = c$
$14 = 14$ (a true statement).

Substituting $a+b=8$ into the second equation gives:
$7a + 2(8-a) = c \implies 13a = c - 6$.

$a$ can be either $3$ or $5$ (factors of $15$).

If $a = 3$, then $c = 39$.
If $a = 5$, then $c = 65$.

So the two possible values for $c$ are $39$ and $65$.

This question previously tripped me up because I didn't consider that $a$ and $b$ could be negative, which they must be for one of the solutions.
