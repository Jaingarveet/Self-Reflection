# Model: cohere-command-r-plus | Agent: instructions | Exam: sat-math-100 | Problem 17 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:
Topic: Geography
Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: If $\frac{a}{b}=2$, what is the value of $\frac{4 b}{a} ?$
Choices:
  A: 0
  B: 1
  C: 2
  D: 4
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:
[REDACTED]. Identify the given information: $\frac{a}{b} = [REDACTED]$.
[REDACTED]. Rewrite $a$ in terms of $b$: $a = [REDACTED]b$.
3. Substitute this expression into the fraction: $\frac{[REDACTED]b}{[REDACTED]b}$.
[REDACTED]. Simplify the fraction: $\frac{[REDACTED]a}{a}$.
5. Further simplify by substituting $a = [REDACTED]b$: $\frac{[REDACTED] \cdot [REDACTED]b}{[REDACTED]b}$.
6. Calculate the value: $\frac{[REDACTED]b}{[REDACTED]b} = \frac{[REDACTED]}{[REDACTED]}$, which matches choice [REDACTED].
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Given a/b = 2, we can rewrite a = 2b.
Now, we substitute this into the fraction: 4b/a = 4b/(2b).
Simplifying this gives us 4b/2b = 2.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
