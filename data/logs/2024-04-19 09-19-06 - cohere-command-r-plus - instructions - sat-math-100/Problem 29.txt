## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Context: \begin{center}.\begin{tabular}{|l|c|}.\hline.\multicolumn{1}{|c|}{Planet} & Acceleration due to gravity $\left(\frac{\mathrm{m}}{\mathrm{sec}^{2}}\right)$ \\.\hline\hline.Mercury & 3.6 \\.\hline.Venus & 8.9 \\.\hline.Earth & 9.8 \\.\hline.Mars & 3.8 \\.\hline.Jupiter & 26.0 \\.\hline.Saturn & 11.1 \\.\hline.Uranus & 10.7 \\.\hline.Neptune & 14.1 \\.\hline.\end{tabular}.\end{center}.The chart above shows approximations of the acceleration due to gravity in meters per.second squared $\left(\frac{\mathrm{m}}{\sec ^{2}}\right)$ for the eight planets in our solar system. The weight of an object on a given planet can be found by using the formula $W=m g$, where $W$ is the weight of the object measured in newtons, $m$ is the mass of the object measured in kilograms, and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity on the planet measured in $\frac{m}{\sec ^{2}}$
Question: An object on Earth has a weight of 150 newtons. On which planet would the same object have an approximate weight of 170 newtons?
Choices:
  A: Venus
  B: Saturn
  C: Uranus
  D: Neptune
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Understand the formula $W = mg$, where $W$ is weight, $m$ is mass, and $g$ is acceleration due to gravity. 
2. Calculate the mass of the object using the weight on Earth and Earth's acceleration due to gravity. 
3. For each planet, multiply the calculated mass by the respective acceleration due to gravity to find the weight. 
4. Compare the calculated weights to the desired weight of $170$ newtons. 
5. Choose the planet that provides the closest approximation.
## Assistant 2:
Reflection: I made a calculation error in my previous attempt. To find the correct answer, I need to calculate the mass of the object using the weight on Earth and then use that mass with each planet's gravity to find the approximate weights.

Thought: 
Using the formula $W = mg$, we can calculate the mass of the object:
\[m = \frac{W}{g} = \frac{150 \text{ N}}{9.8 \frac{\text{m}}{\text{sec}^2}} \approx 15.30 \text{ kg}\]

Now, we can find the weight of this object on each planet:
- Venus: $W \approx 15.30 \text{ kg} \times 8.9 \frac{\text{m}}{\text{sec}^2} \approx 136.17$ newtons (N)
- Saturn: $W \approx 15.30 \text{ kg} \times 11.1 \frac{\text{m}}{\text{sec}^2} \approx 169.83$ N
- Uranus: $W \approx 15.30 \text{ kg} \times 10.7 \frac{\text{m}}{\text{sec}^2} \approx 163.71$ N
- Neptune: $W \approx 15.30 \text{ kg} \times 14.1 \frac{\text{m}}{\text{sec}^2} \approx 215.73$ N

Comparing the calculated weights, Saturn provides the closest approximation to 170 N.
Action: Answer("B")
