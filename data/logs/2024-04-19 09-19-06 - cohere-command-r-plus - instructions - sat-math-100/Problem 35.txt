# Model: cohere-command-r-plus | Agent: instructions | Exam: sat-math-100 | Problem 35 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:

1. Square both sides of the equation, being mindful of the direction of the equality. 
2. Simplify the resulting quadratic equation. 
3. Apply the quadratic formula to find potential solutions. 
4. Check each potential solution in the original equation, not just the simplified quadratic form. 
5. Ensure that the direction of the equality is maintained throughout all steps.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Squaring gives the equation $4x = x^2 - 6x + 9$, which simplifies to $3x^2 - 6x - 9 = 0$. Using the quadratic formula, we find $x = 2$ or $x = -3/2$. However, we must check these solutions in the original equation. For $x=2$, the left side of the original equation is $\sqrt{8}$, while the right side is $-1$, so this doesn't work. For $x=-3/2$, we have $-\sqrt{6} = -9/2$, which is true. Therefore, the answer is $x=-3/2$. Only choice II, 9, is correct.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
