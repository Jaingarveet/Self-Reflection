# Model: cohere-command-r-plus | Agent: instructions | Exam: sat-math-100 | Problem 54 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:
Topic: Geography
Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: For a polynomial $p(x)$, the value of $p(3)$ is -2 .Which of the following must be true about $p(x)$ ?
Choices:
  A: $x-5$ is a factor of $p(x)$.
  B: $x-2$ is a factor of $p(x)$.
  C: $x+2$ is a factor of $p(x)$.
  D: The remainder when $p(x)$ is divided by $x-3$ is -2 .
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:

1. Understand the question: Identify the given information ($p(3) = -2$) and the task (determine the factor or remainder). 
2. Recognize the concept: Identify this problem as one that involves the remainder theorem. 
3. Apply the theorem: Use the remainder theorem, which states that the remainder when $p(x)$ is divided by $(x - c)$ is equal to $p(c)$. 
4. Plug in the value: Substitute $x = 3$ into the polynomial $p(x)$ to find $p(3)$. 
5. Interpret the result: Recognize that $p(3) = -2$ is the remainder when $p(x)$ is divided by $(x - 3)$. 
6. Choose the correct answer: Select the answer choice that matches this conclusion.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: The remainder when $p(x)$ is divided by $(x - 3)$ is equal to $p(3)$, which is given as -2. So, the correct answer is that the remainder when $p(x) $ is divided by $x - 3$ is -2.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
