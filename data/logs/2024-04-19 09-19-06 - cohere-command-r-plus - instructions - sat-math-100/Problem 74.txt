# Model: cohere-command-r-plus | Agent: instructions | Exam: sat-math-100 | Problem 74 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Instructions:
1. Rationalize the denominator by multiplying by the conjugate.
2. Simplify the numerator and denominator of the resulting fraction.
3. Check if the resulting fraction matches any of the choices.
4. If not, multiply the numerator and denominator by the expression that makes the denominator match one of the choices.
5. Simplify the resulting fraction and choose the correct answer.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
First, I rationalize the denominator by multiplying by the conjugate of the numerator:
$\frac{1}{\frac{1}{x+2}+\frac{1}{x+3}} \cdot \frac{(x+3)(x+2)}{(x+3)(x+2)} = \frac{(x+3)(x+2)}{(x+3)^2 + (x+2)^2}$.

Simplifying the numerator and denominator of the resulting fraction, I get:
$\frac{(x+3)(x+2)}{(x+3)^2 + (x+2)^2} = \frac{x^2 + 5x + 6}{x^2 + 8x + 13}$.

None of the choices have a denominator of $x^2 + 8x + 13$. So, I multiply the numerator and denominator of the resulting fraction by $\frac{x^2 + 5x + 6}{x^2 + 5x + 6}$ to get a denominator of $x^2 + 5x + 6$, which matches choice A.

$\frac{x^2 + 5x + 6}{x^2 + 8x + 13} \cdot \frac{x^2 + 5x + 6}{x^2 + 5x + 6} = \frac{(x^2 + 5x + 6)^2}{(x^2 +5x +6)(x^2 + 8x + 13)} = \frac{(x^2 + 5x + 6)^2}{x^4 + 13x^2 + 6x^2 + 40x + 78}$.

Simplifying the denominator of the resulting fraction:
$\frac{(x^2 + 5x + 6)^2}{x^4 + 19x^2 + 40x + 78}$.

Factoring the denominator:
$\frac{(x^2 + 5x + 6)^2}{(x^2 + 13)(x^2 + 6)}$.

Now, I can see that the denominator matches the numerator of choice A. So, choice A is the correct answer.
Action: Answer("A")
