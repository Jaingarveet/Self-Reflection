Question: A television with a price of $\$ 300$ is to be purchased with an initial payment of $\$ 60$ and weekly payments of $\$ 30$. Which of the following equations can be used to find the number of weekly payments, $w$, required to complete the purchase, assuming there are no taxes or fees?
Choices:
  A: $300=30 w-60$
  B: $300=30 w$
  C: $300=30 w+60$
  D: $300=60 w-30$
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Identify the given values: total cost, initial payment, weekly payment, and unknown number of weekly payments. 
2. Understand the relationship between these values: total cost equals initial payment plus weekly payments multiplied by the number of weeks. 
3. Form an equation using the given values and their relationship. 
4. Simplify the equation and isolate the unknown variable. 
5. Solve for the unknown variable to find the number of weekly payments. 
6. Compare the formed equation with the options provided to choose the correct answer.
## Assistant 2:
Reflection: The equation representing the relationship between the given values is $300=60+30w$, where $60$ is the initial payment, $30$ is the weekly payment, and $w$ is the unknown number of weekly payments. Simplifying and rearranging this equation to solve for $w$ results in $300-60=30w \implies w=8$. Therefore, the correct equation is $300=30w+60$.

Thought: 
The total cost of the television ($$300$$) is the initial payment ($$60$$) plus the weekly payments ($$30$$) multiplied by the number of weeks ($$w$$). 
This can be represented by the equation $300 = 60 + 30w$. 
To isolate $w$, we can subtract $60$ from both sides, resulting in $300 - 60 = 30w$, and then divide by $30$ to get $w = 8$. 
So, the equation that correctly represents this situation is $300 = 30w + 60$.
Action: Answer("C")
