# Model: cohere-command-r-plus | Agent: instructions | Exam: sat-math-100 | Problem 3 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:

Topic: Math
Question: If $\frac{3}{5} w=\frac{4}{3}$, what is the value of $w ?$
Choices:
  A: $\frac{9}{20}$
  B: $\frac{4}{5}$
  C: $\frac{5}{4}$
  D: $\frac{20}{9}$
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Identify the given equation.
2. Recognize that you need to isolate $w$.
3. Multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of the coefficient of $w$.
4. Simplify the resulting expression step-by-step.
5. Choose the answer that matches your simplified result.
## Assistant 2:
Reflection: I made a mistake in my previous attempt. I incorrectly assumed that I needed to find the common denominator of the fractions. Instead, I should have focused on isolating the variable $w$ by multiplying by the reciprocal of the coefficient. By doing so, I would have multiplied the coefficient and the fraction by their reciprocal, effectively canceling them out and leaving $w$ by itself. This would have given me the correct value for $w$.

Thought: 
Given equation: $\frac{3}{5} w = \frac{4}{3}$.

To isolate $w$, multiply both sides by the reciprocal of $\frac{3}{5}$, which is $\frac{5}{3}$.

$\left(\frac{5}{3}\right) \times \left(\frac{3}{5} w\right) = \left(\frac{5}{3}\right) \times \left(\frac{4}{3}\right)$.

Simplifying the left side: $\frac{5}{3} \times \frac{3}{5} = 1$, so we have $w = \frac{5}{3} \times \frac{4}{3}$.

Now, multiply the fractions: $w = \frac{5 \times 4}{3 \times 3} = \frac{20}{9}$.
Action: Answer("D")
