# Model: cohere-command-r-plus | Agent: instructions | Exam: sat-math-100 | Problem 60 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: Mr. Kohl has a beaker containing $n$ milliliters of solution to distribute to the students in his chemistry class. If he gives each student 3 milliliters of solution, he will have 5 milliliters left over. In order to give each student 4 milliliters of solution, he will need an additional 21 milliliters. How many students are in the class?
Choices:
  A: 16
  B: 21
  C: 23
  D: 26
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Understand the problem: Mr. Kohl has a fixed amount of solution, and there are two scenarios with different distributions. 
2. Identify the variables: $n$ (amount of solution), $x$ (number of students). 
3. Write the equations: $3x + 5 = n$ and $4x + 5 = n + [REDACTED]$. 
4. Solve for $n$ in the first equation: $n = 3x + 5$. 
5. Substitute and solve: Replace $n$ in the second equation and solve for $x$. 
6. Double-check: Plug $x$ back into both equations to ensure they are satisfied. 
7. Answer: Choose the option that matches the calculated value of $x$.
## Assistant 2:
Reflection: Solving for $n$ in the first equation, I get $n = 3x + 5$. Then, I substitute this into the second equation: $4x + 5 = 3x + 5 + 21$. Combining like terms: $x = 20$. This means there are $20$ students in the class, and I should choose **Answer "D: 20"** as the correct choice.

Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
