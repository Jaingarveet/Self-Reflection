## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")

Question: $$h=-4.9 t^{2}+25 t$$The equation above expresses the approximate height $h$, in meters, of a ball $t$ seconds after it is launched vertically upward from the ground with an initial velocity of 25 meters per second. After approximately how many seconds will the ball hit the ground?
Choices:
  A: 3.5
  B: 4.0
  C: 4.5
  D: 5.0
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Understand the context: a ball is launched vertically upward with an initial velocity, and we want to find when it hits the ground. 
2. Set $h=0$ to find when the height is zero (ground level). 
3. Use the quadratic formula to solve for $t$, being careful with the signs and square root calculations. 
4. Interpret the solutions: the positive value represents the time it takes for the ball to reach the ground. 
5. Compare the approximate value to the given answer choices and select the best match.
## Assistant 2:
Reflection: Last time, I made a mistake in applying the quadratic formula, which led to an incorrect value for $t$. I need to be more careful with the calculations and the concept of positive and negative roots in this context.

Thought: 
Setting $h=0$, we get $-4.9 t^{2}+25 t=0$. Applying the quadratic formula, $t=\frac{-(-25) \pm \sqrt{(-25)^{2}-4 \cdot(-4.9) \cdot 0}}{2 \cdot(-4.9)}$. Simplifying, we get $t=5$ seconds.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
