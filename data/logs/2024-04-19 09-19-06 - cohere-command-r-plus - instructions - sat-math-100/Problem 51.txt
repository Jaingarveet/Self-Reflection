## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Solve the system of equations to find the values of $x$ and $y$.
2. Double-check your calculations for $x$ and $y$.
3. Calculate the value of $x - y$ using the found values of $x$ and $y$.
4. Simplify the expression $x - y$ to find the final answer.
5. Choose the answer choice that matches your calculated result.
## Assistant 2:
Reflection: I misread the question and calculated $y - x$ instead of $x - y$.

Solution:
1. To solve this system of equations, we can use the elimination method. First, we multiply the first equation by 3 and the second equation by 2:
$$\begin{aligned}
3(2 x-3 y)&=3(-14) \\
6 x-9 y&=-42
\end{aligned}$$

$$\begin{aligned}
2(3 x-2 y)&=2(-6) \\
6 x-4 y&=-12
\end{aligned}$$

2. Now, we can add the two equations to eliminate $x$:
$$\begin{aligned}
6 x-9 y+6 x-4 y &= -42-12 \\
12 x-13 y &= -54
\end{aligned}$$

3. Next, we divide the entire equation by 13 to solve for $y$:
$$\begin{aligned}
\frac{12}{13} x-\frac{13}{13} y &= \frac{-54}{13} \\
y &= \frac{12}{13} \cdot \frac{5}{2}-\frac{54}{13} \\
y &= \frac{30}{26}-\frac{54}{13} \\
y &= \frac{15-54}{13} \\
y &= \frac{-39}{13} \\
y &= -3
\end{aligned}$$

4. Now that we have the value of $y$, we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to find $x$:
$$\begin{aligned}
2 x-3(-3) &= -14 \\
2 x+9 &= -14 \\
2 x &= -23 \\
x &= -\frac{23}{2}
\end{aligned}$$

5. Finally, we can calculate the value of $x - y$:
$$\begin{aligned}
x - y &= -\frac{23}{2}-(-3) \\
x - y &= -\frac{23}{2}+3 \\
x - y &= -\frac{23}{2}+\frac{6}{2} \\
x - y &= -\frac{17}{2}
\endend$$

So, the final answer is $x - y = -\frac{17}{2}$, which is **A: -8**.
