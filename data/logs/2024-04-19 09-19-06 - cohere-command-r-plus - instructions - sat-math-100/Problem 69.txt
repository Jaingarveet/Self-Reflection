Question: Alan drives an average of 100 miles each week. His car can travel an average of 25 miles per gallon of gasoline. Alan would like to reduce his weekly expenditure on gasoline by $\$ 5$. Assuming gasoline costs $\$ 4$ per gallon, which equation can Alan use to determine how many fewer average miles, $m$, he should drive each week?
Choices:
  A: $\frac{25}{4} m=95$
  B: $\frac{25}{4} m=5$
  C: $\frac{4}{25} m=95$
  D: $\frac{4}{25} m=5$
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Understand the given information: Alan's average weekly mileage, car's mileage, desired savings, and gasoline cost.
2. Identify the relationships: Number of gallons to the number of miles and cost to the number of gallons.
3. Calculate the number of gallons represented by the desired savings: $\$5$ savings at $\$4$ per gallon.
4. Determine the number of miles represented by the calculated gallons: Use the car's mileage rate.
5. Set up the equation: Express the relationship between the number of fewer miles ($m$) and the desired savings.
6. Simplify the equation: Ensure it matches the format of the choices and your calculations.
7. Choose the correct answer: Select the choice that aligns with your simplified equation.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Alan wants to save $5 on gasoline. At $4 per gallon, this means he wants to use 5/4 = 1.25 fewer gallons.

His car travels 25 miles per gallon, so he should reduce his mileage by 1.25 * 25 = 31.25 miles.

So, the equation is: 
(25/4) * m = 31.25

Simplifying, we get:
m = 31.25 * (4/25)
=> m = 625/25
=> m = 25

Therefore, the answer is C: 25/4 * m = 95.

Action: Answer("C")
