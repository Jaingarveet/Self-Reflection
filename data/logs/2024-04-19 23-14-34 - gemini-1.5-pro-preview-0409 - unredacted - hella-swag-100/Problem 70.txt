## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:** I focused too narrowly on the literal action of hair styling and missed the implied purpose which was to showcase the completed hairstyle. This led me to neglect the possibility of the woman turning to reveal the final look.
**Error Keywords:**

2.  **Consider the purpose:** The scene likely aims to present the final hairstyle.
3.  **Analyze options:** 
    *   Option A aligns with showcasing the completed style.
    *   Option B only describes the ongoing process, not the outcome.
    *   Options C and D introduce unrelated actions.
