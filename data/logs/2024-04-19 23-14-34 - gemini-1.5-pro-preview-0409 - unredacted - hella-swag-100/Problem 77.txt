Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to get rid of calluses on feet [title] Soak your feet on a regular basis. [step] If you have calluses, try soaking your feet on a regular basis to soften the dry and dead skin. Softening the skin with a warm water and mild soap foot bath will make removing that skin much easier.
Choices:
  A: [substeps] Fill a bowl with warm water and mild soap and add epsom salts. Gently immerse your feet in the bath for 10 to 15 minutes.
  B: The softer the skin on your feet, the less likely calluses will develop. Soak any areas that you have calluses on for at least thirty minutes.
  C: You may want to consider adding some dish soap to your foot bath to get your feet properly soaked. [title] Rinse off with warm water after soaking.
  D: [substeps] Use warm water instead of hot water. Hot water can dry out your skin and irritate your feet.

## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:** I focused on the procedural aspect of preparing the foot bath rather than considering potential risks or precautions. I should have prioritized the safety and well-being of the individual by choosing the option that emphasizes using warm water to avoid skin irritation.
**Error Keywords:**
*   Misprioritization 
*   Ignoring safety considerations
*   Focusing on procedure over precaution
**Step-by-Step Solution:**
1.  **Analyze the context:** The text provides instructions on soaking feet to soften calluses.
2.  **Identify the goal:** The next step should logically provide additional information or precautions related to soaking feet.
3.  **Evaluate options based on safety and relevance:**
    *   Option A introduces Epsom salts, which is not directly related to the primary concern of calluses.
    *   Option B focuses on the duration of soaking, which is not the immediate next step.
    *   Option C suggests using dish soap, which is not typically recommended for foot care and could be harsh on the skin.
    *   Option D highlights the importance of using warm water to avoid skin irritation, directly addressing a potential risk associated with soaking feet.
4.  **Choose the safest and most relevant option:** Option D provides a crucial safety precaution and is the most logical next step in the instructions.
