Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to decide to take testosterone [title] Ask yourself if you want to improve your sexual function. [step] If you have a low sex drive, or if your sex drive has declined with age, you might want to give it a boost with some extra testosterone. In addition to increased libido, testosterone supplements can help you avoid unwanted erections and maintain erections when aroused.
Choices:
  A: A healthy body needs more testosterone in order to maintain erections. Some women who are female or older do not maintain regular erections until all their testosterone has been expended, so other people may need testosterone anyway.
  B: [substeps] Be honest with yourself if you want to lower your testosterone. Taking testosterone supplements can lead to a reduction in your sex drive.
  C: [title] Distinguish between testosterone and regular erections. [step] Studies have shown that women with low testosterone are able to have slightly lower levels of sexual function after sex, which is because the hormone changes are carried out through pleasure.
  D: [title] Ask yourself if you want a healthier body. [step] Men who suffer from low testosterone may experience increased body fat and larger breasts.

## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:** My focus on the immediate context of sexual function led me to neglect the broader health implications of testosterone. I failed to consider that the passage might expand beyond sexual benefits to encompass other aspects of health.
**Error Keywords:**
*   Limited context consideration
*   Narrow focus
*   Ignoring broader implications
**Step-by-Step Solution:**
1.  **Analyze the passage:** The passage discusses the positive effects of testosterone on sexual function in men.
2.  **Consider potential continuations:** The passage could continue by:
    *   Exploring downsides of testosterone (Option B)
    *   Discussing other benefits of testosterone (Option D)
    *   Providing inaccurate or irrelevant information (Options A and C)
3.  **Evaluate options:**
    *   Option B is plausible but limited in scope.
    *   Option D broadens the discussion to overall health, aligning with the general theme of testosterone's impact on men's well-being.
    *   Options A and C are factually incorrect and irrelevant.
4.  **Choose the best option:** Option D provides the most logical and informative continuation.
## Future Problem-Solving Strategies
**Detailed Instructions:**
1.  **Read the entire passage carefully:** Grasp the main topic and potential directions for continuation.
2.  **Identify the passage's purpose:** Is it informative, persuasive, or narrative?
3.  **Consider the target audience:** Who is the intended reader, and what information would be relevant to them?
4.  **Analyze each option:** Evaluate the logical flow, relevance, and accuracy of each choice.
5.  **Choose the option that best aligns with the passage's purpose, target audience, and overall theme.**
**General Advice:**
*   **Think holistically:** Don't get stuck on the immediate context; consider broader implications and connections.
*   **Evaluate all options:** Don't jump to conclusions; carefully assess each choice before deciding.
*   **Prioritize accuracy and relevance:** Ensure the chosen option is factually correct and contributes meaningfully to the passage.
*   **Consider the author's intent:** Try to understand the author's purpose and message when making inferences.
