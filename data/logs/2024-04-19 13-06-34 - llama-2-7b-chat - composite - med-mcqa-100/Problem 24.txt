## Assistant 2:
  Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand the importance of prioritizing safety when prescribing medication, especially during pregnancy. I will take the time to research the safety profile of each medication option and consider the potential risks and benefits for both the mother and the fetus.

For this question, I will choose the correct answer as (C) Methimazole. According to medical research, methimazole is the safest antithyroid drug to use during pregnancy. It has been shown to be effective in treating hyperthyroidism while minimizing the risk of fetal harm. In contrast, propylthiouracil (A) and I121 (B) are contraindicated during pregnancy due to their potential teratogenic effects. Carbimazole (D) is also contraindicated during the first trimester of pregnancy due to its potential to cause fetal anomalies.

In conclusion, as a medical professional, it is crucial to carefully evaluate the safety profile of each medication option during pregnancy. By doing so, we can ensure the best possible outcome for both the mother and the fetus.

Answer: (C) Methimazole
