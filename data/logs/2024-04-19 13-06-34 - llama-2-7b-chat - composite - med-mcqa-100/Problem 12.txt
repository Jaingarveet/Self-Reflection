# Model: llama-2-7b-chat | Agent: composite | Exam: med-mcqa-100 | Problem 12 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Medicine.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:
Topic: Geography
Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Medicine
Subtopic: Biochemistry
Question: Aminoacyl t-RNA is not require for ?
Choices:
  A: Proline
  B: Lysine
  C: Hydroxylysine
  D: Methionine
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question as [REDACTED], [REDACTED], when in fact the correct answer is [REDACTED], [REDACTED].

The reason for my mistake is that I misunderstood the question and thought it was asking about the requirement of aminoacyl tRN[REDACTED] for the translation of a specific amino acid, [REDACTED]. However, the question is actually asking about the requirement of aminoacyl tRN[REDACTED] for the translation of any amino acid, and the correct answer is [REDACTED].

Error Keywords:

* Misunderstanding the question
* Confusion with specific amino acids

Solution:

1. Read the question carefully and make sure you understand what it is asking.
2. Break down the question into smaller parts and identify the key concepts involved.
3. Use your knowledge of biochemistry to determine the correct answer.
4. Double-check your calculations and reasoning to ensure accuracy.

Instructions:

1. Identify the amino acid that is not required to be translated with an aminoacyl tRN[REDACTED].
2. Use your knowledge of biochemistry to determine the correct answer.
3. Double-check your calculations and reasoning to ensure accuracy.

Advice:

* Always read the question carefully and make sure you understand what it is asking.
* Always use your knowledge of biochemistry to determine the correct answer.
* Always double-check your calculations and reasoning to ensure accuracy.
* Remember that aminoacyl tRN[REDACTED] is required for the translation of all amino acids during protein synthesis.
## Assistant 2:
  Action: Answer("D")

The amino acid that is not required to be translated with an aminoacyl tRNA is Methionine. Methionine is the only amino acid that does not require an aminoacyl tRNA for its translation, as it is synthesized through a non-proteinogenic pathway. The other options, Proline, Lysine, and Hydroxylysine, do require an aminoacyl tRNA for their translation.
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
