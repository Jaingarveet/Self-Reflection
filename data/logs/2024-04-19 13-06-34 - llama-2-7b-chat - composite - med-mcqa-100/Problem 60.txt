Question: For an epidemiological study, every 10th person is selected from a population. This type of sampling is known as:
Choices:
  A: Simple random sampling
  B: Statified random sampling
  C: Systemic random sampling
  D: Cluster random sampling
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I incorrectly selected answer "[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]" as the correct answer for the question.

The correct answer is "[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]".

Error Keywords:

* Sampling method
* Epidemiological study
* [REDACTED]
* [REDACTED]

Solution:
For an epidemiological study, every 10th person is selected from a population. This type of sampling is known as systemic random sampling.

In systemic random sampling, every member of the population has an equal chance of being selected, regardless of their location or any other characteristic. This method is suitable for studying the prevalence of a disease or condition in a population.

Instructions:

1. Identify the type of sampling method used in the question.
2. Determine the appropriate sampling method for an epidemiological study.
3. Explain the reasoning behind your answer.
4. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
5. Choose the answer that matches your reasoning.

Advice:

* Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
* Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
* Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
* Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
* Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
* Remember that the correct answer is the one that best fits the information provided in the question.

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, selecting answer "[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]" as the correct answer. However, upon further reflection, I realized that the correct answer is systemic random sampling. This method is suitable for an epidemiological study because it ensures that every member of the population has an equal chance of being selected, regardless of their location or any other characteristic.
