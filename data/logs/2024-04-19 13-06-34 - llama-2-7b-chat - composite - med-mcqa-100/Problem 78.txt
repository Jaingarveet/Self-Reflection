The facial artery is a branch of the carotid artery that supplies blood to the face. It terminates in the anastomosis with the branch of the ophthalmic artery, not the opposite side of the facial artery.

Instructions:

1. Identify the origin of the facial artery (branch of the carotid artery).
2. Identify the destination of the facial artery (anastomosis with the branch of the ophthalmic artery).
3. Double-check your understanding of the facial artery's course and termination point.
4. Use the information provided in the question to determine the correct answer.

* Always review and understand the anatomy of the relevant structures before answering a question.
* Take your time and double-check your answers to ensure accuracy.
* Use visual aids, such as diagrams or images, to help you understand the anatomy and terminology of the facial artery.
* Practice using different question types and scenarios to improve your knowledge and confidence in anatomy and medicine.
