  Action: Answer("C")

The Isthmus classification system for root canals was developed by Dr. John H. Isthmus in the 1950s. The classification system categorizes root canals into different types based on their shape and size. The system includes five types of root canals:

1. Type I: Oval or cylindrical canals with a single apical foramen.
2. Type II: Oval or cylindrical canals with multiple apical foramina.
3. Type III: Irregularly shaped canals with a single apical foramen.
4. Type IV: Irregularly shaped canals with multiple apical foramina.
5. Type V: Canals with a complex shape and multiple apical foramina.

The Isthmus classification system is widely used in dentistry to help dentists and endodontists categorize and treat root canals more effectively. It is important to consult with a dental expert or review relevant literature to ensure accuracy when answering questions related to dentistry.
