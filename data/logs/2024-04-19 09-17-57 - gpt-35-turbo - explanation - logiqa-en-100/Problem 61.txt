Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
My mistake was that I did not consider all the possible combinations of departments that F and M could be in charge of. 
The correct answer is [REDACTED] because if F and M are in different departments, then F and I cannot be in the same department, and I and P cannot be in the same department. Therefore, I and P must be in the same department.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
If F and M are not in charge of the same department, then F and I cannot be in charge of the same department. 
I and P cannot be in charge of the same department.
Therefore, I and P must be in charge of the same department.
Action: Answer("C")
