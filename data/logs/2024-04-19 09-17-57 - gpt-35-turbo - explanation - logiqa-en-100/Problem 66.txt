Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
My mistake was that I did not consider all possible arrangements of the islands. 
I assumed that G must be at the top of the line, but it could also be second from the top.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
If G is the northernmost island, it can either be at the top or second from the top.
If G is at the top, then the order of the islands from north to south is G, F, H, E, I.
If G is second from the top, then the order of the islands from north to south is F, G, H, E, I.
Therefore, there are two possible arrangements for this group of islands.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
