Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
My reasoning was incorrect. 
If G is in team 1, then H must be in the front of team 2.
K must be in the middle, and L must be in team 1.
P cannot be in the same team as N or Q.
However, if H is in team 2, then Q must be in the middle of team 1, which means that P and N cannot be in team 1.
Therefore, the only possible pair of magicians that can be in team 1 are [REDACTED].
