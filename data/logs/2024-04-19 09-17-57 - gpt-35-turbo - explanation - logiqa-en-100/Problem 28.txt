Explanation:
I made an error in my reasoning. I did not consider all possible combinations of players that could be selected.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
To meet the conditions, we can start by selecting E or F, but not both. Then, we select J or K, but not both. If J is selected, then G must be selected. Finally, if F is not selected, then M cannot be selected. 
We can use process of elimination to determine the correct answer. 
If we select F, then we cannot select E. If we select J, then we must select G. If we select M, then we cannot select F. 
Therefore, the only possible combination is selecting E, G, J, and either H or K. 
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
