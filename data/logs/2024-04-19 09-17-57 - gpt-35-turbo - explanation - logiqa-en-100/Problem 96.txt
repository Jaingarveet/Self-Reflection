Context: Based on the following questions? Most people think that advertisers do whatever they can to attract customers.But advertisers are not always like this.Recently, in order to expand sales, a family magazine called "Bay" was renamed "Inferno", which mainly published violent and pornographic content.As a result, some perennial advertisers from the original "Bay" magazine refused to renew the contract and turned to other publications.This shows that these advertisers not only consider economic benefits, but also take into account their ethical responsibilities.
Question: If the following item is true, can the argument be strengthened most?
Choices:
  A: The cost and selling price of "Inferno" are lower than that of "Harbour".
  B: The above advertisers who refused to renew their contracts have not affected the benefits after switching to other publications.
  C: Readers of family magazines are generally not interested in violent and pornographic content.
  D: Some clients who advertise in other family magazines and so on turn to "Inferno" magazine.

Explanation:
I misunderstood the argument and did not consider all the options carefully.
I assumed that the argument was only about ethical responsibilities, but it was also about economic benefits.
I did not consider the possibility that advertisers might switch to "Inferno" for economic reasons.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The argument is about advertisers considering both economic benefits and ethical responsibilities.
Option A is not relevant to the argument.
Option B does not strengthen the argument.
Option C is not relevant to the argument.
Option D weakens the argument because it suggests that some advertisers are attracted to "Inferno" for economic reasons.
Action: Answer("D")
