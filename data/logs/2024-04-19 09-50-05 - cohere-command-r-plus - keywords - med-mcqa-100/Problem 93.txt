Solution: Comedonal acne is a form of acne characterized by the presence of comedones (blackheads and whiteheads). [REDACTED] are the first-line treatment for this type of acne. While benzoyl peroxide is a valid treatment option for inflammatory acne, retinoids are preferred for comedonal acne due to their ability to normalize skin cell turnover and prevent the formation of comedones.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Upon reflection, I understand that while benzoyl peroxide is effective for inflammatory acne, comedonal acne responds better to treatments that can address the root cause of comedone formation. Retinoids are preferred in this case as they can effectively normalize skin cell turnover and prevent the buildup of keratin that leads to comedones. Therefore, the correct answer is "C: Retinoids."
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
