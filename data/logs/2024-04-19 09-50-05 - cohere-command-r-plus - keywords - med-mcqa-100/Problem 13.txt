Solution: Pyloric stenosis is a condition that leads to the narrowing of the pylorus, the valve connecting the stomach to the small intestine. This obstruction can cause vomiting, especially in infants, and requires prompt diagnosis. 

The investigation of choice for pyloric stenosis is abdominal ultrasound ([REDA[REDACTED]ED]). Ultrasound is highly sensitive for detecting pyloric stenosis and can identify characteristic features, such as a thickened pyloric muscle and an enlarged, "hourglass-shaped" stomach. This non-invasive imaging technique provides valuable information for diagnosis and treatment planning.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: Ultrasound is the initial investigation of choice for pyloric stenosis as it is non-invasive, highly sensitive, and can detect characteristic features such as pyloric muscle thickening and an enlarged stomach.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
