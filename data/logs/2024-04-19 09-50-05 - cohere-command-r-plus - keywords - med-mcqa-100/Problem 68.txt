Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Error Keywords:
- Misclassification
- Incomplete knowledge
- Overgeneralization

Solution: [REDACTED] is indeed the correct answer. It is a depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent, but it also has a rapid onset of action, typically within seconds, which qualifies it as a skeletal muscle relaxant. [REDACTED], while also a non-depolarizing agent, has a slightly slower onset of action, typically around 2 minutes.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: Suxamethonium is a depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent and the fastest-acting agent among the given options.
