# Model: cohere-command-r-plus | Agent: keywords | Exam: med-mcqa-100 | Problem 12 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Medicine.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:
Topic: Geography
Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis

  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought:

Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Error Keywords:
- Assumption error
- Overgeneralization
- Lack of specificity
- Insufficient knowledge of amino acid modifications
## Assistant 2:
Reflection: I made an assumption that aminoacyl t-RNA is required for all amino acid incorporations into a growing polypeptide chain. However, I overlooked the fact that proline, due to its unique cyclic structure, does not follow the typical stereospecific interaction and can bind directly to the ribosome without requiring aminoacyl t-RNA. This is an important exception to the general rule, and highlights the unique characteristics of proline in protein synthesis.

Thought: Based on my reflection, I now know that proline does not require aminoacyl t-RNA due to its ability to bind directly to the ribosome.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
