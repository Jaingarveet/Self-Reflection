## Assistant 2:
Reflection: I made an assumption that salicylic acid was not used in chemical peels, when in fact it is. I should have verified this assumption with further research before answering.

All of the listed choices are actually common agents used in chemical peeling.
Glycolic acid, kojic acid, and phenol are all alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs) that are commonly used for superficial peels. Salicylic acid, a beta hydroxy acid (BHA), is also widely used in chemical peels, particularly for treating acne and oily skin.
