## Assistant 2:
Reflection: I misinterpreted the question and selected the wrong answer choice. "Randomization implies equal and unknown chances" is the correct interpretation.

Thought: 
Randomization is a process that ensures each participant has an equal and unknown chance of being assigned to any of the groups or receiving any of the treatments being compared.

Equal chances refer to the fact that all individuals have the same probability or likelihood of being assigned to a particular group or receiving a specific treatment. This equality ensures that no bias is introduced into the assignment process.

Unknown chances refer to the concept that neither the researchers nor the participants know in advance which individuals will be assigned to which groups or treatments. This uncertainty is crucial for minimizing potential bias and ensuring the integrity of the study results.

Therefore, the correct answer is "D: Equal and unknown chances."
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
