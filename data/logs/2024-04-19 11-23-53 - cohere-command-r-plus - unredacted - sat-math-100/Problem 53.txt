# Model: cohere-command-r-plus | Agent: unredacted | Exam: sat-math-100 | Problem 53 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: A line in the $x y$-plane passes through the origin and has a slope of $\frac{1}{7}$. Which of the following points lies on the line?
Choices:
  A: $(0,7)$
  B: $(1,7)$
  C: $(7,7)$
  D: $(14,2)$

Explanation: I incorrectly applied the point-slope formula and made a mistake in calculating the $y$-coordinate for each choice. I knew the point-slope formula and the concept of slope, but I made a calculation error. 

Error Keywords:
- Calculation error
- Algebraic error
- Incorrect application of a formula

Solution: 

The line passes through the origin $(0, 0)$, and the slope is given as $\frac{1}{7}$. We can use the point-slope formula to find the equation of the line: 
$y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$

Plugging in $m = \frac{1}{7}$ and $(x_1, y_1) = (0, 0)$, we get:
$y = \frac{1}{7}x$

Now, we can test each choice by plugging in the values of $x$ and $y$ from the choices into the equation:
- A: $(0, 7)$: $7 \neq \frac{1}{7} \cdot 0$
- B: $(1, 7)$: $7 \neq \frac{1}{7} \cdot 1$
- C: $(7, 7)$: $7 = \frac{1}{7} \cdot 7$, which is true, but this does not mean that $(7, 7)$ lies on the line. We cannot choose an answer based on a single point satisfying the equation. We need to test the equation with the coordinates provided in the choices.
- D: $(14, 2)$: $2 = \frac{1}{7} \cdot 14$, which is true. This means that the point $(14, 2)$ satisfies the equation of the line and lies on the line.

Therefore, choice D is the correct answer. 

Instructions:
1. Understand the concept of slope and the point-slope formula.
2. Identify the given information: the point $(0, 0)$ and the slope $m = \frac{1}{7}$.
3. Use the point-slope formula to find the equation of the line: $y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$.
4. Plug in the values of $m$, $x_1$, and $y_1$ into the formula to get $y = \frac{1}{7}x$.
5. Test each choice by plugging the values of $x$ and $y$ from the choices into the equation $y = \frac{1}{7}x$.
6. Choose the answer where the equation holds true. 
7. Remember that a line in the plane is defined by its equation, not by a single point.

Advice:
- Understand the basic concepts of slope and the point-slope formula.
- Be careful when plugging values into formulas and performing calculations.
- Always test each choice provided in the multiple-choice question.
- Remember that a line in the plane is defined by its equation, not by a single point. Avoid making conclusions based on a single point satisfying the equation.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The equation of a line passing through the origin $(0, 0)$ with a slope of $\frac{1}{7}$ is $y = \frac{1}{7}x$.

Now, we can check each choice by plugging the values of $x$ and $y$ into the equation:
- For Choice A: $(0, 7)$, we have $y = 7 \neq \frac{1}{7} \cdot 0$. So, this point does not lie on the line.
- For Choice B: $(1, 7)$, $y = 7 \neq \frac{1}{7} \cdot 1$. So, this point does not lie on the line either.
- For Choice C: $(7, 7)$, $y = 7 = \frac{1}{7} \cdot 7$. This point satisfies the equation, so it lies on the line.
- For Choice D: $(14, 2)$, $y = 2 \neq \frac{1}{7} \cdot 14$. This point does not satisfy the equation, so it does not lie on the line.

Therefore, the correct answer is Choice C: $(7, 7)$.
