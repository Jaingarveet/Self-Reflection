## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: Mr. Kohl has a beaker containing $n$ milliliters of solution to distribute to the students in his chemistry class. If he gives each student 3 milliliters of solution, he will have 5 milliliters left over. In order to give each student 4 milliliters of solution, he will need an additional 21 milliliters. How many students are in the class?
Choices:
  A: 16
  B: 21
  C: 23
  D: 26

Explanation: 
I incorrectly set up and solved a system of equations. I made a mistake in interpreting the information and applying the mathematical concepts. My error was in the algebraic manipulation and solution process.

Error Keywords:
- Algebraic error
- Equation error
- System of equations error

Solution: 
Let $x$ be the number of students in the class. We are given that $3x + 5 = n$ and $4x + 5 = n + 21$. 

Subtracting the first equation from the second gives: 
$x = 16$. This is incorrect, as it does not satisfy the second equation. 

Correct Solution: 
Starting with the first equation, we can solve for $n$ to find: 
$n = 3x + 5$. 

Substituting this into the second equation gives: 
$4x + 5 = 3x + 5 + 21$. 

Simplifying and solving for $x$: 
$x = 10$, which satisfies both equations. 

Now we can find $n$: 
$n = 3x + 5 = 35$. 

With $n$ milliliters of solution, Mr. Kohl can give each of the $10$ students $4$ milliliters, with $5$ milliliters left over. 

Instructions: 
1. Understand the problem: Mr. Kohl has a fixed amount of solution, and there are two scenarios with different distributions. 
2. Identify the variables: $n$ (amount of solution), $x$ (number of students). 
3. Write the equations: $3x + 5 = n$ and $4x + 5 = n + 21$. 
4. Solve for $n$ in the first equation: $n = 3x + 5$. 
5. Substitute and solve: Replace $n$ in the second equation and solve for $x$. 
6. Double-check: Plug $x$ back into both equations to ensure they are satisfied. 
7. Answer: Choose the option that matches the calculated value of $x$. 

Advice: 
 - Take the time to understand the problem and identify the relevant variables. 
 - Clearly define your variables and equations. 
 - Solve one equation at a time, and then substitute to find the final answer. 
 - Always double-check your solution by plugging your answer back into the original equations. 
 - Be careful with algebraic manipulations and ensure each step is valid.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Let $x$ be the number of students in the class. We are given that $3x + 5 = n$ and $4x + 5 = n + 21$, where $n$ is the total volume of the solution. 

Solving for $n$ in the first equation, we get $n = 3x + 5$. Substituting this into the second equation, we have $4x + 5 = 3x + 5 + 21$. 

Simplifying and solving for $x$, we find $x = 10$, which satisfies both equations. Therefore, there are $10$ students in the class.

Action: Answer("B")
