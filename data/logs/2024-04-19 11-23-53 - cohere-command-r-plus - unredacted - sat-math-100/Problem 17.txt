## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that $4b$ in the numerator would cancel out with $a$ in the denominator, resulting in a final value of $\frac{2}{1}$. However, my mistake was in not recognizing that $4b$ should be simplified to $2a$ before proceeding with the calculation. This incorrect assumption led me to choose answer option B.

Error Keywords:
- Algebraic simplification error
- Cancellation error
- Assumption error

Solution: 
Given $\frac{a}{b} = 2$, we can rewrite this as $a = 2b$. Now, we substitute this expression into the fraction:
$\frac{4b}{a} = \frac{4b}{2b} = \frac{2a}{a} = \frac{2 \cdot 2b}{2b} = \frac{4b}{2b} = \frac{2}{1} = C$

Instructions:
1. Identify the given information: $\frac{a}{b} = 2$.
2. Rewrite $a$ in terms of $b$: $a = 2b$.
3. Substitute this expression into the fraction: $\frac{4b}{2b}$.
4. Simplify the fraction: $\frac{2a}{a}$.
5. Further simplify by substituting $a = 2b$: $\frac{2 \cdot 2b}{2b}$.
6. Calculate the value: $\frac{4b}{2b} = \frac{2}{1}$, which matches choice C.

Advice:
- Always simplify algebraic expressions step-by-step, checking each step for accuracy.
- Be cautious when canceling out factors; ensure you're not eliminating information that should be used in subsequent steps.
- Double-check your calculations and final answer.
- Remember that fractions can be simplified by canceling common factors in the numerator and denominator.

$\frac{4b}{a} = \frac{4b}{2b} = \frac{2a}{a} = \frac{2}{1}$

So, the correct answer is $\boxed{\frac{2}{1}}$, which is represented by choice C.
