Explanation: I misinterpreted the data and made an algebra error. I incorrectly assumed a linear relationship between x and y, ignoring the constant term. 

Error Keywords:
- Data interpretation error
- Algebra error
- Assumption error

Solution: 

The table shows that as x increases by 3a, y decreases by a. This indicates a linear relationship with a slope of -1/3. The y-intercept is at (0,0), as when x=a, y=0. 

The equation for this line is y = (-1/3)x, or, rearranging to make 'x' the subject: 

$2x - 3y = 0 \times 5a$. 

Multiplying by 5a gives: 

$2x - 3y = 0$, or $2x - 3y = a \times 0$, which simplifies to $x + 2y = 0 \times a$, or $x + 2y = a$. 

Instructions: 

1. Examine the table and identify the pattern: as x increases by 3a, y decreases by 1a. 
2. Recognize this as a linear relationship with a negative slope. 
3. Find the y-intercept by identifying the value of y when x=a. 
4. Express the relationship as an equation in the form y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept. 
5. Rearrange the equation to make x the subject, and then multiply by the appropriate value of a to match the options. 

Advice: 

- Always examine the data carefully and identify patterns or relationships. 
- Avoid making assumptions; work with the data as it is presented. 
- When dealing with linear relationships, focus on the slope and y-intercept. 
- Practice rearranging equations and identifying equivalent expressions. 
- Double-check your work by substituting values from the table into your equation.

Thought: 
The table shows a clear pattern: as $x$ increases by $3a$, $y$ decreases by $a$. This indicates a linear relationship with a slope of $-\frac{1}{3}$. The y-intercept is at $(0,0)$, as when $x = a$, $y = 0$.

The equation for this line is $y = -\frac{1}{3}x + 0$, which can be rewritten as $2x - 3y = 0$. Multiplying both sides of this equation by $a$ gives us $2xa - 3ay = 0 \times a$, which simplifies to $2xa - 3ay = a \times 0$ or $2xa - 3ay = 0$. Therefore, the equation representing the relationship is $2x - 3y = 0$.

Now, we need to express this equation in a form where 'x' is the subject, as per the options provided. So, we rearrange to get:
$2x - 3y = 0 \times a$
$2x - 3y = a \times 0$
$2x - 3y = a$.

So, the correct answer is the equation where $2x - 3y$ is equal to $a$.
