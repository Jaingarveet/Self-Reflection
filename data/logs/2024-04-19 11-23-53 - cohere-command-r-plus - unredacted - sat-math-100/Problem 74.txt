## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Explanation: I incorrectly simplified the fraction and multiplied by the conjugate in the denominator. I made a calculation error when simplifying the numerator of the final fraction. 

Error Keywords:
- Simplification error
- Arithmetic error
- Calculation error

Solution: 
We can rationalize the denominator of the fraction by multiplying both the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator:
$\frac{1}{\frac{1}{x+2}+\frac{1}{x+3}} \cdot \frac{(x+2)(x+3)}{(x+2)(x+3)} = \frac{(x+2)(x+3)}{(x+2)+(x+3)} = \frac{(x+2)(x+3)}{2x+5}$.

Then, we multiply the numerator and denominator by $2x+5$:
$\frac{(x+2)(x+3)(2x+5)}{(2x+5)^2}$.

Simplifying the numerator, we get:
$(x+2)(x+3)(2x+5) = 2x^3 + 13x^2 + 26x + 30$.

Simplifying the denominator, we get:
$(2x+5)^2 = 4x^2 + 20x + 25$.

So, the simplified fraction is:
$\frac{2x^3 + 13x^2 + 26x + 30}{4x^2 + 20x + 25}$.

To get the expression in the form given in the choices, we need to find the common denominator of the fraction, which is $4x^2 + 20x + 25$. Multiplying the numerator and denominator of the fraction by $\frac{x^2+5x+6}{x^2+5x+6}$, we get:
$\frac{(2x^3 + 13x^2 + 26x + 30)(x^2+5x+6)}{(4x^2 + 20x + 25)(x^2+5x+6)}$.

Simplifying the numerator, we get:
$(2x^3 + 13x^2 + 26x + 30)(x^2+5x+6) = x^5 + 8x^4 + 35x^3 + 70x^2 + 100x + 150$.

Therefore, the equivalent expression is:
$\frac{x^5 + 8x^4 + 35x^3 + 70x^2 + 100x + 150}{x^2 + 5x + 6}$.

This matches the expression in choice B, $\frac{x^2 + 5x + 6}{2x + 5}$.

Instructions:
1. Rationalize the denominator by multiplying by the conjugate.
2. Simplify the numerator and denominator of the resulting fraction.
3. Check if the resulting fraction matches any of the choices.
4. If not, multiply the numerator and denominator by the expression that makes the denominator match one of the choices.
5. Simplify the resulting fraction and choose the correct answer.

Advice:
- Be careful with fraction simplification and multiplication.
- Double-check your calculations and simplify each step completely before moving on. 
- Be cautious when multiplying complex expressions. 
- Ensure that you understand the properties of fractions and rational expressions.
