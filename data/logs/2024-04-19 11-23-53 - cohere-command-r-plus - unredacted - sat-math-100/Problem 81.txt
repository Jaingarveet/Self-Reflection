## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: If $a^{2}+b^{2}=z$ and $a b=y$, which of the following is equivalent to $4 z+8 y$ ?
Choices:
  A: $(a+2 b)^{2}$
  B: $(2 a+2 b)^{2}$
  C: $(4 a+4 b)^{2}$
  D: $(4 a+8 b)^{2}$

Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation: I incorrectly expanded the squared terms and made a substitution error. I should have substituted $a^2 + b^2$ for $z$ and $ab$ for $y$ directly into the choices without expanding the squared terms. 

Error Keywords:
- Algebra error
- Expansion error
- Substitution error

Solution: 

Given: $a^{2}+b^{2}=z$ and $ab=y$

We want to find an expression equivalent to $4z + 8y$:

Choice A: $4(a^2 + b^2) + 8ab = 4z + 8y$ (Substitute $z$ and $y$)

Choice B: $4(a^2 + b^2) + 4(ab) = 4z + 4y$ (Substitute $z$ and $y$)

Choice C: $16(a^2 + b^2) + 16(ab) = 16z + 16y$ (Substitute $z$ and $y$)

Choice D: $16(a^2 + b^2) + 64(ab) = 16z + 64y$ (Substitute $z$ and $y$)

The correct answer is choice B, which simplifies to $4z + 4y$.

Instructions:

1. Identify the given equations: $a^2 + b^2 = z$ and $ab = y$.
2. Understand the task: Find the expression equivalent to $4z + 8y$.
3. Substitute $z$ and $y$ directly into the choices without expanding the squared terms.
4. Simplify each choice to match the form $4z + 8y$, $4z + 4y$, $16z + 16y$, etc.
5. Choose the answer that matches the simplified expression.

Advice:

- Read and understand the question carefully.
- Identify the given equations and the task at hand.
- Substitute the given values directly without unnecessary expansion or manipulation.
- Simplify each choice step-by-step to identify the correct expression.
- Avoid overcomplicating the problem; sometimes the simplest approach is the best.
