## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Explanation: I correctly applied the quadratic formula but made a calculation error when simplifying the expression inside the square root. I also made a mistake in distributing the negative sign when simplifying the solutions.

Error Keywords:
- Calculation error
- Simplification error
- Sign error

Solution: We are given the quadratic equation $3x^2 + 12x + 6 = 0$. Using the quadratic formula, $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$, we can solve for the values of $x$. Plugging in the values, we get:

$$x = \frac{-12 \pm \sqrt{(12)^2 - 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 6}}{2 \cdot 3} = \frac{-12 \pm \sqrt{144 - 72}}{6} = \frac{-12 \pm 12\sqrt{30}}{36}$$

Simplifying further, we get:

$$x = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{30}}{3}$$

This can be written as:

$$x = -2 \pm \frac{\sqrt{30}}{3}$$

Instructions:
1. Apply the quadratic formula: $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$.
2. Plug in the values from the given equation.
3. Simplify the expression inside the square root.
4. Simplify the fraction.
5. Distribute the negative sign correctly when simplifying further.
6. Check your calculations and final answer.

Advice:
- Always double-check your calculations, especially when simplifying complex expressions.
- Pay attention to the signs when distributing negative signs.
- Simplify fractions whenever possible.
- Ensure your final answer is in the required format.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The quadratic equation is $3x^2 + 12x + 6 = 0$. Using the quadratic formula, $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$, the solutions are found to be $x = \frac{-12 \pm \sqrt{144 - 72}}{6} = \frac{-12 \pm 12\sqrt{30}}{36} = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{30}}{3}$, which simplifies to $x = -2 \pm \frac{\sqrt{30}}{3}$.
Action: Answer("B")
