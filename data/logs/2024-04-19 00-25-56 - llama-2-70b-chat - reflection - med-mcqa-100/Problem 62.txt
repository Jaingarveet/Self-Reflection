## Assistant 2:
Response:
  Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I confused the anatomy of the uterine tube. The narrowest part of the uterine tube is actually the interstitial part, not the isthmus.

Error Keywords:

* Anatomy error
* Confusion
* Incorrect identification

Solution:
The correct answer is D, Interstitial.

Instructions:

1. Review the anatomy of the uterine tube.
2. Identify the narrowest part of the uterine tube.
3. Choose the corresponding answer.

Advice:

* Always review the relevant anatomy before answering a question.
* Double-check your answer by comparing it to the correct answer.
* Make sure you understand the question and the options before answering.
* Practice, practice, practice to build your knowledge and confidence.

Additional Tips:

* The interstitial part of the uterine tube is the narrowest part, located between the ampulla and the isthmus.
* The isthmus is the wider part of the uterine tube, connecting the ampulla to the uterus.
* The infundibulum is the funnel-shaped opening of the uterine tube that connects to the ovary.
* The ampulla is the wider part of the uterine tube that receives the ovum from the infundibulum.
