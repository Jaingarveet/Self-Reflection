## Assistant 2:
  Answer: B

The statement "Huaizhou City will certainly encounter the problems of stagnation of economic development or deterioration of the natural environment" is best supported by the given information.

The information states that the development of Huaizhou City depends on industry, which provides jobs and wages for residents, but also produces pollution that threatens the natural environment. This implies that the city's economic growth and natural environment are interconnected and that a problem in one area will affect the other. Therefore, if the city's industry, which is the backbone of its economy, inevitably produces pollution, it is likely that the city will face problems such as stagnation of economic development or deterioration of the natural environment.

Option A is incorrect because it suggests that the quality of life in Huaizhou depends only on economic growth and natural living environment, but the given information indicates that the city's development also depends on industry, which affects both economic growth and the natural environment.

Option C is incorrect because it states that the economic environment of Huaizhou has deteriorated in recent years, but the given information does not provide information about the current state of the city's economy.

Option D is incorrect because it states that the pollution of air, water, and buildings in Huaizhou City is mainly caused by chemical companies, but the given information does not provide information about the specific causes of pollution in the city.
