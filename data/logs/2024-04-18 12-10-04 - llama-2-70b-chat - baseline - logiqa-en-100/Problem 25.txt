Context: Prince Lima in Li Na's mind is tall, handsome and doctor.She knew four men, Wang Wei, Wu Gang, Li Qiang, and Liu Dawei, and one of them met all the conditions she required.(1) Among the 4 men, there are 3 tall men, 2 doctors, and 1 is handsome; (2) Wang Wei and Wu Gang are both doctors; (3) Liu Dawei and Li Qiang are the same height; (4) Li Qiang and Wang Wei Not all are tall.
Question: Who can meet all the requirements of Li Na?
Choices:
  A: Liu Dawei
  B: Li Qiang
  C: Wu Gang
  D: Wang Wei
## Assistant 2:
  Thought: 
From (1), we know that Prince Lima is tall, handsome, and a doctor.
From (2), we know that Wang Wei and Wu Gang are both doctors.
From (3), we know that Liu Dawei and Li Qiang are the same height.
From (4), we know that Li Qiang and Wang Wei are not both tall.

We can deduce that Li Qiang is not tall, and Wang Wei is tall.
Wu Gang is a doctor, but we cannot determine if he is tall or handsome.
Liu Dawei is not a doctor, so he cannot meet all of Li Na's requirements.

Therefore, the only person who can meet all of Li Na's requirements is Wang Wei.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
