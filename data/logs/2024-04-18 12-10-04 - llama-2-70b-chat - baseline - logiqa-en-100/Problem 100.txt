(1) If G or H is arranged to play, they must be in the front.Bit.(2) If K is scheduled to play, he must be in the middle.(3) If L is scheduled to play, he must be on team 1.(4) Neither P nor K can be in the same team as N.(5) P cannot be in the same team as Q.(6) If H is in team 2, Q is in the middle of team 1.
Question: If H is in Team 2, which of the listed arrangements is acceptable for Team 1?
Choices:
  A: Before? L Middle? Q After? N
  B: Before? G In? K After? N
  C: Before? L Middle? Q After? G
  D: Before? G Middle? K After? L
## Assistant 2:
  Answer: "C: Before? L Middle? Q After? G"

Explanation:
The conditions stated in the question can be summarized as follows:

1. G or H must be in the front if they are playing.
2. K must be in the middle.
3. L must be on team 1.
4. P and K cannot be on the same team as N.
5. P and Q cannot be on the same team.
6. If H is in team 2, Q is in the middle of team 1.

From the given choices, only choice C meets all the conditions:

* Before: L (condition 3)
* Middle: Q (condition 6)
* After: G (condition 1)

In this arrangement, K is in the middle of team 2, which satisfies condition 2. P is not on the same team as N or Q, which satisfies conditions 4 and 5. H is in team 2, which satisfies condition 6. Therefore, choice C is the only acceptable arrangement for team 1 if H is in team 2.
