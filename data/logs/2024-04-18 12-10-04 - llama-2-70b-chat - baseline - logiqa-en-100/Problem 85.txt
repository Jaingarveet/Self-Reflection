Topic: Logic
Context: An editor is considering the issue of choosing the manuscript for the theoretical version of the newspaper.Six papers from E, F, G, J and K are available.Taking into account the content of the article, the layout of the newspaper and other factors.(1) If paper E is used, then paper F cannot be used but paper K must be used; (2) Paper G or paper H can only be used without paper J.(3) If you don't need thesis G, you don't need thesis K.(4) Essay E is a manuscript requested by a celebrity and cannot be used.
Question: If the above items are true, which of the following items must be true?
Choices:
  A: Paper E is used, but paper H is not used.
  B: Both articles G and H are used.
  C: No paper J, but paper K.
  D: Both G and J articles are unnecessary.
## Assistant 2:
  Thought: 
From condition (1), we know that if paper E is used, paper F cannot be used, and paper K must be used.
From condition (2), we know that either paper G or paper H can be used, but not both, and that paper J cannot be used if paper G is used.
From condition (3), we know that if paper G is not used, paper K cannot be used.
From condition (4), we know that paper E cannot be used.

Now, let's consider the options:

Option A: Paper E is used, but paper H is not used.
This option is not possible since paper E cannot be used due to condition (4).

Option B: Both articles G and H are used.
This option is possible, but it contradicts condition (2), which states that either paper G or paper H can be used, but not both.

Option C: No paper J, but paper K.
This option is possible, as paper J cannot be used due to condition (2), and paper K must be used due to condition (1).

Option D: Both G and J articles are unnecessary.
This option is not possible, as we know that paper G or paper H can be used due to condition (2), and paper J cannot be used due to condition (2) and (3).

Action: Answer("C")
