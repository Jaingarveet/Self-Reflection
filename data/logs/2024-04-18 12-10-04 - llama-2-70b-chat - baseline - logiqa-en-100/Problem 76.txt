## User 2:
Topic: Logic
Context: Some Taiwan independence elements argue that all people under the jurisdiction of the People ’s Republic of China are Chinese, and Taiwanese are not under the jurisdiction of the People ’s Republic of China.Therefore, Taiwanese are not Chinese.
Question: Which of the following reasoning clearly shows that the above argument is not valid?
Choices:
  A: All successful people have to eat in clothes.I am not a successful person now, so I do n’t have to eat in clothes.
  B: Commodities have use value, and air certainly has use value, so air is of course a commodity.
  C: All technical backbones study hard.Xiao Zhang is a technical backbone.Therefore, Xiao Zhang is a hard-working person.
  D: Criminal behaviors are illegal behaviors, and violations should be condemned by the society, so all criminal behaviors should be condemned by the society.
## Assistant 2:
  The answer is B: Commodities have use value, and air certainly has use value, so air is of course a commodity.

The argument "Taiwanese are not Chinese" is based on the premise that Taiwanese are not under the jurisdiction of the People's Republic of China. However, this premise does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that Taiwanese are not Chinese. Being Chinese refers to a person's ethnicity, culture, or nationality, which is not determined by their political status or jurisdiction. Therefore, the argument is not valid.

The closest analogy to this argument is choice B. The argument that air is a commodity because it has use value is flawed. Air is not a commodity in the classical sense, as it is not something that can be bought or sold. Similarly, the argument that Taiwanese are not Chinese because they are not under the jurisdiction of the People's Republic of China is also flawed, as it is based on a faulty premise.
