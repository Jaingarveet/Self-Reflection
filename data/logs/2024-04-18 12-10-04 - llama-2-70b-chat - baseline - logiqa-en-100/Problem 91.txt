You are an expert in Logic.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Topic: Logic
Context: Researchers in a country reported that they found meteorites about 200 million years old in the strata of a certain area, and they were probably traces of flying objects when a huge meteorite hit the present province of Quebec, Canada.The clay layer with a thickness of about 5 cm also contains high concentrations of elements such as iridium and platinum, which are 50 to 2000 times the concentration normally found on the ground.In addition, this rock also contains special minerals in the formation of the late Bacques.Since the upper and lower strata also contain marine plankton fossils, it can be determined that the impact period was about 215 million years ago.
Question: Which of the following, if true, would best support the above research findings?
Choices:
  A: The rock was formed after the accumulation layer of the deep seabed in the ancient times exposed above the ground
  B: In the late Paleozoic Triassic (approximately 200 million to 237 million years ago) ammonite and other species were extinct on a large scale
  C: Elements such as iridium and platinum are peculiar to meteorites and usually only exist in trace amounts on the surface
  D: In ancient times, there have been many incidents of meteorite impacting the earth
## Assistant 2:
  Answer("C")

Explanation:
The fact that the clay layer contains high concentrations of elements such as iridium and platinum, which are peculiar to meteorites and only exist in trace amounts on the surface, supports the research finding that the meteorites found in the area are about 200 million years old and were probably traces of flying objects when a huge meteorite hit the present province of Quebec, Canada.

Therefore, option C is the best answer.

Option A is incorrect because the formation of the rock after the accumulation layer of the deep seabed in the ancient times exposed above the ground does not necessarily support the finding that the meteorites are 200 million years old and were formed as a result of a meteorite impact.

Option B is also incorrect because the extinction of ammonite and other species in the late Paleozoic Triassic period does not have a direct relationship with the age and origin of the meteorites found in the area.

Option D is incorrect because, while it is true that there have been many incidents of meteorite impacting the earth in ancient times, this information does not directly support the specific research findings about the meteorites found in the area.
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
