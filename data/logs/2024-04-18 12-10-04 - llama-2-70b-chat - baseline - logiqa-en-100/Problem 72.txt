Context: In the 110-meter hurdles competition at the Olympic Games, Liu Xiang won the championship and broke the Olympic record, tying the world record.He said to reporters? "Who said Asians can't be the sprint king ?! As long as I am there! You believe me!", "Black athletes have been monopolizing this project for many years.Yellow-skinned athletes cannot be old Behind black athletes, from me, a new chapter will be written! "
Question: The fact that Liu Xiang won the championship and his words do not constitute a rebuttal to which of the following assertions?
Choices:
  A: Only black athletes can become track and field champions.
  B: All sprint kings are not yellow-skinned players.
  C: Most track and field champions are black athletes.
  D: If who is the king of sprint, whoever has the African-black descent.
## Assistant 2:
  Answer: "B: All sprint kings are not yellow-skinned players."

Explanation:
Liu Xiang's victory and statement do not refute the claim that all sprint kings are not yellow-skinned players because Liu Xiang, a yellow-skinned athlete, has become a sprint king. His statement, "Yellow-skinned athletes cannot be old behind black athletes," implies that he believes yellow-skinned athletes can also excel in sprint events, but it does not directly address the assertion that all sprint kings are not yellow-skinned players. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.
## Result:
Agent Answer: None
