Context: There are five volcanic islands E, F, G, H, and I in the east coast of a country.They are arranged in a straight line from north to south, and they are found? (1) F is adjacent to H and is on the north side of H.(2) I and E are adjacent.(3) G is somewhere in the north of F.
Question: If it is found that G is the northernmost island, how many possible arrangements are there for this group of islands?
Choices:
  A: 2
  B: 3
  C: 4
  D: 5
## Assistant 2:
  Let's break this down step by step:
(1) F is adjacent to H and is on the north side of H.
This means that F and H must be arranged in a sequence, with F being the northernmost island.

(2) I and E are adjacent.
This means that I and E must be arranged in a sequence, with I being the southernmost island.

(3) G is somewhere in the north of F.
This means that G must be arranged between F and H.

Now, let's consider the possible arrangements:

1. F-G-H
2. F-H-G
3. G-F-H
4. G-H-F

There are four possible arrangements, so the answer is (C) 4.

Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
