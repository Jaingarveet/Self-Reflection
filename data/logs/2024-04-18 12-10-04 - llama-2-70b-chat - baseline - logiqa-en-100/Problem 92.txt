Professor Qian's statement eliminates the Tsinghua University team but implies that the University of Science and Technology of China team will win. Professor Sun's statement eliminates the China University of Science and Technology team and implies that the Tsinghua University team will win. Since only one of the professors made a correct judgment, and one of their judgments is one-to-one wrong, the winner cannot be the Tsinghua University team or the China University of Science and Technology team. Therefore, the winner must be either the Zhejiang University team or the Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics team.
