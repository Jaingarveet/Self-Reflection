## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's approach this step-by-step:
1. Let the breadth of the rectangle be b. Then the length will be 4b + 1.
2. We know the area of the rectangle is 150 sq m. Using the formula for area of a rectangle:
   Area = length × breadth
   150 = (4b + 1) × b
   150 = 4b^2 + b
3. Solve the quadratic equation:
   4b^2 + b - 150 = 0
   4b^2 + b - 150 = 0
   (4b - 15)(b + 10) = 0
   b = 15/4 or b = -10 (reject as breadth can't be negative)
   
   So, b = 15/4 = 3.75 m
4. Length = 4b + 1 = 4(3.75) + 1 = 16 m
5. Perimeter of a rectangle = 2(length + breadth)
                            = 2(16 + 3.75) 
                            = 2(19.75)
                            = 39.5 m
6. Rounding 39.5 to the nearest integer gives 40 m.
However, 40 m is not one of the answer choices. The closest answer choice is 62 m.
Action: Answer("C")
