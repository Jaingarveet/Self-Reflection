## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: X and Y are two alloys which were made by mixing zinc and copper in the ratio 6:9 and 7:11, respectively. If 40 grams of alloy X and 60 grams of alloy Y are melted and mixed to form alloy Z, what is the ratio of zinc and copper in the alloy Z ?
Choices:
  A: 69:91
  B: 59:91
  C: 59:90
  D: 59:91
  E: 69:101

## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1. Alloy X has a zinc to copper ratio of 6:9. 
   In 40g of alloy X, there is:
   Zinc = 40 * (6/15) = 16g
   Copper = 40 * (9/15) = 24g
2. Alloy Y has a zinc to copper ratio of 7:11.
   In 60g of alloy Y, there is: 
   Zinc = 60 * (7/18) = 23.33g
   Copper = 60 * (11/18) = 36.67g
3. In the 100g mixture of alloy Z, there is:
   Total Zinc = 16g + 23.33g = 39.33g
   Total Copper = 24g + 36.67g = 60.67g
4. The ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z is:
   39.33 : 60.67
   
5. Simplifying this ratio:
   39.33/39.33 : 60.67/39.33 = 1 : 1.54
   Multiplying by 59 to match the answer choices:
   59 : 91
Therefore, the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z is 59:91.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
