## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's approach this step-by-step:
1. Let's define the variables:
   - Let x be the number of matches played before the final.
   - Sachin's current batting average is 51.
   - In the final match, he scores 78 runs.
   - After the final, his batting average becomes 54.
2. We can set up an equation based on the definition of batting average:
   - Batting average = Total runs scored / Number of matches played
   - So, 51 = Total runs before final / x
   - And, 54 = (Total runs before final + 78) / (x + 1)
3. From the first equation, we can find the total runs before the final:
   - Total runs before final = 51 * x
4. Substituting this into the second equation:
   - 54 = (51x + 78) / (x + 1)
5. Solving for x:
   - 54(x + 1) = 51x + 78
   - 54x + 54 = 51x + 78
   - 3x = 24
   - x = 8
6. So, before the final, Sachin played 8 matches. Adding the final match makes it a total of 9 matches.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
