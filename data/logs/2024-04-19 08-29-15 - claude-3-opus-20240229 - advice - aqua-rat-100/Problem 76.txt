## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Advice:
 - Always simplify complex expressions as much as possible before substituting values.
 - Pay close attention to the bounds given for variables in the question.
 - Use a calculator for calculations involving roots or other irrational numbers.
 - Double-check your calculations, especially when dealing with approximations.
 - Carefully compare your calculated range to the given answer choices.
 - If your range doesn't match any of the choices exactly, consider which choice it fits into.
## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's approach this step-by-step:
1) First, let's simplify the expression for x:
x = (n^2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16) / (n + 4√n + 4)
  = (n^2 + 2n√n + 8√n + 16) / (n + 4√n + 4)
  = (n(n + 2√n + 8) + 16) / (n + 4√n + 4)
  = (n(n + 2√n) + 8n + 16) / (n + 4√n + 4)
  = (n^2 + 2n√n + 8n + 16) / (n + 4√n + 4)
  = n + 2√n + 8 + 16/(n + 4√n + 4)
2) Now, let's consider the bounds for n: 36 ≤ n ≤ 72
3) When n = 36:
x = 36 + 2√36 + 8 + 16/(36 + 4√36 + 4)
  ≈ 36 + 12 + 8 + 16/56
  ≈ 56.29
4) When n = 72:
x = 72 + 2√72 + 8 + 16/(72 + 4√72 + 4)
  ≈ 72 + 16.97 + 8 + 16/105
  ≈ 97.12
5) So, the range of x is approximately 56.29 < x < 97.12
6) Comparing this to the given choices, the only one that fits is:
   C: 25 < x < 64
Therefore, the correct answer is C.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
