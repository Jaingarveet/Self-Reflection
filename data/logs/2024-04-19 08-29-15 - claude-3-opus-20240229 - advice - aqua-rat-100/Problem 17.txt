## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's approach this step-by-step:
1. Understand the given information:
   * The company produces 420 components per month
   * The production cost per component is $110
   * The company wants a minimum yearly profit of $626,400
2. Calculate the yearly production:
   * Monthly production = 420 components
   * Yearly production = 420 × 12 = 5,040 components
3. Calculate the yearly production cost:
   * Production cost per component = $110
   * Yearly production cost = 5,040 × $110 = $554,400
4. Calculate the minimum yearly revenue needed to achieve the desired profit:
   * Minimum yearly profit = $626,400
   * Minimum yearly revenue = Yearly production cost + Minimum yearly profit
   * Minimum yearly revenue = $554,400 + $626,400 = $1,180,800
5. Calculate the minimum selling price per component:
   * Minimum yearly revenue = $1,180,800
   * Yearly production = 5,040 components
   * Minimum selling price per component = $1,180,800 ÷ 5,040 = $234.29
6. Compare the calculated minimum selling price to the given options:
   * The calculated price of $234.29 is not an exact match for any option
   * The nearest option that guarantees the desired yearly profit is $240
Therefore, the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee a yearly profit of at least $626,400 is $240.
Action: Answer("C")
