## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand exactly what it's asking for.
 - Don't add unnecessary constraints that are not mentioned in the question.
 - When dealing with consecutive numbers, it's often helpful to represent them using a variable and then manipulate the equation.
 - Keep in mind any constraints on the variable (like odd/even, positive/negative, etc.).
 - When you have multiple options, test each one to see which satisfies the conditions.
## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's approach this step-by-step:
1. Let's represent the smallest of the 5 consecutive odd numbers as 2n+1. Then the other 4 numbers will be 2n+3, 2n+5, 2n+7, and 2n+9.
2. The sum of these 5 numbers is:
   (2n+1) + (2n+3) + (2n+5) + (2n+7) + (2n+9) 
   = 10n + 25
3. The question states that this sum when divided by 10 is a perfect square. Let's call this perfect square m^2.
   So, (10n + 25)/10 = m^2
   Simplifying, n + 2.5 = m^2
4. Since n is an integer (as the numbers are odd), and 2.5 is not an integer, m^2 cannot be an integer. But a perfect square is always an integer. 
   This means there are no such 5 consecutive odd numbers that satisfy the given condition.
5. However, we are asked to choose one of the given options. So let's test each:
   A: 47 is an odd number, but it doesn't satisfy the condition.
   B: 91 is an odd number, but it doesn't satisfy the condition.
   C: 41 is an odd number, but it doesn't satisfy the condition.
   D: 67 is an odd number, but it doesn't satisfy the condition.
   E: 44 is an even number, so it can't be part of the set of odd numbers.
6. Among these, 44 is the only number that can't be part of the set of 5 consecutive odd numbers, regardless of whether they satisfy the sum condition or not.
Therefore, the answer is E: 44.
Action: Answer("E")

Agent Answer: E
Correct Answer: C
