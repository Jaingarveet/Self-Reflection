## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's approach this step-by-step:
1. The paper is a square with side length 20 cm. The area of the square is:
   Area of square = side^2 = 20^2 = 400 cm^2
2. Two semicircles are cut out from opposite sides of the square. The diameter of each semicircle is equal to the side of the square, which is 20 cm. So the radius of each semicircle is 10 cm.
3. The area of a semicircle is half the area of a full circle. The area of a circle is πr^2.
   Area of semicircle = (1/2) * πr^2 = (1/2) * π * 10^2 = 50π cm^2
4. Since there are two semicircles, the total area removed is:
   Area removed = 2 * 50π = 100π cm^2
5. The remaining area of the paper is the area of the square minus the area of the two semicircles:
   Remaining area = 400 - 100π ≈ 400 - 314.16 = 85.84 cm^2
6. Comparing this result to the answer choices, the closest value is 8.72 when rounded to two decimal places.
