Question: A car is being driven, in a straight line and at a uniform speed, towards the base of a vertical tower. The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower?
Choices:
  A: 5(√3 + 1)
  B: 6(√3 + √2)
  C: 7(√3 – 1)
  D: 8(√3 – 2)
  E: None of these

## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's approach this step-by-step:
1. Let the height of the tower be h and the distance of the car from the base of the tower at the first instance be x.
2. At 45° angle of elevation:
   tan(45°) = h/x
   1 = h/x
   x = h
3. After 10 minutes at 60° angle of elevation:
   tan(60°) = h/(x-d), where d is distance traveled in 10 min
   √3 = h/(x-d)
   √3(x-d) = h
   √3x - √3d = h
   
4. From (2), h = x
   Substituting in (3):
   √3x - √3d = x
   √3x - x = √3d
   x(√3 - 1) = √3d
   x = √3d/(√3 - 1)
5. Let the remaining time to reach the tower be t.
   Then, x = speed * t
        √3d/(√3 - 1) = d/10 * t
        10√3/(√3 - 1) = t
6. Simplify:
   10√3/(√3 - 1) * (√3 + 1)/(√3 + 1)
   = (10√3(√3 + 1))/((√3 - 1)(√3 + 1))
   = (10√3(√3 + 1))/(3 - 1)
   = (10√3(√3 + 1))/2
   = 5√3(√3 + 1)
   = 5(3 + √3)
   = 15 + 5√3
Therefore, the car will reach the base of the tower in 15 + 5√3 minutes more.
