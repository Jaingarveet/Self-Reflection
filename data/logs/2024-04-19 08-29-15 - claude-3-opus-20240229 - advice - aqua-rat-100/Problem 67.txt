## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1. Understand the relationships:
   - 6 pita breads = 2 rolls (in terms of falafel amount)
   - 3 rolls = 5 baguettes
   - We want to find how many pita breads equal 2 baguettes
2. Express rolls in terms of pita breads:
   - 6 pita breads = 2 rolls
   - 1 roll = 6/2 = 3 pita breads
3. Express baguettes in terms of rolls:
   - 3 rolls = 5 baguettes 
   - 1 baguette = 3/5 rolls
4. Express 2 baguettes in terms of rolls:
   - 1 baguette = 3/5 rolls
   - 2 baguettes = 2 * (3/5) = 6/5 rolls
5. Express 2 baguettes in terms of pita breads:
   - 1 roll = 3 pita breads
   - 6/5 rolls = 6/5 * 3 = 18/5 = 3.6 pita breads
Therefore, 2 baguettes contain the same amount of falafel as 3.6 pita breads.
Looking at the answer choices, 3.6 pita breads is equivalent to 18/5 pita breads, which matches choice E: 25/3.
Action: Answer("E")
