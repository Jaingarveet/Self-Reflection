## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1. The space shuttle travels 700m high in 40 seconds at maximum speed. 
2. It takes 5 seconds for the shuttle to pass a point at this speed.
3. We need to find the length of the shuttle. Let's call this length L.
To find the length, we can use the formula:
* Speed = Distance / Time
* Rearranging, Distance = Speed × Time
We know the time it takes the shuttle to pass a point is 5 seconds. 
To get the speed, we can use the information about the 700m height:
* Speed = 700m / 40s = 17.5 m/s
Now plugging into the distance formula:
* Distance = 17.5 m/s × 5s 
* Distance = 87.5 meters
The question asks for the length of the shuttle. This distance of 87.5m that we calculated represents the length of the shuttle.
Looking at the answer choices, 87.5m is closest to 75m.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
