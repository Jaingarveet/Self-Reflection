## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The man's speed in still water is 4 kmph. Let's call this his normal speed.
2. His speed against the current is 2 kmph. This means the current's speed is the difference between his normal speed and his speed against the current. 
   Current speed = Normal speed - Speed against current
                 = 4 kmph - 2 kmph 
                 = 2 kmph
3. When rowing along the current, the man's speed will be his normal speed plus the current's speed.
   Speed along current = Normal speed + Current speed
                       = 4 kmph + 2 kmph
                       = 6 kmph
4. Looking at the answer choices, both B and E match this speed of 6 kmph.
Therefore, the correct answers are B and E. The man's speed along the current is 6 kmph.
Action: Answer("B") and Answer("E")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: E
Score: 0
