Context: When a team travels to Tibet, in addition to Lhasa, there are 6 cities or scenic spots to choose from? City E, City F, Lake G, Mountain H, Mountain I, Lake J Taking into account factors such as time, funding, plateau environment, and physical condition of the personnel, (1) at least one of Lake G and Lake J should be visited.(2) If you don't go to E city or F city, you can't go to G lake.(3) If you don't go to E city, you can't go to H mountain.(4) Only when I cross the I peak can I reach Lake J.
Question: If this team does not go to I Peak due to climate reasons, which of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: The group went to E city and J lake
  B: The group went to city E instead of city F
  C: The group went to visit G Lake and H Mountain
  D: The group went to F city and G lake tour
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
*   Since the team cannot go to I Peak, they cannot reach Lake J (from condition 4).
*   Because they must visit either Lake G or Lake J (condition 1), and they cannot visit Lake J, they must visit Lake G.
*   To visit Lake G, they must visit either City E or City F (condition 2). 
*   The statement that must be true is that they visited Lake G. We don't know for sure about City E or City F, or Mountain H. 
Action: Answer("C")
