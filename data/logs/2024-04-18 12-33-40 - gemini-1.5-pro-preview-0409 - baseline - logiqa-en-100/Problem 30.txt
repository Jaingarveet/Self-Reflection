Context: A unit conducted the year-end assessment and after democratic voting, five people were identified as candidates for the first prize.In the selection of five in four, the following factors need to be considered? 1) At least one person of Bingding is selected.2) If E is selected, then A and B are also selected.3) A maximum of 2 people are selected.
Question: According to the above statement, it can be concluded that who is not in the fourth?
Choices:
  A: A.
  B: B.
  C: C.
  D: Ding.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
*  We need at least one person from Bingding, so options A and B are out. 
*  Option C doesn't provide enough information to determine if C is in the fourth or not.
*  If we don't select E, condition 2 becomes irrelevant, and we can still fulfill conditions 1 and 3 by selecting one person from Bingding and one person from the remaining candidates (C or D). 
Action: Answer("D") 
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
