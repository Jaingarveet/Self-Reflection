Topic: Logic
Context: A certain class intends to select two of three girls from Fang Rufen, Guo Yanran, He Zhilian, and three from five boys, including Peng Youwen, Qiu Zhijie, Ren Xiangyang, Song Wenkai, and Tang Xiaohua, to form a five-person support group for university students to volunteer teaching in the mountains.Requirements? (1) Guo Yanran and Tang Xiaohua are not selected at the same time; (2) Peng Youwen and Song Kaiwen are not selected at the same time; (3) Qiu Zhijie and Tang Xiaohua are not selected at the same time.
Question: If He Zhilian is not selected, which of the following is not selected?
Choices:
  A: Tang Xiaohua
  B: Peng Youwen
  C: Qiu Zhijie
  D: Song Wenkai
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
*   **Rule 1:** Guo Yanran and Tang Xiaohua cannot both be selected.
*   **Rule 2:** Peng Youwen and Song Wenkai cannot both be selected.
*   **Rule 3:** Qiu Zhijie and Tang Xiaohua cannot both be selected.
*   **Condition:** He Zhilian is not selected.
Since He Zhilian is not selected, we need to ensure we pick two other girls from the remaining options: Fang Rufen and Guo Yanran.
*   If we pick **Guo Yanran**, then due to Rule 1, **Tang Xiaohua cannot be selected**.
Therefore, if He Zhilian is not selected, Tang Xiaohua is also not selected. 
Action: Answer("A") 
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
