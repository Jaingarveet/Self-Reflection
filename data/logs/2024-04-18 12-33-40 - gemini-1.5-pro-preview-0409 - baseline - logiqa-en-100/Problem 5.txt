Topic: Logic
Context: The function of the government is to meet the real needs of the people.Unless the government knows what those needs are, the government cannot meet those needs.Freedom of expression can ensure that government officials hear such demand messages.Therefore, for a healthy country, free speech is essential.
Question: Which of the following, if true, cannot weaken the above argument?
Choices:
  A: In most cases, the people do not know what they really need.
  B: Free speech ultimately tends to disrupt social order, and good social order is a prerequisite for meeting the needs of the masses.
  C: The legitimate function of the government is not to satisfy the needs of the people, but to provide equal opportunities for the people.
  D: Freedom of expression is insufficient to satisfy the needs of the masses, and good social order is also essential.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
We need to find the option that DOES NOT weaken the argument. 
Option A weakens the argument by suggesting the people's needs might be unknown.
Option B weakens the argument by suggesting free speech disrupts order, hindering need fulfillment.
Option C weakens the argument by suggesting the government's role is not to meet needs but provide opportunities.
Option D, however, strengthens the argument by adding another requirement (order) for fulfilling needs, not weakening the need for free speech. 
Action: Answer("D") 
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
