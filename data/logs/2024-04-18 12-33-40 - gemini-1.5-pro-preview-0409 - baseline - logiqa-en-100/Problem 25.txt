Context: Prince Lima in Li Na's mind is tall, handsome and doctor.She knew four men, Wang Wei, Wu Gang, Li Qiang, and Liu Dawei, and one of them met all the conditions she required.(1) Among the 4 men, there are 3 tall men, 2 doctors, and 1 is handsome; (2) Wang Wei and Wu Gang are both doctors; (3) Liu Dawei and Li Qiang are the same height; (4) Li Qiang and Wang Wei Not all are tall.
Question: Who can meet all the requirements of Li Na?
Choices:
  A: Liu Dawei
  B: Li Qiang
  C: Wu Gang
  D: Wang Wei
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
* We know there are 3 tall men, 2 doctors, and 1 handsome man.
* Wang Wei and Wu Gang are both doctors, so one of them could be the handsome one.
* Liu Dawei and Li Qiang have the same height, and since Li Qiang and Wang Wei are not both tall, this implies neither Liu Dawei nor Li Qiang are tall (as there are 3 tall men and Wang Wei is one of them).
* Therefore, neither Liu Dawei nor Li Qiang can be Prince Lima as he is tall.
* Between Wang Wei and Wu Gang (both doctors), only one can be handsome. 
* We don't have enough information to definitively choose between them.
Action: Answer("C")
