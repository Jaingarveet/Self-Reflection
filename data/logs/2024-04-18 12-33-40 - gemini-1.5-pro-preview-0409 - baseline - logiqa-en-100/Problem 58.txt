Topic: Logic
Context: In recent years, China's housing prices have risen rapidly.In the fourth quarter of 2004, various government departments issued a number of measures to suppress the excessively rapid growth of housing prices, but national housing prices continued to rise in the first quarter of 2005.It was asserted that rising land prices are the chief culprit in soaring housing prices.
Question: Which of the following, if true, is the most doubtful of an assertion?
Choices:
  A: Shanghai's housing prices in the first quarter of 2005 increased by 19.1% over the same period last year, and land prices rose by 6.53%.
  B: Residential prices in Beijing increased by 7.2% in the first quarter of 2005 compared with the same period last year, and residential land prices rose by 0.37%.
  C: The chairman of Huayuan Real Estate believes that as land development costs increase, house prices will definitely increase.
  D: The chairman of Yongtai Development Company said? "The skyrocketing housing prices are because supply has not kept up with demand."
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
We need to find the option that casts the most doubt on the assertion that rising land prices are the main cause of soaring housing prices.
*   Option A shows a large increase in housing prices with a smaller increase in land prices, which weakens the assertion.
*   Option B shows a similar trend but even more pronounced, further weakening the assertion.
*   Option C supports the assertion, so it doesn't cast doubt.
*   Option D provides an alternative explanation for rising housing prices (supply and demand), thus casting doubt on the original assertion.
Comparing B and D, option B provides a more concrete example with specific numbers that directly contradict the claim about land prices being the main driver. 
Action: Answer("B") 
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
