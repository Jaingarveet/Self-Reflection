Topic: Logic
Context: Aluminum alloys have widely replaced steel in military equipment because they provide the same protection and are lighter in weight.But the manufacturing cost of an aluminum alloy armored vehicle is twice that of a newly armored vehicle.Therefore, from a financial point of view, it is not advisable to replace steel armored vehicles with aluminum alloy armored vehicles with the same protective properties.
Question: Which of the following is true can raise greater doubts about the above conclusion?
Choices:
  A: After the aluminum alloy armored vehicle is put into use, the running cost is one-third of the steel armored vehicle with the same performance.
  B: After the introduction of aluminum alloy armored vehicles, the army must retain maintenance personnel and purchase new tools and parts.
  C: The maintenance cost of steel armored vehicles is the lowest among all armored vehicles currently used by the military.
  D: It is expected that the price of aluminum alloy materials will remain stable, while the price of steel materials may decline.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
We need to find an option that weakens the argument against replacing steel with aluminum.
Option A directly counters the financial argument by stating aluminum's lower running cost. 
Options B, C, and D don't directly address the financial comparison between the two materials.
Action: Answer("A") 
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
