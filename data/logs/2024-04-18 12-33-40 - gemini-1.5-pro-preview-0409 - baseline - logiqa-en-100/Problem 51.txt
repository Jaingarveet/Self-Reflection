Context: There are 7 candidates hired by Haier? F, G, H, I, W, X and Y.One of them needs to be assigned to the public relations department, three to the production department, and three to the sales department.The personnel allocation of these 7 employees must meet the following conditions? (1) H and Y must be allocated in the same department.(2) F and G cannot be allocated in the same department (3) If X is allocated in the sales department, W is allocated in the production department.(4) F must be allocated in the production department.
Question: If X and F are assigned to the same department, which of the following statements cannot be true?
Choices:
  A: G is assigned to the sales department
  B: H is assigned to the production department.
  C: I was assigned to the sales department.
  D: W is assigned to the public relations department.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
*   From (4), F is in production.
*   If X and F are in the same department, then X is also in production (due to the previous point).
*   From (3), if X is in sales (which it isn't), then W is in production. However, since X is not in sales, this statement doesn't provide information about W's placement.
*   We know 3 people are in production: F, X, and one of H or Y (due to point 1).
*   G cannot be with F (point 2), so G is not in production.
*   This leaves the public relations department for W and the sales department for the remaining two of G, H, I, and Y.
Therefore, the statement that cannot be true is **H being assigned to the production department** because the three spots are already filled. 
Action: Answer("B")
