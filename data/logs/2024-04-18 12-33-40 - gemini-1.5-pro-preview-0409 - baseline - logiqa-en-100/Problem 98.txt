Topic: Logic
Context: Right and wrong and whether they violate the rules are two things.There may be regulations that prohibit things that are not wrong in themselves, such as laws in certain countries that prohibit criticism of the government; there may also be regulations that require things that are inherently wrong, such as laws that require apartheid in public places.And, like evaluating behavior, we can also evaluate some of the prescribed right and wrong.
Question: Which of the following does not weaken, but supports the argument in the question stem?
Choices:
  A: If we do not follow some pre-existing regulations or standards, how can we judge right and wrong?
  B: "People are doing, heaven is watching." Failure to act in accordance with ethical regulations will incur punishment from heaven.
  C: Behind the judgment of right and wrong, you can always find the rules or standards on which people judge.
  D: The basis for judgment of right and wrong lies in pushing oneself and one's moral conscience.It is common and universal; however, the moral regulations on how to act for people vary from person to person and from place to place.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
We need to find the option that supports the idea that rules and right/wrong can be separate.
Option A suggests we need rules to judge, which weakens the argument.
Option B introduces a different basis (heaven) for judgment, weakening the argument.
Option C implies right/wrong are always based on rules, weakening the argument.
Option D highlights the subjectivity of rules and the universality of conscience, supporting the argument. 
Action: Answer("D") 
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
