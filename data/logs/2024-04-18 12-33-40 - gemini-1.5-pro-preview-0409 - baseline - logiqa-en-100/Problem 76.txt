## User 2:
Topic: Logic
Context: Some Taiwan independence elements argue that all people under the jurisdiction of the People ’s Republic of China are Chinese, and Taiwanese are not under the jurisdiction of the People ’s Republic of China.Therefore, Taiwanese are not Chinese.
Question: Which of the following reasoning clearly shows that the above argument is not valid?
Choices:
  A: All successful people have to eat in clothes.I am not a successful person now, so I do n’t have to eat in clothes.
  B: Commodities have use value, and air certainly has use value, so air is of course a commodity.
  C: All technical backbones study hard.Xiao Zhang is a technical backbone.Therefore, Xiao Zhang is a hard-working person.
  D: Criminal behaviors are illegal behaviors, and violations should be condemned by the society, so all criminal behaviors should be condemned by the society.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
We need to find an option with a similar invalid reasoning structure as the given argument. 
The given argument uses a faulty logic of excluding a subset (Taiwanese) from a larger set (people under PRC jurisdiction) to conclude they don't belong to another set (Chinese).
Option A: This presents a different faulty logic - assuming not being part of a group (successful people) means not needing to follow their rules (eating in clothes). 
Option B: This is an example of affirming the consequent, a different logical fallacy.
Option C: This is a valid deduction - it follows that if all members of a group have a characteristic, then a member of that group also has that characteristic.
Option D: This is also a valid deduction - it concludes that a subset (criminal behaviors) of a larger set (illegal behaviors) shares the property of the larger set (should be condemned).
Action: Answer("A") 
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
