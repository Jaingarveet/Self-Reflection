Solution:
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
My previous attempt at this question was incorrect. 
I need to carefully consider the factors that can contribute to an unstable lie in a multigravida at 34 weeks with previous normal deliveries.
Reflection:
*   **Oligohydramnios (A):** This condition, characterized by low amniotic fluid levels, can restrict fetal movement and contribute to an unstable lie. 
*   **Placenta previa (B):** While placenta previa can cause complications, it is not directly associated with fetal lie.
*   **Pelvic tumor (C):** A pelvic tumor could potentially interfere with fetal positioning and lead to an unstable lie.
*   **Uterine anomalies (D):**  Uterine anomalies, such as a bicornuate uterus, can create an abnormal uterine cavity shape that may not allow the fetus to settle into a stable position.
Action: Answer("D") 
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
