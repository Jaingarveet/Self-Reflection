Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that the argument was based on the current commute times of Acme employees, when in fact it was based on their future commute times after the move.

Error Keywords:
 - Assumption error
 - Misinterpretation of argument
 - Focus on current situation instead of future situation

Solution:
The argument is based on the future commute times of Acme employees after the move to Ocean View.
The argument assumes that the move will result in most employees having a commute of more than 30 minutes.
The argument does not provide information about the current commute times of Acme employees.
The argument does not provide information about the financial reasons for the move or the opinions of Acme employees.
The argument assumes that the move will not be accompanied by a significant pay raise for Acme employees, as this would potentially allow them to afford housing within a 30-minute commute of Ocean View.

1. Identify the main point of the argument.
2. Determine what assumptions the argument is based on.
3. Consider the information provided in the argument and what it implies.
