Explanation:
I made an error in expanding the equation and solving for the variables.

Error Keywords:
 - Expansion error
 - Algebraic error
 - Variable substitution error

Solution:
To find the two possible values for $c$, we need to expand the equation $(a x+2)(b x+7)$ and compare it to $15 x^{2}+c x+14$.
Expanding the equation, we get $a b x^{2}+7 a x+2 b x+14$.
Since $a+b=8$, we can write $b=8-a$.
Substituting this into the expanded equation, we get $a(8-a) x^{2}+7 a x+2(8-a) x+14$.
Comparing this to $15 x^{2}+c x+14$, we can see that $a(8-a)=15$ and $7 a+16-2 a=c$.
Solving for $a$, we get $a=3$ or $a=5$.
Substituting these values into the equation for $c$, we get $c=31$ or $c=41$.

Instructions:
1. Expand the given equation.
2. Compare the expanded equation to the given equation.
3. Use the given information to substitute for one of the variables.
4. Solve for the remaining variable.
5. Substitute the values obtained for the variables into the equation for $c$.
6. Double-check your calculations and final answer.

Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember to carefully expand equations and substitute variables correctly.
 - Be careful with algebraic manipulations and solving for variables.

Expanding the given equation, we get $a b x^{2}+7 a x+2 b x+14$.
Comparing this to $15 x^{2}+c x+14$, we can see that $a b=15$ and $7 a+2 b=c$.
Since $a+b=8$, we can write $b=8-a$.
Substituting this into the equation for $a b$, we get $a(8-a)=15$.
Solving for $a$, we get $a=3$ or $a=5$.
Substituting these values into the equation for $c$, we get $c=31$ or $c=41$.
