Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I made a calculation error.

Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Arithmetic error
 - Division error

Solution:
The sales person gets a 10% commission on each sale.
The commission on each sale is 10% of $[REDACTED]0, which is $[REDACTED].
The sales person needs to make a salary of at least $1000.
To reach a salary of at least $1000, the sales person needs to make $1000/$[REDACTED] = [REDACTED] sales.

Instructions:
1. Identify the commission rate.

3. Identify the desired salary.
4. Divide the desired salary by the commission on each sale to find the number of sales needed.
5. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.
6. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
7. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.

Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that the number of sales needed is the result of dividing the desired salary by the commission on each sale, not multiplying them.
