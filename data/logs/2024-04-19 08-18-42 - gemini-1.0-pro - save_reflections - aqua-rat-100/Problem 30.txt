## Get Reflection:
## Explanation:
My initial thought process was correct in understanding the problem and the given information. However, I made a mistake in the final calculation. I multiplied the number of tablets by the time interval between each tablet, resulting in 75 minutes. However, the question asks for the total time it takes to consume all the tablets, not just the time between taking the first and last tablet.
## Error Keywords:
* Calculation error
* Misinterpretation of the question
* Incorrect application of multiplication
## Solution:
1. Identify the number of tablets Roy has: 5 tablets.
2. Identify the time interval between taking each tablet: 15 minutes.
3. Calculate the total time by multiplying the number of tablets by the time interval: 5 tablets * 15 minutes/tablet = 75 minutes.
4. However, we need to consider the time it takes to consume each tablet. Since each tablet takes some time to be consumed, we need to add the time it takes to consume each tablet to the total time calculated in step 3. 
5. Assuming it takes approximately 1 minute to consume each tablet, the total time will be 75 minutes + 5 minutes = 80 minutes.
## Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and understand what is being asked.
2. Identify the given information and the required information.
3. Break down the problem into smaller steps.
4. Perform calculations step-by-step, ensuring accuracy at each step.
