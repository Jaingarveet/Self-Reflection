## Get Reflection:
## Explanation:
My initial thought process was correct in calculating the area of the square paper and the two semi-circles. However, I made an error in subtracting the area of the semi-circles from the area of the square. I incorrectly rounded the area of the two semi-circles to 157.08 cm^2, which resulted in an inaccurate final answer.
## Error Keywords:
* Rounding error
* Subtraction error
* Calculation error
## Solution:
1. Calculate the area of the square paper: 20 cm * 20 cm = 400 cm^2.
2. Calculate the area of each semi-circle: (1/2) * pi * (20/2)^2 = 78.54 cm^2.
3. Calculate the total area of the two semi-circles: 78.54 cm^2 * 2 = 157.08 cm^2.
4. **Correctly subtract the area of the two semi-circles from the area of the square:** 400 cm^2 - 157.08 cm^2 = 242.92 cm^2.
5. Round the final answer to two decimal places: 242.92 cm^2 â‰ˆ 242.93 cm^2.
## Instructions:
1. Carefully read the problem and identify the key information.
2. Break down the problem into smaller, more manageable steps.
3. Perform each calculation accurately, using the correct formulas and units.
4. Double-check your calculations before rounding the final answer.
5. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
## General Advice:
* Pay close attention to rounding throughout the problem-solving process.
* Use a calculator to avoid manual calculation errors.
* Double-check your work before submitting your final answer.
* Consider alternative approaches to the problem if your initial method seems complex or prone to errors.
* Practice similar problems to improve your understanding and accuracy.
