## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I miscalculated the LCM of the rotation times for each ball. 
I correctly identified the rotation times for each ball but made a mistake when calculating the LCM.
Error Keywords:
 - LCM error
 - Calculation error
 - Time calculation error
Solution:
Ball A makes 1 full rotation in 26/2 = 13 minutes.
Ball B makes 1 full rotation in 35/5 = 7 minutes.
The LCM of 13 and 7 is 91.
Therefore, they will be at the same starting point again after 91 minutes.
Instructions:
1. Identify the rotation time for each ball.
2. Calculate the LCM of the rotation times for each ball.
3. Multiply the LCM by the number of full rotations for each ball.
4. Add the results from step 3 to get the total time for both balls to be at the same starting point again.
5. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
6. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that the LCM is the smallest number that is a multiple of two or more numbers.
