## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I incorrectly calculated the number of matches lost by the tennis team. 
I knew the correct number of matches won and the percentage of matches lost, but I made a calculation error.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Percentage error
 - Division error
Solution:
The team won 20 matches.
The team lost 30% of their matches.
Let X be the total number of matches played.
We know that 0.3X = 20 (matches lost = 30% of matches played = 20 matches won)
Dividing both sides by 0.3, we get X = 66.66 (total matches played)
Therefore, the team lost 66.66 - 20 = 46.66 matches.
Since we cannot have a fraction of a match, we round up to 47 matches lost.
