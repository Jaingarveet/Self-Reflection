## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:**
I incorrectly identified the length of the other side of the yard as 60 feet. My error stemmed from misinterpreting the relationship between the area and the side lengths of a rectangle. I focused solely on the total area (3,000 sq ft) and one side length (100 ft) without considering the formula for calculating the area of a rectangle (length x width = area).
**Error Keywords:**
* Misinterpretation
* Incomplete analysis
* Formula application error
## Solution
**Step-by-Step Solution:**
1. **Identify the formula:** Area of a rectangle = length x width
2. **Substitute known values:** 3,000 sq ft (area) and 100 ft (width)
3. **Solve for the unknown:** length = area / width = 3,000 sq ft / 100 ft = 30 ft
