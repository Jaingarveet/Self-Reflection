## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:**
My initial approach involved setting up an equation based on the given information and solving for the number of matches played. However, I made a mistake in interpreting the information about Sachin's batting average after the finals. I assumed that his average would increase to 54 after scoring 78 runs in the finals, which is incorrect. 
**Error Keywords:**
* Misinterpretation of information
* Incorrect assumption
* Logical error
## Solution
**Step 1:** Define variables.
* Let `x` be the total number of matches played by Sachin.
* Let `y` be the total number of runs scored by him before the finals.
**Step 2:** Set up equations based on the given information.
* Sachin's batting average before the finals: `y/x = 51`
* Sachin's batting average after the finals: `(y + 78)/(x + 1) = 54`
**Step 3:** Solve the system of equations.
We can solve for `y` in the first equation: `y = 51x`. Substituting this into the second equation, we get:
`(51x + 78)/(x + 1) = 54`
Simplifying and solving for `x`, we get:
`x = 9`
**Step 4:** Find the total number of runs scored.
`y = 51x = 51 * 9 = 459`
**Step 5:** Verify the answer.
After the finals, Sachin's total runs are `y + 78 = 459 + 78 = 537`. His batting average after the finals is `537/10 = 53.7`, which is close to 54, confirming the answer.
## Instructions for Future Problems
