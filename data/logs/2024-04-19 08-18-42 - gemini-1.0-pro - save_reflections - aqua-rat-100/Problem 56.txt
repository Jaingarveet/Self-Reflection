## Get Reflection:
## Explanation:
My initial answer was incorrect because I calculated the interest based on the monthly payment amount instead of the total amount borrowed. This led to an underestimation of the actual interest rate.
## Error Keywords:
* **Misinterpretation:** I misinterpreted the question and focused on the monthly payment instead of the total borrowed amount.
* **Incorrect calculation:** I used the wrong base for calculating the interest, leading to an inaccurate result.
* **Rounding error:** I might have rounded the interest rate prematurely, affecting the final answer.
## Solution:
1. **Calculate the total amount repaid:** 12 months * Rs.31.50/month = Rs.378
2. **Calculate the total interest paid:** Rs.378 - Rs.360 = Rs.18
3. **Calculate the interest rate:** (Rs.18 / Rs.360) * 100% = 5%
