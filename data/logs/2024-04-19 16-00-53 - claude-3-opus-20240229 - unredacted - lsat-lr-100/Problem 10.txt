## System:
You are an expert in Law.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

## User 2:
Topic: Law
Context: Mike: Tom did not tell me that I could use his computer, but it would not be wrong for me to use it anyway. Last week Tom used Mary's bicycle even though she had not told him he could use it.
Question: Which one of the following principles, if valid, would most help to justif Y Mike's reasoning?
Choices:
  A: Using the possessions of others without their permission is not always theft.
  B: Generally one should tell the truth, but there are cases in which it is permissible not to.
  C: If people have used your property without your permission, it is not wrong for you to use their property without their permission.
  D: It is permissible to treat people in a way that is siruilar to the way in which they have treated others.
  E: Using another person's property is wrong if the person is harmed by that use.
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I focused too narrowly on the specific example of using others' property without permission. While Mike's reasoning was about property use, the underlying principle he was applying was more general - that it's okay to treat people the same way they have treated others. My error was in not recognizing this broader principle and instead fixating on the specific property example.
Error Keywords:
 - Overly specific reasoning
 - Failure to identify broader principle
 - Fixating on specific example
Solution:
1. Mike is justifying using Tom's computer without permission by pointing out that Tom used Mary's bicycle without her permission.
2. The key principle Mike is applying is that it's permissible to treat people the same way they have treated others. 
3. This is a general principle that extends beyond just cases of using others' property.
4. Choice (D) directly captures this general principle - it is permissible to treat people in a way that is similar to the way in which they have treated others.
5. While choice (C) fits the specific property example, it is too narrow. Mike's reasoning relies on a broader principle of reciprocity.
6. Choices (A), (B), and (E) are not relevant to the key principle Mike is using to justify his actions.
Therefore, the principle that would most justify Mike's reasoning is (D) - it is permissible to treat people in a way that is similar to the way in which they have treated others.
Instructions:
1. Identify the key action or decision being made.
2. Identify the reasoning or justification given for that action/decision. 
3. Determine if the reasoning relies on a specific example or a general principle.
4. If the reasoning uses a specific example, ask if there is a broader principle that could justify it.
5. Look for an answer choice that matches the general principle, not just the specific example.
6. Eliminate answer choices that are irrelevant to the key principle being applied.
7. Select the answer that best captures the broadest relevant principle justifying the reasoning.
Advice:
 - Don't get too fixated on the specific examples given in the question stem. Look for the broader principles.
 - The correct answer often expresses a general principle rather than just restating details from the question.
 - Eliminate answer choices that are too specific or that focus on tangential issues.
 - The correct answer should justify the reasoning, not just be consistent with the final decision.
 - If two answers seem to fit, choose the one that expresses the broadest relevant principle.
