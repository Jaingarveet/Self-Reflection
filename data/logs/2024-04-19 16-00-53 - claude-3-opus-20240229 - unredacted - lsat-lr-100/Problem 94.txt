# Model: claude-3-opus-20240229 | Agent: unredacted | Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Problem 94 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Law.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Topic: Geography
Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Law
Context: Most auto mechanics have extensive experience. Furthermore, most mechanics with extensive experience understand electronic circuits. Thus, most auto mechanics understand electronic circuits.
Question: The pattern of flawed reasoning in which one of the following arguments is most similar to that in the argument above?
Choices:
  A: During times of the year when automobile traffic increases, gas prices also increase. Increases in gas prices lead to increases in consumer complaints. Thus, increased automobile traffic causes increased consumer complaints.
  B: The most common species of birds in this region are migratory. Moreover, most migratory birds have left this region by the end of November. Hence, few birds remain in this region during the winter.
  C: It is not surprising that most speeding tickets in this region are issued to drivers of sports cars. After all, most drivers who are not interested in driving fast do not buy sports cars.
  D: Most nature photographers find portrait photography boring. Moreover, most portrait photographers especially enjoy photographing dignitaries. Thus, most nature photographers find photographing dignitaries especially boring.
  E: Most snow-removal companies run lawn-care services during the summer. Also, most companies that run lawn-care services during the summer hire additional workers in the summer. Thus, most snow-removal companies hire additional workers in the summer.
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I incorrectly identified argument D as having the same flaw as the original argument. While D does have flawed reasoning, it is not the same flaw as the original. I failed to recognize that argument E actually contains the same logical flaw as the original argument.
Error Keywords:
 - Logical reasoning error
 - Misidentifying analogous reasoning flaw
 - Mistaking different reasoning errors as the same
 - Overlooking correct analogous reasoning error
Solution:
The original argument concludes that most auto mechanics understand electronic circuits because:
1) Most auto mechanics have extensive experience. 
2) Most mechanics with extensive experience understand electronic circuits.
The flaw is assuming the majority of the larger group (auto mechanics) must have the trait held by the majority of a subset group (mechanics with extensive experience).
Looking at argument E:
1) Most snow-removal companies run lawn-care services in summer.
2) Most lawn-care service companies hire additional workers in summer. 
3) The flawed conclusion is that most snow-removal companies hire additional workers in summer.
This makes the same error of assuming the majority of the larger group (snow-removal companies) must have the trait held by the majority of a subset group (lawn-care service companies).
Instructions:
1. Identify the logical structure and flaw in the original argument.
2. For each answer choice, map out the logical structure of the argument.
3. Compare the reasoning in each choice to the original argument.
4. Eliminate choices that have different reasoning errors or are not flawed.
5. Select the choice with the same flawed reasoning pattern as the original.
Advice:
 - Always break arguments down into their component logical steps.
 - Identify the specific nature of flawed reasoning, don't just note that it's flawed.
 - When comparing reasoning, focus on the logical structure, not just surface similarities.
 - Map out the logic of each argument fully before judging similarities.
 - Don't be distracted by arguments that are flawed in different ways than the original.
