Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Law
Context: Ethicist: Marital vows often contain the promise to love "until death do us part." If "love" here refers to a feeling, then this promise makes no sense, for feelings are not within one's control, and a promise to do something not within one's control makes no sense. Thus, no one—including those making marital vows—should take "love" in this context to be referring to feelings.
Question: The ethicist's conclusion follows logically if which one of the following is assumed?
Choices:
  A: None of our feelings are within our control.
  B: People should not make promises to do something that is not within their control.
  C: "Love" can legitimately be taken to refer to something other than feelings.
  D: Promises should not be interpreted in such a way that they make no sense.
  E: Promises that cannot be kept do not make any sense.
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I incorrectly identified the assumption as being that people should not make promises to do something outside their control. While this is stated in the argument, it is not the key assumption needed for the conclusion to follow. The conclusion that "love" should not be taken to refer to feelings relies on the unstated assumption that promises should not be interpreted in a way that makes them nonsensical. I failed to recognize this implicit premise in the argument.
Error Keywords:
 - Incorrect identification of key assumption
 - Failure to recognize implicit premise
 - Misinterpretation of argument structure
 - Logical reasoning error
Solution:
1. The argument states that if "love" in wedding vows refers to a feeling, the promise makes no sense.
2. This is because feelings are outside one's control, and promising something outside one's control is nonsensical.
3. The conclusion is that "love" in this context should not be taken to refer to feelings.
4. For this conclusion to follow, we must assume that promises should not be interpreted in a way that makes them nonsensical.
5. Therefore, the correct answer is D: Promises should not be interpreted in such a way that they make no sense.
Instructions:
1. Read the argument carefully and identify the conclusion.
2. Identify the explicit premises stated in the argument.
3. Look for the gap between the stated premises and the conclusion.
4. Determine what unstated premise is required to bridge this gap and make the conclusion follow logically.
5. Select the answer choice that best captures this necessary assumption.
Advice:
 - Always read arguments carefully and break them down into their component parts.
 - Identify both the explicit premises and the conclusion of the argument.
 - Look for unstated assumptions that are necessary for the conclusion to follow from the premises.
 - Be careful not to select an answer just because it is stated in the argument; it must be the key assumption.
 - Eliminate answer choices that are irrelevant or insufficient to make the conclusion follow logically.
