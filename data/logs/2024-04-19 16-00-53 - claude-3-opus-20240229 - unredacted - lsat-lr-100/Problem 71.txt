Topic: Law
Context: Curator: Our museum displays only twentieth-century works, which are either on loan from private collectors or in the museum's permanent collection. Prints of all of the latter works are available in the museum store. The museum store also sells prints of some works that are not part of the museum's permanent collection, such as Hopper's Nighthawks.
Question: If the curator's statements are true, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Every print in the museum store is of a work that is either on loan to the museum from a private collector or part of the museum's permanent collection.
  B: Every print that is sold in the museum store is a copy of a twentieth-century work.
  C: There are prints in the museum store of every work that is displayed in the museum and not on loan from a private collector.
  D: Hopper's Nighthawks is both a twentieth-century work and a work on loan to the museum from a private collector.
  E: Hopper's Nighthawks is not displayed in the museum.
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that choice B must be true because the museum only displays twentieth-century works and the store sells prints of works from the museum's collection and some that aren't. However, I failed to consider that the store could sell prints of twentieth-century works that are neither on loan to the museum nor part of its permanent collection.
Error Keywords:
- Incorrect assumption
- Incomplete information
- Faulty logic
- Overlooked key details
- Jumped to conclusions
Solution:
Let's re-examine the curator's statements and break them down:
1. The museum displays only twentieth-century works.
2. The displayed works are either on loan from private collectors or in the museum's permanent collection.
3. Prints of all works in the museum's permanent collection are available in the museum store.
4. The museum store also sells prints of some works that are not part of the museum's permanent collection, such as Hopper's Nighthawks.
Now, let's reconsider each choice:
A: False. The store sells prints of some works not in the museum's collection, like Nighthawks.
B: False. The store could sell prints of twentieth-century works that are neither on loan to the museum nor part of its permanent collection.
C: True. All works displayed in the museum that are not on loan from private collectors must be part of the museum's permanent collection. The store sells prints of all works in the permanent collection.
D: Insufficient information. We don't know if Nighthawks is on loan to the museum or from which century it is.
E: Insufficient information. We don't know if Nighthawks is displayed in the museum or not.
Therefore, the only statement that must be true based on the given information is C.
Instructions:
1. Read the question and information provided carefully.
2. Break down the given information into clear, separate facts.
3. Consider each answer choice individually.
4. Evaluate each choice against the given facts.
5. Eliminate choices that are false, insufficient, or unsupported by the facts.
6. Identify the choice that must be true based on the given information alone.
7. Double-check your reasoning and ensure your answer is logically sound.
Advice:
- Always read the question and provided information thoroughly.
- Break down complex information into clear, manageable facts.
- Consider all answer choices carefully and individually.
- Base your reasoning solely on the given facts, not assumptions.
