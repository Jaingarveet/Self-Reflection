Topic: Law
Context: Teacher: Participating in organized competitive athletics may increase a child's strength and coordination. As critics point out, however, it also instills in those children who are not already well developed in these respects a feeling of inferiority that never really disappears. Yet, since research has shown that adults with feelings of inferiority become more successful than those free of such anxieties, funding for children's athletic programs should not be eliminated.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes the role played in the teacher's argument by the assertion that participating in organized competitive athletics may increase a child's strength and coordination?
Choices:
  A: It is mentioned as one possible reason for adopting a policy for which the teacher suggests an additional reason.
  B: It is a claim that the teacher attempts to refute with counterarguments.
  C: It is a hypothesis for which the teacher offers additional evidence.
  D: It is cited as an insufficient reason for eliminating funding for children's athletic programs.
  E: It is cited as an objection that has been raised to the position that the teacher is supporting.

Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I misinterpreted the role that the assertion about increasing strength and coordination played in the overall argument. I focused too much on the teacher's counterargument about feelings of inferiority leading to success later in life. However, the question was specifically asking about the role of the assertion that athletics may increase strength and coordination.
Looking back, this assertion is actually mentioned as a possible reason to support children's athletic programs, before the teacher goes on to provide an additional reason to maintain funding in spite of the critics' objections. The teacher is not attempting to refute this claim, provide further evidence for it, cite it as an insufficient reason, or mention it as an objection to their own position.
Error Keywords:
 - Misinterpreting the question
 - Misidentifying the role of a statement in an argument
 - Focusing on the wrong part of the argument
 - Logical reasoning error
Solution:
The teacher's argument can be broken down as follows:
1. Participating in competitive athletics may increase a child's strength and coordination. 
2. Critics argue that athletics can also make less developed children feel inferior, a feeling that persists.
3. However, research shows that adults with feelings of inferiority become more successful.
4. Therefore, funding for children's athletic programs should not be eliminated.
The assertion that participating in athletics may increase strength and coordination is mentioned as one possible reason to support athletic programs. The teacher then suggests an additional reason to maintain funding (that feelings of inferiority can lead to later success), in order to counter the critics' argument. Therefore, choice A most accurately describes the role of the assertion in question.
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and identify the specific assertion or statement it is asking about.
2. Break down the argument into its main points and the roles that each statement plays.
3. Identify how the assertion in question relates to the overall argument - is it a main claim, a supporting reason, a counterargument, an objection, or something else?
4. Eliminate answer choices that do not accurately describe the role of the assertion.
5. Select the answer choice that most precisely captures how the assertion functions in the context of the larger argument.
Advice:
 - Always read questions carefully and make sure you are addressing exactly what is being asked.
 - Break down arguments into their component parts and the logical relationships between those parts.
 - Map out the structure of an argument before attempting to identify the role of any one statement.
 - Be precise in your analysis - look for the answer choice that most fully and accurately captures the logical role of the statement in question.
 - Don't be distracted by other aspects of the argument that are not directly relevant to answering the question at hand.
