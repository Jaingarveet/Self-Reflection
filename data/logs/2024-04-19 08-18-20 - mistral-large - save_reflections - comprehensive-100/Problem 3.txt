Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I made a calculation error.

Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error

Solution:
The sales person gets a 10% commission on each sale.
The commission on each sale is 10% of $250, which is $25.
The sales person needs to make a salary of at least $1000.
To reach a salary of at least $1000, the sales person needs to make $1000/$25 = 40 sales.

Instructions:

3. Identify the desired salary.
4. Divide the desired salary by the commission on each sale to find the number of sales needed.

 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
