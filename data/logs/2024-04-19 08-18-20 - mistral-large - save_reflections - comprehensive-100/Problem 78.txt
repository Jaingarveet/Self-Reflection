## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I misunderstood the definition of a physical change. I thought that any change that involved the addition of a substance, such as acids, would be a chemical change. However, the addition of acids to create a ball of food (choice A) is actually a physical change because it does not change the chemical composition of the food.

Error Keywords:
 - Misunderstanding of physical change definition
 - Confusion between physical and chemical changes
 - Incorrect interpretation of the question

Solution:
The process of digestion involves both physical and chemical changes. Physical changes involve a change in physical properties, such as shape, size, or state of matter, without changing the chemical composition of the substance. Chemical changes involve a change in chemical composition, resulting in the formation of new substances.

The addition of acids to create a ball of food (choice A) is a physical change because it does not change the chemical composition of the food. The secretion of pepsin to change proteins to peptides (choice B) is a chemical change because it involves breaking down proteins into smaller peptides, resulting in a change in chemical composition. The breakdown of food substances by digestive juices (choice C) is a chemical change because it involves breaking down complex molecules into simpler ones, resulting in a change in chemical composition. The squeezing of food through the intestines (choice D) is a physical change because it involves changing the shape and position of the food without changing its chemical composition.

Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and understand what it is asking.
2. Identify the physical and chemical changes that occur during the process of digestion.
3. Determine which of the choices represents a physical change.
4. Eliminate the choices that represent chemical changes.
5. Choose the answer that represents a physical change.

Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand what it is asking.
 - Be familiar with the definitions of physical and chemical changes.
 - Identify the physical and chemical changes that occur during the process of digestion.
 - Eliminate the choices that represent chemical changes.
 - Choose the answer that represents a physical change.
 - Double-check your answer to ensure accuracy.
