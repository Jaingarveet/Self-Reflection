1. Incorrect answer explanation:
I made a calculation error when determining the amount of zinc in alloy Y. I calculated (7/18) \* 60 = 23.33 grams, but the correct calculation should be (7/18) \* 60 = 23.56 grams (rounded to two decimal places). This led to an incorrect ratio of zinc and copper in alloy Z.

2. Error keywords:
   - Calculation error
   - Arithmetic error
   - Ratio calculation error

3. Correct solution:
Alloy X has zinc and copper in the ratio 6:9, so in 40 grams of alloy X, there are (6/15) \* 40 = 16 grams of zinc and (9/15) \* 40 = 24 grams of copper.
Alloy Y has zinc and copper in the ratio 7:11, so in 60 grams of alloy Y, there are (7/18) \* 60 = 23.56 grams of zinc and (11/18) \* 60 = 36.44 grams of copper.
Alloy Z has 16 + 23.56 = 39.56 grams of zinc and 24 + 36.44 = 60.44 grams of copper.
The ratio of zinc and copper in alloy Z is 39.56 : 60.44, which simplifies to 59 : 91 (approximately). However, since the question asks for the exact ratio, we should not simplify and instead use 39.56 : 60.44.

4. Instructions for future problem-solving:
   a. Carefully read the question and understand the given ratios.
   b. Calculate the amount of each element in alloy X and alloy Y separately.
   c. Add the amounts of each element to find the composition of alloy Z.
   d. Determine the ratio of the elements in alloy Z without simplifying.
   e. Double-check calculations to ensure accuracy.

5. General advice for similar problems:
   a. Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
   b. Be precise with calculations and avoid rounding errors.
   c. Show your work and be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
   d. Double-check your calculations and final answer.
   e. Be cautious when simplifying ratios, as the question may ask for the exact ratio.
