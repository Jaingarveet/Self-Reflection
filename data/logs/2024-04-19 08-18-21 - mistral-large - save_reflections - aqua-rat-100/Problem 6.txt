1. Incorrect answer explanation:
I made an error in calculating the remaining work for Mr. Blue. I multiplied the remaining portion of the house (0.92) by the number of days it takes Mr. Blue to paint a whole house (12 days). This is incorrect because Mr. Blue only needs to paint the remaining portion, not a whole house.

2. Error keywords:
   - Calculation error
   - Proportion error
   - Work rate problem error

3. Correct solution:
   - Mr. Brown paints 1.33 houses in 8 days.
   - Mr. Black paints 0.75 houses in 6 days.
   - Together, they have painted 2.08 houses.
   - The remaining work is 3 - 2.08 = 0.92 of a house.
   - Since Mr. Blue can paint a house in 12 days, he can paint 1/12 of a house in 1 day.
   - Therefore, it will take Mr. Blue 0.92 \* 12 = 11.04 days to paint the remaining portion.
   - However, since Mr. Blue cannot work for a fraction of a day, he will need to work for a full 11 days to complete the remaining portion of the house.

4. Instructions for future reference:
   - Calculate the work done by each worker before the third worker starts.
   - Calculate the remaining work.
   - Calculate the time it takes the third worker to complete the remaining work, considering that they cannot work for a fraction of a day.

5. General advice:
   - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
   - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
   - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
   - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
   - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
   - Remember to consider the constraints of the problem, such as not being able to work for a fraction of a day.
