## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I made an incorrect assumption about the cost of the brown sharpeners.
The gap in my knowledge was in understanding the problem statement.
I assumed that the cost of brown sharpeners was 1 rupee, but the problem states that Jack pays 1 rupee more for each white than brown sharpeners.

Error Keywords:
 - Incorrect assumption
 - Misunderstanding of problem statement
 - Misinterpretation of cost difference

Solution:
Let's assume the number of white sharpeners is x and the number of brown sharpeners is y.
We know that x + y = 18 (total number of sharpeners) and x + (x - y) = 100 (total cost of sharpeners).
Solving these equations simultaneously, we get x = 10 and y = 8.

Instructions:
1. Read the problem statement carefully.
2. Identify the variables and their relationships.
3. Set up equations based on the given information.
4. Solve the equations simultaneously.
5. Double-check your calculations and final answer.

Advice:
 - Always read the problem statement carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always identify the variables and their relationships.
 - Always set up equations based on the given information.
 - Always solve the equations simultaneously.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Never make assumptions about the problem statement.
 - Always interpret the problem statement correctly.
 - Always understand the cost difference between two items.
