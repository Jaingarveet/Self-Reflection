## Self-Reflection
**Error:** I previously selected answer A as the correct answer, which was incorrect.
**Reasoning:** My initial reasoning was flawed because I did not consider condition (4) thoroughly. While I correctly identified that F and G cannot be in the same department and that H and Y must be together, I overlooked the requirement for F to be in the production department. This led me to choose an answer where F was not in production.
**Solution:** To arrive at the correct answer, I need to ensure that all conditions are met, including the placement of F in the production department. 
**Instructions:** 
1. Start by placing F in the production department as per condition (4).
2. Next, consider condition (2) and ensure that G is not in the production department. This leaves the sales and public relations departments as options for G.
3. Now, analyze condition (1) which requires H and Y to be in the same department. Since F is already in production, we can place H and Y in either sales or public relations.
4. Finally, consider condition (3) which states that if X is in sales, then W must be in production. Since we have the freedom to choose between sales and public relations for H and Y, we can place X in sales and W in production to satisfy this condition.
**Revised Answer:**
Based on the revised reasoning, the correct answer is:
**Action: Answer("B")** 
This answer satisfies all the given conditions:
* F is in the production department.
* G is not in the same department as F.
* H and Y are in the same department (sales).
* X is in sales, and W is in production.
