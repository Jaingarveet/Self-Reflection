## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The argument assumes that the proportion of cars with airbags in accidents is the same as the proportion of cars with airbags on the road. This is not necessarily true. It is possible that cars with airbags are more likely to be involved in accidents, but that the airbags are also more likely to save the lives of the occupants.
