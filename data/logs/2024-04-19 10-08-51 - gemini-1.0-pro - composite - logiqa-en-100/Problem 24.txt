Context: From the end of the 1980s to the beginning of the 1990s, a total of 134 in-service staff died in 7 research institutes of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Peking University in a five-year period.Some people collected this data and concluded that the average age of death of intellectuals in Zhongguancun is 53.34 years, which is lower than Beijing â€™s average life expectancy of 73 years in 1990 and 5.18 years lower than the 58.52 years surveyed 10 years ago.
Question: Which of the following most accurately points out the fallacy of this statistical reasoning?
Choices:
  A: The actual situation is that 143 in-service personnel died, and the sample data is unreliable.
  B: If the sample size is too small, data on the deaths of in-service personnel from other research institutions and universities in Zhongguancun should be added.
  C: This is equivalent to the surprising conclusion after surveying the average age of death of college students is 22 years? people with college education have an average life expectancy of more than 50 years less than others.
  D: This statistical reasoning does not distinguish between types of intellectuals in Zhongguancun.

## Analyzing the Fallacy
The conclusion that intellectuals in Zhongguancun have a lower life expectancy than the average Beijing resident is based on flawed reasoning. Here's why:
**1. Biased Sample:** The study only considers deaths of in-service staff from 7 research institutes, which is a very specific and limited sample. This doesn't represent the entire population of intellectuals in Zhongguancun, which includes people from various professions, ages, and health conditions.
**2. Ignoring Age Distribution:** The average age of death (53.34 years) is calculated based on the deaths of in-service staff, who are likely to be older than the general population. This skews the average downwards and doesn't reflect the life expectancy of all intellectuals in Zhongguancun.
**3. Ignoring Cause of Death:** The study doesn't consider the causes of death, which could be related to specific occupational hazards or health issues within the research institutes. This makes it impossible to generalize the findings to the entire intellectual population.
**4. False Analogy:** The comparison with the average age of death of college students is misleading. College students are a young and healthy population, while the in-service staff sample includes older individuals with potentially higher health risks.
**5. Lack of Control Group:** The study doesn't compare the life expectancy of intellectuals in Zhongguancun with a control group of intellectuals from other areas. This makes it impossible to determine if the observed difference is truly due to location or other factors.
## Correct Answer
Based on the analysis above, the most accurate statement pointing out the fallacy is:
**C: This is equivalent to the surprising conclusion after surveying the average age of death of college students is 22 years? people with college education have an average life expectancy of more than 50 years less than others.**
This statement highlights the flawed logic of comparing the average age of death of a specific, non-representative sample with the general population's life expectancy. It emphasizes the importance of considering the context and limitations of the data before drawing conclusions.
## Reflection
In the previous attempt, the incorrect answer was chosen due to focusing solely on the numerical comparison of average ages without considering the underlying issues with the sample and methodology. This highlights the importance of critical thinking and understanding the limitations of statistical data before drawing conclusions.
## Result:
Agent Answer: None
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
