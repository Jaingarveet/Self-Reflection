## System:
You are an expert in Logic.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Topic: Geography
Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Logic
Context: A provincial Go team coach selects 4 of the 7 players from E, F, G, H, J, K and M to participate in the professional league.The selection must meet the following conditions? E or F has one person to participate, but not both .One of J or K will participate, but not both.If J participates, then G participates.Unless F participates, M does not participate.
Question: Which two of the following players will be selected by the coach to make the four-person team the only choice?
Choices:
  A: F and H
  C: G and M
  B: G and J
  D: H and M
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I misinterpreted the condition "Unless F, then not M" as "If F, then M". This led me to incorrectly eliminate option [REDACTED], which satisfies all other conditions.
Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation
- Conditional logic error
- Negation error
Solution:
1. E or F, but not both: This means either E or F will be selected, but not both.
2. J or K, but not both: This means either J or K will be selected, but not both.
3. If J, then G: This means if J is selected, then G must also be selected.
4. Unless F, then not M: This means if F is not selected, then M cannot be selected. This is equivalent to "If F, then M".
5. Analyze the choices based on the corrected conditions.
[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]: This violates condition 1, as both F and E are selected.
[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]: This satisfies all conditions. If J is selected, then G is also selected (condition 3). If F is not selected (condition 4), then M cannot be selected.
[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]: This violates condition 4, as F is not selected and M is selected.
[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]: This satisfies all conditions. If F is selected (condition 4), then M can be selected.
Instructions:
1. Carefully read and understand all conditions, including any negations or implications.
2. Break down complex conditions into simpler components.
3. Analyze each choice systematically against all conditions.
4. Double-check your reasoning and interpretation of the conditions.
5. Choose the answer that satisfies all conditions without violating any.
Advice:
- Pay close attention to the wording of conditions, especially negations and implications.
- Visualize the conditions using diagrams or tables if helpful.
- Test each choice systematically against all conditions to avoid overlooking any violations.
- Be mindful of common logical fallacies and biases.
- Practice similar problems to improve your logical reasoning skills.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Let's analyze each choice based on the corrected conditions:
* **A: F and H**: This violates condition 1, as both F and E are selected.
* **B: G and J**: This satisfies all conditions. If J is selected, then G is also selected (condition 3). If F is not selected (condition 4), then M cannot be selected.
* **C: G and M**: This violates condition 4, as F is not selected and M is selected.
* **D: H and M**: This satisfies all conditions. If F is selected (condition 4), then M can be selected.
Therefore, the only choice that satisfies all conditions is **B: G and J**.
Action: Answer("B")
