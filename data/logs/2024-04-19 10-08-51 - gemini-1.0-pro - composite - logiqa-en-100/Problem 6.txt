Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Context: When a team travels to Tibet, in addition to Lhasa, there are 6 cities or scenic spots to choose from? City E, City F, Lake G, Mountain H, Mountain I, Lake J Taking into account factors such as time, funding, plateau environment, and physical condition of the personnel, (1) at least one of Lake G and Lake J should be visited.(2) If you don't go to E city or F city, you can't go to G lake.(3) If you don't go to E city, you can't go to H mountain.(4) Only when I cross the I peak can I reach Lake J.
Question: If this team does not go to I Peak due to climate reasons, which of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: The group went to E city and J lake
  B: The group went to city E instead of city F
  C: The group went to visit G Lake and H Mountain
  D: The group went to F city and G lake tour
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
My initial analysis was correct in identifying the relevant rules and their implications. However, I failed to consider all possible scenarios that satisfy the given conditions. 
Specifically, I overlooked the possibility that the team could have visited both E city and F city, which would allow them to visit G lake without violating rule (2).
Error Keywords:
 - Incomplete analysis
 - Overlooking possibilities
 - Scenario omission
Solution:
1. The team did not go to I Peak.
2. According to rule (4), if the team did not go to I Peak, they could not go to Lake J.
3. According to rule (1), the team must visit at least one of Lake G and Lake J. Since they cannot visit Lake J, they must visit Lake G.
4. According to rule (2), if the team did not go to E city or F city, they could not go to G lake. Since they visited G lake, they must have gone to either E city or F city.
5. The team could have visited both E city and F city, satisfying rule (2) and allowing them to visit G lake.
6. Therefore, the only statement that must be true is that the team went to F city and G lake.
Instructions:
1. Carefully read and understand all given rules and conditions.
2. Identify all possible scenarios that satisfy the given conditions.
3. Analyze each scenario systematically to determine if it violates any rules.
4. Eliminate scenarios that violate any rules.
5. Identify the statements that are true for all remaining scenarios.
6. Choose the answer that reflects the statements that are true for all remaining scenarios.
Advice:
 - Consider all possible scenarios that satisfy the given conditions, even if they seem unlikely.
 - Be systematic in your analysis and do not jump to conclusions.
 - Double-check your reasoning and ensure that it is consistent with all given rules and conditions.
 - Remember that the goal is to identify the statements that are true for all possible scenarios, not just the most likely scenario.
