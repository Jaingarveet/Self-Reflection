## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The original argument is a deductive argument with a modus tollens form:
- All P are Q.
- Not Q.
- Therefore, not P.
In the original argument, P is "landscape room" and Q is "can see the landscape".
We need to find an argument that is most similar to this form.
Choice A is not similar because it is an inductive argument.
Choice B is similar because it is a deductive argument with a modus tollens form.
Choice C is not similar because it is a deductive argument with a modus ponens form.
Choice D is not similar because it is a deductive argument with a modus tollens form, but the conclusion is not the negation of the antecedent.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
