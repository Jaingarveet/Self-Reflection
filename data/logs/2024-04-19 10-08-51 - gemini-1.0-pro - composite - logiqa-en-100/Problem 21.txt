Topic: Logic
Context: Xiao Chen? At present, part of the orbit of Comet 1996D3 is far from the sun, but recently it can be found to emit flickering light through the solar telescope.In the past, people never observed such flashes of comets far away from the sun, so this flicker must be an unusual scene.Xiao Wang? Normally people don't observe comets far away from the sun.The 1996D3 comet flicker light discovered this time was obtained by continuous and careful tracking observation.
Question: Which of the following most accurately summarizes the method Xiao Wang used to refute Xiao Chen's views?
Choices:
  A: Point out that the key concepts used by Xiao Chen are ambiguous.
  B: pointed out that Xiao Chen's argument is clearly lacking in persuasion.
  C: pointed out that Xiao Chen's arguments contradict themselves.
  D: Disagree with Xiao Chen's conclusion, and put forward another explanation for Xiao Chen's argument.E.Agree with Xiao Chen's conclusion, but put forward another explanation for Xiao Chen's argument.
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I incorrectly identified the method Xiao Wang used to refute Xiao Chen's views.
My error was in misinterpreting the meaning of "refute." I focused on the specific claim about the unusual nature of the flickering light, rather than the broader argument about the lack of evidence.
Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation
- Scope of argument
- Focus on specific claims
Solution:
Xiao Chen argues that the flickering light of Comet 1996D3 is unusual because it has never been observed before.
Xiao Wang counters that comets far away from the sun are not normally observed, and the flickering light was discovered through careful tracking observation.
Xiao Wang is directly refuting Xiao Chen's claim about the lack of evidence. By pointing out that the flickering light was only observed through careful tracking, Xiao Wang is suggesting that the lack of previous observations is not a valid reason to conclude that the flickering light is unusual.
Instructions:
1. Carefully read and understand the arguments presented by both Xiao Chen and Xiao Wang.
2. Identify the specific claim that Xiao Wang is refuting.
3. Analyze Xiao Wang's argument to determine the method used to refute Xiao Chen's claim.
4. Consider the broader context of the argument and the overall purpose of Xiao Wang's response.
5. Choose the answer that accurately reflects the method used by Xiao Wang to refute Xiao Chen's views.
Advice:
- Pay close attention to the language used in the arguments, including key terms and phrases.
- Consider the logical structure of the arguments and how the claims are connected.
- Think critically about the assumptions and implications of each argument.
- Avoid focusing on specific details or claims without considering the broader context.
- Choose the answer that best reflects the overall method used to refute the opposing argument.
## Assistant 2:
## Analysis of Xiao Chen and Xiao Wang's Arguments:
**Xiao Chen:**
* **Claim:** The flickering light of Comet 1996D3 is unusual because it has never been observed before.
* **Reasoning:** Lack of previous observations suggests the phenomenon is uncommon.
**Xiao Wang:**
* **Counter-argument:** Comets far away from the sun are not normally observed.
* **Reasoning:** The lack of previous observations is not due to the absence of the phenomenon, but rather the lack of observation itself.
* **Evidence:** The flickering light was discovered through careful tracking observation.
## Identifying the Method Used by Xiao Wang:
Xiao Wang is not directly attacking the validity of Xiao Chen's claim about the unusual nature of the flickering light. Instead, he is focusing on the **reasoning** behind the claim. He argues that the lack of previous observations is not a reliable indicator of the phenomenon's rarity, as it could simply be due to the lack of observation itself.
Therefore, the method used by Xiao Wang to refute Xiao Chen's views is:
**C: pointed out that Xiao Chen's arguments contradict themselves.**
By highlighting the inconsistency between the claim and the reasoning, Xiao Wang effectively undermines the overall argument presented by Xiao Chen.
## Action:
Answer("C")
## Result:
