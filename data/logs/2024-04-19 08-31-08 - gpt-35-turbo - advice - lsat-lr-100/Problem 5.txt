## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The question describes an apparent discrepancy between the increase in the number of tornadoes and the unchanged climatic factors affecting their creation.
To resolve this discrepancy, we need to find an answer choice that explains why the number of tornadoes has increased despite the unchanged climatic factors.
Answer choice A is irrelevant because it talks about the knowledge of meteorologists before 1953.
Answer choice B is also irrelevant because it talks about the intensity of tornadoes, not their frequency.
Answer choice C does not help to resolve the discrepancy because it only talks about the last five years, not the period since 1953.
Answer choice D is also irrelevant because it talks about the property damage caused by tornadoes, not their frequency or climatic factors.
Answer choice E is also irrelevant because it talks about citizens helping authorities detect tornadoes, not the frequency or climatic factors affecting their creation.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")

Agent Answer: N
Correct Answer: E
