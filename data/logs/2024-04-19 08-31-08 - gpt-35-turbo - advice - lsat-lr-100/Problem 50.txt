Topic: Law
Context: Cigarette companies claim that manufacturing both low-and high-nicotine cigarettes allows smokers to choose how much nicotine they want. However, a recent study has shown that the levels of nicotine found in the blood of smokers who smoke one pack of cigarettes per day are identical at the end of a day's worth of smoking, whatever the level of nicotine in the cigarettes they smoke.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain the finding of the nicotine study?
Choices:
  A: Blood cannot absorb more nicotine per day than that found in the smoke from a package of the lowest-nicotine cigarettes available.
  B: Smokers of the lowest-nicotine cigarettes available generally smoke more cigarettes per day than smokers of high-nicotine cigarettes.
  C: Most nicotine is absorbed into the blood of a smoker even if it is delivered in smaller quantities.
  D: The level of tar in cigarettes is higher in low-nicotine cigarettes than it is in some high-nicotine cigarettes.
  E: When taking in nicotine by smoking cigarettes is discontinued, the level of nicotine in the blood decreases steadily.

## Assistant 2:
Self-reflection:
The question asks for the option that most helps to explain the finding of the nicotine study, which is that the levels of nicotine found in the blood of smokers who smoke one pack of cigarettes per day are identical at the end of a day's worth of smoking, whatever the level of nicotine in the cigarettes they smoke. 
Option A is incorrect because it talks about the maximum amount of nicotine that can be absorbed by the blood, which is not relevant to the question.
Option B is incorrect because it talks about the number of cigarettes smoked per day, which is not relevant to the question.
Option D is incorrect because it talks about the level of tar in cigarettes, which is not relevant to the question.
Option E is incorrect because it talks about the decrease in nicotine levels when smoking is discontinued, which is not relevant to the question.
Option C is the correct answer because it explains that most nicotine is absorbed into the blood of a smoker even if it is delivered in smaller quantities, which helps to explain why the levels of nicotine found in the blood of smokers who smoke one pack of cigarettes per day are identical at the end of a day's worth of smoking, whatever the level of nicotine in the cigarettes they smoke.
