Context: Patricia: During Japan's Tokugawa period, martial arts experts known as ninjas were trained for the purposes of espionage and assassination. Yet at that time there was actually very little ninja activity in Japan, and most Japanese did not fear ninjas. Tamara: That is not true. Many wealthy Japanese during the Tokugawa period had their houses constructed with intentionally squeaky floors so that they would receive warning if a ninja were in the house.
Question: Of the following, which one, if true, is the strongest counter Patricia can make to Tamara's objection?
Choices:
  A: Many poor Japanese during the Tokugawa period also had houses constructed with intentionally squeaky floors.
  B: As part of their secret training, ninjas learned to walk on squeaky floors without making a sound.
  C: The wealthy made up a small portion of Japan's population during the Tokugawa period.
  D: The fighting prowess of ninjas was exaggerated to mythic proportions in the years following the Tokngawa period.
  E: There were very few ninjas at any time other than during the Tokugawa period.

## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The main point of Tamara's objection is that wealthy Japanese during the Tokugawa period feared ninjas and took measures to protect themselves.
The key issue that needs to be addressed is whether the fear of ninjas was widespread or limited to a small group of wealthy Japanese.
Answer choice A is irrelevant to the main point of the objection.
Answer choice B does not address the main point of the objection and is not a strong counter.
Answer choice C is a weak counter because it does not address the main point of the objection directly.
Answer choice D is irrelevant to the main point of the objection.
Answer choice E is a strong counter because it directly challenges Tamara's claim that many Japanese feared ninjas during the Tokugawa period.
Action: Answer("E")
