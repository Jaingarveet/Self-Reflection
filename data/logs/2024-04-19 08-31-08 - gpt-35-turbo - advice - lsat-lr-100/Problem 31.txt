## User 2:
Topic: Law
Context: Mayor: Our city faces a difficult environmental problem caused by the enormous amount of garbage that we must dispose of. Although new recycling projects could greatly reduce this amount, these projects would actually be counterproductive to the goal of minimizing the overall amount of environmental damage.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would most help to resolve the apparent inconsistency in the mayor's claims about new recycling projects?
Choices:
  A: The vehicles that pick up materials for recycling create less pollution than would be caused by incinerating those materials.
  B: The great costs of new recycling projects would prevent other pollution-reducing projects from being undertaken.
  C: The mayor's city has nearly exhausted its landfill space and therefore must incinerate much of its garbage.
  D: More recycling would give industries in the mayor's city a greater incentive to use recycled materials in their manufacturing processes.
  E: People who recycle feel less justified in consuming more than they need than do people who do not recycle.

## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The mayor claims that new recycling projects would be counterproductive to the goal of minimizing the overall amount of environmental damage. However, the mayor also acknowledges that the city faces a difficult environmental problem caused by the enormous amount of garbage that must be disposed of. Therefore, the apparent inconsistency is that the mayor claims that new recycling projects would be counterproductive to the goal of minimizing environmental damage, but also acknowledges that the city faces a difficult environmental problem caused by the enormous amount of garbage that must be disposed of.
