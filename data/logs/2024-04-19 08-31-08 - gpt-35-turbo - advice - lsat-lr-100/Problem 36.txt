Context: Native speakers perceive sentences of their own language as sequences of separate words. But this perception is an illusion. This is shown by the fact that travelers who do not know a local language hear an unintelligible, uninterrupted stream of sound, not sentences with distinct words.
Question: Which one of the following is an assumption on which the argument depends?
Choices:
  A: It is impossible to understand sentences if they are in fact uninterrupted streams of sound.
  B: Those who do not know a language cannot hear the way speech in that language actually sounds.
  C: People pay less close attention to the way their own language sounds than they do to the way an unfamiliar language sounds.
  D: Accomplished non-native speakers of a language do not perceive sentences as streams of sound.
  E: Native speakers' perceptions of their own language are not more accurate than are the perceptions of persons who do not know that language.

## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The argument suggests that native speakers perceive sentences of their own language as sequences of separate words, but this perception is an illusion. The evidence is that travelers who do not know a local language hear an unintelligible, uninterrupted stream of sound, not sentences with distinct words. The assumption must be something that connects the evidence to the conclusion.
Option A is incorrect because the argument does not suggest that it is impossible to understand sentences if they are in fact uninterrupted streams of sound.
Option B is incorrect because the argument suggests that those who do not know a language hear an unintelligible, uninterrupted stream of sound, not that they cannot hear the way speech in that language actually sounds.
Option C is incorrect because the argument does not suggest that people pay less close attention to the way their own language sounds than they do to the way an unfamiliar language sounds.
Option D is incorrect because the argument does not suggest that accomplished non-native speakers of a language do not perceive sentences as streams of sound.
Option E is incorrect because the argument suggests that native speakers perceive sentences of their own language as sequences of separate words, but this perception is an illusion. Therefore, the assumption must be that native speakers' perceptions of their own language are not accurate.
