Topic: Law
Context: A panel of five scientists will be formed. The panelists will be selected from among three botanists—F, G, and H—three chemists—K, L, and M—and three zoologists—P, Q, and R. Selection is governed by the following conditions: The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types. If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. F and K cannot both be selected. K and M cannot both be selected. If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
Question: If four of the scientists selected are F, L, Q, and R, which one of the following must be the fifth scientist selected?
Choices:
  A: G
  B: H
  C: K
  D: M
  E: P

Explanation:
The problem states that four of the selected scientists are F, L, Q, and R. Based on the conditions given in the problem, we need to select the fifth scientist such that the panel meets the requirements.

1. The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types. Since four of the selected scientists are botanists, we need to select one zoologist. Therefore, the fifth scientist must be a zoologist.
2. If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. Since four botanists have already been selected, we can select only one zoologist.
3. K and M cannot both be selected. Since M has already been selected, K cannot be selected.
4. If M is selected, both P and R must be selected. Since M has already been selected, P and R must be selected.

Based on the above analysis, the fifth scientist that must be selected is E, the only remaining zoologist. Therefore, the correct answer is (E) - Zoologist.

I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand the mistake now. Thank you for providing the correct answer.

1. The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types. Since four of the selected scientists are botanists, we need to select one zoologist. Therefore, the fifth scientist must be a zoologist.
2. If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. Since four botanists have already been selected, we can select only one zoologist.
3. K and M cannot both be selected. Since M has already been selected, K cannot be selected.
4. If M is selected, both P and R must be selected. Since M has already been selected, P and R must be selected.

Therefore, the fifth scientist that must be selected is E, the only remaining zoologist. The correct answer is (E) - Zoologist.
