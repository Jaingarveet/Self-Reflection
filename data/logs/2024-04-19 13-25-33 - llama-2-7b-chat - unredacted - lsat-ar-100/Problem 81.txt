## Assistant 2:
  Thought: 
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I realize now that the organizer's selection of works must conform to the given requirements.

The group consists of three French novels, three Russian novels, two French plays, and one Russian play. This means that at most four French works can be selected, and at least three but no more than four novels can be selected. Additionally, the organizer must select at least as many French novels as Russian novels.

If both French plays are selected, then the Russian play is not selected. This means that the organizer cannot select all three plays, as that would leave no room for the Russian play.

Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
