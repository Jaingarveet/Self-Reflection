Context: An administrator must assign parking spaces to six new employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young.

The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.

## Assistant 2:
  Reflection:

I previously answered this question incorrectly by selecting option C, which states that Vaughn is assigned parking space #5. However, if Robertson is assigned parking space #3, then Vaughn cannot be assigned parking space #5, as there is a conflict with the rule that states no two employees can be assigned the same parking space. Therefore, the correct answer is option E, which states that Young is assigned parking space #2.

I reflected on my previous answer and realized my mistake by carefully reviewing the given rules and constraints. I also used my understanding of the problem to eliminate incorrect options and arrive at the correct answer.
## Result:
Agent Answer: None
Correct Answer: E
Score: 0
