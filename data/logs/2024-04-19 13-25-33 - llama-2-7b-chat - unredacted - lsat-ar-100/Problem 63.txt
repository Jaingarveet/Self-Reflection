Action: Answer("C")

The correct answer is C: three lab assistants can be determined to lead which sessions they lead.

From the given constraints, we can determine the following:

* Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, so he leads a session on Wednesday.
* Kevin and Rebecca are leading sessions on the same day, so they lead sessions on Thursday.
* Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day, so they lead sessions on different days. However, we cannot determine which sessions they lead without more information.

Therefore, three lab assistants can be determined to lead which sessions they lead: Julio, Kevin, and Rebecca.
