  Thank you for providing the feedback! I apologize for the mistake in my previous response. Here is the corrected answer:

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand why. After re-reading the problem, I realized that the information provided is not sufficient to determine the correct answer. The problem does not give enough information to determine when each house is shown, and it does not provide any information about the order in which the houses are shown.

To solve this problem, we need to use the information provided in the problem statement to create a logical sequence of events. Based on the rules given in the problem, we can deduce the following:

1. J must be shown in the evening.
2. K cannot be shown in the morning.
3. L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.

Using these rules, we can create a possible sequence of events:

Morning: K is shown, L is shown after K.
Afternoon: M is shown.
Evening: J is shown.

Based on this sequence of events, the answer must be (B): L is shown in the afternoon.

I hope this explanation helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
