## Assistant 2:
  Reflection:

Upon reviewing my previous answer, I realized that I made a mistake in my reasoning. I incorrectly assumed that Lan's session would meet on the same day as Kevin's session, which led me to choose the incorrect answer.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to use the constraints provided in the question:

* Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
* Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
* Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
* Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.

From these constraints, we can deduce that:

* Lan's session cannot meet on Wednesday morning, as Kevin and Lan cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
* Lan's session cannot meet on Thursday morning, as Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
* Lan's session cannot meet on Friday morning, as Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
* Olivia's session cannot meet on Wednesday morning, as Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
* Olivia's session cannot meet on Thursday morning, as Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) Olivia's session meets Thursday morning.
