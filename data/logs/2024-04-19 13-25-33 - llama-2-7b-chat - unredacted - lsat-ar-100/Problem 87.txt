## Assistant 2:
  Thought: 
I previously answered this question incorrectly, selecting Choice "C". However, upon further reflection, I realize that the organizer must select at least two French novels, as stated in the problem. Therefore, the correct answer is Choice "D", two French novels.

I made a mistake in my initial answer by selecting Choice "C", which does not meet the requirements of the problem. I realized my error after re-reading the problem and noticing that the organizer must select at least two French novels. Thank you for providing the opportunity to reflect on my mistake and improve my answer.
