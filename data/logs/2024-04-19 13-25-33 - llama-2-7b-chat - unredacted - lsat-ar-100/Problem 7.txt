  Thank you for the feedback! I'm glad I could arrive at the correct answer with your guidance. Here's my self-reflection on how I approached the problem:

1. I started by analyzing the conditions given in the question and identifying the key constraints. I realized that there were five witnesses and three days of the week, and each witness had to testify on a specific day.
2. I used a truth table to determine the possible schedules that meet the conditions. This helped me visualize the possible combinations of witnesses and their testimonies.
3. I noticed that Franco did not testify on the same day as Garcia, and Iturbe testified on Wednesday. This meant that at least two witnesses had to testify on Tuesday.
4. I observed that Hong did not testify on Monday, and Jackson was the only witness scheduled to testify on Monday. This meant that at least one witness had to testify on Monday.
5. I used a systematic approach to determine the possible schedules that met all the conditions. I created a table to represent the possible combinations of witnesses and their testimonies.
6. I noticed that the only possible schedule that met all the conditions was: Franco does not testify on the same day as Hong, Garcia testifies on Tuesday, Iturbe testifies on Wednesday, and Hong does not testify on Monday. Jackson is the only witness scheduled to testify on Monday.
7. I concluded that the correct answer is option B, which states that Hong is scheduled to testify on Tuesday.
