  Thank you for the opportunity to correct my previous answer. After reflecting on the problem and my previous solution, I realize that I made an error in my reasoning. Here is the correct answer:

The order in which the breeds of kitten are featured in the pet shop, from day 1 through day 7, is:

E: Siamese, Himalayan, Siamese, Himalayan, Manx, Siamese, Himalayan

Explanation:

* Day 1: Greyhound (no kittens featured)
* Day 2: Manx (Himalayans are not featured on day 1, so they must be featured on day 2)
* Day 3: Himalayan (since Manx was featured on day 2, Himalayans are featured on day 3)
* Day 4: Siamese (Himalayans are not featured on day 3, so Siamese must be featured on day 4)
* Day 5: Himalayan (since Siamese was featured on day 4, Himalayans are featured on day 5)
* Day 6: Manx (Himalayans are not featured on day 5, so Manx must be featured on day 6)
* Day 7: Siamese (Himalayans are not featured on day 6, so Siamese must be featured on day 7)

Therefore, the correct answer is option E: Siamese, Himalayan, Siamese, Himalayan, Manx, Siamese, Himalayan.
