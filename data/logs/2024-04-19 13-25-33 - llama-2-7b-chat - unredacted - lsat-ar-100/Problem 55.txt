## Assistant 2:
  Thank you for the feedback! I'm glad I was able to arrive at the correct answer after reflecting on my previous attempt. Here is how I would answer the question again:

Action: Answer("D")

The acceptable schedule of witnesses is:

Monday: Garcia and Jackson
Tuesday: Franco and Iturbe
Wednesday: Garcia and Hong

Explanation:

1. Franco does not testify on the same day as Garcia, so Franco testifies on Monday.
2. Iturbe testifies on Wednesday, as specified in the problem.
3. Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday, so Franco and Iturbe testify on Tuesday.
4. Hong does not testify on Monday, so Hong testifies on Wednesday.
5. At least one witness testifies on Monday, so Garcia testifies on Monday.

By meeting all the conditions given in the problem, this schedule of witnesses is the only acceptable one.
