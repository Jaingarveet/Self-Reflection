Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.

The shoe store is in space 2, so the pharmacy must be in space 1 or 7.
If the pharmacy is in space 1, then the optometrist or the veterinarian must be in space 2.
If the pharmacy is in space 7, then one of the restaurants must be in space 2.
If the optometrist is in space 5, then the veterinarian must be in space 3 or 6.
If the veterinarian is in space 4, then the toy store cannot be in space 3 or 5.
A: The optometrist cannot be in space 5 if the shoe store is in space 2.
B: The pharmacy can be in space 1 if the optometrist is in space 2.
C: A restaurant cannot be in space 3 if the shoe store is in space 2.
