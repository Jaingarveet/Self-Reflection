Context: On the first day of a two-day study for a cycling magazine, four riders—Reynaldo, Seamus, Theresa, and Yuki—will each test one of four bicycles—F, G, H, and J. Each rider will then test a different one of the bicycles on the second day. Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day. The assignment of riders to bicycles is subject to the following conditions: Reynaldo cannot test F. Yuki cannot test J. Theresa must be one of the testers for H. The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.

If Reynaldo tests J on the second day, then Seamus must test H on the first day and Yuki must test F on the first day. 
If Seamus tests H on the first day, then Theresa must test J on the first day, and Yuki must test F on the first day. 
If Yuki tests H on the first day, then Seamus must test J on the first day, and Theresa must test F on the first day. 
If Yuki tests H on the second day, then Seamus must test J on the first day, and Theresa must test F on the first day.
