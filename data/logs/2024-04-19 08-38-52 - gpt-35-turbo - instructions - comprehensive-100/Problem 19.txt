Topic: Logic
Context: The late famous logician Jin Yuelin of China heard the words "Money is like dung" and "Friends are worth a thousand dollars" when he was a child, and found that there are logical problems because they can lead to the absurd conclusion of "friends are like dung".
Question: Since the conclusion of "friends like dung" is not true, it can be logically derived?
Choices:
  A: The expression "money is like dung" is false.
  B: If a friend is indeed worth a lot of money, then money is not like dung.
  C: The statement that "friends are valuable" is true.
  D: The words "Money is like dung" and "Friends are worth a thousand dollars" are either true or false.

Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and understand the problem.
2. Identify the conclusion that is not true.
3. Identify the statement that can logically explain why the conclusion is not true.
4. Consider each option and evaluate whether it provides a logical explanation for the conclusion.
5. Choose the option that provides the best logical explanation for the conclusion.
## Assistant 2:
Self-reflection:
The conclusion that "friends are like dung" is not true because it contradicts the statement that "friends are worth a thousand dollars". Therefore, the statement that "if a friend is indeed worth a lot of money, then money is not like dung" logically explains why the conclusion is not true. Option B provides this logical explanation, so the correct answer is B.
Action: Answer("B")
