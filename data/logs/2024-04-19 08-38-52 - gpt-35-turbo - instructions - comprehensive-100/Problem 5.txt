## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let the number of members in the club be n.
The youngest member is 7 years old.
The sum of the ages of all the members is 250.
The common difference is 3 months, which is 1/4 of a year.
We can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series to set up an equation:
Sum = n/2 * [2a + (n-1)d]
where a is the first term, d is the common difference, and n is the number of terms.
In this case, a = 7 years, d = 1/4 years, and the sum is 250 years.
Substituting these values into the formula, we get:
250 = n/2 * [2(7) + (n-1)(1/4)]
Simplifying the equation:
500 = n[14 + (n-1)/4]
Multiplying both sides by 4 to eliminate the fraction:
2000 = n[56 + n - 1]
2000 = n^2 + 55n
Rearranging the equation:
n^2 + 55n - 2000 = 0
Using the quadratic formula:
n = (-55 ± sqrt(55^2 + 4(2000)))/2
n = (-55 ± 85)/2
n = 15 or n = -70
Since the number of members must be positive, the answer is:
Action: Answer("E")
## Result:
Agent Answer: E
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
