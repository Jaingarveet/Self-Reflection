## Assistant 2:
Thought:
From the given conditions, we know that:
- Exactly six students will give reports over three consecutive days.
- Two reports will be given each day, one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
- George can only give a report on Tuesday.
- Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports.
- If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then the students who can give morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday are:
- Monday: [REDACTED]
- Tuesday: George and [REDACTED]
- Wednesday: [REDACTED] and [REDACTED]
We know that George can only give a report on Tuesday, so he cannot give a report on Monday or Wednesday. Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports, so they must give morning reports. If Nina gives a report, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on the next day, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. Therefore, Nina cannot give a report on Tuesday, or else Helen and Irving would have to give reports on Wednesday, which is not possible since only two reports can be given each day. Thus, Nina must give a report on Wednesday. This means that Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday. Therefore, the students who can give morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday are:
- Monday: [REDACTED]
- Tuesday: George and [REDACTED]
- Wednesday: Nina and [REDACTED]
The only answer choice that matches this result is B: Irving, Robert, and Helen. 
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: D
