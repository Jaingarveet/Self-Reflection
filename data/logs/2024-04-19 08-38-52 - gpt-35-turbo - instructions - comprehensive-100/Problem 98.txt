# Model: gpt-35-turbo | Agent: instructions | Exam: comprehensive-100 | Problem 98 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Medicine.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:

Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought:

The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Medicine
Subtopic: Biochemistry
Question: Aminoacyl t-RNA is not require for ?
Choices:
  A: Proline
  B: Lysine
  C: Hydroxylysine
  D: Methionine
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Understand the role of aminoacyl t-RN[REDACTED] in protein synthesis.
2. Know which amino acids require aminoacyl t-RN[REDACTED] for protein synthesis.
3. Identify the amino acid in the question.
4. Determine if the amino acid requires aminoacyl t-RN[REDACTED] for protein synthesis.
5. Choose the answer that matches your determination.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Aminoacyl t-RNA is required for the attachment of amino acids to tRNA molecules during protein synthesis.
Proline, Lysine, Hydroxylysine, and Methionine are all amino acids.
Proline and Hydroxylysine are exceptions to the rule and do not require aminoacyl t-RNA for protein synthesis.
Lysine and Methionine require aminoacyl t-RNA for protein synthesis.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
