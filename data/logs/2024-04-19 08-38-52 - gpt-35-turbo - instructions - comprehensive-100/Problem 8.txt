Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Identify the speeds of the two cars.
2. Identify the distance between the two cars.
3. Use the formula distance = speed x time to find the time it takes for each car to travel.
4. Write an equation that relates the distances traveled by both cars.
5. Solve the equation for the time it takes for the two cars to meet.
6. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
7. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
1. The first car is traveling at 12 mph.
2. The second car is traveling at 13 mph.
3. The distance between the two cars is 50 miles.
4. Let's assume that they meet after t hours.
5. The distance traveled by the first car is 12t, and the distance traveled by the second car is 13t.
6. The sum of the distances traveled by both cars is equal to the total distance between them, which is 50 miles.
7. Therefore, the equation is 12t + 13t = 50.
8. Solving for t, we get t = 2.
9. Double-checking, 12(2) + 13(2) = 24 + 26 = 50.
