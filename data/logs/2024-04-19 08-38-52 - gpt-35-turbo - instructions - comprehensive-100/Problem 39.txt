Topic: Law
Context: There are two kinds of horror stories: those that describe a mad scientist's experiments and those that describe a monstrous beast. In some horror stories about monstrous beasts, the monster symbolizes a psychological disturbance in the protagonist. Horror stories about mad scientists, on the other hand, typically express the author's feeling that scientific knowledge alone is not enough to guide human endeavor. However, despite these differences, both kinds of horror stories share two features: they describe violations of the laws of nature and they are intended to produce dread in the reader.
Question: If the statements above are true, which one of the following would also have to be true?
Choices:
  A: All descriptions of monstrous beasts describe violations of the laws of nature.
  B: Any story that describes a violation of a law of nature is intended to invoke dread in the reader.
  C: Horror stories of any kind usually describe characters who are psychologically disturbed.
  D: Most stories about mad scientists express the author's antiscientific views.
  E: Some stories that employ symbolism describe violations of the laws of nature.

## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The passage states that both kinds of horror stories describe violations of the laws of nature and are intended to produce dread in the reader. It also states that horror stories about monstrous beasts may symbolize psychological disturbances in the protagonist, while horror stories about mad scientists express the author's feeling that scientific knowledge alone is not enough to guide human endeavor. 
A: This statement is too extreme. The passage only states that monstrous beasts in horror stories may symbolize psychological disturbances in the protagonist, not that all descriptions of monstrous beasts describe violations of the laws of nature.
B: The passage states that horror stories that describe violations of the laws of nature are intended to produce dread in the reader, but it does not state that all stories that describe violations of the laws of nature are intended to do so.
C: This statement is too extreme. The passage only states that horror stories about monstrous beasts may symbolize psychological disturbances in the protagonist, not that all horror stories describe characters who are psychologically disturbed.
D: This statement is too extreme. The passage only states that horror stories about mad scientists typically express the author's feeling that scientific knowledge alone is not enough to guide human endeavor, not that most stories about mad scientists express the author's antiscientific views.
E: This statement is possible, as the passage states that horror stories of both kinds describe violations of the laws of nature.
