Context: Only Canadian films are shown at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival. This year, most of the films that won prizes at that festival also won prizes at international film festivals.

Choices:
  A: This year, most of the Canadian films that were shown at international film festivals won prizes at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival.
  B: Most of the Canadian Films produced this year were shown at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival.
  C: Some of the films that won prizes at international film festivals this year were Canadian films.
  D: This year, not every film that won a prize at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival was also shown at an international film festival.
  E: This year, at least one Film that won a prize at an international Film festival was not shown at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The correct answer must follow logically from the information provided in the truth of the two statements.

Statement A is not necessarily true, as it refers to Canadian films shown at international festivals, whereas the original statement refers to films generally.

Statement B is incorrect as it refers to Canadian films produced and not specifically those shown at the festival.

Statement C is the correct answer as it is the only statement that logically follows from the original statements. The original statements tell us that most films that won prizes at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival also won prizes at international festivals, and that only Canadian films are shown at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival. Therefore, it must be true that some of the films that won prizes at international festivals were Canadian films.

Statement D is not necessarily true as it is possible that every film that won a prize at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival was also shown at an international festival, we just know that most films did so.

Statement E is not necessarily true as it is possible that all films that won prizes at international festivals were also shown at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival.

Therefore, the correct answer is C.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
