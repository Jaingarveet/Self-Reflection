Topic: Law
Context: Hana said she was not going to invite her brothers to her birthday party. However, among the gifts Hana received at her party was a recording in which she had expressed an interest. Since her brothers had planned to give her that recording, at least some of Hana's brothers must have been among the guests at Hana's birthday party after all.
Question: A reasoning error in the argument is that the argument
Choices:
  A: disregards the possibility that a change of mind might be justified by a change in circumstances
  B: treats the fact of someone's presence at a given event as a guarantee that that person had a legitimate reason to be at that event
  C: uses a term that is intrinsically evaluative as though that term was purely descriptive
  D: fails to establish that something true of some people is true of only those people
  E: overlooks the possibility that a person's interest in one kind of thing is compatible with that person's interest in a different kind of thing
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The argument assumes that because Hana received the recording as a gift, her brothers must have been present at the party, without considering other possibilities. This is a reasoning error as it fails to acknowledge that someone else could have given Hana the recording as a gift, even if they did not plan it.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
