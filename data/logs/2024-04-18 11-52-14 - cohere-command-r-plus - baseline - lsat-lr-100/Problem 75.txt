Topic: Law
Context: Figorian Wildlife Commission: The development of wetlands in industrialized nations for residential and commercial uses has endangered many species. To protect wildlife we must regulate such development in Figoria: future wetland development must be offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats. Thus, development would cause no net reduction of wetlands and pose no threat to the species that inhabit them. Figorian Development Commission: Other nations have flagrantly developed wetlands at the expense of wildlife. We have conserved. Since Figorian wetland development might not affect wildlife and is necessary for growth, we should allow development. We have as much right to govern our own resources as countries that have already put their natural resources to commercial use.
Question: Which one of the following principles, if accepted, would most strongly support the Figorian Development Commission's position against the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position?
Choices:
  A: National resources should be regulated by international agreement when wildlife is endangered.
  B: The right of future generations to have wildlife preserved supersedes the economic needs of individual nations.
  C: Only when a reduction of populations of endangered species by commercial development has been found should regulation be implemented to prevent further damage.
  D: Environment regulation must aim at preventing any further environmental damage and cannot allow for the different degrees to which different nations have already harmed the environment.
  E: It is imprudent to allow further depletion of natural resources.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The Figorian Development Commission argues that Figoria has a right to develop its own natural resources, even if this may impact wildlife, as other nations have already done so. They argue that any environmental impact may not be as severe as in other countries, and that the economic benefits outweigh the potential harm.

Of the given choices, the principle that most strongly supports this position is "C: Only when a reduction of populations of endangered species by commercial development has been found should regulation be implemented to prevent further damage."

This principle suggests that regulation is not necessary unless there is clear evidence of harm to endangered species populations. It implies that development can proceed in the absence of such evidence, which aligns with the Development Commission's argument that Figorian wetland development "might not affect wildlife."

While the other choices touch on important environmental and regulatory considerations, they do not directly support the Development Commission's argument in the same way as choice "C."

Choice "A" suggests international regulation, which goes against the Development Commission's emphasis on Figoria's sovereignty. Choice "B" prioritizes wildlife preservation over economic needs, conflicting with the Development Commission's argument for development. Choice "D" takes a strict approach to environmental regulation, not allowing for considerations of varying degrees of harm across nations. Choice "E" expresses a general sentiment against resource depletion but does not address the specific argument about the potential for varying impacts on wildlife.

Therefore, choice "C" is the strongest support for the Figorian Development Commission's position.

Action: Answer("C")
