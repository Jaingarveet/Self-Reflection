Context: Editorial: Painting involves a sequential application of layers, each of which adheres satisfactorily only if the underlying layer has been properly applied. Education is, in this respect, like the craft of painting. Since the most important steps in painting are preparation of the surface to be painted and application of the primer coat, it makes sense to suppose that .
Question: Which one of the following most logically completes the editorial's argument?
Choices:
  A: in the educator's initial contact with a student, the educator should be as undemanding as possible
  B: students who have a secure grasp of the fundamentals of a subject are likely to make progress in that subject
  C: educators who are not achieving the goals they intended should revise their teaching methods
  D: teaching new students is rewarding but much more difficult than teaching more advanced students
  E: the success of a student's overall educational experience depends above all upon that student's initial educational experience
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The argument is that education is like painting in that each layer builds upon the last, and so the initial steps are the most important. 
Therefore, the completion of the argument should reflect this idea that the initial steps are critical to the overall success of the process.

Choice B states that students with a secure grasp of fundamentals are likely to make progress, which aligns with the idea that initial steps are key to future success. This choice completes the argument most logically.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: E
Score: 0
