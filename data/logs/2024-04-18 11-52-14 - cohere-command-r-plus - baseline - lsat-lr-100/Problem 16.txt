Context: There are 70 to 100 Florida panthers alive today. This represents a very large increase over their numbers in the 1970s, but their population must reach at least 250 if it is to be self-sustaining. Their current habitat is not large enough to support any more of these animals, however.
Question: If the statements above are true, which one of the following must also be true?
Choices:
  A: Some part of the panthers' current habitat is only of marginal quality.
  B: If the population of Florida panthers ever exceeds 250, it will be self-sustaining.
  C: Unless Florida panthers acquire a larger habitat, their population will not be self-sustaining.
  D: The population of Florida panthers will never increase much beyond its current level.
  E: Today, Florida panthers occupy a larger habitat than they did in the 1970s.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The correct answer is C: Unless Florida panthers acquire a larger habitat, their population will not be self-sustaining. This is because the statement tells us that their current habitat cannot support a larger population, and a minimum of 250 individuals are needed for the population to be self-sustaining.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
