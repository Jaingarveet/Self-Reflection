## System:
You are an expert in Law.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Context: Microbiologist: Because heavy metals are normally concentrated in sewage sludge during the sewage treatment process, the bacteria that survive in the sludge have evolved the unusual ability to resist heavy-metal poisoning. The same bacteria also show a strong resistance to antibiotics. This suggests that the bacteria's exposure to the heavy metals in the sewage sludge has somehow promoted their resistance to antibiotics.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the microbiologist's argument?
Choices:
  A: Most bacteria that are not resistant to antibiotics are not resistant to heavy-metal poisoning either.
  B: Bacteria that live in sewage sludge that is free of heavy metals, but is in other respects similar to normal sewage, are generally resistant to neither heavy-metal poisoning nor antibiotics.
  C: Antibiotic resistance of bacteria that survive in sewage sludge in which heavy metals are concentrated contributes to their resistance to heavy-metal poisoning.
  D: Sewage sludge that contains high concentrations of heavy metals almost always contains significant concentrations of antibiotics.
  E: Many kinds of bacteria that do not live in sewage sludge are resistant to both heavy-metal poisoning and antibiotics.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The argument is strengthened by showing that the absence of heavy metals results in a lack of antibiotic resistance in the bacteria. Choice B does this by showing that bacteria in sludge without heavy metals are generally resistant to neither heavy metals nor antibiotics.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
