Context: City dog licensing records show that more cocker spaniels are registered to addresses in the Flynn Heights neighborhood than to addresses in all other neighborhoods combined. So if an animal control officer finds a stray cocker spaniel anywhere near Flynn Heights, it is likely that the dog belongs to someone in Flynn Heights.
Question: Which one of the following would be most useful to know in order to evaluate the argument?
Choices:
  A: whether cocker spaniels are more likely than dogs of other breeds to stray from their owners
  B: whether there are more cocker spaniels registered to addresses in Flynn Heights than any other breed of dog
  C: whether the city's animal control officers find more stray dogs in and around Flynn Heights than in any other part of the city
  D: whether the number of pets owned, per capita, is greater for residents of Flynn Heights than for residents of any other neighborhood
  E: whether residents of Flynn Heights are more likely to license their dogs than residents of other neighborhoods are
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The argument is that stray cocker spaniels found near Flynn Heights likely belong to residents of that neighborhood because more cocker spaniels are registered there than anywhere else.
To evaluate this argument, it would be useful to know if the high number of registered cocker spaniels in Flynn Heights is due to unique characteristics of the neighborhood or its residents.

Choice A addresses dog behavior, which is not relevant to the argument.
Choice B is irrelevant; the argument already states that more cocker spaniels are registered in Flynn Heights.
Choice C discusses the number of stray dogs found, but this does not provide insight into why one breed dominates registrations in a particular area.
Choice D considers pet ownership rates, but this does not directly relate to the argument's focus on a specific breed.

Choice E is the most useful as it considers whether the licensing behavior of Flynn Heights residents could be a factor in the high number of registered cocker spaniels. If residents of Flynn Heights are more diligent in licensing their dogs, it could explain the high number of cocker spaniel registrations without requiring that there are more of this breed in the neighborhood.
Action: Answer("E")

Agent Answer: E
