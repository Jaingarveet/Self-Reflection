## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The area of the rectangle is 150 sq m. Let's call the breadth b. Then the length is 4b + 1.
2. Using the formula for area of a rectangle:
   Area = length * breadth
   150 = (4b + 1) * b
   150 = 4b^2 + b
3. Solve the quadratic equation:
   4b^2 + b - 150 = 0
   (4b - 15)(b + 10) = 0
   b = 15/4 or b = -10 (discard as breadth can't be negative)
   So, b = 15/4 = 3.75 m
4. Length = 4b + 1 = 4(3.75) + 1 = 16 m
5. Perimeter of a rectangle = 2(length + breadth)
                            = 2(16 + 3.75)
                            = 2(19.75)
                            = 39.5 m
The closest answer is 40 m.
