## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) There are 3 children and 3 chairs. This is an arrangement problem, so we need to consider the order.
2) One key constraint is that Susan must be to the left of Tim. This means Susan and Tim can't be arranged in all possible ways.
3) Let's consider the possible positions for Susan:
   - Susan could be in the leftmost chair
   - Susan could be in the middle chair
   She can't be in the rightmost chair because then she wouldn't be to the left of Tim.
4) If Susan is in the leftmost chair, then Tim must be in the middle chair to satisfy the constraint. Zen would be in the rightmost chair. There's only 1 way to arrange them in this case.
5) If Susan is in the middle chair, then Tim must be in the rightmost chair. Zen would be in the leftmost chair. Again, there's only 1 way to arrange them in this case.
6) Adding up the two possible arrangements, there are 2 ways total to arrange the children under the given constraints.
Therefore, the correct answer is C: 2.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
