## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
* The team won 20 matches
* They lost 30% of their total matches
* To find the number of matches lost, we first need to calculate the total number of matches played
* If we let x = total matches played, then:
   - x - 20 = matches lost
   - matches lost / total matches = 30% = 0.30
* So we can set up the equation:
   (x - 20) / x = 0.30
* Solving for x:
   x - 20 = 0.30x
   0.70x = 20
   x = 20/0.70 = 28.57
* The team played about 29 total matches (rounding 28.57 up since you can't play a fraction of a match)
* If they won 20 matches out of 29 total, then they lost:
   29 - 20 = 9 matches
Therefore, the number of matches the team lost is closest to:
Action: Answer("E")
## Result:
Agent Answer: E
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
