## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: Amy is organizing her bookshelves and finds that she has 10 different types of books. She then codes each book with either a single letter or a pair of two different letters. If each type of book is uniquely represented by either a single letter or pair of letters, what is the smallest number of letters Amy will need to create the codes for all 10 types of books? (Assume the order of letters in a pair does not matter.)
Choices:
  A: 3
  B: 4
  C: 5
  D: 10
  E: 20

## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) If Amy uses single letters only, she would need 10 letters to uniquely code the 10 types of books. 
2) However, Amy can also use pairs of letters. The key realization is that the order doesn't matter in these pairs. This means she's dealing with combinations, not permutations.
3) With n letters, the number of unique pairs (combinations) is given by the formula:
   
   $\binom{n}{2} = \frac{n!}{2!(n-2)!} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}$
4) Let's start with the smallest possible n and see if it's enough:
   For n = 3: 
   Single letters: 3
   Pairs: $\binom{3}{2} = \frac{3*2}{2} = 3$
   Total: 3 + 3 = 6 (not enough)
   For n = 4:
   Single letters: 4  
   Pairs: $\binom{4}{2} = \frac{4*3}{2} = 6$
   Total: 4 + 6 = 10 (just enough!)
5) Therefore, the smallest number of letters Amy needs is 4.
Action: Answer("B")
