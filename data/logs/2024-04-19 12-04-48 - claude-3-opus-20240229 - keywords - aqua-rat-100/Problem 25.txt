Question: A car is being driven, in a straight line and at a uniform speed, towards the base of a vertical tower. The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower?
Choices:
  A: 5(√3 + 1)
  B: 6(√3 + √2)
  C: 7(√3 – 1)
  D: 8(√3 – 2)
  E: None of these

## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) Let the height of the tower be h and the distance of the car from the base of the tower at the first instance be x.
2) Then, tan(45°) = h/x. We know tan(45°) = 1, so h = x.
3) After 10 minutes, the angle of elevation is 60°. Let the distance traveled by the car in these 10 minutes be d. 
   Then, tan(60°) = h/(x-d). We know tan(60°) = √3, so √3 = h/(x-d).
4) Substituting h = x from step 2:
   √3 = x/(x-d)
   √3(x-d) = x
   √3x - √3d = x
   √3x - x = √3d
   x(√3 - 1) = √3d
   
5) Solving for d:
   d = x(√3 - 1)/√3 
     = x(√3/√3 - 1/√3)
     = x(1 - 1/√3)
     
6) Now, if the speed of the car is v, then x = 10v (since the car traveled distance x in 10 minutes).
7) The remaining distance to the tower is x - d. At speed v, this will take time (x - d)/v.
8) Substituting x = 10v and the expression for d from step 5:
   Time = (10v - 10v(1 - 1/√3))/v
        = 10 - 10(1 - 1/√3)
        = 10 - 10 + 10/√3
        = 10/√3
        
9) Simplifying:
   Time = 10/√3 * √3/√3
        = 10√3/3
        = 10√3/3 * (√3 + 1)/(√3 + 1)
        = (10√3(√3 + 1))/(3(√3 + 1))
        = (10(3 + √3))/(3(√3 + 1))
        = (10/3) * (3 + √3)/(√3 + 1)
        = (10/3) * (√3 + 1)
        
Therefore, the car will reach the base of the tower in (10/3) * (√3 + 1) minutes more.
