## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step to make sure we get the right answer this time:
1) The company produces 420 components per month. Over a year that is:
   420 * 12 = 5040 components per year
2) The production cost is $110 per component. So the total yearly production cost is: 
   5040 * $110 = $554,400
3) They want a yearly profit of at least $626,400. 
   Profit = Revenue - Costs
   So the total revenue must be at least:
   $626,400 + $554,400 = $1,180,800
   
4) To get the minimum price per component, divide the total revenue by the number of components:
   $1,180,800 / 5040 = $234.29 per component
5) Rounding up to the nearest $10 to ensure the profit target is met, the minimum price is $240 per component.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
