## Get Reflection:
  Action: Answer("D")

Explanation:
The assumption required by the curator's argument is that the hippopotamus' legs were not broken through some natural occurrence after it was placed in the tomb. This assumption is necessary to support the curator's conclusion that the hippopotamus was a religious object, as the breaking of the legs is believed to have been done intentionally as part of a religious ritual. If the legs were broken off naturally, then the curator's conclusion would not be supported.

The other choices do not relate to the question or are not necessarily true. Choice A, that the tomb in which the hippopotamus was found was not the tomb of a child, is not necessarily true and does not affect the curator's argument. Choice B, that earthenware figures were never used as children's roys in ancient Egypt, is also not necessarily true and does not affect the curator's argument. Choice C, that the tomb in which the hippopotamus was found was not reentered from the time of burial until archaeologists opened it, is not necessarily true and does not affect the curator's argument. Choice E, that the hippopotamus was originally placed upside down in the tomb, is not necessarily true and does not affect the curator's argument.

Therefore, the correct answer is D, that the hippopotamus' legs were not broken through some natural occurrence after it was placed in the tomb.
