## Get Reflection:
  Action: Answer("A")

The correct answer is A: The only considerations that bear upon the question of whether the mosaics should have been removed are archaeological.

The archaeologist's argument is based on the idea that the mosaics should have been left in their original location for archaeological reasons. The absence of the mosaics could mislead future archaeologists who may not have access to the records of the removed artifacts. This argument is based solely on archaeological considerations, and therefore, choice A is the best answer.

The other choices do not support the archaeologist's argument as well:

B: Archaeologists studying a site can tell whether or not that site had been flooded at some time. This choice is not relevant to the issue of whether the mosaics should have been removed.

C: The materials used in the construction of a mosaic are readily apparent when the mosaic is examined in its original location. This choice is not directly related to the archaeologist's argument.

D: Archaeological sites from which artifacts have been removed rarely mislead archaeologists who later study the site. This choice is not necessarily true, and even if it were, it would not address the specific concern about the potential misinterpretation of the site due to the absence of the mosaics.

E: The removal of artifacts from archaeological sites rarely has any environmental impact. This choice is not relevant to the issue of whether the mosaics should have been removed.
