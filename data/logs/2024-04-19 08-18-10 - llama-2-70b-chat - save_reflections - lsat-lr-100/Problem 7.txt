## Get Reflection:
  Action: Answer("B")

Explanation:
The radio producer's argument is similar in pattern to choice B. Both arguments present two options, and then present a reason why one of the options is not feasible or desirable. In the producer's argument, the station cannot afford to stick with classical music alone, so they must devote some airtime to other genres. In choice B, the person cannot afford to buy blinds, so they should make curtains. Both arguments use the "or" conjunction to present the two options and then use a reason to eliminate one of the options.

The other choices do not share this pattern of reasoning. Choice A presents two options, but does not eliminate one of them based on a reason. Choice C presents two options and eliminates one of them based on a reason, but the reason is not related to cost, which is the primary concern in the radio producer's argument. Choice D presents two options, but the reason for eliminating one of them is not related to cost or feasibility, but rather to aesthetics. Choice E presents two options, but the reason for eliminating one of them is not related to cost or feasibility, but rather to a desire to avoid having bare windows.

Therefore, the correct answer is B, as it most closely matches the pattern of reasoning used by the radio producer.
