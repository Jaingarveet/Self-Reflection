## Get Reflection:
  Action: Answer("D")

Explanation:
The editorial argues that the political party's policy is inconsistent because they have expressed the view that increasing spending on education is a worthy goal, but have also claimed that the government should not increase spending on education.

The assumption behind this argument is that a consistent political policy should not hold that an action that comprises a worthy goal should not be performed. This is the best description of choice D.

The other choices do not accurately describe the assumption made in the editorial:

A is not relevant to the argument. The editorial does not discuss the inconsistency of a legislator's actions.

B is not relevant to the argument. The editorial does not discuss the long-run effects of educational policy.

C is not relevant to the argument. The editorial does not suggest that the goal of increasing spending on education is not morally good.

E is not relevant to the argument. The editorial does not discuss the views of members of other political parties.

Therefore, the correct answer is D.
