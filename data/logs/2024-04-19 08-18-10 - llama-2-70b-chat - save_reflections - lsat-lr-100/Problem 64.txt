## Get Reflection:
  Action: Answer(E)

Explanation:
The argument assumes that the shedding of tears is the cause of the reduction of emotional stress, without considering the possibility that other factors, such as the release of endorphins or the act of expressing emotions, may also play a role in reducing stress. Therefore, the argument is vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it takes for granted that because certain substances (tears) are present whenever a condition (emotional stress) occurs, those substances are a cause of that condition.

Choice E accurately describes this flaw in the argument. The argument assumes that the shedding of tears is the sole cause of the reduction of emotional stress, without considering other possible factors that may contribute to this effect. Therefore, choice E is the best answer.

The correct answer is E.

Reflection:
I incorrectly answered the question because I misunderstood the argument and the correct answer choice. I chose answer B, thinking that the argument was confusing a necessary condition with a sufficient condition. However, the correct answer is E, as the argument takes for granted that the shedding of tears is the sole cause of the reduction of emotional stress, without considering other possible factors.

In the future, I will be more careful in my analysis of the argument and the answer choices, and consider all the possible flaws in the argument before selecting an answer. I will also make sure to read the question stem carefully and provide my answer in the correct format.
