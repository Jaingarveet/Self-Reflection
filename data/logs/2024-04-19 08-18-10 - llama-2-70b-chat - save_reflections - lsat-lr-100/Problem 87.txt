## Get Reflection:
  Action: Answer("C")

Explanation:
The argument concludes that support group meetings do not help patients with disease T live longer. However, choice C states that the members of the group that attended weekly support group meetings lived 2 years longer, on average, than the members of the other group. This information directly contradicts the conclusion and suggests that attending support group meetings may indeed have a positive effect on the lifespan of patients with disease T. Therefore, choice C most seriously weakens the argument.

Error Keywords:
 - Conclusion contradiction
 - Average lifespan
 - Attending support group meetings

Solution:
The argument is based on the premise that support group meetings do not help patients with disease T live longer. However, choice C provides evidence that the members of the group who attended weekly support group meetings lived longer than the members of the other group. This evidence contradicts the premise and weakens the argument.

Instructions:
1. Read the argument carefully and understand the conclusion.
2. Identify the evidence provided in choice C.
3. Analyze the relationship between the evidence and the conclusion.
4. Determine if the evidence contradicts the conclusion.
5. Choose the answer that most seriously weakens the argument.

Advice:
 - Always read the argument carefully and understand the conclusion.
 - Always identify the evidence provided in each choice.
 - Always analyze the relationship between the evidence and the conclusion.
 - Always determine if the evidence contradicts the conclusion.
 - Always choose the answer that most seriously weakens the argument.
 - Remember that attending support group meetings may have a positive effect on the lifespan of patients with disease T.
