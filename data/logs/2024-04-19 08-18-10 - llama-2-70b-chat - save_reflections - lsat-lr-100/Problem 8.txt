## Get Reflection:
  Action: Answer(E)

Explanation:
The argument assumes that the correlation between high-fther diets and low colon cancer rates is causal, with fther consumption being the sole factor responsible for the difference. However, this overlooks the possibility that other substances in foods containing fther may also play a role in preventing colon cancer. Choice E acknowledges this by stating that foods containing fther also contain other substances that tend to prevent colon cancer. Therefore, it is not just the fther itself that is responsible for the reduced cancer risk, but also other components of fther-rich foods. This weakens the argument's conclusion that insufficient consumption of fther causes colon cancer.

Error Keywords:
- Oversimplification
- Ignores other factors
- Insufficient evidence

Solution:
1. Identify the correlation presented in the argument.
2. Consider alternative explanations for the correlation.
3. Evaluate the argument's conclusion in light of these alternative explanations.

Instructions:
1. Read the argument carefully and identify the correlation presented.
2. Consider the possibility of other factors contributing to the correlation.
3. Evaluate the argument's conclusion in light of these other factors.
4. If the argument overlooks other factors that could contribute to the correlation, identify them and explain how they weaken the argument's conclusion.
5. Choose the answer that best describes the flaw in the argument.

Advice:
- Always consider alternative explanations for a correlation.
- Be aware of the possibility of oversimplification in arguments.
- Look for evidence that supports or weakens an argument's conclusion.
- Consider the implications of other factors that may be relevant to the argument.
