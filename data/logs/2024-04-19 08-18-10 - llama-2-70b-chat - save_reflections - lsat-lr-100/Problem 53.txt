## Get Reflection:
  The reasoning in Robinson's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it:

B: gives reasons that do not address the point made in Wexell's argument.

Robinson's argument focuses on the fact that the museum's purchase of props and costumes allows them to be displayed and made available to the public, but this does not address Wexell's argument that the items have no artistic significance outside the context of a performance. Robinson's argument does not provide any reasons to refute Wexell's claim that the items are not artistically significant, and instead, it changes the subject by discussing the availability of the items to the public. Therefore, Robinson's argument does not effectively counter Wexell's argument, and it is vulnerable to criticism on this grounds.

Action: Answer("B")

Reflection:
I incorrectly answered the question because I misunderstood the argument presented by Robinson. I thought that Robinson was arguing that the museum did not waste its money because the display of the props and costumes is the only way to make them available to the public, and I focused my answer on the fact that there are other ways to make the items available to the public. However, upon re-reading the passage, I realized that Robinson's argument is actually focused on the fact that the museum's purchase of the props and costumes allows them to be displayed and made available to the public, regardless of their artistic significance. Therefore, the correct answer is B, as Robinson's argument does not address Wexell's point that the items have no artistic significance outside the context of a performance.

In the future, I will make sure to carefully read and understand the arguments presented in the passage before answering the question. I will also pay closer attention to the specific criticisms of the argument and ensure that my answer addresses the specific weaknesses of the argument.
