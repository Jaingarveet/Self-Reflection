## Get Reflection:
  Action: Answer("B")

Explanation:
The correct answer is choice B: The great costs of new recycling projects would prevent other pollution-reducing projects from being undertaken.

The mayor claims that new recycling projects would be counterproductive to the goal of minimizing overall environmental damage. This apparent inconsistency can be resolved if the costs of implementing new recycling projects would prevent the city from undertaking other projects that would reduce pollution. Choice B provides a plausible explanation for why the mayor might hold this position.

The other choices do not resolve the inconsistency:

* Choice A is not relevant to the mayor's claim. Even if the vehicles that pick up materials for recycling create less pollution than incineration, this does not explain why new recycling projects would be counterproductive.
* Choice C does not address the mayor's claim that new recycling projects would be counterproductive. The fact that the city has nearly exhausted its landfill space and must incinerate much of its garbage does not explain why recycling would be counterproductive.
* Choice D does not resolve the inconsistency. While more recycling might give industries in the mayor's city a greater incentive to use recycled materials, this does not explain why new recycling projects would be counterproductive.
* Choice E is not relevant to the mayor's claim. The fact that people who recycle might feel less justified in consuming more than they need does not explain why new recycling projects would be counterproductive.

Therefore, the correct answer is choice B.
