## Get Reflection:
  Action: Answer("C")

Explanation:
The correct answer is C: Only when a reduction of populations of endangered species by commercial development has been found should regulation be implemented to prevent further damage.

The Figorian Wildlife Commission is calling for regulation to protect wildlife, but the Figorian Development Commission argues that Figorian wetland development would not affect wildlife and is necessary for growth. Option C suggests that regulation should only be implemented after damage has been done, which means that the Figorian Development Commission's position would be supported.

The other options do not support the Figorian Development Commission's position:

A: National resources should be regulated by international agreement when wildlife is endangered. This principle would support the Figorian Wildlife Commission's call for regulation to protect wildlife, as it suggests that international agreements should be in place to regulate national resources when wildlife is endangered.

B: The right of future generations to have wildlife preserved supersedes the economic needs of individual nations. This principle would also support the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position, as it suggests that the need to preserve wildlife for future generations is more important than economic needs.

D: Environment regulation must aim at preventing any further environmental damage and cannot allow for the different degrees to which different nations have already harmed the environment. This principle would not support either side, as it suggests that environmental regulation should focus on preventing further damage, but does not address the issue of past harm.

E: It is imprudent to allow further depletion of natural resources. This principle would support the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position, as it suggests that it is unwise to allow further depletion of natural resources.
