## Assistant 2:
Reflection: My previous answer was incorrect because I made a mistake in interpreting the clue about being 70 miles away from B, 3 hours before the end of the trip. This clue is crucial for determining the correct solution. 

Solution: 
Let's define the distance between A and B as 'x' miles. 

Kevin drives at 70 mph for the first leg of the journey, so the time taken for the first leg is:
Time = Distance / Speed = x / 70 hours

Since he immediately returns, the total time of the journey is twice this time: 
2 * (x / 70) = 2x / 70 hours

Three hours before the end of the trip, he was still on his way to B, and there were 70 miles left to B. This means 70 miles in 3 hours:
Distance = Speed * Time = 70 miles
Speed = Distance / Time = 70 / 3 = 23.33 mph

Now, we can find the time taken as follows:
Time = Distance / Speed = 70 / 23.33 = 3 hours

So, 3 hours before the end of an 11-hour trip, there were 3 hours left. Thus:
11 total hours - 3 hours left = 8 hours passed

Therefore, the time for the first leg is 8 hours, and we can calculate the distance between A and B:
x = Speed * Time = 70 * 8 = 560 miles

Answer: The distance between points A and B is 560 miles.
