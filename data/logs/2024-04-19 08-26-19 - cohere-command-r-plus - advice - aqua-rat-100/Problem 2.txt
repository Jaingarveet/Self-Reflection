## Assistant 2:
Reflection: I made a careless error in my previous attempt. I calculated the difference in averages correctly but then added, instead of subtracted, this value from the new average to find the weight of the heavy-duty truck. Correcting this mistake should lead to the right answer.

Thought: 
Let X be the weight of the heavy-duty truck.
The average weight of the 10 vehicles increased by 2.6 tons, so the new average = 12.2 tons + 2.6 tons = 14.8 tons.
Thus, the total weight of the 11 vehicles = 14.8 tons * 11 = 162.8 tons.
Subtracting the total weight of the original 10 vehicles:
X + 162.8 tons - 122 tons = 14.8 tons
X = 40.8 tons
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
