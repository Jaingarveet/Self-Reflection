## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Advice:
- Read the question carefully and identify the given information and the goal.
- Draw a diagram if it helps visualize the problem.
- Break down the problem into smaller steps to avoid confusion.
- Pay attention to keywords like "midpoint" and their geometric meanings.
- Double-check your calculations and ensure you're performing the correct mathematical operations.
## Assistant 2:
Reflection: I made a mistake in interpreting the given information. I incorrectly assumed that point R was the midpoint of the line segment ST, when in fact, it is point U. This incorrect assumption led me to choose the wrong formula and calculate an inaccurate result. To solve this problem correctly, I should have recognized that point U, being the midpoint of ST, divides ST into two equal segments. 

Thought: 
Given that U is the midpoint of ST, the line segments SU and UT are equal in length. 
Let's denote the length of SU (and UT) as "x."
We know that ST = 22, and since U is the midpoint, we can write:
x + x = 22
2x = 22
x = 11

Now, to find the length of RU, we can use the given length of RT (which is 17) and subtract the length of UT (which is 11):
RU = RT - UT
RU = 17 - 11
RU = 6

So, the correct answer is 6 units.
Action: Answer("A")
