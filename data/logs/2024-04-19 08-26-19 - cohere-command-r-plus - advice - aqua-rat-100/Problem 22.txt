## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: Alex and Jacob works at a toy shop that make toys. Alex takes 7 hours to make a toy, and Jacob takes 9 hours to make a toy. During a month, both of them makes 35 toys in total. If both of them have worked for almost similar number of hours how many toys have been prepared by Jacob?
Choices:
  A: 15
  B: 16
  C: 17
  D: 18
  E: 19
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Advice:
 - Read the question carefully and identify the given rates, total work, and constraints. 
 - Calculate the total hours worked by each person based on their rates. 
 - Use the constraint that they worked for almost the same number of hours to set up an equation. 
 - Solve the equation for the unknown number of toys made by Jacob. 
 - Always double-check your calculations and the constraints provided in the question.
## Assistant 2:
Reflection: I made a mistake in understanding the constraint that Alex and Jacob worked for almost the same number of hours. To make their hours 'almost equal', the difference between their individual hours should be minimized. 

Now, let's calculate their individual hours: 
- Alex: 7 hours/toy * 35 toys = 245 hours
- Jacob: 9 hours/toy * [number of toys] = [number of hours] 

For their hours to be almost equal, the difference between their hours should be minimized: 
 |245 - [number of hours for Jacob]| should be minimized 

This means that Jacob's hours should be very close to 245, and with the given options, it turns out that 8 hours/toy yields a value very close to 245: 
9 hours/toy * 17 toys = 153 hours 

Therefore, Jacob made 17 toys. 

Let's now double-check the difference in their working hours: 
 |245 - (9 * 17)| = |245 - 153| = 92 - 153 = -61 

So, the correct answer is 'C: 17'.
