## Assistant 2:
Reflection: I made a careless mistake in my previous attempt. I correctly set up the equation but made an error in solving it. I should have been more careful in performing the calculations and double-checked my answer. For future questions, I will be more meticulous and thorough in my calculations to avoid such errors.

Thought: 
Let M be Meenu's weight.
She said, "I weigh 29 kgs plus half of my weight," which can be written as:
M = 29 + M/2

Now, solving for M:
2M = 29 + M
2M - M = 29
M = 29 kg

So, Meenu weighs 29 kgs.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
