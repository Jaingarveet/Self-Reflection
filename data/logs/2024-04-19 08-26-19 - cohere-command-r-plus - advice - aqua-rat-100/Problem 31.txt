## Assistant 2:
Reflection: I made a mistake in calculating the total number of microwave ovens sold. The correct calculation is:
Total number of ovens = (42 * 12) + (20 * 10) = 740

Average over 22 months = 740 / 22 = 33.6, which rounds to 34

So, the correct answer is D: 34.
Action: Answer("D")

Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
