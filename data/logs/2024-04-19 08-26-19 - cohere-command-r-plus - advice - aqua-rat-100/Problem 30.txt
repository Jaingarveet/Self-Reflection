- Be mindful of common misconceptions and errors, such as confusing time intervals with total time.
## Assistant 2:
Reflection: I made a mistake in interpreting the question. I incorrectly assumed that Roy would take the first tablet immediately, but the question doesn't specify that. Instead, I should calculate the total time from the moment Roy starts taking the first tablet to the moment he takes the last one.

Answer Interpretation: To consume 5 tablets, Roy needs to wait for 4 intervals of 15 minutes each. So, the total time is (4 x 15) minutes = 60 minutes.

Action: Answer("E")
## Result:
Agent Answer: E
Correct Answer: E
