- Read the problem carefully and identify the given values, such as cost price, desired profit, and discount.
- Understand the concept of markup and discount: Markup increases the price, while discount decreases it.
- Practice solving equations with variables to find unknown values.
- Double-check your calculations and ensure you have considered all the necessary steps.
- Pay attention to units and percentages, and apply them correctly in your calculations.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Cost Price (CP) = Rs. 1200
Desired Profit = 20%
Discount = 20%

First, we calculate the profit margin that the seller wants to make. Since he wants to make a 20% profit, the Cost Price * Profit/100 = 1200 * 20/100 = Rs. 240

So, the Selling Price (SP) without discount = CP + Profit = 1200 + 240 = Rs. 1440

Now, we calculate the price after offering a 20% discount. Discount/100 * SP = 20/100 * 1440 = Rs. 288

SP after discount = SP without discount - Discount = 1440 - 288 = Rs. 1152

Therefore, the price at which Karan should mark the sewing machine is Rs. 1152 more than the CP.

Calculation for the correct answer:
Required Price = CP + CP * 20/100 + CP * 20/100 = 1200 * [1 + 20/100 + 20/100] = 6 * 1200/5 = Rs. (6 * 1200)/5 = Rs. 1440

So, the final answer is B.
Action: Answer("B")
