Question: A car is being driven, in a straight line and at a uniform speed, towards the base of a vertical tower. The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower?
Choices:
  A: 5(√3 + 1)
  B: 6(√3 + √2)
  C: 7(√3 – 1)
  D: 8(√3 – 2)
  E: None of these

## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Let $d$ be the distance from the car to the base of the tower when the angle of elevation is $45^\circ$. Then the distance from the car to the top of the tower is $d + x$, where $x$ is the height of the tower.

Using trigonometry, we can set up the equation:
$(d + x) / d = \tan(60^\circ) / \tan(45^\circ)$

Simplifying this equation, we get:
$x = d(\sqrt{3} - 1)$

Differentiating with respect to time, we get:
$dx / dt = v$
where $v$ is the speed of the car.

Setting $dx / dt = v$ and solving for $d$, we get:
$d = vt$

Now, we can find the time $t$ it will take for the car to reach the base of the tower:
$x = vt(\sqrt{3} - 1)$
$t = x / v(\sqrt{3} - 1)$

Plugging in the values, we get:
$t = (\sqrt{3} + 1) minutes$.

Therefore, the car will reach the base of the tower after $5(\sqrt{3} + 1)$ minutes more.

So, the correct answer is $A: 5(\sqrt{3} + 1)$.
Action: Answer("A")
