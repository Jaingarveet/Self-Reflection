## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: Amy is organizing her bookshelves and finds that she has 10 different types of books. She then codes each book with either a single letter or a pair of two different letters. If each type of book is uniquely represented by either a single letter or pair of letters, what is the smallest number of letters Amy will need to create the codes for all 10 types of books? (Assume the order of letters in a pair does not matter.)
Choices:
  A: 3
  B: 4
  C: 5
  D: 10
  E: 20
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Advice:
 - Focus on simplicity and efficiency in your solution. 
 - Look for patterns and simple systems that can be used for coding. 
 - Avoid unnecessary calculations and overcomplication. 
 - Double-check your calculations and ensure they align with the problem's constraints.
## Assistant 2:
Reflection: My previous answer was incorrect because I misunderstood the prompt and tried to use a single letter for each book, which was not possible with 10 unique types.

Correct solution:
The minimum number of letters needed is 5:
- We can use a, b, c, d, and e as single letters for 5 types of books.
- For the remaining 5 types, we can create pairs without duplicates: ab, ac, ad, ae, and bc.
- This way, each book type is represented by either a single letter or a unique pair, for a total of 10 codes using a minimum of 5 letters.

Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
