## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Advice:
- Understand the properties of geometric shapes and how they transform. 
- Pay attention to the units in the problem and ensure they are consistent throughout your calculations. 
- Be careful with square roots and exponents; they are easily confused. 
- Double-check your calculations and ensure you are solving for the correct variable.
## Assistant 2:
Reflection: I made a mistake in my previous attempt. I correctly found the area of the rectangle and calculated the side length of the square, but I chose the wrong answer choice. I should have chosen Answer("C") instead of Answer("D").

Thought: 
The area of the rectangle = length * breadth = 27 * 17 = 459 sq. cm.
The side of the square = sqrt(459) = 21.42 cm.
The closest value is 22 cm.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
