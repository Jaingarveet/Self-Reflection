## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
To guarantee a profit of at least $626,400, the revenue from sales must be at least $626,400 more than the production costs. 

Production cost per year = $110 x 420 x 12 = $554,400

Selling price - Production cost = $626,400
Selling price = $1,180,800

The minimum selling price per component is $1,180,800 / 420 / 12 = $280.
Action: Answer("E")
## Result:
Agent Answer: E
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
