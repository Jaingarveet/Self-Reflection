## Assistant 2:
Reflection: I made an error in interpreting the variable values in the equation. To find the correct answer, I need to consider the correct values for the number of sharpeners and their cost difference.

Thought: 
Let's assume Jack bought 'x' number of white sharpeners and the rest ('8-x') in brown.
The cost of each white sharpener = 1 rupee more than each brown sharpener.

Equation: 
100 = (x * [cost of white sharpener]) + ((8-x) * [cost of white sharpener - 1])

Now, we can plug in different values for 'x' to find the correct answer:
- For x = 5: 
100 = (5 * 11) + (3 * 10) = 55 + 30 = 85, which is not equal to 100.

- For x = 6: 
100 = (6 * 11) + (2 * 10) = 66 + 20 = 86, which is not equal to 100.

- For x = 7: 
100 = (7 * 11) + (1 * 10) = 77 + 10 = 87, which is not equal to 100.

- For x = 8: 
100 = (8 * 11) + (0 * 10) = 88, which is not equal to 100.

- For x = 9: 
100 = (9 * 11) + (8-x) * (11-1)
100 = (9 * 11) + (0 * 10)
100 = 99

So, the correct answer is 9 white sharpeners and 8 brown sharpeners.
Action: Answer("B")
