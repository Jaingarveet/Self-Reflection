Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully to identify the correct variables and their relationships. 
 - Pay attention to signs and directions (addition, subtraction, etc.). 
 - Double-check your equation setup and ensure it aligns with the problem's logic. 
 - Practice solving similar problems to improve your understanding and accuracy. 
 - Remember that savings are subtracted from income, not added to expenses.
## Assistant 2:
Reflection: I made a mistake in interpreting the word "saves." I added the savings to the expenses, assuming it meant "total spending." Instead, I should have subtracted the savings from the unknown income to find the expenses.

Correct solution:
Let X be the monthly income.
Monthly savings = 12.5% of income = 0.125X
Monthly expenses = Rs. 3500
Thus, X - 0.125X = 3500
0.875X = 3500
X = 3500 / 0.875 = Rs. 4000

Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
