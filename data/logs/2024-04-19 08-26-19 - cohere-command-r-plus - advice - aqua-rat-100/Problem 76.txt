You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

## Assistant 2:
Reflection: I made a mistake in simplifying the expression for x. I incorrectly assumed that I could combine the square root with the other terms inside the square root, which is not valid. Instead, I should've kept the expression as it was and proceeded to find the range of values for x by inspecting the numerator and denominator separately.

Thought: 
First, I'll simplify the expression for x:
(n^2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16) / (n + 4√n + 4)

Now, I'll find the range of values for x by considering the numerator and denominator separately:
Numerator (N):
N = n^2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16

Since we have 36 ≤ n ≤ 72, we can find the range of values for N by plugging in the minimum and maximum values of n:
N(min) = 36^2 + 2√36(36 + 4) + 16 ≈ 1676
N(max) = 72^2 + 2√72(72 + 4) + 16 ≈ 5776

So, we have 1676 < N < 5776.

Denominator (D):
D = n + 4√n + 4

Again, plugging in the minimum and maximum values of n:
D(min) = 36 + 4√36 + 4 ≈ 88
D(max) = 72 + 4√72 + 4 ≈ 164

So, we have 88 < D < 164.

Now, to find the range of x, I'll divide the range of N by the range of D:
1676/164 < x < 5776/88

Simplifying the fractions:
20.95 < x < 65.63

So, the correct answer is B: 23 < x < 58.
Action: Answer("B")
