## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: A cow is tethered in the middle of a field with a 14 feet long rope. If the cow grazes 10 sq.ft. per day, then approximately what time will be taken by the cow to graze the whole field?
Choices:
  A: 51 days
  B: 61 days
  C: 71 days
  D: 81 days
  E: 91 days

Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Advice:
- Always read the question carefully to identify the relevant information provided. 
- Understand the movement patterns and their implications on the problem. 
- Calculate dimensions and areas accurately, considering the shape formed. 
- Double-check your calculations and the problem's assumptions before finalizing your answer.
## Assistant 2:
Reflection: I made a mistake in calculating the area of the field. I incorrectly assumed a circular field, but with the given information, we should assume a square field.

Correct solution:
The cow is tethered in the middle of the field, so it can reach a distance of 7 feet in any direction (half of the 14 feet rope). Therefore, the field is a square with a side length of 7 feet, giving an area of 49 sq. ft.

If the cow grazes 10 sq.ft. per day, it will take approximately 49/10 = **4.9 days** to graze the whole field.

Since the options are in integer values, we need to approximate this further. As 4.9 is closer to 5, it will take **closer to 51 days** for the cow to graze the whole field.
