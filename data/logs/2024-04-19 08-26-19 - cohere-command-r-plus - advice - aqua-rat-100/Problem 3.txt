## Assistant 2:
Reflection: I made a mistake in my previous attempt. Let's break the problem down step by step:

First, we find the dimensions of the rectangle. After trimming 4 feet from one side of the square, the rectangle has a width ($w$) that is 4 feet less than its length ($l$). We know that the area of the rectangle is equal to twice the area of one triangle, or $70 \times 2 = 140$ square feet. Using the formula for the area of a rectangle, we can set up the equation $lw = 140$.

Next, we can substitute $w = l - 4$ into the equation and simplify:
$(l - 4)l = 140$
$l^2 - 4l - 140 = 0$

By factoring, we can solve for $l$:
$(l - 10)(l + 14) = 0$
So, $l = 10$ or $l = -14$. 

Since length cannot be negative, $l = 10$. 

Now that we know the length of one side of the square, we can find its perimeter. The perimeter of the square is $4l = 4 \times 10 = \boxed{40}$ feet. 

I made a mistake in my previous attempt by incorrectly calculating the side length of the square. I should have paid closer attention to the geometric properties and ensured that I applied the formulas correctly. For future reference, I should carefully check my calculations and equations to avoid such errors.
