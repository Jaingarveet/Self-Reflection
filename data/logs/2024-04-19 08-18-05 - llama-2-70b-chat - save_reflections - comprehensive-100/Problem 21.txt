## Get Reflection:
  Action: Answer("D")

Explanation:
I apologize for the mistake in my previous response. I misunderstood the format of the answer and did not provide it in the correct way.

The correct answer is indeed D: Rottweilers and Manx are both featured on day 5.

The reasoning is as follows:

* Greyhounds are featured on day 1, so they cannot be featured on day 5.
* Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1, so they cannot be featured on day 5.
* Rottweilers cannot be featured on day 7, so they must be featured on day 5.
* Manx cannot be featured on day 7, as stated in the question, so they must be featured on day 5.

Therefore, option D is the correct answer.

I apologize for any confusion caused by my previous response, and I hope this clears up any confusion.
