## Get Reflection:
  Explanation:
I made a mistake in my conversion from inches to miles.
I incorrectly divided 1 inch by 40 miles instead of multiplying by 40 miles.
This resulted in an incorrect answer of 200 miles instead of 800 miles.
Error Keywords:
- Conversion error
- Unit conversion error
- Multiplication error

Solution:
Let's convert the length of the road from inches to miles.
1/4 inch represents an actual distance of 10 miles.
So, 1 inch represents an actual distance of 40 miles.
Now, we can convert 20 inches to miles:
20 inches = 20 x 40 = 800 miles

Instructions:
1. Identify the conversion factor between inches and miles.
2. Convert 1 inch to miles using the conversion factor.
3. Multiply the length of the road in inches by the conversion factor to get the actual distance in miles.
4. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.
5. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
6. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.

Advice:
- Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
- Always use the correct conversion factors when converting units.
- Always double-check your calculations, especially when working with different units.
- Remember that multiplication is commutative, meaning the order of the factors does not change the result.
