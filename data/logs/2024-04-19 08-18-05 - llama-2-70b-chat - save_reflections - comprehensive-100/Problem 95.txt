## Get Reflection:
  Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I confused the inferior mesenteric vein with the superior mesenteric vein.
The gap in my knowledge was in the anatomy of the veins of the abdominal cavity.
Error Keywords:
- Confusion
- Mixed up
- Anatomy
Solution:
The inferior vena cava is a large vein that carries deoxygenated blood from the lower body to the right atrium of the heart.
The inferior mesenteric vein is a tributary of the inferior vena cava.
The right suprarenal vein drains directly into the inferior vena cava.
Instructions:
1. Review the anatomy of the veins of the abdominal cavity.
2. Identify the tributaries of the inferior vena cava.
3. Recognize that the right suprarenal vein drains directly into the inferior vena cava.
4. Choose the answer that matches the correct information.
