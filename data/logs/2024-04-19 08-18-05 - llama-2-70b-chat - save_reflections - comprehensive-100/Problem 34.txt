## Get Reflection:
  Action: Answer("E")

Explanation:
The argument requires assuming that currently, most Acme employees have a commute of less than 30 minutes. The fact that most employees cannot afford housing within a 30-minute commute of Ocean View implies that their current commute is less than 30 minutes. Therefore, option E is the best answer.

Error Keywords:

* Assumption
* Commute
* Affordability

Solution:
1. Identify the argument: The chairperson of Acme Corporation has decided to move the company from its current location in Milltown to Ocean View.
2. Identify the conclusion: Most Acme employees will have a commute of more than 30 minutes once the company has moved.
3. Identify the premises: Most Acme employees cannot afford housing within a 30-minute commute of Ocean View.
4. Identify the missing premise: Currently, most Acme employees have a commute of less than 30 minutes.
5. Choose the answer that completes the argument: Option E states that Acme's move to Ocean View will not be accompanied by a significant pay raise for Acme employees. This implies that the employees' current commute is less than 30 minutes, as they cannot afford housing within a 30-minute commute of Ocean View.
