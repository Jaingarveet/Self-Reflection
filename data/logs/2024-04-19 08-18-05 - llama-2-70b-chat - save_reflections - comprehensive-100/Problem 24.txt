## Get Reflection:
  Explanation:
I made a mistake in my reasoning and answer.
I incorrectly assumed that Nina's report must be given on Wednesday, which led me to eliminate certain possibilities.
I also failed to consider the possibility that Olivia could give a morning report on Monday.
Error Keywords:
- Logic error
- Reasoning error
- Assumptions
Solution:
Let's break down the problem step by step:
1. Exactly six students will give individual oral reports.
2. Exactly two reports will be given each day.
3. Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report, so George will give a morning report on Tuesday.
4. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report, so they must give morning reports.
5. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day, Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
6. Since Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, we need to find the morning reports for Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
7. Olivia can give a morning report on Monday, and Robert can give a morning report on Wednesday.
8. George can give a morning report on Tuesday.
9. Helen can give a morning report on Wednesday.
10. Irving can give a morning report on Monday.
Instructions:
1. Identify the students who cannot give afternoon reports.
2. Identify the students who must give reports on certain days.
3. Identify the students who can give morning reports on each day.
4. Work step-by-step through your reasoning to find the morning reports for each day.
5. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
6. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
