## Get Reflection:
  Action: Answer("B")

Explanation:
The correct answer is B: The historical and social circumstances of a culture can play an important role in the development of that culture's values.

The critics discussed in the second paragraph argue that the values of non-Western cultures cannot be understood if they are studied solely from within the perspective of Western culture. They claim that the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in the second version of multicultural education are still identifiably Western and value-laden. Therefore, they would agree with option B, which states that the historical and social circumstances of a culture can play an important role in the development of that culture's values. This option aligns with the critics' argument that understanding the historical and social context of a culture is essential to understanding its values.

The other options do not align with the critics' argument. Option A states that members of a culture with different values cannot understand the social and historical circumstances that give rise to a culture's values. Option C states that it is impossible for one culture to successfully study another culture unless it does so from more than one cultural perspective. While this option may be related to the critics' argument, it is not the same as saying that the historical and social circumstances of a culture can play an important role in the development of its values. Option D states that genuine understanding of another culture is impossible unless that culture shares the same cultural values. This option is not supported by the passage, as the critics argue that understanding can be achieved by adopting the perspectives and methods of the cultures studied, even if they are different from Western values. Option E states that the values of liberalism cannot be adequately understood if we approach them solely through the methods of Western science. While this option may be related to the critics' argument, it is not directly addressed in the passage.
