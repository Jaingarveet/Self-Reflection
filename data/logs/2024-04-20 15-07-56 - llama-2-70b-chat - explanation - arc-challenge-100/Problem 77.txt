Question: Sheep Challenge Evolution A species of sheep lives on the Scottish island of Hirta. Hirta has plenty of grass for the sheep to eat, and no natural predators of the sheep live on the island. Some sheep have dark wool, and some have light wool. The sheep with dark wool tend to be much larger and stronger than the sheep with light wool. However, researchers have found that in the last 20 years, the sheep with light wool have increased in number. Usually, strength and size help animals survive and breed. A new sheep predator is introduced to the island. Which change to the sheep population will most likely occur first?
Choices:
  A: a decrease in the population of sheep with dark wool
  B: a decrease in the population of sheep with light wool
  C: an increase in the population of sheep with dark wool
  D: an increase in the population of sheep with light wool

Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I misunderstood the relationship between the sheep's traits and their ability to survive and breed. I thought that the larger and stronger sheep with dark wool would have an advantage in the presence of a new predator, but in reality, the opposite is true. The sheep with light wool, which are smaller and weaker, will be better able to escape the predator and survive, leading to an increase in their population.
## Assistant 2:
  Action: Answer("D")

Explanation:
I have reflected on my previous answer and realized that I made a mistake. I misunderstood the relationship between the sheep's traits and their ability to survive and breed. In the presence of a new predator, the smaller and weaker sheep with light wool will have an advantage because they can escape the predator more easily. Therefore, the correct answer is D: an increase in the population of sheep with light wool.
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
