Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I misunderstood the question stem. I thought the question was asking for an example of animal instinct, whereas it was actually asking for an exception.
## Assistant 2:
  Action: Answer("D")

Explanation:
I have reflected on my previous answer and realized that I misunderstood the question stem. The question is asking for an example of animal instinct, whereas I provided an example of animal behavior. Building nests is not an instinctive behavior, but rather a learned behavior that some animals acquire through experience and practice. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) building nests.
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: C
