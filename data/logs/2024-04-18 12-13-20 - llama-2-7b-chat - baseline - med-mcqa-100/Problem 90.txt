Question: At 34 weeks multigravida with previous 2 normal delivery has an unstable lie with the present pregnancy. It can be due to:
Choices:
  A: Oligohydramnios
  B: Placenta pre
  C: Pelvic tumor
  D: Uterine anomalies
## Assistant 2:
  Thought: The patient's unstable lie at 34 weeks of gestation with a previous history of two normal deliveries could be due to several possible causes.

Action: Answer("D") Uterine anomalies.

Explanation: Uterine anomalies, such as a bicornuate uterus or a unicornuate uterus, can cause an unstable lie in a pregnancy. These anomalies can lead to a decrease in the amount of amniotic fluid surrounding the fetus, which can cause the fetus to lie in an unstable position. Other possible causes of an unstable lie at this gestational age include placenta previa or oligohydramnios. However, pelvic tumors are less common and are unlikely to cause this symptom at this stage of pregnancy.
