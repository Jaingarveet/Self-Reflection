Question: In a solution the concentration of hydrogen ion (H+) is 1 x 10-6 moles/litre. The pH of the solution will be -
Choices:
  A: Three
  B: Six
  C: Nine
  D: Twelve
## Assistant 2:
  Thought: The pH of a solution is directly proportional to the concentration of hydrogen ions (H+) and inversely proportional to the concentration of hydroxide ions (OH-).
Action: Using the given concentration of hydrogen ions (H+), we can calculate the pH of the solution using the pH formula: pH = -log[H+].
pH = -log(1 x 10-6) = -6

Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
