Question: A ship leaks a large amount of oil near a coastal area. Which statement describes how the oil most likely will affect the coastal habitat?
Choices:
  A: Fish reproduction rates will increase.
  B: Water birds will be unable to use their wings.
  C: Water plants will be exposed to more sunlight.
  D: Coastal plants will have access to more nutrients.
## Assistant 2:
  Thought: 
When oil spills into coastal waters, it can harm marine life and affect their habitat. The oil can coat the feathers of water birds, making it difficult for them to fly or insulate themselves, and it can also suffocate or poison marine animals that come into contact with it. Oil slicks can also prevent sunlight from reaching water plants, which can affect their ability to undergo photosynthesis. Coastal plants, on the other hand, may not be directly affected by the oil spill, as they are not submerged in water.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
