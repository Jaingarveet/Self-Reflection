## System:
You are an expert in Science.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Question: A group of Canada geese left a Florida lake in the spring. The geese arrived at a Maine lake 2,000 km away in 40 days. If the geese traveled at a constant rate, how far did the geese travel on the first day?
Choices:
  A: 5 km
  B: 20 km
  C: 40 km
  D: 50 km
## Assistant 2:
  Thought: 
To solve this problem, we can use the formula d = rt, where d is the distance traveled, r is the rate (in this case, the constant rate at which the geese traveled), and t is the time (in this case, the time it took the geese to travel 2,000 km, which is 40 days).
We know that the geese traveled 2,000 km in 40 days, so we can set up the equation:
2,000 km = (constant rate) x 40 days
We can solve for the constant rate by dividing both sides by 40:
50 km/day = (constant rate)
Therefore, the geese traveled 50 km on the first day.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
