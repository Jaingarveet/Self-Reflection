## User 2:
Topic: Science
Question: Which process in plants is most similar to sexual reproduction in vertebrates?
Choices:
  A: cell division
  B: self-pollination
  C: cross-pollination
  D: seed development
## Assistant 2:
  Thought: 
Sexual reproduction in vertebrates involves the fusion of gametes (sex cells) to produce offspring with a unique combination of genetic traits. In plants, the process that most closely resembles this is cross-pollination. Cross-pollination involves the transfer of pollen from the male reproductive organ of one plant (the anther) to the female reproductive organ of another plant (the stigma). This results in the fusion of gametes (sperm and egg cells) and the production of offspring with a unique combination of genetic traits.
Action: Answer("C")
