# Model: gemini-1.0-pro | Agent: keywords | Exam: sat-math-100 | Problem 91 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:

Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")

Question: \begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|c||c|c|c|c|}\hline$n$ & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\\hline$f(n)$ & -2 & 1 & 4 & 7 \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}The table above shows some values of the linear function $f$. Which of the following defines $f$ ?
Choices:
  A: $f(n)=n-3$
  B: $f(n)=2 n-4$
  C: $f(n)=3 n-5$
  D: $f(n)=4 n-6$

Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Error Keywords:
 - Slope calculation error
 - Linear function analysis error
## Assistant 2:
I understand. I will carefully analyze the problem and my previous solution to ensure I provide the correct answer this time.
**Reflection:**
* **Error:** I made a mistake in calculating the slope of the linear function.
* **Solution:** I will double-check my calculations and ensure I use the correct formula for slope: (change in y) / (change in x).
* **Linear function analysis:** I will carefully examine the table of values to identify the pattern and determine the equation that best represents the relationship between n and f(n).
**Analysis:**
Looking at the table, we can see that the values of f(n) increase by 3 for every increase of 1 in n. This indicates a constant slope of 3.
**Answer:**
The equation that defines the linear function with a slope of 3 and a y-intercept of -5 is:
**f(n) = 3n - 5**
Therefore, the correct answer is **C: f(n) = 3n - 5**.
## Result:
Agent Answer: None
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
