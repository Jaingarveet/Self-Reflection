## Assistant 2:
I understand. I will try my best to answer the question correctly this time.
**Thought:**
* The line passes through the origin, which means both coordinates of a point on the line can be 0.
* If $(2, k)$ is on the line, then $k$ can be 0.
* If $(k, 32)$ is on the line, then $k$ can be 32.
* However, the question asks which of the following **could** be the value of $k$, not which **must** be the value of $k$.
* Therefore, both 0 and 32 are possible values of $k$.
**Action:**
Answer("A")
