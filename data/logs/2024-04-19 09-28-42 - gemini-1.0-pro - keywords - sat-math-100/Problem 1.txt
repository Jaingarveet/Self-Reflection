Question: $$h=-16 t^{2}+v t+k$$The equation above gives the height $h$, in feet, of a ball $t$ seconds after it is thrown straight up with an initial speed of $v$ feet per second from a height of $k$ feet. Which of the following gives $v$ in terms of $h, t$, and $k$ ?
Choices:
  A: $v=h+k-16 t$
  B: $v=\frac{h-k+16}{t}$
  C: $v=\frac{h+k}{t}-16 t$
  D: $v=\frac{h-k}{t}+16 t$

## Assistant 2:
I understand. I will try my best to answer the question correctly this time.
**Thought:**
The equation given is a quadratic equation in the form of $h = at^2 + bt + c$, where $a = -16$, $b = v$, and $c = k$. We need to find an expression for $v$ in terms of $h$, $t$, and $k$.
**Step 1: Rearrange the equation to isolate v.**
We can start by rearranging the equation to isolate $v$:
```
h = -16t^2 + vt + k
vt = h + 16t^2 - k
v = (h + 16t^2 - k) / t
```
**Step 2: Simplify the expression.**
We can simplify the expression by combining the constants:
```
v = (h + 16t^2 - k) / t
v = (h - k) / t + 16t
```
**Answer:**
Therefore, the expression that gives $v$ in terms of $h$, $t$, and $k$ is:
```
v = (h - k) / t + 16t
```
**Action:**
