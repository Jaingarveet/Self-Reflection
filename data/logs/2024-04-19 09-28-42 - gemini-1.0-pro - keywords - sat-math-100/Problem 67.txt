## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: Which of the following is an equation of a circle in the $x y$-plane with center $(0,4)$ and a radius with endpoint $\left(\frac{4}{3}, 5\right) ?$
Choices:
  A: $x^{2}+(y-4)^{2}=\frac{25}{9}$
  B: $x^{2}+(y+4)^{2}=\frac{25}{9}$
  C: $x^{2}+(y-4)^{2}=\frac{5}{3}$
  D: $x^{2}+(y+4)^{2}=\frac{3}{5}$

## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
I previously answered this question incorrectly because I did not correctly identify the center of the circle. I mistakenly used the endpoint of the radius as the center.
The correct center of the circle is $(0,4)$.
The radius of the circle is the distance between the center $(0,4)$ and the endpoint of the radius $\left(\frac{4}{3}, 5\right)$.
Using the distance formula, we find that the radius is $\sqrt{\left(\frac{4}{3}-0\right)^2+(5-4)^2}=\sqrt{\frac{16}{9}+1}=\sqrt{\frac{25}{9}}=\frac{5}{3}$.
Therefore, the equation of the circle is $(x-0)^2+(y-4)^2=\left(\frac{5}{3}\right)^2$, which simplifies to $x^2+(y-4)^2=\frac{25}{9}$.
Action: Answer("A")
