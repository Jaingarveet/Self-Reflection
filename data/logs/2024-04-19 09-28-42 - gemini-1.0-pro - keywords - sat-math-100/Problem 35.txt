## Assistant 2:
I understand. I will try my best to answer the question correctly this time.
**Thought:**
1. **Square both sides of the equation:**
$$\sqrt{4 x} = x - 3$$
$$4x = (x - 3)^2$$
2. **Expand the right side:**
$$4x = x^2 - 6x + 9$$
3. **Move all terms to one side:**
$$0 = x^2 - 10x + 9$$
4. **Factor the quadratic equation:**
$$0 = (x - 1)(x - 9)$$
5. **Solve for x:**
$$x = 1 \text{ or } x = 9$$
**Therefore, the values of x that satisfy the equation are 1 and 9.**
**Action: Answer("C")**
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: B
