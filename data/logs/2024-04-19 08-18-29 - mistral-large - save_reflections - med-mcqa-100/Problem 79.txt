## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I made an error in my calculation of the average gain in length over 4 years.
The gap in my knowledge was not in pediatrics but in basic arithmetic.
I knew the correct growth rate per year but made a calculation error.

Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Arithmetic error
 - Multiplication error

Solution:
The average growth rate for children between the ages of 2 and 5 is about 6 cm per year.
To find the average gain in length over 4 years, we need to multiply the growth rate per year by the number of years.
6 cm/year \* 4 years = 24 cm
However, the question asks for the answer in centimeters, not in years.
Therefore, we do not need to divide by the number of years.
The correct answer is 24 cm.

Instructions:
1. Identify the growth rate per year.
2. Identify the number of years.
3. Multiply the growth rate per year by the number of years.
4. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.
5. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
6. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.

Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them.
 - Always pay attention to the units of measurement in the question and answer choices.
