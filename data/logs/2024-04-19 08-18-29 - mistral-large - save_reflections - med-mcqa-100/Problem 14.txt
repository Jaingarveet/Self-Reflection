## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I confused the end products of anaerobic glycolysis with those of aerobic glycolysis.
The gap in my knowledge was in biochemistry, specifically in the differences between anaerobic and aerobic glycolysis.
I knew the correct process but mixed up the end products.
Error Keywords:
 - Confusion error
 - Biochemistry error
 - Anaerobic vs aerobic glycolysis error
Solution:
Anaerobic glycolysis, also known as fermentation, occurs in the absence of oxygen.
The end product of anaerobic glycolysis is 2 ATP (adenosine triphosphate) and 2 NAD (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide).
Instructions:
1. Identify the type of glycolysis being asked about (anaerobic or aerobic).
2. Recall the end products of anaerobic glycolysis.
3. Double-check that the end products are specific to anaerobic glycolysis.
4. Choose the answer that matches the correct end products.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your answer against your knowledge of the topic.
 - Remember that anaerobic glycolysis and aerobic glycolysis have different end products.
