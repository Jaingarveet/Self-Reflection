## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I confused the mode of inheritance with the type of disorder.
The gap in my knowledge was not in the biochemistry of the disorder but in the genetic basis of the disorder.
I knew the correct gene involved but made a mistake in identifying the mode of inheritance.

Error Keywords:
 - Mode of inheritance error
 - Genetic disorder error
 - Autosomal dominant error

Solution:
Hypophosphatemic Vitamin D Resistant Rickets is an X-linked dominant disorder caused by mutations in the PHEX gene.
The disorder is characterized by low levels of phosphate in the blood, leading to rickets and other bone abnormalities.
The disorder is inherited in an X-linked dominant manner, meaning that it affects both males and females but is more severe in males.

Instructions:
1. Identify the disorder in question.
2. Identify the gene involved in the disorder.
3. Identify the mode of inheritance of the disorder.
4. Identify the characteristics of the disorder.
5. Choose the answer that matches the mode of inheritance and characteristics of the disorder.
6. Double-check your answer to ensure accuracy.

Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your answer to ensure accuracy.
 - Remember that the mode of inheritance is a critical aspect of genetic disorders.
 - Be aware of the differences between autosomal and X-linked inheritance patterns.
 - Be aware of the differences between dominant and recessive inheritance patterns.
 - Be aware of the differences between different types of genetic disorders.
