## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I incorrectly identified the impression material that is elastic, sets by a chemical reaction, and is catalyzed by chloroplatinic acid.
The gap in my knowledge was in the specific properties of dental impression materials.
I confused the catalyst used in the setting reaction of Polyether with that of Poly vinyl siloxane.
Error Keywords:
 - Misidentification
 - Confusion
 - Catalyst
 - Impression material
Solution:
The impression material that is elastic, sets by a chemical reaction, and is catalyzed by chloroplatinic acid is Poly vinyl siloxane.
