Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I did not know the correct X-ray feature of pyloric stenosis.
The gap in my knowledge was in radiology, specifically in the interpretation of X-ray images.
I knew the definition of pyloric stenosis but was not familiar with its X-ray features.
Error Keywords:
 - Lack of knowledge
 - Misinterpretation of X-ray images
 - Incorrect choice selection
Solution:
Pyloric stenosis is a condition where the pylorus, the opening between the stomach and the small intestine, becomes narrowed or blocked.
The classic X-ray feature of pyloric stenosis is a "single bubble appearance," which is caused by the dilated stomach and the absence of gas in the distal small bowel.

4. Select the choice that matches the X-ray features of the condition.
5. If none of the choices match, choose the closest one.
6. Double-check your answer to ensure accuracy.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
