  I apologize for my mistake in the previous response. I mistakenly selected option A, "Honeycomb pattern," as the answer.

Upon reflection, I realized that I confused Type 2 etched enamel with another topic in dentistry. The correct answer for Type 2 etched enamel is actually option C, "Cobblestone pattern."

I will make sure to pay closer attention to the details and avoid confusion with similar terms in the future.
