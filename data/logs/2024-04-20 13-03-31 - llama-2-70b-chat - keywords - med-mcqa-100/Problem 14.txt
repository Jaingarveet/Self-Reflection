# Model: llama-2-70b-chat | Agent: keywords | Exam: med-mcqa-100 | Problem 14 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Medicine.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:

Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:

Subtopic: Biochemistry
Question: In anaerobic glycolysis, end product is -
Choices:
  A: 2 ATP + 2 NAD
  B: 2 ATP
  C: 2 ATP + 2 NADH
  D: 4 ATP + 2 FADH2
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Error Keywords:

* Confusion
* Metabolism
* Glycolysis
## Assistant 2:
  I apologize for my mistake in the previous answer. I seem to have confused the end products of glycolysis with those of cellular respiration.

Anaerobic glycolysis is the process by which glucose is converted into energy in the absence of oxygen. The end product of this process is 2 ATP and 2 NADH.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
Action: Answer("C")

Reflection:
I will make sure to differentiate between the end products of glycolysis and cellular respiration in the future. Additionally, I will review the steps and end products of each metabolic process to avoid confusion.
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
