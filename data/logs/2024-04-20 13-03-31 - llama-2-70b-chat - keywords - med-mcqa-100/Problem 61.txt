## Assistant 2:
  I apologize for my mistake in the previous response. Let's analyze the question again.
A seizure in a newborn is a medical emergency that requires immediate attention. The most common type of seizure in newborns is a tonic seizure. It is characterized by a sudden stiffening of the muscles, often accompanied by a cry or grunting sound.
Therefore, the answer is B: Tonic.

Reflection:
In my previous response, I think I was confused between clonic and tonic seizures. Clonic seizures are characterized by repetitive jerking movements, whereas tonic seizures are characterized by a sudden stiffening of the muscles. I mixed up the two and chose the wrong answer. To avoid this mistake in the future, I will make sure to carefully read the question and differentiate between the two types of seizures.
