## Assistant 2:
  I apologize for my previous mistake. Let's analyze the options again:

A. Oligohydramnios: This is a condition where there is a decrease in the amount of amniotic fluid surrounding the fetus. While it can cause fetal distress and other complications, it's not typically associated with an unstable lie.

B. Placenta previa: This is a condition where the placenta partially or completely covers the cervix. It can cause bleeding during pregnancy and delivery, but it doesn't typically cause an unstable lie.

C. Pelvic tumor: This is a rare condition that can cause an unstable lie, but it's not a common cause.

D. Uterine anomalies: This is the most likely cause of an unstable lie in a multigravida with previous normal deliveries. Uterine anomalies can cause the fetus to shift and change position, leading to an unstable lie.

Reflecting on my previous answer, I overlooked the possibility of uterine anomalies as the cause of an unstable lie. I misjudged the likelihood of this option, thinking it was less common than it actually is.

Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: B
