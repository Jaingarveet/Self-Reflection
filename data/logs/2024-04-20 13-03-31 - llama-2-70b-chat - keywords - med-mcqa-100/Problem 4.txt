## Assistant 2:
  Reflection:
I apologize for my mistake in the previous response. I mistakenly selected option 
A (100 mg iron + 500 mcg folic acid) as the correct answer.
Upon reflection, I realized that my answer was incorrect due to a lack of attention 
to detail. I misapplied my knowledge of the recommended daily intake of iron and 
folic acid. I relied too heavily on my memory instead of carefully reading the 
options and considering the context of the question.

Correct Answer:
The correct answer is option 
B (60 mg iron + 500 mcg folic acid).
According to the MCH (Maternal and Child Health) program, pregnant women should 
receive daily supplements containing 60 mg of iron and 500 mcg of folic acid to 
help prevent anemia and promote fetal development.

Action: Answer("B")
