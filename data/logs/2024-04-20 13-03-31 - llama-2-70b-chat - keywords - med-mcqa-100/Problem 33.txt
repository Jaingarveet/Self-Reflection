## System:
You are an expert in Medicine.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Error Keywords:

* Misunderstanding of the target antigen in cicatricial pemphigoid
* Mistaken belief about the binding of autoantibodies in the salt split skin technique
## Assistant 2:
  I apologize for my previous mistake. After reflecting on the question, I realized that my mistake was due to a misunderstanding of the target antigen in cicatricial pemphigoid. I mistakenly believed that the autoantibodies in the salt split skin technique bound to BP antigen 1 & 2, which is incorrect.

The correct answer is B: Epiligrin. In cicatricial pemphigoid, IgG autoantibodies target the epidermal basement membrane zone, specifically the epiligrin protein. The salt split skin technique is used to detect the presence of these autoantibodies, and it involves splitting the skin into two layers, followed by separation of the epidermal and dermal layers. The epidermal side of the split skin is then incubated with patient's serum, and the presence of IgG autoantibodies is detected by immunofluorescence staining.

Therefore, the answer is B: Epiligrin, as it is the target antigen of the autoantibodies in cicatricial pemphigoid that is bound by IgG on the epidermal side of the salt split skin technique.

Action: Answer("B")
