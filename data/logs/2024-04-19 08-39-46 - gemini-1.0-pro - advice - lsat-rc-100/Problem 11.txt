Topic: Law
Context: Music and literature, rivals among the arts, have not coexisted without intruding on each other's terrain. Ever since what we think of as "literature" developed out of the sounds of spoken, sung, and chanted art, writing bas aspired to the condition of music, in which fonn contnbutes significantly to content. Nowhere is this truer than in the African American tradition, whose music is often considered its greatest artistic achievement and one of the greatest contributions to North American art. But while many African American writers have used musicians and music as theme and metaphor in their writing, none had attempted to draw upon a musical genre as the structuring principle for an entire novel until Toni Morrison did so in her 1992 novel Jazz, a novel set in the Harlem section of New York City in 1926 . In Jazz, the connection to music is found not only in the novel's plot but, more strikingly, in the way in which the story is told. The narration slips easily from the third-person omniscience of the narrator's disembodied voice-which, though sensitive and sympathetic, claims no particular identity, gender, or immersion in specific social circumstances-to the first-person lyricism of key characters. But throughout these shifts, the narrator is both generous with the characters' voices and protective of his or her mastery over the narrative as a whole. On the one hand, the central characters are given the responsibility of relating their parts of the overarching story, but on the other hand, their sections are set offby quotation maIks, reminders that the narrator is allowing them to speak.. In this way, the narrative is analogous in structure to the playing of a jazz hand which intertwines its ensemble sound with the individuality of emhedded solo perfunnances. In jazz, composer and conductor Duke Ellington was the first to construct his compositions with his individual musicians and their unique "voices" in mind. Yet no matter how lengthy his musicians' improvisations, no matter how bold or inventive their solos might be, they always performed within the undeniable logic of the composer's frame-they always, in other words, performed as ifwith quotation marks ar01md their improvisations and solos. It is this same effect that Toni Morrison has achieved in Jazz, a literary rendering of an art of composition that Duke Ellington perfected around the time in which Jazz is set. In this novel, Morrison has found a way, paradoxically, to create the sense of an ensemble of characters improvising within the fixed scope of a carefully constructed collective narration. By simulating the style of a genius of music while exhibiting Morrison's own linguistic virtuosity, Jazz serves to redefine the very possibilities of narrative point of view.
Question: The author's assertion in lines 11-16 would be most called in 10 question if which one of the following were true?
Choices:
  A: Even a casual reading of Jazz makes it evident that the author has intentionally tried to simulate a style of jazz performance in the narration of the story.
  B: A small number of African American novelists writing earlier in the twentieth century sought to base the form of their work on the typical structme of blues music.
  C: All novels about nonliterary arts and artists appear as if their authors have tried to make their narrative styles reminiscent of the arts in question.
  D: Depending partly on whether or not it is read aloud, any novel can be found to be somewhat musical in nature.
  E: A smaller number of African American writers than of non-African American writers in North America have written novels whose plots and characters have to do with music.

## Self-Reflection
**My previous answer:** C
**The correct answer:** A
**My mistake:** I focused too much on the specific details of the passage about the connection between jazz and the novel *Jazz*, and I overlooked the broader point that the author was making about the relationship between music and literature.
**What I learned:** It is important to pay attention to the overall argument of a passage, not just the specific details. I also need to be careful not to make assumptions about the author's intentions.
## Answering the question
**Action: Answer("A")**
**Explanation:**
The author's assertion in lines 11-16 would be most called into question if it were true that even a casual reading of *Jazz* makes it evident that the author has intentionally tried to simulate a style of jazz performance in the narration of the story. This is because the author's assertion is that the connection between jazz and the novel is not immediately apparent, and that it is only through careful reading that the reader can appreciate the way in which the novel's structure and style reflect the improvisational nature of jazz.
The other answer choices are either irrelevant to the author's assertion or do not directly contradict it. For example, the fact that a small number of African American novelists writing earlier in the twentieth century sought to base the form of their work on the typical structure of blues music does not necessarily mean that the author of *Jazz* is doing the same thing. Similarly, the fact that all novels about nonliterary arts and artists appear as if their authors have tried to make their narrative styles reminiscent of the arts in question does not mean that the author of *Jazz* is doing so successfully. And the fact that depending partly on whether or not it is read aloud, any novel can be found to be somewhat musical in nature does not mean that the author of *Jazz* is intentionally trying to make the novel sound like jazz.
Therefore, the only answer choice that directly contradicts the author's assertion is A.
