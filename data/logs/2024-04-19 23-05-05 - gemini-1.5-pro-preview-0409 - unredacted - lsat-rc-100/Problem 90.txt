Topic: Law
Context: Music and literature, rivals among the arts, have not coexisted without intruding on each other's terrain. Ever since what we think of as "literature" developed out of the sounds of spoken, sung, and chanted art, writing bas aspired to the condition of music, in which fonn contnbutes significantly to content. Nowhere is this truer than in the African American tradition, whose music is often considered its greatest artistic achievement and one of the greatest contributions to North American art. But while many African American writers have used musicians and music as theme and metaphor in their writing, none had attempted to draw upon a musical genre as the structuring principle for an entire novel until Toni Morrison did so in her 1992 novel Jazz, a novel set in the Harlem section of New York City in 1926 . In Jazz, the connection to music is found not only in the novel's plot but, more strikingly, in the way in which the story is told. The narration slips easily from the third-person omniscience of the narrator's disembodied voice-which, though sensitive and sympathetic, claims no particular identity, gender, or immersion in specific social circumstances-to the first-person lyricism of key characters. But throughout these shifts, the narrator is both generous with the characters' voices and protective of his or her mastery over the narrative as a whole. On the one hand, the central characters are given the responsibility of relating their parts of the overarching story, but on the other hand, their sections are set offby quotation maIks, reminders that the narrator is allowing them to speak.. In this way, the narrative is analogous in structure to the playing of a jazz hand which intertwines its ensemble sound with the individuality of emhedded solo perfunnances. In jazz, composer and conductor Duke Ellington was the first to construct his compositions with his individual musicians and their unique "voices" in mind. Yet no matter how lengthy his musicians' improvisations, no matter how bold or inventive their solos might be, they always performed within the undeniable logic of the composer's frame-they always, in other words, performed as ifwith quotation marks ar01md their improvisations and solos. It is this same effect that Toni Morrison has achieved in Jazz, a literary rendering of an art of composition that Duke Ellington perfected around the time in which Jazz is set. In this novel, Morrison has found a way, paradoxically, to create the sense of an ensemble of characters improvising within the fixed scope of a carefully constructed collective narration. By simulating the style of a genius of music while exhibiting Morrison's own linguistic virtuosity, Jazz serves to redefine the very possibilities of narrative point of view.
Question: Each of the following excerpts from the passage exhibits the author's attitude toward the novel Jazz EXCEPT:
Choices:
  A: "...whose music is often considered its greatest artistic achievement and one of the greatest con1nbutions to North American art" (lines 8-10)
  B: "In Jazz, the connection to music is found not only in the novel's plot but, more strikingly, in the way in which the story is told" (lines 17-19)
  C: "The narration slips easily from the third-person omniscience of the narrator's disembodied voice ....." (lines 19-21)
  D: "... Morrison has found a way, paradoxically, to create the sense of an ensemble of characters improvising within the fixed scope ....." (lines 49-51)
  E: "By simulating the style of a genius of music while exhibiting Morrison's own linguistic virtuosity ..." (lines 52-54)

Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:**
I misinterpreted the question's intent. I focused on identifying excerpts that expressed an opinion about the novel's style or structure, overlooking the broader context of the author's attitude towards the novel and its connection to African American artistic achievement.
**Error Keywords:**
*   Misinterpretation 
*   Reading comprehension error
*   Focus on specifics over the broader context
## Solving the Problem
1.  **Reread the question:**  Focus on understanding the author's overall attitude towards the novel, not just specific stylistic elements.
2.  **Analyze each excerpt:** Evaluate how each excerpt contributes to the author's overall perspective on the novel's significance and connection to African American art.
3.  **Identify the outlier:** Look for the excerpt that does not express a positive or appreciative attitude towards the novel or its cultural context.
**Solution:**
Option A, while acknowledging the significance of African American music, does not directly express the author's attitude towards the novel *Jazz* itself. The other options highlight the novel's innovative structure, connection to music, and Morrison's skillful writing, all reflecting a positive evaluation.
## Instructions for Future Similar Problems
1.  **Carefully read the question and all answer choices.**
2.  **Identify the key focus:** Is it on the author's opinion, factual information, or a specific aspect of the text?
3.  **Analyze each answer choice in relation to the key focus.**
4.  **Eliminate options that are irrelevant or contradict the author's perspective.**
5.  **Choose the answer that best aligns with the author's overall attitude or the main point of the passage.** 
## General Advice
*   **Pay attention to context:** Consider the overall purpose and main ideas of the passage when interpreting specific excerpts.
*   **Read actively and critically:**  Engage with the text and question the author's intentions and perspectives.
*   **Develop strong reading comprehension skills:** Practice identifying main ideas, supporting details, and author's purpose in various texts.
*   **Improve vocabulary and understanding of literary devices:** This will enhance your ability to analyze complex texts and authorial choices.
