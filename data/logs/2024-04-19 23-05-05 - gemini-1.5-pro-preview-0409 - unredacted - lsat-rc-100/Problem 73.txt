Topic: Law
Context: Music and literature, rivals among the arts, have not coexisted without intruding on each other's terrain. Ever since what we think of as "literature" developed out of the sounds of spoken, sung, and chanted art, writing bas aspired to the condition of music, in which fonn contnbutes significantly to content. Nowhere is this truer than in the African American tradition, whose music is often considered its greatest artistic achievement and one of the greatest contributions to North American art. But while many African American writers have used musicians and music as theme and metaphor in their writing, none had attempted to draw upon a musical genre as the structuring principle for an entire novel until Toni Morrison did so in her 1992 novel Jazz, a novel set in the Harlem section of New York City in 1926 . In Jazz, the connection to music is found not only in the novel's plot but, more strikingly, in the way in which the story is told. The narration slips easily from the third-person omniscience of the narrator's disembodied voice-which, though sensitive and sympathetic, claims no particular identity, gender, or immersion in specific social circumstances-to the first-person lyricism of key characters. But throughout these shifts, the narrator is both generous with the characters' voices and protective of his or her mastery over the narrative as a whole. On the one hand, the central characters are given the responsibility of relating their parts of the overarching story, but on the other hand, their sections are set offby quotation maIks, reminders that the narrator is allowing them to speak.. In this way, the narrative is analogous in structure to the playing of a jazz hand which intertwines its ensemble sound with the individuality of emhedded solo perfunnances. In jazz, composer and conductor Duke Ellington was the first to construct his compositions with his individual musicians and their unique "voices" in mind. Yet no matter how lengthy his musicians' improvisations, no matter how bold or inventive their solos might be, they always performed within the undeniable logic of the composer's frame-they always, in other words, performed as ifwith quotation marks ar01md their improvisations and solos. It is this same effect that Toni Morrison has achieved in Jazz, a literary rendering of an art of composition that Duke Ellington perfected around the time in which Jazz is set. In this novel, Morrison has found a way, paradoxically, to create the sense of an ensemble of characters improvising within the fixed scope of a carefully constructed collective narration. By simulating the style of a genius of music while exhibiting Morrison's own linguistic virtuosity, Jazz serves to redefine the very possibilities of narrative point of view.

## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:** My focus on the unique aspects of *Jazz*'s narrative structure and its connection to jazz music led me to overlook the broader context of African American literature. While the passage highlights the innovative nature of Morrison's approach, it also mentions that many African American writers have used music as a theme and metaphor. This suggests a broader trend within the literary tradition, making option E the most relevant question.
**Error Keywords:**
*   Narrow focus
*   Ignoring context
*   Misinterpreting passage scope
## Step-by-Step Solution
1. **Identify the main topic:** The passage discusses the relationship between music and literature, specifically focusing on Toni Morrison's novel *Jazz* and its connection to jazz music.
2. **Analyze key points:** 
    *   African American writers often use music as a theme or metaphor.
    *   *Jazz* is unique in its use of a musical structure for the entire novel.
    *   The narrative style of *Jazz* mirrors the improvisational nature of jazz music, with individual characters' voices interwoven within a larger narrative framework.
3. **Review answer choices:** Eliminate options that are not addressed in the passage (A, C, D).
4. **Compare remaining options:** 
    *   Option B focuses solely on *Jazz*'s style compared to other works by Morrison.
    *   Option E considers a characteristic of *Jazz* within the broader context of African American literature.
5. **Choose the best option:** Option E aligns with the passage's discussion of music as a theme in African American writing, making it the most relevant question.
