## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I focused on the purpose of the proverb rather than the author's purpose in providing a translation of the proverb. 
The gap in my knowledge was not in the content of the passage but in my ability to identify the author's purpose. 
I knew the proverb was used as a teaching tool to regulate peer-group relationships, but I did not connect that to the author's purpose in providing a translation of the proverb. 
Error Keywords:
 - Misunderstanding author's purpose
 - Focusing on content rather than author's purpose
 - Lack of reading comprehension
Solution:
The author provides a translation of a proverb in lines 32â€“33 primarily in order to illustrate the relation between proverb use and education about peer-group relationships in Mexican American communities. The proverb "Tell me who you run with and I'll tell you who you are" is frequently used in Mexican American communities as a teaching tool to regulate peer-group relationships. The author provides the translation to show how proverbs can be used to teach traditional wisdom and values within a specific cultural context.
