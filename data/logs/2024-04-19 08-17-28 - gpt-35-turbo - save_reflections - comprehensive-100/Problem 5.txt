Explanation:
I correctly set up the equation to solve for the number of members in the club, but I made an error in simplifying the equation. 
The gap in my knowledge was in simplifying quadratic equations. 
I made a mistake in expanding the brackets and simplifying the quadratic equation. 
Error Keywords:
 - Quadratic equation error
 - Algebraic simplification error
 - Arithmetic error
Solution:
The sum of the ages of n members in an A.P. with first term a and common difference d is given by the formula: S = n/2[2a + (n-1)d]
Here, a = 7 years and d = 1/4 years.
The sum of the ages of all the members is 250, so we have:
250 = n/2[2(7) + (n-1)(1/4)]
Simplifying this equation, we get:
500 = n[14 + (n-1)/4]
Multiplying both sides by 4, we get:
2000 = 4n[14 + (n-1)/4]
Expanding the brackets, we get:
2000 = 56n + n^2 - n/4
Simplifying this quadratic equation, we get:
n^2 + 55n - 8000 = 0
Using the quadratic formula, we get:
n = (-55 ± sqrt(55^2 + 4(8000)))/2
n = (-55 ± 225)/2
n = 85/2 or n = -140
Since the number of members cannot be negative, the number of members in the club is 85/2, which is not one of the given choices.
