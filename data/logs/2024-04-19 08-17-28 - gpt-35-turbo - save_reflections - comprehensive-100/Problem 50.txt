## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I incorrectly chose answer choice A because it suggests that the diversity of secondary substances in a plant population is proportional to the number of insects with which that plant population has interacted throughout its evolutionary history. However, the passage states that only a few secondary substances occur in any one species of plant, but the same or similar ones tend to occur in related plants such as the various species that constitute a single family. Additionally, the passage notes that some secondary substances are favored by natural selection because they are scents that attract pollinating insects to blossoms, while others are biochemical defenses against plant-eating insects. Therefore, the appearance of secondary substances in plants is not solely dependent on the number of insects with which the plant population has interacted. 
Error Keywords:
 - Misinterpretation
 - Overgeneralization
 - Incomplete understanding
Solution:
The correct answer is D because the passage notes that no particular secondary substance has appeared in plants in direct response to insects, though in many instances insects have influenced which particular secondary substances are present in a plant species. The passage also notes that some secondary substances are favored by natural selection because they are scents that attract pollinating insects to blossoms, while others are biochemical defenses against plant-eating insects. Therefore, the appearance of secondary substances in plants is not solely dependent on the number of insects with which the plant population has interacted.
