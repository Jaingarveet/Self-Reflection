## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I misread the condition that no breed is featured on any two consecutive days. 
I also misread the condition that Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1. 
Error Keywords:
 - Misreading
 - Misinterpretation
 - Careless error
Solution:
Greyhounds are featured on day 1.
No breed is featured on any two consecutive days.
Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7.
Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.
Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.
A: Greyhounds and Siamese cannot both be featured on day 2 because no breed can be featured on any two consecutive days.
B: Greyhounds are featured on day 1 and cannot be featured on day 7. Himalayans are not featured on day 1, so they could be featured on day 7. Therefore, Greyhounds and Himalayans could both be featured on day 7. 
C: Himalayans are not featured on day 1, so they cannot be featured on day 4. Rottweilers are not featured on any day that features Himalayans, so they cannot be featured on day 4 either. Therefore, Rottweilers and Himalayans cannot both be featured on day 4.
D: Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, so they could be featured on day 5. Manx could also be featured on day 5 because it is not featured on any of the other days. Therefore, Rottweilers and Manx could both be featured on day 5.
E: Newfoundlands and Manx cannot both be featured on day 6 because no breed can be featured on any two consecutive days.
