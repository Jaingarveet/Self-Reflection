## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I incorrectly chose a 1-day website target as the target that cannot be set for more than one client. However, the correct answer is a 3-day website target. 
The conditions state that Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target. Therefore, Truvest cannot have a 3-day website target if Solide's website target is shorter. 
Error Keywords:
 - Misreading the conditions
 - Misinterpreting the requirements
 - Logical error
Solution:
Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target. None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
A 1-day website target can be set for multiple clients.
A 2-day voicemail target can be set for multiple clients.
A 2-day website target can be set for multiple clients.
A 3-day voicemail target can be set for multiple clients.
A 3-day website target cannot be set for more than one client because Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
