## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I misinterpreted the condition "No traditional piece is performed until Wayne performs at least one modem piece." I thought that Wayne must perform a modern piece first, but it is not necessary. 
Error Keywords:
 - Misinterpretation
 - Misunderstanding
 - Assumption
Solution:
The third solo is a traditional piece.
Exactly two of the traditional pieces are performed consecutively.
No traditional piece is performed until Wayne performs at least one modem piece.
It is possible that Wayne performs a traditional piece first, followed by two consecutive traditional pieces, and then Zara performs a modern piece in the fourth solo, and Wayne performs a modern piece in the fifth solo.
Therefore, the answer is C.

1. Read the problem carefully and understand the conditions.
2. Identify the condition that limits the placement of traditional pieces.
3. Identify the condition that limits the placement of modern pieces.
4. Identify the condition that limits the choice of pianist for the fourth solo.
