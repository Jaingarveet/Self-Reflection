## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
The correct answer is B because it provides a logical explanation for why the conclusion "friends are like dung" is not true. If a friend is indeed worth a lot of money, then money is not like dung. This statement contradicts the premise that "money is like dung" and therefore invalidates the argument that leads to the absurd conclusion "friends are like dung". The statement "friends are valuable" is not necessarily false, as it is possible for friends to be valuable even if they are not worth a thousand dollars. Therefore, option C is not the correct answer.
Error Keywords:
 - Misunderstanding the question
 - Incorrectly assuming the negation of a statement
 - Incorrectly assuming the truth value of a statement
Solution:
To solve this problem, we need to identify the statement that can be logically derived from the fact that the conclusion "friends are like dung" is not true. The conclusion "friends are like dung" is not true because it leads to an absurdity. Therefore, we need to find a statement that can explain why this conclusion is not true. Option B provides a logical explanation for why the conclusion "friends are like dung" is not true, and is therefore the correct answer.
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and understand the problem.
2. Identify the conclusion that is not true.
3. Identify the statement that can logically explain why the conclusion is not true.
4. Consider each option and evaluate whether it provides a logical explanation for the conclusion.
5. Choose the option that provides the best logical explanation for the conclusion.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Be careful when negating statements, as the negation may not always be true.
 - Do not assume the truth value of a statement without evidence or logical reasoning.
 - Consider each option carefully and evaluate whether it provides a logical explanation for the problem.
 - Eliminate options that are clearly false or irrelevant.
