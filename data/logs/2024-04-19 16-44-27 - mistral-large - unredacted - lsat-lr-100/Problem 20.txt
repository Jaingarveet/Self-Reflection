Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

## User 2:
Topic: Law
Context: Judge: The defendant admits noncompliance with national building codes but asks that penalties not be imposed because he was confused as to whether national or local building codes applied to the area in which he was building. This excuse might be acceptable had he been charged with noncompliance with local codes, but since he is charged with noncompliance with national codes, his excuse is unacceptable.
Question: Which one of the following principles, if valid, most helps to justify the judge's reasoning?
Choices:
  A: Local codes and national codes must not overlap with each other.
  B: Local codes may be less strict, but not more strict, than national codes.
  C: Any behavior required by national codes is also required by local codes.
  D: Ignorance of the difference between two codes is not an adequate excuse for noncompliance.
  E: A behavior that is in compliance with one law is not necessarily in compliance with another.
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I focused too narrowly on the defendant's excuse and the judge's rejection of it, rather than considering the broader principle that underlies the judge's reasoning.

Error Keywords:
 - Narrow focus
 - Misinterpretation of the question
 - Failure to consider broader principles

Solution:
The judge's reasoning is based on the fact that the defendant's noncompliance with national codes cannot be excused by confusion with local codes.
The principle that justifies this reasoning is that any behavior required by national codes is also required by local codes.
This means that if the defendant was required to comply with national codes, then he was also required to comply with local codes, and his confusion between the two is irrelevant.

Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and identify the key issue.
2. Consider the broader principles that underlie the judge's reasoning.
3. Identify the principle that most directly supports the judge's reasoning.
4. Eliminate answer choices that are not directly relevant to the issue or that contradict the principle.
5. Choose the answer that best reflects the principle that supports the judge's reasoning.

Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and identify the key issue.
 - Consider the broader principles that underlie the reasoning presented in the question.
 - Avoid focusing too narrowly on specific details or arguments presented in the question.
 - Eliminate answer choices that are not directly relevant to the issue or that contradict the principle.
 - Choose the answer that best reflects the principle that supports the reasoning presented in the question.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The key issue in the question is the judge's rejection of the defendant's excuse for noncompliance with national building codes.
The broader principle that underlies the judge's reasoning is that ignorance of the law is not an adequate excuse for noncompliance.
The principle that most directly supports the judge's reasoning is that ignorance of the difference between two codes is not an adequate excuse for noncompliance.

Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
