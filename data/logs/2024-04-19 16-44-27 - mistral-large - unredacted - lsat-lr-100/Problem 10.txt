Topic: Law
Context: Mike: Tom did not tell me that I could use his computer, but it would not be wrong for me to use it anyway. Last week Tom used Mary's bicycle even though she had not told him he could use it.
Question: Which one of the following principles, if valid, would most help to justif Y Mike's reasoning?
Choices:
  A: Using the possessions of others without their permission is not always theft.
  B: Generally one should tell the truth, but there are cases in which it is permissible not to.
  C: If people have used your property without your permission, it is not wrong for you to use their property without their permission.
  D: It is permissible to treat people in a way that is siruilar to the way in which they have treated others.
  E: Using another person's property is wrong if the person is harmed by that use.
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I focused too narrowly on the specific example given in the context and failed to consider the broader principle that could justify Mike's reasoning.

Error Keywords:
 - Narrow focus
 - Failure to consider broader principles
 - Misinterpretation of the question

Solution:
The principle that most closely aligns with Mike's reasoning is that it is permissible to treat people in a way that is similar to the way in which they have treated others. This principle is more general than the one I initially chose, which focused specifically on the use of property without permission.

Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and identify the reasoning that needs to be justified.
2. Consider the broader principles that could justify this reasoning, rather than focusing too narrowly on specific examples.
3. Evaluate each answer choice in light of these broader principles.
4. Choose the answer that most closely aligns with the broader principle that could justify the reasoning.

Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and identify the key issue.
 - Consider the broader principles that could apply to the situation, rather than focusing too narrowly on specific examples.
 - Evaluate each answer choice in light of these broader principles.
 - Choose the answer that most closely aligns with the broader principle that could justify the reasoning.
 - Be aware of the potential for misinterpretation of the question and avoid making assumptions.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The principle that most closely aligns with Mike's reasoning is that it is permissible to treat people in a way that is similar to the way in which they have treated others.
