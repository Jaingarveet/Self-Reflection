- Rounding values can help simplify calculations, but be mindful of significant figures and potential rounding errors.
## Assistant 2:
Reflection: I made a mistake in interpreting the question. I incorrectly assumed that the amount given to the daughters was the same as the amount given to the sons, which led me to incorrectly calculate the total amount divided by 13 people. To avoid this mistake in the future, I should pay closer attention to the relationships between the amounts received by different family members and double-check my interpretations before proceeding with calculations.

Thought: 
The question involves dividing a sum of money among family members with different relationships. 

Let's start by understanding the relationships:
- Each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew.
- Each son receives five times as much as each nephew.

Now, let's calculate the amount received by each nephew first. We have 13 people (5 sons + 4 daughters + 2 nephews + 1 himself = 13), and the total amount is Rs. 8600. So, the amount received by each nephew is Rs. 8600 / 13 = Rs. 661.54 (rounded to two decimal places).

Now, we can find the amount received by each daughter. Since each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, the amount each daughter receives is 4 * Rs. 661.54 = Rs. 2646.16. 

So, the correct answer is...
