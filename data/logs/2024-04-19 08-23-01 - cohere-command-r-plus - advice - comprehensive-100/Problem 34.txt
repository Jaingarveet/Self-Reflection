Topic: Law
Context: The chairperson of Acme Corporation has decided to move the company from its current location in Milltown to Ocean View.

  A: All Acme employees can afford housing within a 30-minute commute of Milltown.
  B: The chairperson of Acme has good financial reasons for wanting to move the company to Ocean View.
  C: None of Acme's employees except the chairperson are in favor of moving the company to Ocean View.
  D: Currently, most Acme employees have a commute of less than 30 minutes.

## Assistant 2:
Reflection: I missed the correct answer because I overlooked the keyword "most," focusing only on the commute distance and housing affordability. Upon reflection, the correct answer, Choice E, encompasses the financial aspect, linking the employees' inability to afford nearby housing with the absence of a pay raise, which is crucial to the argument's assumption.
Action: Answer("E")
