## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
First, I'll solve the system of equations:

$2x - 3y = -14$ can be rewritten as $2x = 3y - 14$, and then as $x = \frac{3}{2}y - 7$.

Substituting for $x$ in the second equation:
$3(\frac{3}{2}y - 7) - 2y = -6$
Simplifying gives:
$\frac{9}{2}y - 21 - 2y = -6$
$\frac{9}{2}y - 2y = 21 + 6$
$\frac{1}{2}y = 27$
$y = 54$.

Substituting $y = 54$ into $x = \frac{3}{2}y - 7$,
$x = \frac{3}{2}(54) - 7 = \frac{243}{2} - 7 = 115.5$.

Finally, $x - y = 115.5 - 54 = \mathbf{-40.5}$.

The answer provided in the multiple-choice question is incorrect, as none of the options include $-40.5$.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
