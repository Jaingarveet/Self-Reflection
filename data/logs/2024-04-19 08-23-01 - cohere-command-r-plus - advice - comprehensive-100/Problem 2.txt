## Assistant 2:
Reflection: I made a mistake in my previous response by converting inches to feet incorrectly. I should have divided by 12, not multiplied. 

Thought: 
Each picket along with the space on its right accounts for 1/2 + 6 = 6-1/2 inches. 
So, x pickets will take up (x * 6-1/2) inches. 
To convert this to feet, we divide by 12: (x * 6-1/2) / 12 = (x * 6/12 + 1/2/12) = (x/2) + 1/2 feet. 
Adding the length of the fence at the end, we get (x/2) + 1/2 + 6 feet. 
This can be simplified to (x+12)/2 feet.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: E
Score: 0
