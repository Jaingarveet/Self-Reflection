## Assistant 2:
Reflection: I made a calculation error in my previous attempt. I added the difference in averages to the initial average weight, instead of subtracting, to find the weight of the new truck. Correcting this error should lead to the right answer.

Thought: 
The problem involves finding the weight of the new heavy-duty truck added to a group of vehicles, given changes in their average weight. 

Step 1: Understanding the Given Information

Initial average weight of 10 vehicles = 12.2 tons

Final average weight after adding the new truck = 12.2 tons + 2.6 tons = 14.8 tons

Step 2: Calculating the Weight of the New Truck

The weight of the new truck can be calculated by considering the increase in total weight when it is added to the group. 

Let the weight of the new truck be 'x' tons. 

Total weight of the original 10 vehicles = 10 * 12.2 tons = 122 tons

After adding the new truck, the total weight becomes (122 tons + x). This total weight should correspond to the final average weight multiplied by the total number of vehicles (now 11): 

(Final average weight) * (Total number of vehicles) = 14.8 tons * 11 = 162.8 tons

So, we have: 
122 tons + x = 162.8 tons 

Solving for x, we get: 
x = 162.8 tons - 122 tons = 40.8 tons 

Therefore, the weight of the heavy-duty truck is 40.8 tons. 

Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
