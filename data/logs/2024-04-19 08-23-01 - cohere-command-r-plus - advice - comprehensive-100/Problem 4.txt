# Model: cohere-command-r-plus | Agent: advice | Exam: comprehensive-100 | Problem 4 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")

Question: At its maximum speed, a space shuttle can travel 700m high in 40 seconds. It will also take 5 seconds to pass a point. What then is the length of the space shuttle?
Choices:
  A: 50 m
  B: 75 m
  C: 100 m
  D: 125 m
  E: 150 m
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Advice:
 - Read the question carefully to identify the relevant information and the specific calculation required. 
 - Understand the difference between vertical speed and the speed at which an object passes a point. 
 - Double-check your calculations and ensure you are applying the correct values to the appropriate formulas. 
 - Always consider the units of your values and ensure they match the required units for your answer. 
 - Practice similar problems to improve your familiarity with these types of calculations.
## Assistant 2:
Reflection: I made an error in interpreting the question. I incorrectly assumed that the shuttle's vertical speed was relevant to its speed while passing a point. Instead, I should have used the time taken to pass a point to calculate the shuttle's speed and length.

Correct Solution: 
The speed of the shuttle when passing a point can be calculated as distance divided by time: 
- Distance = 700m
- Time = 5 seconds
- Speed = 700 / 5 = 140 m/s

Now, we can find the length of the shuttle. It takes 5 seconds to pass a point at its maximum speed, so:
- Length = Speed x Time = 140 x 5 = 700 meters

Therefore, the answer is [CHOICE LETTER].
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
