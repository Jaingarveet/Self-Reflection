# Model: mistral-large | Task: save_reflection | Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Problem 90 of 100
## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misinterpreted the question. The question asked for the excerpt that does not exhibit the author's attitude towards the novel Jazz, but I chose an excerpt that described a narrative technique used in the novel, rather than the author's attitude towards it.

Error Keywords:

* Misinterpretation of the question
* Incorrect identification of the author's attitude
* Confusion between narrative technique and author's attitude

Solution:
To solve the problem again, I would first carefully read the question and understand that it is asking for the excerpt that does not exhibit the author's attitude towards the novel Jazz. Then, I would read each excerpt and determine whether it expresses the author's attitude towards the novel or not.

Instructions:

1. Read the question carefully and understand what it is asking.
2. Read each excerpt and determine whether it expresses the author's attitude towards the novel or not.
3. Eliminate the excerpts that express the author's attitude towards the novel.
4. Choose the excerpt that does not express the author's attitude towards the novel.

Advice:

* Always read the question carefully and understand what it is asking.
* Be precise in identifying the author's attitude towards the subject matter.
* Do not confuse narrative techniques with the author's attitude towards the subject matter.
* Eliminate the choices that clearly express the author's attitude towards the subject matter.
* Choose the choice that does not express the author's attitude towards the subject matter.
