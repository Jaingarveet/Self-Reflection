## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I misinterpreted the author's argument in passage A and failed to apply it correctly to the plan described in passage B.
The gap in my knowledge was in understanding the author's perspective on discretionary nonenforcement and how it applies to the situation in passage B.
I incorrectly assumed that the author would prefer a more equitable solution, such as placing liens on properties, rather than selectively enforcing the rule against certain individuals.
However, the author's argument is that discretionary nonenforcement can be used to reduce the costs of overinclusive rules, and the plan described in passage B is an example of this.

Error Keywords:
 - Misinterpretation of author's argument
 - Incorrect application of author's argument
 - Misunderstanding of discretionary nonenforcement

Solution:
The author of passage A argues that discretionary nonenforcement can be used to reduce the costs of overinclusive rules.
The plan described in passage B involves selectively enforcing the rule only against certain individuals to achieve a particular goal, which is an example of discretionary nonenforcement.
The author of passage A would likely agree that the plan described in passage B is a reasonable response to the water department's history of enforcing overinclusive rules to the letter, as it reduces the costs of overinclusion without creating underinclusion.

Instructions:
1. Carefully read and understand the author's argument in passage A.
2. Identify the plan described in passage B and how it relates to the author's argument.
3. Consider the author's perspective on discretionary nonenforcement and how it applies to the situation in passage B.
4. Evaluate the options presented in the question and choose the one that best aligns with the author's argument.
5. Double-check your answer to ensure that it accurately reflects the author's perspective.

Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always consider the author's perspective and how it applies to the situation in the question.
 - Always evaluate the options presented in the question and choose the one that best aligns with the author's argument.
 - Never assume that the author would prefer a particular solution without evidence to support it.
 - Always double-check your answer to ensure that it accurately reflects the author's perspective.
