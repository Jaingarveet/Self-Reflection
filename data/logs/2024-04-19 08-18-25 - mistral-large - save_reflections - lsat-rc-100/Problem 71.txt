## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misunderstood the author's criticism of the argument made in passage A. I thought that the author was criticizing the assumption that all human behavior can be explained by the proliferation of genes, but the author was actually criticizing the assumption that it is sufficient to explain a type of human behavior in evolutionary terms by showing that the behavior would have improved the reproductive success of early humans.

Error Keywords:
 - Misunderstanding of the author's argument
 - Misinterpretation of the passage
 - Incorrect identification of the author's criticism

Solution:
The author of passage B criticizes the argument made in passage A by suggesting that it is a mistake to assume that it is sufficient to explain a type of human behavior in evolutionary terms by showing that the behavior would have improved the reproductive success of early humans. The author argues that there are often multiple interests that could explain a given behavior, and that it is not necessarily the case that genes are the only or primary factor driving behavior.

Choice C is the best answer because it directly addresses the author's criticism of the argument made in passage A. The author suggests that it is a mistake to assume that it is sufficient to explain a type of human behavior in evolutionary terms by showing that the behavior would have improved the reproductive success of early humans.

Instructions:
1. Read the passages carefully and identify the author's argument and criticism.
2. Identify the keywords in the question that indicate the author's criticism.
