# Model: mistral-large | Task: save_reflection | Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Problem 14 of 100
## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I misunderstood the question prompt and did not carefully read the answer choices. I thought the question was asking for any concept that was mentioned in both passages, rather than the one concept that was explicitly mentioned in both passages.

Error Keywords:
 - Misunderstood question prompt
 - Careless reading of answer choices
 - Overinclusive answer

Solution:
Passage A discusses the concept of overinclusive laws and the use of discretionary nonenforcement by law enforcement agencies. It also mentions the limitations of language and the danger of punishing innocent people.
Passage B discusses the issue of water delinquents and the use of selective water cut-offs by officials. It also mentions a loophole that prohibits debts other than taxes from being subject to liens by the city and the idea of changing the law.
Both passages explicitly mention loopholes (legal technicalities in Passage A and a specific loophole in Passage B).

Instructions:
1. Carefully read the question prompt and answer choices.
2. Identify the concepts mentioned in each passage.
3. Compare the concepts mentioned in each passage to the answer choices.
4. Select the one concept that is explicitly mentioned in both passages.
5. Double-check your answer to ensure it is explicitly mentioned in both passages.

Advice:
 - Always read the question prompt and answer choices carefully.
 - Always identify the concepts mentioned in each passage.
 - Always compare the concepts mentioned in each passage to the answer choices.
 - Always select the one concept that is explicitly mentioned in both passages.
 - Always double-check your answer to ensure it is explicitly mentioned in both passages.
 - Never select an overinclusive answer that includes concepts not explicitly mentioned in both passages.
