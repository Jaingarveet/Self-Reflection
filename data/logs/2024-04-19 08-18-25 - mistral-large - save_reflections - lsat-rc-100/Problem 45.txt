# Model: mistral-large | Task: save_reflection | Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Problem 45 of 100
## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I focused too much on the benefits of the new digital model of publishing and not enough on the author's main argument about the role of literary agents in driving the transition to the new model.

Error Keywords:
 - Misinterpretation of the author's argument
 - Focusing too much on the benefits of the new model
 - Not considering the role of literary agents in driving the transition

Solution:
The author argues that the demands of literary agents for higher royalty payments for authors will be the impetus for completing the transition to the new digital model of publishing. The author states that traditional publishers will have to adjust to accommodate these demands or risk losing their authors to upstart digital-publishing firms.

Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and identify what is being asked.
2. Identify the author's main argument and the evidence they provide to support it.
3. Consider the role of each of the answer choices in the author's argument.
4. Eliminate answer choices that are not directly related to the author's argument.
5. Choose the answer choice that most directly supports the author's main argument.

Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and identify what is being asked.
 - Focus on the author's main argument and the evidence they provide to support it.
 - Consider the role of each of the answer choices in the author's argument.
 - Eliminate answer choices that are not directly related to the author's argument.
 - Choose the answer choice that most directly supports the author's main argument.
 - Do not focus too much on the benefits or drawbacks of a particular option, but rather on how it relates to the author's argument.
