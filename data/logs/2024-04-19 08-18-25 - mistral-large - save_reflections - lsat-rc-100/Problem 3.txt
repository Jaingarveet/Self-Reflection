## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misunderstood the author's argument. The author's argument is not that increased size always leads to monopoly power, but rather that increasing returns to scale can lead to monopoly power. Choice E undermines the connection between increased size and monopoly power by suggesting that there are diminishing returns to specialization, which would limit the ability of larger businesses to achieve increasing returns to scale.

Error Keywords:
 - Misunderstood the argument
 - Misinterpreted the connection between increased size and monopoly power
 - Failed to consider the role of diminishing returns to specialization

Solution:
The author argues that increasing returns to scale can lead to monopoly power. However, choice E suggests that there are diminishing returns to specialization, which would limit the ability of larger businesses to achieve increasing returns to scale. This would undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power.

Instructions:
1. Carefully read the author's argument to understand the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
2. Consider the role of increasing returns to scale in the author's argument.
3. Evaluate each answer choice to determine which one would most undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
4. Consider the role of diminishing returns to specialization in evaluating the answer choices.
5. Choose the answer that most effectively undermines the connection between increased size and monopoly power.

Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember to consider the role of diminishing returns in evaluating the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
