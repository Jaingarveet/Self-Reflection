## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I focused on the information provided in the passage about the roots of corridos in Spain and the use of familiar imagery, rather than considering the specific question being asked about the author's likely agreement.

Error Keywords:
 - Misinterpretation of the question
 - Focusing on irrelevant information
 - Not considering the specific question being asked

Solution:
The passage discusses the corrido, a type of narrative folk song from the Lower Rio Grande Border region. It highlights the use of familiar linguistic and thematic conventions, including the use of everyday images and ready-made lines, which serve to affirm the cohesiveness of Border communities. The passage also mentions that corridos have roots in eighteenth-century Spain.

The question asks which statement the author would most likely agree with. The correct answer is E, as the passage mentions that the despedida, or formal closing verse, is a clear marker of both the corrido's uniqueness and its generic continuity. Without a despedida, a corrido would lack this important marker.

Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and consider what is being asked.
2. Identify the main points of the passage and how they relate to the question.
3. Eliminate answer choices that are not supported by the passage.
4. Choose the answer that is most strongly supported by the passage.

Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and consider what is being asked.
 - Focus on the main points of the passage and how they relate to the question.
 - Eliminate answer choices that are not supported by the passage.
 - Choose the answer that is most strongly supported by the passage, even if it is not explicitly stated.
 - Be aware of common answer choice traps, such as answer choices that are too broad or too narrow, or that distort information from the passage.
