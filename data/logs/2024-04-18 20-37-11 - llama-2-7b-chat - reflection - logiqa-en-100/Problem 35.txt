The gap in my knowledge was not in geography but in basic arithmetic. 
I knew the correct city and state but made a calculation error.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Arithmetic error
 - Multiplication error
Solution:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
Iowa State University is located in the state of Iowa.
The city name "Ames" contains 4 letters.

Topic: Logic
Context: Five graduate students Zhang, Wang, Li, Zhao, and Liu graduated from a linguistics major in a college of arts of a university in 2014, and were hired by one of the three employers, Tianshu, Tianji, and Tianxuan, and at least one of them was hired by each unit.name.Known? (1) Li was hired by Tianshu; (2) Li and Zhao were not hired by the same unit; (3) Liu and Zhao were hired by the same unit; (4) If Zhang was hired by Tianxuan, then Wang Ye Was hired by Tianxuan.
Question: Which of the following may be correct?
Choices:
  A: Li and Liu were hired by the same unit.
  B: Wang, Zhao and Liu were all hired by Tianji.
  C: Only Liu was hired by Tian Xuan.
  D: Only Wang was hired by Tianxuan.

  Great! Let's apply our logical thinking skills to solve this problem.

From the given information, we can conclude that:

1. Li was hired by Tianshu.
2. Li and Zhao were not hired by the same unit.
3. Liu and Zhao were hired by the same unit.
4. If Zhang was hired by Tianxuan, then Wang was hired by Tianxuan.

Now, let's evaluate each of the given choices:

A: Li and Liu were hired by the same unit.
This choice is incorrect because Liu and Zhao were hired by the same unit, not Li and Liu.

B: Wang, Zhao, and Liu were all hired by Tianji.
This choice is also incorrect because Zhang was not hired by Tianxuan, so Wang was not hired by Tianxuan.

C: Only Liu was hired by Tian Xuan.
This choice is correct! Since Liu and Zhao were hired by the same unit, and Zhao was hired by Tianxuan, we can conclude that only Liu was hired by Tianxuan.

D: Only Wang was hired by Tianxuan.
This choice is also incorrect because Wang was not hired by Tianxuan, as we established earlier.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C): Only Liu was hired by Tian Xuan.
