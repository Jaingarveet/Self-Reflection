  C: Planning Department, Finance Department, Sales Department, R & D Department, Administration Department, Human Resources Department
  D: Sales Department, Finance Department, Planning Department, R & D Department, Human Resources Department, Administration Department

  Thought: Let's analyze the information given in the question:

1. The two floors of the human resources department and the sales department are not adjacent.
2. The finance department is on the next floor of the planning department.
3. The floor of the administrative department is above the planning department, but below the human resources department.

Floor 1: Sales Department
Floor 2: Human Resources Department
Floor 3: Planning Department
Floor 4: Finance Department
Floor 5: Administration Department
Floor 6: Research and Development Department

Now, let's match the distribution of the departments with the choices given in the question:

A: This option does not match the information given in the question. The finance department is not on the same floor as the planning department, and the human resources department is not on the same floor as the sales department.

B: This option matches the layout we created earlier. The finance department is on the next floor of the planning department, and the human resources department is on a different floor than the sales department.

C: This option does not match the information given in the question. The planning department is not on the same floor as the finance department, and the sales department is not on the same floor as the human resources department.

D: This option does not match the information given in the question. The sales department is not on the same floor as the finance department, and the human resources department is not on the same floor as the research and development department.

Therefore, the correct answer is B: Finance Department, Planning Department, Sales Department, R & D Department, Administration Department, Human Resources Department.
