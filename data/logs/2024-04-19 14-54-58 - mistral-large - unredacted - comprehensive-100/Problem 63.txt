## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Explanation:
I made an algebraic error in solving for z.

Error Keywords:
 - Algebraic error
 - Subtraction error
 - Equation solving error

Solution:
To solve for z, we can subtract z from both sides of the equation to get:
2z - z = 1
z = 1 - z
z + z = 1
2z = 1
z = 1/2

Instructions:
1. Subtract z from both sides of the equation.
2. Combine like terms.
3. Divide both sides of the equation by 2.
4. Simplify the equation.
5. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.

Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always follow the order of operations.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember to distribute the subtraction sign when subtracting a variable from both sides of an equation.
 - Remember to simplify the equation after combining like terms.
 - Remember to divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of the variable to solve for the variable.
