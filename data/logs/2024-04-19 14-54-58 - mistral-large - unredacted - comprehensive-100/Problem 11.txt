Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I did not carefully consider the information provided in each choice. I focused too much on the percentage increase in housing prices compared to land prices, rather than the actual increase in land prices.

Error Keywords:

* Misinterpretation of data
* Lack of attention to detail
* Incorrect comparison

Solution:
The assertion is that rising land prices are the chief culprit in soaring housing prices.
Choice A shows that housing prices increased significantly more than land prices, but the actual increase in land prices is still significant.
Choice B shows that land prices rose very little compared to housing prices, which casts doubt on the assertion.
Choice C is an opinion that supports the assertion.
Choice D is an opinion that contradicts the assertion.

Instructions:

1. Read the question carefully and understand the assertion being made.
2. Consider each choice and the information it provides.
3. Compare the information in each choice to the assertion.
4. Determine which choice casts the most doubt on the assertion.
5. Choose the answer that corresponds to that choice.

Advice:

* Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
* Pay attention to the details in each choice.
* Compare the information in each choice to the assertion being made.
* Consider the actual values, not just the percentages.
* Choose the answer that casts the most doubt on the assertion.
