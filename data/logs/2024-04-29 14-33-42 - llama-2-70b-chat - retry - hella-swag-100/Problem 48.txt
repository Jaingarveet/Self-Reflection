Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to shop for speakers [title] Decide how you'll use the speakers. [step] The variety of speaker builds suits individual speakers for different tasks. For casual music listening, a pair of bookshelf speakers would be more than enough.
Choices:
  A: For, for church music listening, a pair of high performance speakers would be perfect for easy listening during worship periods. For assembly groups, a 4-prong speaker would be adequate, but for parties, ladies could now stand between the blocks.
  B: However, for business calls or social gatherings you may also consider other options; ipods and digital speakers are both available. It's important to consider the quality of your speakers, along with the layout of your space.
  C: Personal speakers are fairly easy to get into. A solo recording of 10 seconds played on your ipod or two of jumps up and down on a bulletin board might work for the majority of speakers.
  D: Those who desire a more intensive experience can upgrade to standing speakers. Surround sound systems are also a high-end option.

Action: Answer("B")

Explanation:
The passage discusses how to shop for speakers and suggests considering the intended use of the speakers when making a decision. Choice B continues this train of thought by suggesting additional options for business calls or social gatherings. It also mentions the importance of considering the quality of the speakers and the layout of the space. This choice aligns with the overall theme of the passage and provides the most coherent and relevant information.

Choice A does not align with the topic of the passage and contains inappropriate language. Choice C is not relevant to the topic and is too brief to provide useful information. Choice D mentions surround sound systems, which are mentioned in the passage, but it does not address the topic of considering the intended use of the speakers.
