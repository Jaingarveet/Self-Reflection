## Assistant 2:
  Answer: B

The correct answer is B. The step suggests that you should jot down the information to work through later, so that you don't end up feeling bitter or resentful. This is a more constructive approach than the other options, which suggest avoiding the person, ending the relationship, or trying to put yourself in the frenemy's shoes.

In the previous question, the answer was A, which suggests that if you're just like them, you may not enjoy talking about the dark side of things, and this person might not be a good friend. However, this answer doesn't take into account the possibility that the person may still be a good friend even if you're not similar to them.

Therefore, the correct answer is B, which suggests taking a step back and jotting down the information to work through later, rather than making a hasty decision or trying to change the person.
