Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to be indie (for guys ) [title] Break free from conformity. [step] One of the most critical aspects to being indie is not adopting other people's views without evaluating the situation yourself. Going with the crowd is never something that an indie person would do, so make sure that you are making independent decisions when it comes to music, clothing, and your opinions.
Choices:
  A: [substeps] Understand how people may affect how you think about the music and related trends. [title] Steer clear of the " what's indie, what's indie-animal " mentality.
  B: Do your research on different topics to help inform your opinions. [substeps] If you like a band or musician, but everyone else thinks they are bad or weird, then you should stand up for your views.
  C: [substeps] Never allow the messenger back into your life. If you are in a relationship with someone but they are choosing to change with you, leave the conversation.
  D: You don't have to assume how you will feel. What's more, you probably know a bit more about people who just want to blend in with their surroundings.

## Assistant 2:
  Answer: B

Explanation:
The correct answer is B: Do your research on different topics to help inform your opinions. The passage emphasizes the importance of making independent decisions and not conforming to other people's views. Choice B aligns with this idea by suggesting that one should do their own research to inform their opinions, rather than relying on what others think.

Choice A is not relevant to the topic of being indie and is not mentioned in the passage. Choice C is not related to the topic of being indie and seems unethical. Choice D is not related to the topic of being indie and seems unhelpful.

Therefore, the answer is B: Do your research on different topics to help inform your opinions.
## Result:
