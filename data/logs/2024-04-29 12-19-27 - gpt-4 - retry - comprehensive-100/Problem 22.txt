## User 2:
Topic: Law
Context: Of the eight students—George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert—in a seminar, exactly six will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
Question: If George, Nina, and Robert give reports and they do so on different days from one another, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Helen gives a report on Wednesday.
  B: Nina gives a report on Monday.
  C: Nina gives a report on Tuesday.
  D: Olivia gives a report on Monday.
  E: Robert gives a report on Wednesday.

## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
George can only give a report on Tuesday. 
Robert cannot give an afternoon report, but he can give a morning report on any day. 
Nina can give a report on any day, but if she gives a report, then Helen and Irving must both give reports the next day, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. 
Given that George, Nina, and Robert give reports on different days, Nina cannot give a report on Monday because Helen and Irving would have to give reports on Tuesday, but George is already giving a report on Tuesday. 
Nina also cannot give a report on Tuesday because Helen and Irving would have to give reports on Wednesday, but there are only two slots on Wednesday and one of them is already taken by Robert. 
Therefore, Nina must give a report on Wednesday. 
This means that Robert must give a report on Monday and George must give a report on Tuesday. 
Helen cannot give a report on Wednesday because Nina is giving a report on Wednesday and if Nina gives a report, then Helen must give a report the next day, but there is no next day after Wednesday. 
Therefore, the only option that could be true is Olivia gives a report on Monday.
Action: Answer("D")
