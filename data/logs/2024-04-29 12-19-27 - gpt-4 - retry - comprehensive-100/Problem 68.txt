## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
A line passes through the origin if the equation of the line is in the form y = mx, where m is the slope of the line. The slope of the line determined by the points (2, k) and (k, 32) is (32-k)/(k-2). Setting this equal to 0 (since the line passes through the origin and thus has a slope of 0), we get 32-k = 0, which gives k = 32. However, this is not one of the options. Therefore, I must have made a mistake. The slope of the line should not be 0, because a line passing through the origin can have any slope. The slope should be (32-k)/(k-2) = k/2 (since the line also passes through the point (2, k)). Solving this equation gives k = 4.
Action: Answer("B")
