## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The equation $(a x+2)(b x+7)=15 x^{2}+c x+14$ can be expanded to $abx^2 + (7a+2b)x + 14 = 15x^2 + cx + 14$. 
Since the coefficients on the left and right sides of the equation must be equal, we know that $ab = 15$ and $7a+2b = c$. 
We also know that $a+b = 8$. 
We can solve for $a$ and $b$ using these two equations. 
Then, we can substitute $a$ and $b$ into the equation $7a+2b = c$ to find the two possible values for $c$.
Action: Answer("C")
