Context: Of the eight students—George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert—in a seminar, exactly six will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.

Choices:
  A: Irving, Lenore, and Nina

## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. Kyle gives the afternoon report on Tuesday. This means George must give the morning report on Tuesday, since Tuesday is the only day he can give a report.
2. Helen gives the afternoon report on Wednesday. 
3. Nina cannot give a report on Tuesday, because if she did, then Helen and Irving would have to give reports on Wednesday. But we know Helen is giving the afternoon report Wednesday, so there wouldn't be room for Irving.
4. Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports. Robert also cannot give the Wednesday morning report, because then Nina would have to give the Tuesday report which we determined is not possible.
5. So for the Wednesday morning slot, the options are Nina, Irving, or Lenore. 
6. If Nina gives the Wednesday morning report, then no conditions are violated. Lenore and Irving are then free for the Monday slots.
Therefore, the answer that fits is:
Action: Answer("A")
The morning reports could be given by Irving, Lenore, and Nina on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday respectively.
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: D
