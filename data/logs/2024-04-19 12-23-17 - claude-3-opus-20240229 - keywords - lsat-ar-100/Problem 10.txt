## Assistant 2:
You're right, I made an error in my previous analysis. Let me carefully re-examine the constraints and evaluate each answer choice to determine the correct answer.
The key constraints are:
1. Select 5-6 works total
2. No more than 4 French works 
3. 3-4 novels must be selected
4. Number of French novels â‰¥ Russian novels
5. If both French plays are selected, the Russian play is not selected
Evaluating the choices:
A. 1 French novel, 2 Russian novels, 1 French play, 1 Russian play 
   - Satisfies constraints 1-4
   - Violates constraint 5 by selecting both French plays and the Russian play
   - Incorrect
B. 2 French novels, 1 Russian novel, 2 French plays, 1 Russian play
   - Satisfies constraints 1, 3 and 4 
   - Violates constraint 2 by selecting 4 French works and the Russian play
   - Also violates constraint 5 like choice A
   - Incorrect 
C. 2 French novels, 2 Russian novels, 2 French plays
   - Satisfies constraints 1-4
   - Avoids violating constraint 5 by not selecting the Russian play
   - Looks correct
D. 3 French novels, 1 Russian novel, 2 French plays
   - Violates constraint 2 by selecting 5 French works
   - Incorrect
E. 3 French novels, 2 Russian novels, 1 Russian play
   - Satisfies constraints 1-4 
   - Avoids violating constraint 5 by not selecting the French plays
   - Also looks correct
After carefully checking the constraints against each choice, both C and E appear to be valid selections. However, the question asks for just one possible selection.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
