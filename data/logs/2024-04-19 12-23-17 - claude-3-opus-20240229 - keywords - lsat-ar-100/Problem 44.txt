## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step, keeping in mind the constraints and implications:
1. Greyhounds are featured on day 1. This means they can't be featured on day 7 (no breed on day 1 is on day 7).
2. Himalayans are featured on exactly 3 days, but not day 1. So they must be on 3 of days 2-7. 
3. Rottweilers can't be featured on any day with Himalayans. And Rottweilers aren't on day 7.
4. No breed is featured on consecutive days.
Looking at the answer choices:
A: Greyhounds on days 3 and 5 would violate the no consecutive days rule. Eliminate A.
B: Newfoundlands on day 3 is possible. Keep B.
C: Rottweilers on day 6 is possible, as long as Himalayans aren't on day 6. Keep C.
D: Rottweilers only on day 3 is possible, as long as Himalayans aren't on day 3. Keep D.
E: Rottweilers on exactly 3 days is impossible. They can't be on day 1 (Greyhounds), day 7, or any Himalayan day. At most 2 days left for Rottweilers. Eliminate E.
Of the remaining (B, C, D), all are possible scenarios without violating any rules, even if Himalayans aren't on day 7.
Therefore, it's impossible to determine which single statement must be true. The question cannot be answered definitively based on the information provided.
