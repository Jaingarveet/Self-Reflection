## User 2:
Topic: Law
Context: Of the eight students—George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert—in a seminar, exactly six will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
Question: If Helen, Kyle, and Lenore, not necessarily in that order, give the three morning reports, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Helen gives a report on Monday.
  B: Irving gives a report on Monday.
  C: Irving gives a report on Wednesday.
  D: Kyle gives a report on Tuesday.
  E: Kyle gives a report on Wednesday.

## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. Helen, Kyle, and Lenore give the three morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, in some order.
2. George can only report on Tuesday. Since the morning slot on Tuesday is taken, George must report on Tuesday afternoon.
3. Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports. So the other afternoon slots (Monday and Wednesday) must be filled by two of the remaining students - Irving, Nina.
4. If Nina reports, then the next day both Helen and Irving must report (unless Nina reports on Wednesday). But we know Helen has a morning slot. So if Nina reports, it must be on Monday or Tuesday, and Irving must have the other afternoon slot.
5. The question asks what must be true. The only definite information we have is that George reports on Tuesday afternoon. We can't say for certain which day Helen, Irving, or Kyle report.
Therefore, none of the answer choices must be true. The question is flawed as there is no correct answer given.
