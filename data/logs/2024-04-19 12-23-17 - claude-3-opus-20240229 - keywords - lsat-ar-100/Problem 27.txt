## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step, keeping in mind the constraints and avoiding incorrect assumptions:
1. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. So they must be included in any complete list of students who review Tamerlane.
2. Megregian reviews more plays than Kramer and Lopez. But neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. 
   - This means Jiang cannot review Tamerlane, because if he did, Megregian could not review it. 
   - And if Megregian reviews Tamerlane, Lopez cannot.
3. Exactly two students review exactly the same play(s). The only way this is possible given the other constraints is if Kramer and O'Neill are the two students who review the same play(s). 
   - They both review Tamerlane, and cannot review any other plays in common or it would violate this constraint.
   - This also means Lopez and Megregian cannot review Tamerlane, or they would review the same play as Kramer and O'Neill.
Therefore, the only students who could review Tamerlane are Kramer and O'Neill.
Action: Answer("B")
