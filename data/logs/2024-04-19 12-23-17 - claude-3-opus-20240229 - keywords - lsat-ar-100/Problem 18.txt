## User 2:
Topic: Law
Context: Of the eight students—George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert—in a seminar, exactly six will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
Question: Which one of the following could be the schedule of the students' reports?
Choices:
  A: Mon. morning: Helen; Mon. afternoon: Robert Tues. morning: Olivia; Tues. afternoon: Irving Wed. morning: Lenore; Wed. afternoon: Kyle
  B: Mon. morning: Irving; Mon. afternoon: Olivia Tues. morning: Helen; Tues. afternoon: Kyle Wed. morning: Nina; Wed. afternoon: Lenore
  C: Mon. morning: Lenore; Mon. afternoon: Helen Tues. morning: George; Tues. afternoon: Kyle Wed. morning: Robert; Wed. afternoon: Irving
  D: Mon. morning: Nina; Mon. afternoon: Helen Tues. morning: Robert; Tues. afternoon: Irving Wed. morning: Olivia; Wed. afternoon: Lenore
  E: Mon. morning: Olivia; Mon. afternoon: Nina Tues. morning: Irving; Tues. afternoon: Helen Wed. morning: Kyle; Wed. afternoon: George

## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. Tuesday is the only day George can give a report. This eliminates choices A, B and D.
2. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. Choice C has Robert giving a morning report on Wednesday, so this is still a possibility. Choice E has Olivia giving a morning report on Monday, so this also works so far.
3. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is on Wednesday. 
- In choice C, Nina does not give a report, so this condition doesn't apply. 
- In choice E, Nina gives an afternoon report on Monday. This means Helen and Irving must both report on Tuesday. However, choice E has Kyle reporting on Wednesday morning and George on Wednesday afternoon, violating the condition. 
Therefore, by process of elimination, the only possible correct schedule is choice C.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
