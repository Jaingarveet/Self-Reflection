Context: An administrator must assign parking spaces to six new employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young. Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
Question: For how many of the six new employees is the assignment of a parking space limited to one of only two possible spaces?
Choices:
  A: none
  B: two

## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4. This means Robertson's assignment is limited to one of four possible spaces.
2. Young must be assigned a lower-numbered parking space than Robertson. Since Robertson must be in #1-4, this means Young must be in #1, #2, or #3. So Young's assignment is limited to one of three possible spaces. 
3. Togowa must be assigned a lower-numbered parking space than Young. Since Young must be in #1-3, this means Togowa must be in #1 or #2. So Togowa's assignment is limited to one of two possible spaces.
4. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. This doesn't directly limit either Xu or Souza to only two possible spaces, since there are still multiple higher/lower options available for each.
5. No additional constraints are given for Vaughn.
In summary:
- Robertson: 4 possible spaces 
- Young: 3 possible spaces
- Togowa: 2 possible spaces
- Xu, Souza, Vaughn: More than 2 possible spaces each
Therefore, only one employee (Togowa) is limited to one of two possible parking spaces.
Action: Answer("A")

Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: D
