Context: A chemistry class has six lab sessions scheduled over three days—Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday—one session heing held each morning and one each afternoon. Each session will be led by a different lab assistant—Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, or Rebecca.

Nessa must lead an afternoon session. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
Question: If Lan does not lead a Wednesday session, then which one of the following lab assistants must lead a Thursday session?

  A: Rebecca
  B: Olivia
  C: Nessa

## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions on the same day. 
2. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions on the same day.
3. Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
4. Julio's session must be earlier in the week than Olivia's.
5. The question states that Lan does not lead a Wednesday session.
Given constraint 2, if Lan does not lead on Wednesday, then Olivia must lead on Wednesday. 
Then by constraint 4, Julio must lead a session on Wednesday morning, since his session has to be earlier than Olivia's.
By constraint 1, Kevin and Rebecca lead on the same day, which cannot be Wednesday. It also cannot be Friday, because then there would be no valid day left for Lan.
Therefore, Kevin and Rebecca must both lead sessions on Thursday.
Action: Answer("D")
