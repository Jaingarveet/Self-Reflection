Topic: Law
Context: On each of exactly seven consecutive days (day 1 though day 7), a pet shop features exactly one of three breeds of kitten—Himalayan, Manx, Siamese—and exactly one of three breeds of puppy—Greyhound, Newfoundland, Rottweiler. The following conditions must apply: Greyhounds are featured on day 1. No breed is featured on any two consecutive days. Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7. Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1. Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.
Question: If Himalayans are not featured on day 7, then which one of the following pairs of days CANNOT feature both the same breed of kitten and the same breed of puppy?
Choices:
  A: day 1 and day 3
  B: day 2 and day 6
  C: day 3 and day 5
  D: day 4 and day 6
  E: day 5 and day 7

## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. Greyhounds are featured on day 1. This eliminates choice A, since day 1 and day 3 can't have the same puppy breed.
2. No breed is featured on any two consecutive days. This means the same kitten or puppy breed can only be repeated on odd numbered days (1, 3, 5, 7) or even numbered days (2, 4, 6). 
3. Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7. Combined with the previous point, this means day 1 and day 7 must have completely different kitten and puppy breeds.
4. Himalayans are featured on exactly 3 days, but not day 1. The question also states Himalayans are not on day 7. So Himalayans must be on 3 of the days 2-6.
5. Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day with Himalayans. So Rottweilers can only be on the remaining 2 of days 2-6 that don't have Himalayans.
6. Looking at the answer choices:
   - B (day 2 and 6), D (day 4 and 6), E (day 5 and 7) are all possible since they are even days that could share breeds.
   - C (day 3 and 5) is not possible. If Himalayans are on 3 of days 2-6, then either day 3 or day 5 must have Himalayans. But then the other day must have Rottweilers (the only option left for an odd day). So day 3 and 5 cannot have matching breeds.
Therefore, day 3 and day 5 CANNOT feature both the same kitten and puppy breed.
