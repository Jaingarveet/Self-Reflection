## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. We know that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. And either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
2. Parra and Quinn work in the same zone, and Stuckey and Udall work in the same zone.
3. There are more sales reps in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
4. The question states that more sales reps work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3. 
5. Let's consider the choices:
   A) Kim works in Zone 2 - This could be true, as we don't have any information about where Kim works.
   
   B) Mahr works in Zone 2 - Similar to A, this could be true.
   
   C) Parra works in Zone 3 - This can't be true. If Parra works in Zone 3, then Quinn also works in Zone 3. But we're told that more reps work in Zone 1 than Zone 3.
   
   D) Tiao works in Zone 1 - This could be true. If Tiao works in Zone 1, then Parra works in Zone 3 (with Quinn), and Udall works in Zone 2 (with Stuckey). This satisfies all the conditions.
   
   E) Udall works in Zone 3 - This can't be true. If Udall works in Zone 3, then Stuckey also works in Zone 3. But we're told that more reps work in Zone 1 than Zone 3.
6. Therefore, the correct answer is D.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: E
Score: 0
