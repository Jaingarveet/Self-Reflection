## Assistant 2:
You're right, I made an error in my previous attempt. Let me carefully reconsider the requirements and possibilities:
The key requirements are:
1. No more than 4 French works total
2. At least 3 but no more than 4 novels total 
3. At least as many French novels as Russian novels
4. If both French plays are selected, the Russian play cannot be
With 5-6 works selected, to satisfy requirement 2, there must be at least 1-2 plays selected.
Requirement 3 means there cannot be more Russian novels than French novels. So the minimum number of French novels is the same as the number of Russian novels selected.
If no Russian novels are selected, then no French novels are required. But at least 1 French work is needed to get to 5 total. This could be a French play.
If 1 Russian novel is selected, then at least 1 French novel is required. 
If 2 Russian novels are selected, then at least 2 French novels are required.
So the organizer must select at least 1 French work, but it could be either a novel or a play, depending on the number of Russian novels. 2 French novels are not always required.
Therefore, the only answer that is always necessarily true is:
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: D
