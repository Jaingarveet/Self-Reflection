## System:
You are an expert in Law.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Context: At a concert, exactly eight compositions—F, H, L, O, P, R, S, and T—are to be performed exactly once each, consecutively and one composition at a time. The order of their performance must satisfy the following conditions: T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R. At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F. O is performed either first or fifth. The eighth composition performed is either L or H. P is performed at some time before S. At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
Question: P CANNOT be performed
Choices:
  A: second
  B: third
  C: fourth
  D: sixth
  E: seventh

## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step, making sure to consider all the constraints:
1. T is either immediately before F or immediately after R. This means there are two possible orderings for F, R and T: either F-T-R or R-T-F.
2. At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F. This means that in the F-T-R ordering, at least two compositions must be between T and R. In the R-T-F ordering, at least two compositions must be between R and T.
3. O is performed either first or fifth. This is a direct constraint on O's position.
4. The eighth composition is either L or H. This is a direct constraint on the last position.
5. P is performed at some time before S. This means P cannot be in the last position if S is not performed, and P cannot be performed after S.
6. At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O. This means that O and S cannot be adjacent in the ordering.
Now, let's consider the positions P cannot be in:
- P cannot be eighth, because that spot is reserved for L or H (constraint 4).
- P cannot be seventh, because then it would be after S if S is sixth (violating constraint 5).
- P cannot be first, because that spot is potentially for O (constraint 3).
However, P could potentially be in positions 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6, depending on the positions of the other compositions. There is not enough information to definitively rule out any of these positions for P.
Therefore, the correct answer is that P CANNOT be performed seventh.
Action: Answer("E")

Agent Answer: E
Correct Answer: E
