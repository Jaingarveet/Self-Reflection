## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step, keeping in mind the constraints and my previous reflection.
Given:
- Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions on the same day
- Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions on the same day
- Nessa must lead an afternoon session
- Julio's session must be on an earlier day than Olivia's
- Julio and Kevin both lead morning sessions
If Julio and Kevin lead morning sessions:
1. Kevin and Rebecca lead sessions on the same day. Since Kevin has a morning session, Rebecca must have the afternoon session that day.
2. Julio leads a morning session on an earlier day than Olivia. So Olivia must lead a session on Thursday or Friday. 
3. Lan cannot lead a session on the same day as Olivia. So if Olivia leads on Thursday, Lan must lead on Wednesday or Friday. If Olivia leads on Friday, Lan must lead on Wednesday or Thursday.
4. Nessa must lead an afternoon session. She could lead on any of the three days, depending on the other assignments.
Looking at the answer choices:
A: Lan's session could meet Wednesday morning, so this is possible.
B: Lan's session could meet Thursday afternoon if Olivia leads on Friday, so this is possible. 
C: Nessa's session could meet Friday afternoon, so this is possible.
D: Olivia's session could not meet Thursday morning, because Julio leads a morning session before her. This is the exception.
E: Olivia's session could meet Friday morning, so this is possible.
Therefore, the answer choice that could not be true is D: Olivia's session meets Thursday morning.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
