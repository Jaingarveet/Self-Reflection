Topic: Law
Context: A government needs to assign new ambassadors to Venezuela, Yemen, and Zambia. The candidates for these ambassadorships are Jaramillo, Kayne, Landon, Novetzke, and Ong. One ambassador will be assigned to each country, and no ambassador will be assigned to more than one country. The assignment of the ambassadors must meet the following constraints: Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships. If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne. If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen. If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
Question: The pair of candidates who are not assigned to ambassadorships could be
Choices:
  A: Jaramillo and Novetzke
  B: Jaramillo and Ong
  C: Kayne and Landon
  D: Kayne and Novetzke
  E: Landon and Ong

## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step, considering all the constraints:
1. Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned an ambassadorship. This means one of them will not be assigned.
2. If Jaramillo is assigned, then so is Kayne. The contrapositive is also true: if Kayne is not assigned, then neither is Jaramillo. 
3. If Ong is assigned to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned to Yemen. But Kayne could still be assigned to Zambia in this case.
4. If Landon is assigned, it must be to Zambia.
Now, let's consider the implications:
- From (1) and (2), we know that either both Jaramillo and Kayne are assigned, or neither are. This eliminates choices C and D.
- If Ong is assigned to Venezuela (3), then Kayne can't be assigned to Yemen, but he could still be assigned to Zambia. So Ong being assigned doesn't necessarily mean Kayne isn't.
- If Landon is assigned, it's to Zambia (4). But this doesn't directly impact the other assignments.
The key insight is that Jaramillo and Kayne are either both assigned or both unassigned. The other constraints don't force any other pair to be unassigned together.
Therefore, the correct answer is B: Jaramillo and Ong could be the pair not assigned to ambassadorships.
Action: Answer("B")
