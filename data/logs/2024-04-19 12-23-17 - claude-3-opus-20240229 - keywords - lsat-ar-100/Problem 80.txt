The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.

## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step, keeping in mind the rules and my previous errors:
1. Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. 
2. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
3. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
4. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
From rule 4, we know Robertson can only be in spaces 1-4. And from rule 3, Young must be in a lower space than Robertson.
Looking at the choices:
A: Violates rule 3 - Young is in a higher space than Robertson.
B: Violates rule 4 - Robertson is in space 5. 
C: Violates rule 1 - Togowa is in a lower space than Young.
D: Follows all the rules. Togowa < Young < Robertson, Souza < Xu, and Robertson is in space 2.
E: Violates rule 2 - Souza is in a higher space than Xu.
Therefore, the only valid assignment is choice D.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: E
Score: 0
