## Assistant 2:
## Self-Reflection
**Previous Incorrect Answer:** C: Stuckey
**Reasoning:** I incorrectly assumed that Stuckey and Quinn could not work in the same zone because they were both assigned to Zone 3. However, the prompt only states that Stuckey and Udall work in the same zone, not Quinn.
**Correct Answer:** D: Tiao
**Reasoning:**
* We know Parra and Quinn work in the same zone.
* We also know that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
* Since Parra and Quinn are in the same zone, Tiao cannot be in Zone 1 with them.
* Therefore, Tiao must be in either Zone 2 or Zone 3.
* However, we also know that either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
* Since Tiao cannot be in Zone 1 and cannot be in Zone 2 with Udall, Tiao must be in Zone 3.
* Consequently, Quinn cannot be in Zone 3 with Tiao, as they are in the same zone.
**Action:** Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
