## Assistant 2:
## Self-Reflection
**My previous incorrect answer:** C: Garcia is scheduled to testify on Wednesday.
**Reasoning behind my incorrect answer:** I mistakenly assumed that since Franco and Garcia cannot testify on the same day, and Franco is scheduled with Hong, then Garcia must be scheduled on Wednesday with Iturbe. However, this overlooks the requirement that exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
**Correct answer:** E: Iturbe is the only witness scheduled to testify on Wednesday.
**Reasoning behind the correct answer:**
* **Franco and Hong:** Since Franco and Hong are scheduled together, they cannot be on Monday (as Hong cannot be on Monday) or Tuesday (as exactly two witnesses must be on Tuesday). Therefore, they must be on Wednesday.
* **Iturbe:** Iturbe must be on Wednesday as per the given condition.
* **Garcia:** As Franco and Hong are on Wednesday, Garcia cannot be with them due to the restriction. This leaves Monday and Tuesday as possibilities for Garcia.
* **Tuesday:** Since exactly two witnesses must be on Tuesday, and Franco and Hong are already on Wednesday, Garcia cannot be on Tuesday. Therefore, Garcia must be on Monday.
* **Monday:** With Garcia on Monday, the remaining slot can be filled by either Franco or Hong. Since they are already together on Wednesday, it doesn't matter which one is on Monday.
Therefore, the only witness scheduled to testify on Wednesday is Iturbe.
**Action:** Answer("E")
