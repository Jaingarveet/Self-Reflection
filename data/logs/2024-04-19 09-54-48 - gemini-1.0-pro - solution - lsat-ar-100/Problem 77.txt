Context: An administrator must assign parking spaces to six new employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young.

Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.

## Assistant 2:
Self-reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly because I did not consider all of the rules. I only considered the rule that Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. I did not consider the rule that Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
To answer this question correctly, I need to consider all of the rules. I need to start by assigning Robertson to one of the four parking spaces that he is eligible for. Once I have assigned Robertson, I can then assign the other employees to the remaining parking spaces.
Here is one possible solution:
* Robertson: #1
* Young: #2
* Togowa: #3
* Souza: #4
* Xu: #5
* Vaughn: #6
In this solution, Young is assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa, and Robertson is assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
There are other possible solutions, but in all of them, Young and Togowa are assigned to two of the four highest-numbered parking spaces.
Therefore, the answer to the question is **B: two**.
