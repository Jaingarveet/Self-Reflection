Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
1. **Grain > Livestock > Textiles:** This establishes a hierarchy where Grain has the highest bay number, followed by Livestock, and then Textiles.
2. **Produce > Fuel:** This tells us that Produce has a higher bay number than Fuel.
3. **Textiles is next to Produce:** This means they could be in bays 4 and 5 or bays 2 and 3, but it does not specify direct adjacency.
Now, let's reconsider the options:
* **[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]:** This cannot be correct because Livestock needs to be higher than Textiles, which cannot be in [REDACTED].
* **[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]:** This is still a possibility. Livestock could be in [REDACTED], followed by Textiles in [REDACTED], and then Produce in bay 4.
* **[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]:** This cannot be correct because Livestock needs to be higher than Textiles, which cannot be in [REDACTED].
* **[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]:** This is now a valid option. Livestock could be in [REDACTED], with Grain above it in [REDACTED], and Textiles and Produce in bays 2 and 3.
* **[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]:** This cannot be correct because Livestock needs to be lower than Grain, which cannot be in [REDACTED].
Therefore, the options that satisfy all the conditions are [REDACTED] and [REDACTED].
