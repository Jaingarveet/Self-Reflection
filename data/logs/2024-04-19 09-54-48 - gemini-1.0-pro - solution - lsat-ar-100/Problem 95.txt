Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
1. Grain > Livestock: Grain is in a higher numbered bay than Livestock.
2. Livestock > Textiles: Livestock is in a higher numbered bay than Textiles.
3. Produce > Fuel: Produce is in a higher numbered bay than Fuel.
4. Textiles next to Produce: Textiles and Produce are in adjacent bays.
5. Bay 1: Since Textiles and Produce are adjacent, and Produce is higher than Fuel, then Textiles must be in Bay 1 and Produce in Bay 2.
6. Bay 2: Produce is in Bay 2 (from step 5).
7. Bay 3: Livestock is higher than Textiles (step 2) and cannot be in Bay 1 or 2 (occupied by Textiles and Produce). Therefore, Livestock is in Bay 3.
8. Bay 4: Grain is higher than Livestock (step 1) and cannot be in Bay 1, 2, or 3. Therefore, Grain is in Bay 4.
9. Bay 5: Fuel is lower than Produce (step 3) and cannot be in Bay 1, 2, or 4. Therefore, Fuel is in Bay 5.
10. Bay 6: Machinery is the only remaining cargo and must be in Bay 6.
Therefore, the cargo in the first three bays is Fuel, Machinery, and Textiles.
