## Assistant 2:
Thought:
I recall this question and my previous error. I initially focused on the time and speeds without considering the distances properly. 
The key is to recognize the turning point 3 hours before the end. At that point, Kevin was 70 miles from B, driving at 90 mph. So, he reached B in 70/90 = 7/9 hours.
This means the remaining trip back to A took 3 - 7/9 = 20/9 hours.
Since he drove back at 70 mph, the distance from B to A is 70 * (20/9) = 1400/9 miles.
Therefore, the total distance between A and B is 70 + 1400/9 = 2030/9 miles.
