## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: A car is being driven, in a straight line and at a uniform speed, towards the base of a vertical tower. The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower?
Choices:
  A: 5(√3 + 1)
  B: 6(√3 + √2)
  C: 7(√3 – 1)
  D: 8(√3 – 2)
  E: None of these

## Reflection on Previous Error:
While I don't have access to the specifics of my previous error, I recall the general approach to this type of problem involves trigonometry and relative rates. The key is to establish the relationship between the angle of elevation, the distance to the tower, and the height of the tower.  Then, using the changing angle and time, we can determine the car's speed and ultimately the time it takes to reach the base.
**Potential Error Sources:**
* **Trigonometric Ratios:**  I might have used the wrong trigonometric ratios (sine, cosine, tangent) or applied them incorrectly in the context of the problem.
* **Angle Conversion:**  The problem involves switching between degrees and radians, and an error in conversion could lead to an incorrect solution.
* **Relative Rates:**  The relationship between the rate of change of the angle and the car's speed might have been misinterpreted or miscalculated.
* **Algebraic Manipulation:**  Errors in algebraic manipulation while solving for the unknowns are always a possibility.
**Improved Approach:**
1. **Diagram:**  Start with a clear diagram illustrating the car, tower, angle of elevation, and distances involved.
2. **Trigonometric Relationships:**  Carefully choose the appropriate trigonometric ratios based on the given information and what needs to be calculated.
3. **Variable Assignment:**  Assign variables to the unknowns, such as the height of the tower, the initial distance to the tower, and the car's speed.
4. **Equations:**  Formulate equations based on the trigonometric relationships and the given information about the changing angle and time.
5. **Relative Rates:**  Establish the relationship between the rate of change of the angle and the car's speed.
6. **Solution:**  Solve the equations step-by-step, ensuring accuracy in calculations and algebraic manipulations.
7. **Verification:**  Check the solution against the problem statement and ensure it makes logical sense.
**With this improved approach, I am confident I can accurately solve the problem this time.**
