## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The previous error likely stemmed from rounding off the desired profit per unit prematurely. To avoid this, I'll calculate the required profit per unit precisely and then choose the answer that meets or exceeds this value. 
**Calculation:**
1. **Yearly profit goal:** $626,400
2. **Units produced per year:** 420 units/month * 12 months = 5040 units
3. **Required profit per unit:** $626,400 / 5040 units = $124.29 (approximately)
4. **Production cost per unit:** $110 
5. **Minimum selling price per unit:** $124.29 (profit) + $110 (cost) = $234.29
Therefore, the minimum selling price must be at least $234.29 to achieve the desired annual profit. 
Action: Answer("C")
