## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The area of the square paper is 20 cm * 20 cm = 400 sq cm.
Each semi-circle has a diameter of 20 cm, so a radius of 10 cm.
The area of one semi-circle is 1/2 * pi * r^2 = 1/2 * pi * 10^2 = 50pi sq cm.
The combined area of both semi-circles is 100pi sq cm.
The remaining area of the paper is 400 sq cm - 100pi sq cm, which is approximately 85.84 sq cm.
