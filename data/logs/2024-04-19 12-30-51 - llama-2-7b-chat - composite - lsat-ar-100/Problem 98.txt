Context: A realtor will show a prospective buyer seven houses—J, K, L, M, N, 0, and P—during a single day.

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I realized that I made a mistake in my reasoning. Here is my reflection:

Error Keywords:

* K cannot be shown in the morning
* L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown

Solution:
The correct answer is (B) L is shown at some time after J is shown.

Explanation:
The information given in the problem states that J must be shown in the evening, and K cannot be shown in the morning. This means that K must be shown in the afternoon. Additionally, the problem states that L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown. Since K is shown in the afternoon, L must be shown at some time after K is shown and before M is shown, which is in the evening. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) L is shown at some time after J is shown.

Advice:
When solving this problem, it is important to carefully read and understand the information given in the problem. Pay attention to the restrictions and requirements stated in the problem, and use logical reasoning to determine the correct answer. It is also helpful to use a diagram or flowchart to visualize the order in which the houses are shown and to ensure that the rules are being followed correctly.
