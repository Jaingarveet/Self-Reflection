Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.

Reflection:

Error Keywords:

* Souza
* Togowa
* Vaughn
* Xu

Solution:

After reflecting on my previous answer, I realized that I made a mistake in my solution. If Robertson is assigned parking space #3, then the correct answer is (B) Togowa is assigned parking space #2.

Explanation:

* Robertson is assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young, so Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
* Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa, so Young must be assigned parking space #5 or #6.
* Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, so Xu must be assigned parking space #3 or #4.
* Vaughn must be assigned parking space #5.
* Souza must be assigned parking space #6.

Therefore, the only possible assignment of parking spaces to the six employees is:

Robertson: parking space #3
Souza: parking space #6
Togowa: parking space #2
Vaughn: parking space #5
Xu: parking space #4
Young: parking space #5

Advice:

When solving this problem, it is important to carefully follow the given rules and constraints. In this case, it was crucial to keep track of the assigned parking spaces for each employee and to use logical reasoning to determine the possible assignments.
