Problem:
The schedule must meet the following conditions: Franco does not testify on the same day that Garcia testifies. Iturbe testifies on Wednesday. Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday. Hong does not testify on Monday. At least one witness testifies on Monday.

When solving this problem, it's essential to carefully read and understand the conditions given in the problem. In this case, it's crucial to note that Franco and Garcia cannot testify on the same day. Also, it's important to pay attention to the order of the days of the week and the number of witnesses testifying on each day.
