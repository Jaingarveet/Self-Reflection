Context: Of the eight students—George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert—in a seminar, exactly six will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.

Choices:
  A: Helen gives a report on Monday.
  B: Irving gives a report on Monday.

## Assistant 2:
  Topic: Law
Question: If Helen, Kyle, and Lenore, not necessarily in that order, give the three morning reports, which one of the following must be true?

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I realized that I made a mistake in my reasoning. Here is my self-reflection:

Error Keywords:

* I misunderstood the condition that states "Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report." I thought that George could give a report on any day, including Monday and Wednesday.
* I overlooked the condition that states "Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report." I thought that either Olivia or Robert could give an afternoon report.

Solution:
The correct answer is (B) Irving gives a report on Monday.

Explanation:
The information given in the problem states that exactly two reports will be given each day, one in the morning and one in the afternoon. Since Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report, and neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report, the only possible combination of morning and afternoon reports is:

Monday: Helen, Kyle, and Lenore give reports in the morning.
Tuesday: George gives a report in the morning, and Irving gives a report in the afternoon.
Wednesday: Helen, Kyle, and Lenore give reports in the morning, and Nina gives a report in the afternoon.

Therefore, if Helen, Kyle, and Lenore give the three morning reports, Irving must give his report on Monday.

Advice:
When solving this problem, it is important to carefully read and understand the conditions given in the problem. Pay attention to the keywords and phrases that indicate the restrictions and possibilities for the reports. Also, make sure to use a logical and systematic approach to determine the possible combinations of reports.
