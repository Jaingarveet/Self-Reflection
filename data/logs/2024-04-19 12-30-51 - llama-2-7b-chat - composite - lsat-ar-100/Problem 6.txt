C: Megregian reviews more of the plays than O'Neill does.
D: O'Neill reviews more of the plays than Jiang does.
E: O'Neill reviews more of the plays than Kramer does.

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and then I reflected on my solution and the correct answer. I realized that I misunderstood the conditions of the problem. Here is my revised answer:

The correct answer is (B) Megregian reviews more of the plays than Jiang does.

Explanation:
The problem states that Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian, which means that Megregian reviews at least 2 of the plays (Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation). Since Jiang does not review any of the plays that Kramer and Lopez review, Jiang must review fewer plays than Megregian. Therefore, Megregian reviews more plays than Jiang does.

Solution:
I made an error in my initial answer by not fully understanding the conditions of the problem. I misunderstood the relationship between the number of plays reviewed by each student and the number of plays reviewed by Kramer and Lopez.

Instructions:
To solve this problem, it is important to carefully read and understand the conditions of the problem. Pay attention to the relationships between the different students and the plays they review.

Advice:
When solving this type of problem, it can be helpful to create a diagram or chart to visualize the relationships between the different students and the plays they review. This can help you identify the correct answer more easily.
