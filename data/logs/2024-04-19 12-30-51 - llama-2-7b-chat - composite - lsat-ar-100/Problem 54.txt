  Topic: Law
Context: For the school paper, five students—Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, Megregian, and O'Neill—each review one or more of exactly three plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation, but do not review any other plays. The following conditions must apply: Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
Question: If Jiang does not review Tamerlane, then which one of the following must be true?

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand the mistake. Here is my reflection on the problem, my solution, and the correct answer:

Error Keywords:

* I mistakenly assumed that if Jiang does not review Tamerlane, then Lopez must review Undulation. However, the problem statement does not explicitly state this, and there is no information in the problem that suggests it.
* I also mistakenly assumed that if Kramer and Lopez each review fewer plays than Megregian, then Lopez must review fewer plays than Megregian. However, the problem statement only states that Kramer and Lopez each review fewer plays than Megregian, without specifying the order in which they review the plays.

Solution:

* I should have realized that if Jiang does not review Tamerlane, then Lopez could review any of the three plays (Sunset, Tamerlane, or Undulation).
* I should have also realized that if Kramer and Lopez each review fewer plays than Megregian, then Lopez could review fewer plays than Megregian, but it is not necessarily true that Lopez reviews fewer plays than Megregian.

Correct Answer:

* If Jiang does not review Tamerlane, then Lopez could review any of the three plays (Sunset, Tamerlane, or Undulation).
* Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.

Advice:

* When solving a problem, it is important to carefully read and understand the problem statement, and to avoid making assumptions that are not explicitly stated in the problem.
* When solving a problem, it is important to use the information provided in the problem to eliminate incorrect options and arrive at the correct answer.
* When solving a problem, it is important to reflect on your solution and the correct answer to ensure that you have arrived at the correct conclusion.
