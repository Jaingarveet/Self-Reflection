Error Keywords: Franco, Garcia, Hong, Iturbe, and Jackson
Solution: I mistakenly selected option A, which states that Franco is scheduled to testify on Wednesday. However, the correct answer is option C, which states that Garcia is scheduled to testify on Tuesday.

Explanation:
The correct answer is option C, Garcia is scheduled to testify on Tuesday. This is because the conditions of the problem state that Franco does not testify on the same day as Garcia, and Iturbe testifies on Wednesday. Therefore, Garcia must testify on Tuesday.

Advice: When solving this problem, it is important to carefully read and understand the conditions of the problem, and to use logical reasoning to determine the correct answer. It can be helpful to create a diagram or chart to visualize the schedule and the relationships between the witnesses.
