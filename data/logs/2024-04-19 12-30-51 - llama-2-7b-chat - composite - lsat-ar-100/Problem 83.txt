Initial Answer:
I previously answered this question incorrectly. I selected Choice (B) Lan's session meets Thursday afternoon. However, upon further reflection, I realized that Lan cannot lead an afternoon session because the problem states that Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day. Therefore, the correct answer is Choice (E) Olivia's session meets Friday morning.

Explanation:

The correct answer is Choice (E) Olivia's session meets Friday morning. This is because if Julio and Kevin both lead morning sessions, then Olivia's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Kevin's session. Since Kevin's session meets on Wednesday morning, Olivia's session must meet on Thursday morning.

[REDACTED]

In conclusion, the correct answer is Choice (E) Olivia's session meets Friday morning. I hope this helps you in your studies. If you have any questions or need further clarification, please feel free to ask.
