Question: If the veterinarian is in space 5, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: The optometrist is in space 2.
  B: The pharmacy is in space 7.
  C: A restaurant is in space 4.
  D: The shoe store is in space 6.
  E: The toy store is in space 3.

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, stating that the optometrist was in space 2. However, upon further reflection, I realized that this answer was incorrect. The pharmacy must be at one end of the row, and one of the restaurants must be at the other end. Therefore, the pharmacy cannot be in space 7.

Using the constraints provided, we can eliminate options A, B, and E. The pharmacy is not in space 7, so option B is incorrect. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so option E is incorrect. The optometrist must be next to either the pharmacy or the veterinarian, so option A is also incorrect.

Therefore, the correct answer is option C: A restaurant is in space 4.
## Result:
Agent Answer: None
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
