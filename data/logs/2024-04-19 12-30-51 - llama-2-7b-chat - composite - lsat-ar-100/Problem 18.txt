Question: Which one of the following could be the schedule of the students' reports?

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I realized that I made a mistake in my reasoning. I will use my self-reflection to help me answer this question correctly.

Error Keywords:

* I mistakenly assumed that Nina's report would be given on Monday, which led me to choose the wrong schedule in option B.
* I failed to notice that Robert cannot give an afternoon report on Tuesday, which is mentioned in the problem statement.

Solution:
The correct schedule for the students' reports is:

Mon. morning: Helen
Mon. afternoon: Robert
Tues. morning: George
Tues. afternoon: Kyle
Wed. morning: Lenore
Wed. afternoon: Irving

Explanation:
The conditions given in the problem statement are:

* Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report.
* Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
* If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.

Using these conditions, we can deduce the following schedule:

Monday:

* Helen gives a report in the morning.
* Robert gives a report in the afternoon.

Tuesday:

* George gives a report in the morning.
* Kyle gives a report in the afternoon.

Wednesday:

* Lenore gives a report in the morning.
* Irving gives a report in the afternoon.

Therefore, the correct answer is option E.
