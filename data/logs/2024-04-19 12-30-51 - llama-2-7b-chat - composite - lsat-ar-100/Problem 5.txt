Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, stating that E: F is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf L is placed on was the correct answer. However, upon further reflection, I realize that the correct answer is actually D: G is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf O is placed on.

Here's my reasoning:

* More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, so the bottom shelf must contain at least two books.
* I is placed on the middle shelf, so there are at least two books on the top and bottom shelves.
* K is placed on a higher shelf than F, so K must be placed on the bottom shelf.
* O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so O must be placed on the middle shelf.
* Since G is placed on a higher shelf than O, G must be placed on the top shelf.

Therefore, the correct answer is D: G is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf O is placed on.

Advice: When answering this question, it's important to carefully analyze the information provided and to pay attention to the conditions specified in the problem. It's also helpful to use visual aids, such as diagrams or mental images, to help you visualize the bookcase and its contents. By taking the time to carefully consider the problem and use the correct reasoning, you can arrive at the correct answer.
