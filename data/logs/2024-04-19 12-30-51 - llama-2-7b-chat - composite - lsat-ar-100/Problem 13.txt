## Assistant 2:
  Reflection:

I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand the mistake now. Let's go through the problem step-by-step:

1. Franco does not testify on the same day as Garcia, so Franco cannot testify on Monday.

Error: I mistakenly selected option (A) Franco is scheduled to testify on Wednesday.

2. Iturbe testifies on Wednesday, so at least one witness must testify on Monday.

Correct: Hong must testify on Tuesday, as there is only one witness scheduled to testify on Monday.

3. Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.

Correct: Therefore, Jackson must testify on Wednesday, as there are exactly two witnesses scheduled to testify on Tuesday.

The correct answer is (D) Hong testifies on Tuesday.

The schedule that meets all the conditions is:

Monday: Franco, Garcia, Hong
Tuesday: Iturbe, Jackson
Wednesday: None

I hope this reflection helps me avoid making the same mistake in the future. Thank you for the opportunity to reflect and improve!
