## System:
You are an expert in Law.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Law
Context: A panel of five scientists will be formed. The panelists will be selected from among three botanists—F, G, and H—three chemists—K, L, and M—and three zoologists—P, Q, and R. Selection is governed by the following conditions: The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types. If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. F and K cannot both be selected. K and M cannot both be selected. If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
Question: If P is the only zoologist selected, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: If K is selected, G cannot be selected.
  B: If L is selected, F cannot be selected.
  C: If exactly one chemist is selected, it must be K.
  D: If exactly two chemists are selected, F cannot be selected.
  E: If exactly two chemists are selected, G cannot be selected.

## Assistant 2:
  Topic: Law
Context: A panel of five scientists will be formed.
Question: If P is the only zoologist selected, which one of the following must be true?

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I realized that I made a mistake in my reasoning. Here is my self-reflection:

Error Keywords:

* I misunderstood the condition that states if more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
* I overlooked the condition that states if M is selected, both P and R must be selected.

Solution:
The correct answer is (C): If exactly one chemist is selected, it must be K.

Explanation:
If P is the only zoologist selected, then at most one botanist can be selected. Since more than one botanist is selected, K must be selected. Since M is selected, both P and R must be selected. Therefore, the only possible combination is: K, P, R.

Advice:
When solving this problem, it is essential to carefully read and understand the conditions given. Pay close attention to the constraints on the selection of scientists and ensure that you are following them correctly. Also, try to identify any keywords or phrases that can help you narrow down the possible combinations of scientists.
