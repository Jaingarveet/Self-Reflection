Service targets will be set at 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day. Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail. The six targets are set according to the following conditions: None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
Question: If Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, which one of the following must be true?

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I realized that I made a mistake in my solution. Here is my self-reflection:

Error Keywords:

* Image's voicemail target is not 2 days.
* Solide's website target is not 2 days.

Solution:
The correct answer is (C) Image's website target is 1 day.

Explanation:
If Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, then Image's website target must be 1 day. This is because Image's voicemail target is shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets, and Solide's website target is shorter than Truvest's website target. Therefore, Image's website target must be 1 day to meet the condition that Image's voicemail target is shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.

Advice:
When solving this problem, it is essential to carefully read the conditions given in the problem statement and to pay attention to the relationships between the different targets. It is also important to use logical reasoning and to eliminate incorrect options based on the given information.
