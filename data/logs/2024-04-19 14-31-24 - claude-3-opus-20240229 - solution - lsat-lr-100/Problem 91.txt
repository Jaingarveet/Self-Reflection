Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.

The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Law
Context: People who are allergic to cats are actually allergic to certain proteins found in the animals' skin secretions and saliva; which particular proteins are responsible, however, varies from allergy sufferer to allergy sufferer. Since all cats shed skin and spread saliva around their environment, there is no such thing as a cat incapable of provoking allergic reactions, although it is common for a given cat to cause an allergic reaction in some-but not all-people who are allergic to cats.
Question: Which one of the following statements is most strongly supported by the information above?
Choices:
  A: Any particular individual will be allergic to some breeds of cat but not to others.
  B: No cat is capable of causing an allergic reaction in all types of allergy sufferers.
  C: Not all cats are identical with respect to the proteins contained in their skin secretions and saliva.
  D: The allergic reactions of some people who are allergic to cats are more intense than the allergic reactions of other allergy sufferers.
  E: There is no way to predict whether a given cat will produce an allergic reaction in a particular allergy sufferer.
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
The passage states that the particular proteins responsible for cat allergies "varies from allergy sufferer to allergy sufferer." For the proteins to vary between sufferers, the proteins themselves must differ between cats. If all cats had identical proteins, the allergic reaction would be the same for everyone. Therefore, the passage implies that not all cats have the same proteins in their skin secretions and saliva (Choice C). While the passage also supports that no cat causes allergies in everyone (Choice B), this is a secondary point compared to the direct implication about differing proteins.
## Assistant 2:
You're right, upon further reflection, Choice C is most strongly supported by the information provided.
The key points are:
1) The proteins responsible for cat allergies vary from person to person
2) For the proteins to vary, they must differ between cats
If all cats had the exact same proteins, the allergic reaction would be consistent across all allergy sufferers. But since the passage states the responsible proteins vary by person, it directly implies that the proteins themselves are not identical across all cats.
While the passage also suggests no single cat causes allergies in everyone (Choice B), this is more of a secondary implication compared to the direct statement about the proteins differing.
Therefore, Choice C - that not all cats have identical proteins in their skin and saliva - has the strongest textual support.
Action: Answer("C")
