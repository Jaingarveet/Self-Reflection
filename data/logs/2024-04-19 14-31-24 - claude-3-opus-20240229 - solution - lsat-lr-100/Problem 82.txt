Topic: Law
Context: Patricia: During Japan's Tokugawa period, martial arts experts known as ninjas were trained for the purposes of espionage and assassination. Yet at that time there was actually very little ninja activity in Japan, and most Japanese did not fear ninjas. Tamara: That is not true. Many wealthy Japanese during the Tokugawa period had their houses constructed with intentionally squeaky floors so that they would receive warning if a ninja were in the house.
Question: Of the following, which one, if true, is the strongest counter Patricia can make to Tamara's objection?
Choices:
  A: Many poor Japanese during the Tokugawa period also had houses constructed with intentionally squeaky floors.
  B: As part of their secret training, ninjas learned to walk on squeaky floors without making a sound.
  C: The wealthy made up a small portion of Japan's population during the Tokugawa period.
  D: The fighting prowess of ninjas was exaggerated to mythic proportions in the years following the Tokngawa period.
  E: There were very few ninjas at any time other than during the Tokugawa period.

Solution:
Patricia's main claim is that there was little ninja activity during the Tokugawa period and most Japanese did not fear ninjas at that time. 
Tamara objects by pointing out that many wealthy Japanese had squeaky floors installed to warn of ninjas, suggesting they did fear ninjas.
However, the wealthy made up only a small portion of Japan's population during the Tokugawa period (Choice C). 
So even if the wealthy feared ninjas, this is consistent with Patricia's claim that most Japanese did not.
The prevalence of fear among a small subgroup does not contradict the assertion about the population as a whole.
## Assistant 2:
You're right, I made an error in my previous answer. Let me think through this again step-by-step:
Patricia's main point is that there was little ninja activity during the Tokugawa period and most Japanese did not fear ninjas at that time.
Tamara objects by noting that many wealthy Japanese had squeaky floors installed specifically to warn of ninjas, suggesting they did fear ninjas.
Looking at the answer choices:
A) The flooring of poor people's houses is not directly relevant to the fear of ninjas among the wealthy.
B) Ninjas being able to avoid detection on squeaky floors would not counter the implication that the floors were installed out of fear of ninjas.
C) If the wealthy were only a small portion of the population, then even if they feared ninjas, this is still consistent with Patricia's claim that most Japanese overall did not. 
D) and E) The reputation and prevalence of ninjas in other time periods doesn't directly address the objection about fear during the Tokugawa period specifically.
Therefore, C is the strongest counter - it explains how the wealthy fearing ninjas does not necessarily contradict Patricia's point about the feelings of most Japanese people at the time.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
