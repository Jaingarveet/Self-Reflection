Topic: Law
Context: Teacher: Participating in organized competitive athletics may increase a child's strength and coordination. As critics point out, however, it also instills in those children who are not already well developed in these respects a feeling of inferiority that never really disappears. Yet, since research has shown that adults with feelings of inferiority become more successful than those free of such anxieties, funding for children's athletic programs should not be eliminated.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes the role played in the teacher's argument by the assertion that participating in organized competitive athletics may increase a child's strength and coordination?
Choices:
  A: It is mentioned as one possible reason for adopting a policy for which the teacher suggests an additional reason.
  B: It is a claim that the teacher attempts to refute with counterarguments.
  C: It is a hypothesis for which the teacher offers additional evidence.
  D: It is cited as an insufficient reason for eliminating funding for children's athletic programs.
  E: It is cited as an objection that has been raised to the position that the teacher is supporting.

Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
The teacher's argument can be broken down as follows:
1. Participating in competitive athletics may increase a child's strength and coordination. 
2. Critics argue that athletics can also make less developed children feel inferior, a feeling that persists.
3. However, research shows that adults with feelings of inferiority become more successful.
4. Therefore, funding for children's athletic programs should not be eliminated.
The assertion that participating in athletics may increase strength and coordination is mentioned as one possible reason to support athletic programs. The teacher then suggests an additional reason to maintain funding (that feelings of inferiority can lead to later success), in order to counter the critics' argument. Therefore, choice [REDACTED] most accurately describes the role of the assertion in question.
## Assistant 2:
Let's analyze the role of the assertion that participating in athletics may increase a child's strength and coordination in the teacher's overall argument:
1. The teacher acknowledges this potential benefit of athletic participation.
2. However, the teacher then presents a counterargument from critics - that athletics can make less developed children feel inferior long-term. 
3. The teacher counters the critics by citing research showing feelings of inferiority in adults can lead to more success.
4. The teacher concludes funding for athletics should be maintained.
The initial assertion about increasing strength and coordination is not the main reason the teacher argues for maintaining funding. Rather, it is mentioned as one possible benefit that the teacher acknowledges before presenting the critics' counterargument.
The key to the teacher's argument is countering the critics by suggesting childhood feelings of inferiority from athletics may actually be beneficial, leading to more successful adults. This is the teacher's main reason to maintain athletic funding.
Therefore, the assertion that athletics may increase strength and coordination is cited as an insufficient reason on its own for maintaining funding for athletics programs. The teacher provides an additional reason to counter the critics' argument against this.
