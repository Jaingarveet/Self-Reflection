# Model: gemini-1.0-pro | Agent: instructions | Exam: sat-math-100 | Problem 80 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: $$\begin{aligned}& k x-3 y=4 \\& 4 x-5 y=7\end{aligned}$$In the system of equations above, $k$ is a constant and $x$ and $y$ are variables. For what value of $k$ will the system of equations have no solution?
Choices:
  A: $\frac{12}{5}$
  B: $\frac{16}{7}$
  C: $-\frac{16}{7}$
  D: $-\frac{12}{5}$
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Multiply both equations by appropriate constants to make the coefficients of one variable equal but opposite.
2. Subtract one equation from the other to eliminate one variable.
3. Solve for the remaining variable.
4. Substitute the value of the solved variable back into one of the original equations.
5. Solve for the other variable.
6. Substitute the values of both variables into the other original equation.
7. Solve for the constant $k$.
8. Double-check all calculations and steps to ensure accuracy.
9. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
