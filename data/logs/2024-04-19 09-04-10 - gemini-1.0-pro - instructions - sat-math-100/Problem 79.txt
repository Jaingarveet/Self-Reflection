## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: A helicopter, initially hovering 40 feet above the ground, begins to gain altitude at a rate of 21 feet per second. Which of the following functions represents the helicopter's altitude above the ground $y$, in feet, $t$ seconds after the helicopter begins to gain altitude?
Choices:
  A: $y=40+21$
  B: $y=40+21 t$
  C: $y=40-21 t$
  D: $y=40 t+21$
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Identify the initial value (y-intercept).
2. Identify the rate of change (slope).
3. Determine the equation of the line using the slope-intercept form: $y=mx+b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept.
4. Substitute the values of the slope and y-intercept into the equation.
5. Simplify the equation.

## Self-Reflection
**Previous Incorrect Answer:** C: $y=40-21 t$
**Reasoning for Incorrect Answer:** I mistakenly interpreted the rate of change as a decrease in altitude instead of an increase.
**Correct Answer:** B: $y=40+21 t$
**Reasoning for Correct Answer:**
1. **Initial value (y-intercept):** The helicopter starts at an altitude of 40 feet, so the y-intercept is 40.
2. **Rate of change (slope):** The helicopter gains altitude at a rate of 21 feet per second, so the slope is 21.
3. **Equation of the line:** Using the slope-intercept form, the equation of the line is $y=21t+40$.
4. **Substitution:** Substituting the values of the slope and y-intercept, we get $y=21t+40$.
5. **Simplification:** The equation is already in its simplest form.
Therefore, the correct function representing the helicopter's altitude is $y=40+21 t$.
**Action:** Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
