## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: A circle in the $x y$-plane has center $(5,7)$ and radius 2. Which of the following is an equation of the circle?
Choices:
  A: $(x-5)^{2}+(y-7)^{2}=4$
  B: $(x+5)^{2}+(y+7)^{2}=4$
  C: $(x-5)^{2}+(y-7)^{2}=2$
  D: $(x+5)^{2}+(y+7)^{2}=2$

## Assistant 2:
I understand. I will reflect on my previous mistake and use the information to answer the question correctly this time.
**Self-reflection:**
* **Mistake:** I incorrectly chose option A in my previous attempt.
* **Reason for mistake:** I mistakenly used the radius as the coefficient for both the x and y terms in the equation.
* **Correct approach:** The radius represents the distance from the center to any point on the circle. Therefore, the equation should be written as $(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2$, where $(h, k)$ is the center and $r$ is the radius.
**Answer:**
Based on the self-reflection and the correct approach, the equation of the circle is:
$(x - 5)^2 + (y - 7)^2 = 2^2$
Therefore, the correct answer is **C: $(x-5)^{2}+(y-7)^{2}=2$**.
**Action:** Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
