Question: $$0.10 x+0.20 y=0.18(x+y)$$Clayton will mix $x$ milliliters of a $10 \%$ by mass saline solution with $y$ milliliters of a $20 \%$ by mass saline solution in order to create an $18 \%$ by mass saline solution. The equation above represents this situation. If Clayton uses 100 milliliters of the $20 \%$ by mass saline solution, how many milliliters of the $10 \%$ by mass saline solution must he use?
Choices:
  A: 5
  B: 25
  C: 50
  D: 100

## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The equation is $0.10x+0.20y=0.18(x+y)$.
We are given that $y=100$.
We need to find $x$.
Substituting $y=100$ into the equation, we get $0.10x+0.20(100)=0.18(x+100)$.
Simplifying the equation, we get $0.10x+20=0.18x+18$.
Solving for $x$, we get $x=50$.
Therefore, Clayton must use 50 milliliters of the $10 \%$ by mass saline solution.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
