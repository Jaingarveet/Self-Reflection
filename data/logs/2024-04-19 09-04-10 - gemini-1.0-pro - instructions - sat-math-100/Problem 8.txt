Question: Alma bought a laptop computer at a store that gave a 20 percent discount off its original price. The total amount she paid to the cashier was $p$ dollars, including an 8 percent sales tax on the discounted price. Which of the following represents the original price of the computer in terms of $p$ ?
Choices:
  A: $0.88 p$
  B: $\frac{p}{0.88}$

Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Identify the original price of the computer as x.
2. Calculate the discounted price by multiplying the original price by (1 - discount).
3. Calculate the final price by multiplying the discounted price by (1 + sales tax).
4. Set the final price equal to p dollars.
5. Solve for x by isolating it on one side of the equation.
6. Express the original price in terms of p.

## Self-Reflection (Previous Incorrect Answer)
**Mistake:** I incorrectly calculated the discounted price by subtracting the discount from the original price instead of multiplying.
**Corrected Approach:**
1. **Original price:** $x$ dollars
2. **Discounted price:** $x$ * (1 - 0.20) = 0.80x dollars
3. **Final price:** 0.80x * (1 + 0.08) = 0.864x dollars
4. **Setting final price equal to p:** 0.864x = p
5. **Solving for x:** x = p / 0.864
6. **Expressing original price in terms of p:** $\frac{p}{0.864}$
Therefore, the original price of the computer in terms of p is $\frac{p}{0.864}$.
