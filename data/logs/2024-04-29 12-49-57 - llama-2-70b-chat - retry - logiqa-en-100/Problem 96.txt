Context: Based on the following questions? Most people think that advertisers do whatever they can to attract customers.But advertisers are not always like this.Recently, in order to expand sales, a family magazine called "Bay" was renamed "Inferno", which mainly published violent and pornographic content.As a result, some perennial advertisers from the original "Bay" magazine refused to renew the contract and turned to other publications.This shows that these advertisers not only consider economic benefits, but also take into account their ethical responsibilities.
Question: If the following item is true, can the argument be strengthened most?
Choices:
  A: The cost and selling price of "Inferno" are lower than that of "Harbour".
  B: The above advertisers who refused to renew their contracts have not affected the benefits after switching to other publications.
  C: Readers of family magazines are generally not interested in violent and pornographic content.

## Assistant 2:
  This question is asking which piece of information, if true, would strengthen the argument that advertisers consider ethical responsibilities in addition to economic benefits.
The correct answer is C: Readers of family magazines are generally not interested in violent and pornographic content.
This piece of information strengthens the argument by suggesting that the advertisers who refused to renew their contracts with "Inferno" did so because they were not interested in reaching readers who were interested in violent and pornographic content. This suggests that the advertisers were taking into account their ethical responsibilities, rather than just economic benefits.

The other options do not strengthen the argument:

A: The cost and selling price of "Inferno" are lower than that of "Harbour". This information does not address the advertisers' motivations or ethical considerations.

B: The above advertisers who refused to renew their contracts have not affected the benefits after switching to other publications. This information does not provide any insight into the advertisers' motivations for refusing to renew their contracts.

D: Some clients who advertise in other family magazines and so on turn to "Inferno" magazine. This information actually weakens the argument, as it suggests that some advertisers are interested in reaching the audience of "Inferno" despite its violent and pornographic content.

Therefore, the answer is C: Readers of family magazines are generally not interested in violent and pornographic content.
## Result:
Agent Answer: None
