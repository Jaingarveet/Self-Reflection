Question: Which of the following, if true, can best refute the above argument?
Choices:
  A: The cave inspired the description of hell in Greek mythology
  B: The cave is actually an ancient cemetery and funeral venue
  C: There is no prehistoric village in Europe that has been found earlier than the cave
  D: The entrance to the cave collapsed 5000 years ago

Answer: "D: The entrance to the cave collapsed 5000 years ago"

The correct answer is D. The entrance to the cave collapsed 5000 years ago. This answer refutes the argument that hundreds of people lived in the cave because if the entrance had collapsed 5000 years ago, it would have been impossible for people to enter and live in the cave during that time.

The other options do not refute the argument. Option A, the cave inspired the description of hell in Greek mythology, does not provide any evidence that the cave was not inhabited by hundreds of people. Option B, the cave is actually an ancient cemetery and funeral venue, does not necessarily contradict the idea that hundreds of people lived in the cave, as it is possible that the cave was used for both purposes. Option C, there is no prehistoric village in Europe that has been found earlier than the cave, does not provide any information about the inhabitability of the cave.
## Result:
