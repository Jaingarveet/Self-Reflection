## Assistant 2:
  I'm sorry, but you didn't provide any reflection information. Therefore, I cannot use your self-reflection to help you answer this question. However, I can give you a hint: the correct answer is choice B.

Here's why:
The survey showed that 63% of respondents favored college students as nannies, but when asked if they would ask college students to be nannies, nearly 60% said "no." This seemingly contradictory phenomenon can be explained by the fact that people may have different preferences and expectations when it comes to nannies. While some may view college students as suitable nannies, others may not want to hire them for various reasons.

One possible reason is that people may think college students are not affordable. This is supported by choice B, which states that 62% of survey respondents were only willing to pay a monthly salary of 800 yuan to 1,000 yuan for a college nanny. This suggests that people may not want to hire college students as nannies because they cannot afford to pay them a higher salary.

Therefore, choice B is the best explanation for the seemingly contradictory phenomenon.
