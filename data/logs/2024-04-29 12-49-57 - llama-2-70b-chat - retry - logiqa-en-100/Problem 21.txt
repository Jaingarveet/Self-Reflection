Context: Xiao Chen? At present, part of the orbit of Comet 1996D3 is far from the sun, but recently it can be found to emit flickering light through the solar telescope.In the past, people never observed such flashes of comets far away from the sun, so this flicker must be an unusual scene.Xiao Wang? Normally people don't observe comets far away from the sun.The 1996D3 comet flicker light discovered this time was obtained by continuous and careful tracking observation.

## Assistant 2:
  I'm sorry, but you didn't provide any reflection information. Therefore, I cannot use your self-reflection to help you answer this question. However, I can give you a hint: the answer is not choice A.

The correct answer is choice D: Disagree with Xiao Chen's conclusion, and put forward another explanation for Xiao Chen's argument.

Xiao Wang refuted Xiao Chen's views by providing an alternative explanation for the flickering light observed from Comet 1996D3. Xiao Wang did not point out any ambiguity in Xiao Chen's key concepts (choice A), nor did they argue that Xiao Chen's argument was lacking in persuasion (choice B) or that Xiao Chen's arguments contradict themselves (choice C). Instead, Xiao Wang presented a different explanation for the observed phenomenon, which is option D.

Therefore, the answer is D: Disagree with Xiao Chen's conclusion, and put forward another explanation for Xiao Chen's argument.
