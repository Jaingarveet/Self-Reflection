Context: According to a report, in the year to March, mainland Chinese buyers became the second largest group of foreign buyers buying US real estate, with a transaction volume of US $ 9 billion, second only to Canada.This is 23% higher than the previous year ’s USD 7.3 billion transaction volume and 88% higher than the previous year ’s USD 4.8 billion transaction volume.Some people think that there are more and more rich people in China who are transferring their property abroad.
Question: Which of the following is true is the best argument against the above argument
Choices:
  ?: Although the turnover has increased by 23%, the volume of Chinese buyers has not increased this year
  C: There are groups of real estate speculators among the wealthy Chinese who have speculated in Beijing and Shanghai

## Assistant 2:
  I apologize for my previous mistake. After reflecting on the problem, I realized that my previous answer was incorrect. The best argument against the argument that there are more and more rich people in China who are transferring their property abroad is:

D: The risk of the US real estate market has been small in recent years and has a certain function of value preservation and appreciation.

This choice suggests that the increase in transaction volume among Chinese buyers may be due to the relatively low risk of the US real estate market, which has a function of value preservation and appreciation. This argument does not necessarily contradict the fact that there are more rich people in China transferring their property abroad, but it provides an alternative explanation for the increase in transaction volume.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
