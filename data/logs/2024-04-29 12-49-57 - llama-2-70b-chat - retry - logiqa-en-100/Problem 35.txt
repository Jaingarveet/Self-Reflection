## Assistant 2:
  I'm not able to view the reflection information as it's not provided. However, I can give a solution to the problem.

Let's break down the information given:

1. Li was hired by Tianshu.
2. Li and Zhao were not hired by the same unit.
3. Liu and Zhao were hired by the same unit.
4. If Zhang was hired by Tianxuan, then Wang was hired by Tianxuan.

From (1), we know that Li is not hired by Tianji or Tianxuan.
From (2), we know that Zhao is not hired by Tianshu or Tianji.
From (3), we know that Liu is hired by Tianxuan.
From (4), we can deduce that Zhang is not hired by Tianxuan, otherwise, Wang would be hired by Tianxuan, but we know that Li is hired by Tianshu, so Zhang cannot be hired by Tianxuan.

Now, let's look at the choices:

A. Li and Liu were hired by the same unit.
This is false. Li is hired by Tianshu, and Liu is hired by Tianxuan.

B. Wang, Zhao, and Liu were all hired by Tianji.
This is false. Liu is hired by Tianxuan, and Li is hired by Tianshu.

C. Only Liu was hired by Tian Xuan.
This is true. From (3), we know that Liu is hired by Tianxuan, and from (4), we know that Wang is not hired by Tianxuan.

D. Only Wang was hired by Tianxuan.
This is false. From (4), we know that if Zhang was hired by Tianxuan, then Wang would be hired by Tianxuan, but we know that Zhang is not hired by Tianxuan.

Therefore, the correct answer is C. Only Liu was hired by Tian Xuan.
