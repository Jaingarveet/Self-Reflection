## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Given that X and F are in the same department, and F must be in the production department, X must also be in the production department. According to condition (3), if X is in the sales department, W must be in the production department. However, since X is not in the sales department, there is no requirement for W's placement. Therefore, W can be in any department, including public relations. 
Choices A, B, and C do not contradict any of the conditions. However, choice D, which states that W is assigned to the public relations department, is possible and does not contradict any conditions. Therefore, all of the statements can be true.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: B
