## System:
You are an expert in Logic.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Advice:
- Always read the question and conditions carefully.
- Understand the meaning of conditional words like "unless".
- Break down complex problems into simpler parts.
- Double-check your understanding and your work.
- Practice logical reasoning problems to improve your skills.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The conditions are as follows:
1. Either E or F, but not both, must participate.
2. Either J or K, but not both, must participate.
3. If J participates, then G must participate.
4. Unless F participates, M does not participate.
Let's analyze the choices:
A: F and H - If F participates, E cannot. This leaves us with two more spots. H can be one of them, but the last spot cannot be filled because if we choose J, we must also choose G, and if we choose K, M cannot participate because F is already participating. So, this choice is not possible.
B: G and J - If G and J participate, E or F can participate, but not both. If E participates, the last spot can be filled by K. If F participates, the last spot cannot be filled by M because F is already participating. So, this choice is possible.
C: G and M - If G and M participate, F must also participate because M is participating. This leaves us with one more spot. This spot can be filled by either J or K, but not both. If J is chosen, it contradicts the condition that if J participates, then G must participate. So, this choice is not possible.
D: H and M - If H and M participate, F must also participate because M is participating. This leaves us with one more spot. This spot can be filled by either J or K, but not both. If J is chosen, it contradicts the condition that if J participates, then G must participate. So, this choice is not possible.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
