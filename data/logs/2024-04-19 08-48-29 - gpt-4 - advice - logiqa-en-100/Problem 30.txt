## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The conditions are:
1) At least one person of Bingding is selected.
2) If E is selected, then A and B are also selected.
3) A maximum of 2 people are selected.
From condition 2, if E is selected, then A and B are also selected. This means that if E is selected, there will be at least 3 people selected, which contradicts condition 3 that a maximum of 2 people are selected. Therefore, E cannot be selected.
From condition 1, at least one person of Bingding is selected. This means that either Bing or Ding is selected. 
Since a maximum of 2 people are selected, and at least one person of Bingding is selected, the other person selected cannot be A, B, or E (since selecting A or B would require E to be selected, and E cannot be selected). Therefore, the other person selected must be C.
Therefore, the fourth person cannot be A, B, E, or C. The only remaining choice is Ding.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
