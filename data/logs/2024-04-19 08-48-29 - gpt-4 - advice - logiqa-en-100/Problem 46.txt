## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
From the conditions, we know that:
- H and Y must be in the same department.
- F and G cannot be in the same department.
- If X is in sales, then W is in production.
- F must be in production.
From these conditions, we can infer that:
- Since F must be in production and F and G cannot be in the same department, G cannot be in production.
- If G is in sales, then X cannot be in sales because if X is in sales, W must be in production, but there are already three people (F, H, Y) in production.
- Therefore, G and X cannot both be in sales.
Action: Answer("B")

Score: 1
