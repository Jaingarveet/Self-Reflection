Context: Since 1993, sand and dust storms have frequently occurred in the Inner Mongolia region of our country, causing major economic losses.Some people think that sand and dust storms are caused by grassland degradation and desertification caused by climate drought.They are natural disasters, so they are inevitable.
Question: If the following items are true, can the above opinions be questioned, except?
Choices:
  A: In the 1950s, grass in Xilin Gol grassland in Inner Mongolia was as tall as a horse's belly, and now grass can't even cover mice.
  B: Opposite the degraded grasslands of Hulunbeier and Xilinguole in Inner Mongolia, the grasslands of Mongolian grassland are about 1 meter high.
  C: On the almost uninhabited border line of 10 kilometers wide between China and Mongolia, grass still maintains the height of the 1950s.
  D: The increase in dust storms is mainly due to human factors such as overloaded grazing and predatory management of grasslands.

## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The opinion stated is that sand and dust storms are natural disasters caused by climate drought, and are therefore inevitable. The question asks which statement, if true, would not question this opinion. 
A: This statement suggests that the grassland has degraded over time, which could be due to human factors, not just climate drought. This questions the opinion.
B: This statement suggests that grasslands in a similar climate are not degraded, which could imply that human factors, not climate drought, are responsible for the degradation. This questions the opinion.
C: This statement suggests that in areas without human interference, the grassland has not degraded, implying that human factors, not climate drought, may be responsible for the degradation. This questions the opinion.
D: This statement directly states that human factors are the main cause of the increase in dust storms, which directly questions the opinion.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
