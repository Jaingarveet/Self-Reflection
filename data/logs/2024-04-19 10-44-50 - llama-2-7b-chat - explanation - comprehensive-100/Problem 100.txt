Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question by selecting option [REDACTED], [REDACTED], as the correct answer. However, upon further analysis, I realize that the correct answer is option [REDACTED], [REDACTED].

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest a possible testicular tumor, which can cause infertility due to the dilated blood vessels draining the left testicle. The patient's history of hyperlipidemia and nodular prostatic hyperplasia also increase their risk of developing a testicular tumor, which can lead to infertility.
