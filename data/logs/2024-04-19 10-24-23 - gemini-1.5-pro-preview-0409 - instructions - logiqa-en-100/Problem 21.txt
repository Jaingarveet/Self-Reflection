Context: Xiao Chen? At present, part of the orbit of Comet 1996D3 is far from the sun, but recently it can be found to emit flickering light through the solar telescope.In the past, people never observed such flashes of comets far away from the sun, so this flicker must be an unusual scene.Xiao Wang? Normally people don't observe comets far away from the sun.The 1996D3 comet flicker light discovered this time was obtained by continuous and careful tracking observation.

  A: Point out that the key concepts used by Xiao Chen are ambiguous.

## Assistant 2:
## Reflection on Previous Attempt:
In my previous attempt, I likely focused on the disagreement between Xiao Chen and Xiao Wang, leading to an incorrect choice. The key to understanding Xiao Wang's refutation lies in **how** he countered Xiao Chen's argument, not just the disagreement itself. 
## Analyzing Xiao Wang's Refutation:
Xiao Wang doesn't challenge the definitions or logic within Xiao Chen's argument. He also doesn't directly contradict Xiao Chen's conclusion about the flickering being unusual. Instead, he provides an alternative explanation for the observation: **the flickering was noticed due to continuous and careful observation, not because it's a unique phenomenon**.
## Choosing the Correct Answer:
Based on this analysis, the most accurate description of Xiao Wang's method is:
**Action: Answer("D")** 
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
