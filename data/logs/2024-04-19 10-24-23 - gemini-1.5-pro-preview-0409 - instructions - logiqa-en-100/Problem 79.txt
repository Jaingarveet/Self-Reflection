Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Topic: Logic
Context: There must be an outside world, because if there is something outside me that can shine or reflect, shining the light into my eyes, which gives me a visual experience, I ca nâ€™t see the buildings, the crowds and the stars these things.And, not only have visual experience like me, but others also have such visual experience; book knowledge also tells us repeatedly that there is an outside world outside of us.
Question: Which of the following does not constitute doubt or rebuttal to the above argument?
Choices:
  A: To use sensory evidence to explain the existence of the external world requires presupposing the existence of the external world in the mind.
  B: How do you prove that others have similar visual experience to you?
  C: Since the visual experience is reliable, Mirage is not a so-called illusion, but a real existence.
  D: If there is no external world and natural science knowledge is not a true reflection of it, then why does natural science achieve such great success in practice?

## Assistant 2:
## Reflection on Previous Error:
**My previous error:** I previously selected choice C as the non-rebuttal. This was incorrect because choice C actually challenges the argument by questioning the reliability of visual experience and suggesting that mirages are real, which contradicts the assumption of a reliable external world causing visual experiences.
**Understanding the correct answer:** The correct answer should not challenge or cast doubt on the given argument about the existence of the external world. It should either be neutral or support the argument's premise.
**Learning:** I need to carefully analyze each choice in relation to the argument's core claims and identify statements that do not contradict or weaken those claims. 
**Applying the learning:** Let's analyze each choice:
* **A:** This challenges the argument by pointing out circular reasoning - using sensory experience to justify the external world while assuming the external world exists to have sensory experiences. This is a valid rebuttal.
* **B:** This questions the assumption that others have similar visual experiences, casting doubt on the shared experience of the external world. This is a valid rebuttal.
* **C:** As discussed before, this challenges the reliability of visual experiences, contradicting the argument's basis. This is a valid rebuttal.
* **D:** This supports the argument by highlighting the practical success of natural science, which relies on the existence of an external world to study and explain. This does not challenge the argument.
Therefore, the choice that does not constitute doubt or rebuttal is **D**.
**Action: Answer("D")** 
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
