## System:
You are an expert in Logic.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Reflection on Previous Attempt:
**Error Analysis:**
In my previous attempt, I likely focused too much on individual conditions and failed to consider the combined implications of multiple conditions simultaneously. This led to overlooking potential conflicts and selecting an arrangement that violated one or more constraints.
**Improved Approach:**
1. **Start with fixed positions:** Based on the given conditions, H being in Team 2 fixes Q's position as the middle in Team 1 (condition 6).
2. **Analyze remaining conditions:** Consider the remaining conditions and how they interact with each other to eliminate incompatible options.
3. **Verify the final arrangement:** Ensure the chosen arrangement satisfies all given conditions without any contradictions.
**Applying the Improved Approach:**
Given H is in Team 2, Q must be in the middle of Team 1 (condition 6). Now let's analyze the options:
* **Option A:** L (front), Q (middle), N (back) - This option seems valid as it satisfies conditions (1), (3), and (4).
* **Option B:** G (front), K (middle), N (back) - This violates condition (4) as K and N cannot be in the same team.
* **Option C:** L (front), Q (middle), G (back) - This option seems valid as it satisfies conditions (1), (3), and (6).
* **Option D:** G (front), K (middle), L (back) - This violates condition (4) as K and N cannot be in the same team. 
Therefore, both options A and C seem valid based on the given information. However, without further information about N's position restrictions, we cannot definitively determine which specific arrangement is acceptable. 
## Result:
Agent Answer: None
