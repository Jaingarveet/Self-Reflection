## Assistant 2:
## Reflection on Previous Attempt:
In my previous attempt, I made the mistake of assuming that information from one option could be applied to another option, even though the options were not mutually exclusive. This led me to incorrectly eliminate possibilities and arrive at the wrong conclusion.
## Solving the Problem Step-by-Step:
1. **Analyze the given information:**
    - We know there are 5 graduates and 3 employers (Tianshu, Tianji, Tianxuan).
    - Each employer hired at least one graduate.
    - Li works at Tianshu (from statement 1).
    - Li and Zhao work at different places (from statement 2).
    - Liu and Zhao work at the same place (from statement 3).
    - If Zhang is at Tianxuan, then Wang is also at Tianxuan (from statement 4).
2. **Evaluate each option based on the given information:**
    **A: Li and Liu were hired by the same unit.** 
    - This contradicts statement 2 (Li and Zhao work at different places) and statement 3 (Liu and Zhao work at the same place). So, this is **NOT possible**.
    **B: Wang, Zhao, and Liu were all hired by Tianji.**
    - This doesn't contradict any given information. Li is at Tianshu, and this option doesn't specify where Zhang works. So, this is **possible**.
    **C: Only Liu was hired by Tianxuan.**
    - This contradicts statement 3 (Liu and Zhao work at the same place). So, this is **NOT possible**.
    **D: Only Wang was hired by Tianxuan.**
    - This could be possible if Zhang is NOT at Tianxuan (based on statement 4). So, this is **possible**.
3. **Choose the correct option:**
    Based on the analysis, options B and D are possible scenarios. 
Action: Answer("B") 
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
