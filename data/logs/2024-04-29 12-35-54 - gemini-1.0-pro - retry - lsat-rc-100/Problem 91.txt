Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Law enforcement agencies can effectively nullify particular laws, or particular applications of law, simply by declining to prosecute violators. This power appears to be exercised frequently and I attempt here to explain why. Rules of law are almost always overinclusive: read literally, they forbid some conduct that the legislature that formulated the rule did not want to forbid. The costs of precisely tailoring a rule to the conduct intended to be forbidden would be prohibitive given the limitations of human foresight and the inherent ambiguities of language. The more particularly the legislature tries to describe the forbidden conduct, the more loopholes it will create. Enforcing an overinclusive rule to the letter could impose very heavy social costs. The effect would be like punishing an innocent person in order to reduce the probability of acquitting a guilty one. Of course, the danger of punishing the innocent is not a decisive blow against the use of a particular method of law enforcement; the danger must be traded off against the costs of alternative methods that would reduce it. But there is a technique-discretionary nonenforcement-by which the costs of overinclusion can be reduced without a corresponding increase in underinclusion (loopholes). Of course, allowing discretionary nonenforcement does not determine the principle by which the law enforcement agency will select its cases. Conceivably the agency could concentrate its resources on those areas of conduct that had been brought inadvertently within the scope of the rule. But this seems unlikely. Capricious enforcement is not unknown (or even rare) but it does not appear to be the central tendency since legislative oversight assures that the agency does not stray too far from the intended, as distinct from the enacted, regulation being enforced. Passage B The newspaper reported that 231,000 water customers in the city are late paying their bills-some by months, others by decades. In all, these water delinquents owe the city more than $625 million in overdue bills and penalties. So officials are planning to selectively cut the water to a few residences with outstanding bills to show that they are serious about collecting those debts. Officials plan to target only high-income neighborhoods, to make examples of a few privileged residents who will be in no position to complain since they were caught stiffing the system. But property owners are responsible for water bills. So why not just do what every other property-related creditor or tax authority does-attach a lien to the property? The money owed would automatically be available whenever a property was sold, and the threat of negative credit implications would be a powerful incentive to keep current with one's water obligations. Well, here's an answer: a loophole prohibits debts other than taxes from being subject to liens by the city, and, technically, water charges are not taxes. But if the problem is with the law, then why not change the law? Wouldn't that be easier, and politically smarter, than shutting off people's water?
Question: The author of passage A would be most likely to agree with which one of the following statements concerning the plan described in lines 41-47 in passage B?
Choices:
  A: Officials should not implement the plan until just after the legislature's annual appropriations hearing.
  B: At least the plan would have a lower social cost than would turning off the water of all 231,000 households that have not paid on time.
  C: The plan is a reasonable response to the water department's history of enforcing overinclusive rules to the letter.
  D: A better plan would have been to place liens on the properties owned by those who are late paying their bills.
  E: Instead of implementing the plan, specific laws regarding the payment of water bills should be introduced to provide a more effective set of incentives.

## Analyzing the Plan in Passage B through the Lens of Passage A
Passage A argues that discretionary non-enforcement can be a useful tool for law enforcement agencies to address overinclusive rules. This means agencies can choose not to prosecute certain violations, even if technically they could. 
Let's analyze the plan described in Passage B using this framework:
* **Overinclusive Rule:** The rule requiring water bill payment could be considered overinclusive as it applies to everyone, regardless of their ability to pay. This could lead to hardship for low-income residents who fall behind on their bills.
* **Discretionary Non-enforcement:** The plan to selectively cut off water to high-income residents who haven't paid their bills can be seen as a form of discretionary non-enforcement. Instead of pursuing all delinquent accounts equally, the agency is focusing on a specific group.
* **Social Cost:** The social cost of cutting off water to high-income residents is likely lower than cutting off water to everyone who hasn't paid. This is because high-income residents are more likely to have the means to pay their bills and find alternative sources of water if necessary.
Now, let's compare the statements in the answer choices to the analysis above:
* **A:** This statement is irrelevant to the analysis of the plan in Passage B.
* **B:** This statement aligns with the idea that discretionary non-enforcement can reduce social costs.
* **C:** There is no information in Passage A to suggest that the water department has a history of enforcing overinclusive rules to the letter.
* **D:** While placing liens on properties could be an alternative solution, Passage A suggests that discretionary non-enforcement can be a more effective tool in certain situations.
* **E:** This statement aligns with the idea that changing the law could be a better long-term solution than discretionary non-enforcement.
Therefore, the statement the author of Passage A would most likely agree with is:
**Action: Answer("B")** 
This is because it aligns with the argument in Passage A that discretionary non-enforcement can be a useful tool for addressing overinclusive rules and reducing social costs.
