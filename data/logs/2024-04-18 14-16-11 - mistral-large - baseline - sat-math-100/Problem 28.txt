Question: $$\frac{x^{2}-1}{x-1}=-2$$What are all values of $x$ that satisfy the equation above?
Choices:
  A: -3

## Assistant 2:
Thought:
First, factor the numerator of the fraction:
$$\frac{(x-1)(x+1)}{x-1}=-2$$
Next, cancel out the common factor of $(x-1)$ from the numerator and denominator:
$$x+1=-2$$
Now, solve for $x$:
$$x=-3$$
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
