## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:

Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:

  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: $$g(x)=a x^{2}+24$$For the function $g$ defined above, $a$ is a constant and $g(4)=8$. What is the value of $g(-4)$ ?
Choices:
  A: 8
  B: 0
  C: -1
  D: -8
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
To find the value of $g(-4)$, we first need to find the value of $a$ using the given information $g(4)=8$.
Substituting $x=4$ and $g(4)=8$ into the equation $g(x)=ax^2+24$, we get $8=a(4)^2+24$.
Solving for $a$, we get $a=-1$.
Now, substituting $x=-4$ and $a=-1$ into the equation $g(x)=ax^2+24$, we get $g(-4)=(-1)(-4)^2+24=16+24=40$.
However, none of the given choices match this value.
Since I am required to select one of the available choices, I will choose the closest one to the correct answer.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
