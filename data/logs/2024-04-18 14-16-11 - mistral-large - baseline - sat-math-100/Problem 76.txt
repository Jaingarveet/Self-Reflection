## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: If $\frac{5}{x}=\frac{15}{x+20}$, what is the value of $\frac{x}{5} ?$
Choices:
  A: 10
  B: 5
  C: 2
  D: $\frac{1}{2}$
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
To solve for x, we can cross-multiply and get 5(x+20) = 15x.
Simplifying, we get 5x + 100 = 15x.
Rearranging, we get 10x = 100.
Dividing both sides by 10, we get x = 10.
Now, we need to find the value of $\frac{x}{5}$.
Substituting x = 10, we get $\frac{10}{5} = 2$.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
