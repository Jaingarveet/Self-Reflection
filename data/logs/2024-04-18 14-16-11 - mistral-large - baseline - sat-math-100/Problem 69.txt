## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.

Question: Alan drives an average of 100 miles each week. His car can travel an average of 25 miles per gallon of gasoline. Alan would like to reduce his weekly expenditure on gasoline by $\$ 5$. Assuming gasoline costs $\$ 4$ per gallon, which equation can Alan use to determine how many fewer average miles, $m$, he should drive each week?
Choices:
  A: $\frac{25}{4} m=95$
  B: $\frac{25}{4} m=5$
  C: $\frac{4}{25} m=95$
  D: $\frac{4}{25} m=5$
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Alan currently spends $100 miles/week \times \frac{1 gallon}{25 miles} \times $4/gallon = $16/week on gasoline.
He wants to reduce his expenditure by $5/week, so he wants to spend $11/week on gasoline.
Let $m$ be the number of miles he should drive each week to spend $11/week on gasoline.
Then, $m miles/week \times \frac{1 gallon}{25 miles} \times $4/gallon = $11/week.
Solving for $m$, we get $m = 25 \times \frac{11}{4} = \frac{275}{4}$.
The equation that Alan can use to determine how many fewer average miles, $m$, he should drive each week is $\frac{4}{25} m = 11 - 5 = 6$.
Action: Answer("D")
