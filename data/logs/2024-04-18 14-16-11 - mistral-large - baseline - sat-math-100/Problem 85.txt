Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: $$C=\frac{5}{9}(F-32)$$The equation above shows how a temperature $F$, measured in degrees Fahrenheit, relates to a temperature $C$, measured in degrees Celsius. Based on the equation, which of the following must be true?I. A temperature increase of 1 degree Fahrenheit is equivalent to a temperature increase of $\frac{5}{9}$ degree Celsius.II. A temperature increase of 1 degree Celsius is equivalent to a temperature increase of 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit.III. A temperature increase of $\frac{5}{9}$ degree Fahrenheit is equivalent to a temperature increase of 1 degree Celsius.
Choices:
  A: I only
  B: II only
  C: III only
  D: I and II only
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let's analyze each statement one by one.

I. A temperature increase of 1 degree Fahrenheit is equivalent to a temperature increase of $\frac{5}{9}$ degree Celsius.
This statement is true. According to the equation, if the temperature increases by 1 degree Fahrenheit, the Celsius temperature will increase by $\frac{5}{9}$ degree.

II. A temperature increase of 1 degree Celsius is equivalent to a temperature increase of 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit.
This statement is also true. If the temperature increases by 1 degree Celsius, the Fahrenheit temperature will increase by $\frac{9}{5}$ degrees, which is equal to 1.8 degrees.

III. A temperature increase of $\frac{5}{9}$ degree Fahrenheit is equivalent to a temperature increase of 1 degree Celsius.
This statement is false. According to the equation, if the temperature increases by $\frac{5}{9}$ degree Fahrenheit, the Celsius temperature will increase by $\frac{5}{9} \times \frac{5}{9} = \frac{25}{81}$ degrees, which is not equal to 1 degree.

Action: Answer("D")
