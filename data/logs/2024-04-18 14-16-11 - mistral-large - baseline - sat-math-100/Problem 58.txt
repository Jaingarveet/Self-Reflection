## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: $$\begin{aligned}& y<-x+a \\& y>x+b\end{aligned}$$In the $x y$-plane, if $(0,0)$ is a solution to the system of inequalities above, which of the following relationships between $a$ and $b$ must be true?
Choices:
  A: $a>b$
  B: $b>a$
  C: $|a|>|b|$
  D: $a=-b$
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
If $(0,0)$ is a solution to the system of inequalities, then both inequalities must be true for $x=0$ and $y=0$.
Substituting $x=0$ and $y=0$ into the first inequality, we get $0<-0+a$, which simplifies to $a>0$.
Substituting $x=0$ and $y=0$ into the second inequality, we get $0>0+b$, which simplifies to $b<0$.
Since $a>0$ and $b<0$, we know that $a>b$.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
