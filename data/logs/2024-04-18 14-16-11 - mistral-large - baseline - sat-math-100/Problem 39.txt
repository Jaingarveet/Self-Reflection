## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: $$\begin{aligned}& -3 x+y=6 \\& a x+2 y=4\end{aligned}$$In the system of equations above, $a$ is a constant. For which of the following values of $a$ does the system have no solution?
Choices:
  A: -6
  B: -3
  C: 3
  D: 6
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
For a system of linear equations to have no solution, the equations must be parallel lines, meaning their slopes are equal but their y-intercepts are different.
The slope of the first equation is -3, and the slope of the second equation is -a/2.
For the slopes to be equal, -3 = -a/2. Solving for a, we get a = 6.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
