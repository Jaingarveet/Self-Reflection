Question: A retail company has 50 large stores located in different areas throughout a state. A researcher for the company believes that employee job satisfaction varies greatly from store to store. Which of the following sampling methods is most appropriate to estimate the proportion of all employees of the company who are satisfied with their job?
Choices:
  A: Selecting one of the 50 stores at random and then surveying each employee at that store
  B: Selecting 10 employees from each store at random and then surveying each employee selected
  C: Surveying the 25 highest-paid employees and the 25 lowest-paid employees
  D: Creating a website on which employees can express their opinions and then using the first 50 responses
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
To estimate the proportion of all employees of the company who are satisfied with their job, it is important to select a sample that is representative of the entire population of employees.
Option A is not appropriate because it only surveys employees from one store, which may not be representative of the entire population.
Option C is not appropriate because it only surveys employees based on their salary, which may not be related to job satisfaction.
Option D is not appropriate because it only uses responses from employees who choose to visit the website, which may not be representative of the entire population.
Option B is the most appropriate because it selects a random sample of employees from each store, which is more likely to be representative of the entire population.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
