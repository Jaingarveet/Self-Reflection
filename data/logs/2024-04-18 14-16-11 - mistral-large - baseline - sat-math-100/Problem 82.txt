## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: $$y=a(x-2)(x+4)$$In the quadratic equation above, $a$ is a nonzero constant. The graph of the equation in the $x y$-plane is a parabola with vertex $(c, d)$. Which of the following is equal to $d$ ?
Choices:
  A: $-9 a$
  B: $-8 a$
  C: $-5 a$
  D: $-2 a$
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The vertex of a parabola in the form $y=a(x-h)^2+k$ is at $(h,k)$.
To find the vertex of the given parabola, we need to convert it to the vertex form.
We can do this by expanding the equation and then completing the square.
Expanding the equation, we get $y=a(x^2+2x-8)$.
To complete the square, we add and subtract $(2/2)^2=1$ inside the parentheses, giving us $y=a(x^2+2x+1-1-8)=a(x+1)^2-9a$.
So, the vertex is at $(-1,-9a)$.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
