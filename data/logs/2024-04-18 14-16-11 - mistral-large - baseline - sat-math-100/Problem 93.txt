Choices:
  A: Females taking Geometry
  B: Females taking Algebra II
  C: Males taking Geometry
  D: Males taking Algebra I
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
To find the category that accounts for approximately 19 percent of all the survey respondents, I need to calculate the percentage of each category by dividing the number of students in that category by the total number of students and then multiplying by 100.

The total number of students is 310.

For A: Females taking Geometry, there are 53 students.
Percentage = (53/310) x 100 = 17.1%

For B: Females taking Algebra II, there are 62 students.
Percentage = (62/310) x 100 = 20%

For C: Males taking Geometry, there are 59 students.
Percentage = (59/310) x 100 = 19%

For D: Males taking Algebra I, there are 44 students.
Percentage = (44/310) x 100 = 14.2%

Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
