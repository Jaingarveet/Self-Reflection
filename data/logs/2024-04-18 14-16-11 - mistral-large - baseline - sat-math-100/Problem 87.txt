Question: In the $x y$-plane, the parabola with equation $y=(x-11)^{2}$ intersects the line with equation $y=25$ at two points, $A$ and $B$. What is the length of $\overline{A B}$ ?
Choices:
  A: 10
  B: 12
  C: 14
  D: 16
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
To find the length of $\overline{A B}$, we need to find the coordinates of points $A$ and $B$.
To do this, we can set the equations of the parabola and the line equal to each other and solve for $x$:
$(x-11)^{2} = 25$
Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
$x-11 = \pm 5$
Solving for $x$, we get two possible values: $x = 11 + 5 = 16$ and $x = 11 - 5 = 6$.
These are the $x$-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$.
To find the $y$-coordinates, we can substitute these values of $x$ into either equation.
Using the equation of the line, we get:
$y = 25$ for both points.
Therefore, the coordinates of points $A$ and $B$ are $(6, 25)$ and $(16, 25)$.
To find the length of $\overline{A B}$, we can use the distance formula:
$\sqrt{(x_{2}-x_{1})^{2}+(y_{2}-y_{1})^{2}} = \sqrt{(16-6)^{2}+(25-25)^{2}} = \sqrt{10^{2}+0^{2}} = 10$
Action: Answer("A")
