Question: $$h=-4.9 t^{2}+25 t$$The equation above expresses the approximate height $h$, in meters, of a ball $t$ seconds after it is launched vertically upward from the ground with an initial velocity of 25 meters per second. After approximately how many seconds will the ball hit the ground?
Choices:
  A: 3.5
  B: 4.0
  C: 4.5
  D: 5.0
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
To find when the ball hits the ground, we need to find when the height $h$ is equal to 0.
We can set the equation equal to 0 and solve for $t$:
$$-4.9 t^{2}+25 t = 0$$
We can factor out a $t$ to get:
$$-t(4.9 t-25) = 0$$
Setting each factor equal to 0, we get:
$$-t = 0$$
$$4.9 t-25 = 0$$
The first equation gives us $t=0$, which is when the ball is launched.
The second equation gives us $t=25/4.9 \approx 5.1$.
However, this is not one of the answer choices.
We can check each answer choice to see which one is closest to 5.1.

Action: Answer("D")
