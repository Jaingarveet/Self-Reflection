Question: At Lincoln High School, approximately 7 percent of enrolled juniors and 5 percent of enrolled seniors were inducted into the National Honor Society last year. If there were 562 juniors and 602 seniors enrolled at Lincoln High School last year, which of the following is closest to the total number of juniors and seniors at Lincoln High School last year who were inducted into the National Honor Society?
Choices:
  A: 140
  B: 69
  C: 39
  D: 30
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
To find the total number of juniors and seniors who were inducted into the National Honor Society, we need to calculate the number of juniors and seniors who were inducted separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of juniors who were inducted:
7 percent of 562 juniors = (7/100) x 562 = 39.34, which we can round to 39 since we cannot have a fraction of a person.

Next, let's calculate the number of seniors who were inducted:
5 percent of 602 seniors = (5/100) x 602 = 30.1, which we can round to 30 since we cannot have a fraction of a person.

Now, let's add the number of juniors and seniors who were inducted:
39 + 30 = 69

Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
