## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Topic: Math
Question: \begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}\hline$x$ & $f(x)$ \\\hline0 & 3 \\\hline2 & 1 \\\hline4 & 0 \\\hline5 & -2 \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}The function $f$ is defined by a polynomial. Some values of $x$ and $f(x)$ are shown in the table above. Which of the following must be a factor of $f(x)$ ?
Choices:
  A: $x-2$
  B: $x-3$
  C: $x-4$
  D: $x-5$
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
A factor of a polynomial function $f(x)$ is a linear expression $(x-a)$ where $a$ is a root of the function.
A root of a function is a value of $x$ for which $f(x)=0$.
From the table, we can see that $f(4)=0$.
Therefore, $x-4$ must be a factor of $f(x)$.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
