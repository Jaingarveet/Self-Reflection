## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: $$\begin{aligned}& 2.4 x-1.5 y=0.3 \\& 1.6 x+0.5 y=-1.3\end{aligned}$$The system of equations above is graphed in the $x y$-plane. What is the $x$-coordinate of the intersection point $(x, y)$ of the system?
Choices:
  A: -0.5
  B: -0.25
  C: 0.8
  D: 1.75
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
To find the x-coordinate of the intersection point of the system, we can solve the system of equations using substitution or elimination method.
First, we can multiply the first equation by 4 to eliminate the decimal points:
$9.6 x - 6 y = 1.2$
Then, we can multiply the second equation by 3 to eliminate the decimal points:
$4.8 x + 1.5 y = -3.9$
Next, we can multiply the second equation by 2 to make the coefficients of y the same in both equations:
$9.6 x + 3 y = -7.8$
Now, we can subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate y:
$-3 y = 9$
$y = -3$
Substitute y = -3 into the first equation to solve for x:
$2.4 x - 1.5(-3) = 0.3$
$2.4 x + 4.5 = 0.3$
$2.4 x = -4.2$
$x = -1.75$
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
