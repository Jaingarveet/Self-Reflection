Question: Shipping Charges\begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}\hline$\begin{array}{c}\text { Merchandise weight } \\ \text { (pounds) }\end{array}$ & $\begin{array}{c}\text { Shipping } \\ \text { charge }\end{array}$ \\\hline5 & $\$ 16.94$ \\\hline10 & $\$ 21.89$ \\\hline20 & $\$ 31.79$ \\\hline40 & $\$ 51.59$ \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}The table above shows shipping charges for an online retailer that sells sporting goods. There is a linear relationship between the shipping charge and the weight of the merchandise. Which function can be used to determine the total shipping charge $f(x)$, in dollars, for an order with a merchandise weight of $x$ pounds?
Choices:
  A: $f(x)=0.99 x$
  B: $f(x)=0.99 x+11.99$
  C: $f(x)=3.39 x$
  D: $f(x)=3.39 x+16.94$
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
To find the linear function that models the relationship between the shipping charge and the weight of the merchandise, we need to find the slope and the y-intercept.

The slope can be found by using any two points from the table and calculating the change in shipping charge divided by the change in weight. For example, using the points (5, 16.94) and (10, 21.89), we get:

slope = (21.89 - 16.94) / (10 - 5) = 4.95 / 5 = 0.99

The y-intercept can be found by using one of the points and plugging it into the equation of a line, y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept. Using the point (5, 16.94), we get:

16.94 = 0.99(5) + b
16.94 = 4.95 + b
b = 11.99

Therefore, the linear function that models the relationship between the shipping charge and the weight of the merchandise is f(x) = 0.99x + 11.99.

Action: Answer("B")
