Question: The equation $\frac{24 x^{2}+25 x-47}{a x-2}=-8 x-3-\frac{53}{a x-2}$ is true for all values of $x \neq \frac{2}{a}$, where $a$ is a constant.What is the value of $a$ ?
Choices:
  A: -16
  B: -3
  C: 3
  D: 16
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
To solve for $a$, we can first multiply both sides of the equation by $(a x-2)$ to eliminate the denominator:

$24 x^{2}+25 x-47=-8 x(a x-2)-3(a x-2)-53$

Expanding and simplifying the equation, we get:

$24 x^{2}+25 x-47=-8 a x^{2}+16 x+3 a x-6-53$

Combining like terms, we get:

$(24+8 a) x^{2}+(25-16-3 a) x+47-6=0$

Since the equation is true for all values of $x$, the coefficients of $x^{2}$ and $x$ must be zero:

$24+8 a=0 \Rightarrow a=-3$

$25-16-3 a=0 \Rightarrow a=-3$

Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
