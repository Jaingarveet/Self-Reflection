## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: \begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}\hline$x$ & $a$ & $3 a$ & $5 a$ \\\hline$y$ & 0 & $-a$ & $-2 a$ \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}Some values of $x$ and their corresponding values of $y$ are shown in the table above, where $a$ is a constant. If there is a linear relationship between $x$ and $y$, which of the following equations represents the relationship?
Choices:
  A: $x+2 y=a$
  B: $x+2 y=5 a$
  C: $2 x-y=-5 a$
  D: $2 x-y=7 a$
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The table shows that when $x=a$, $y=0$, so the y-intercept is 0. This means that the equation of the line must be in the form $y=mx$.

When $x=3a$, $y=-a$, so we can substitute these values into the equation to find the slope: $-a=m(3a)$, which simplifies to $m=-1/3$.

Therefore, the equation of the line is $y=-1/3x$.

We can rearrange this equation to $x+3y=0$.

Comparing this to the answer choices, we can see that none of them match exactly. However, we can manipulate the equation to match one of the choices.

If we multiply both sides of our equation by 2, we get $2x+6y=0$.

We can then subtract $4ay$ from both sides to get $2x+2y=-4ay$.

Finally, we can add $5ay$ to both sides to get $2x+2y=ay$.

Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
