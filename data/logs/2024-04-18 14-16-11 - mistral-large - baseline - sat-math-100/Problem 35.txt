# Model: mistral-large | Agent: baseline | Exam: sat-math-100 | Problem 35 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:
Topic: Geography
Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: $$\sqrt{4 x}=x-3$$What are all values of $x$ that satisfy the given equation?I. 1II. 9
Choices:
  A: I only
  B: II only
  C: I and II
  D: Neither I nor II
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
To solve the equation, we can square both sides to get rid of the square root.
This gives us $4x = (x-3)^2$.
Expanding the right side, we get $4x = x^2 - 6x + 9$.
Rearranging the equation, we get $x^2 - 10x + 9 = 0$.
Factoring the quadratic equation, we get $(x-1)(x-9) = 0$.
This gives us two possible solutions: $x=1$ and $x=9$.
However, we need to check these solutions in the original equation to make sure they are valid.
Substituting $x=1$ into the original equation, we get $\sqrt{4 \cdot 1} = 1 - 3$, which simplifies to $2 = -2$. This is not true, so $x=1$ is not a valid solution.
Substituting $x=9$ into the original equation, we get $\sqrt{4 \cdot 9} = 9 - 3$, which simplifies to $6 = 6$. This is true, so $x=9$ is a valid solution.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
