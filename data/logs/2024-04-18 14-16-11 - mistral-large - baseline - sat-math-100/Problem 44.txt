Question: A square field measures 10 meters by 10 meters. Ten students each mark off a randomly selected region of the field; each region is square and has side lengths of 1 meter, and no two regions overlap. The students count the earthworms contained in the soil to a depth of 5 centimeters beneath the ground's surface in each region. The results are shown in the table below.\begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}\hlineRegion & $\begin{array}{c}\text { Number of } \\ \text { earthworms }\end{array}$ & Region & $\begin{array}{c}\text { Number of } \\ \text { earthworms }\end{array}$ \\\hlineA & 107 & $\mathrm{~F}$ & 141 \\\hlineB & 147 & $\mathrm{G}$ & 150 \\\hlineC & 146 & $\mathrm{H}$ & 154 \\\hlineD & 135 & $\mathrm{I}$ & 176 \\\hlineE & 149 & $\mathrm{~J}$ & 166 \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}Which of the following is a reasonable approximation of the number of earthworms to a depth of 5 centimeters beneath the ground's surface in the entire field?
Choices:
  A: $\quad 150$
  B: $\quad 1,500$
  C: 15,000
  D: 150,000
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The total area of the field is 10m x 10m = 100 square meters.
The area of each region is 1m x 1m = 1 square meter.
The total number of earthworms in the 10 regions is 107 + 147 + 146 + 135 + 149 + 141 + 150 + 154 + 176 + 166 = 1461.
Since the 10 regions cover 10 square meters, the number of earthworms per square meter is 1461 / 10 = 146.1.
Therefore, the number of earthworms in the entire field is approximately 146.1 x 100 = 14610.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
