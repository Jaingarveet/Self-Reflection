# Model: mistral-large | Agent: baseline | Exam: sat-math-100 | Problem 18 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:
Topic: Geography
Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: Which of the following is equivalent to $9^{\frac{3}{4}}$ ?
Choices:
  A: $\sqrt[3]{9}$
  B: $\sqrt[4]{9}$
  C: $\sqrt{3}$
  D: $3 \sqrt{3}$
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
To solve this problem, we need to understand that $9^{\frac{3}{4}}$ can be written as $(\sqrt[4]{9})^3$.
Now, we need to find the fourth root of 9 and then cube it.
The fourth root of 9 is 3, and the cube of 3 is 27.
However, none of the given choices is equal to 27.
There must be a mistake in the question or the choices.

Action: Answer("None of the Above")

Wait, I made a mistake. The correct answer is:

Thought:
To solve this problem, we need to understand that $9^{\frac{3}{4}}$ can be written as $(\sqrt[4]{9})^3$.
Now, we need to find the fourth root of 9 and then cube it.
The fourth root of 9 is 3, and the cube of 3 is 27.
However, we don't need to calculate the cube of 3 because the question asks for the equivalent expression, not the value.
So, the equivalent expression is $(\sqrt[4]{9})^3$, which is equal to $(\sqrt[4]{9^3})$.
The fourth root of $9^3$ is equal to the cube root of 9, which is 3.
Therefore, the correct answer is "A".

Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: N
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
