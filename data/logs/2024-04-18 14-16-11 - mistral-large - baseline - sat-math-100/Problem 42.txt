Topic: Math
Question: If $(a x+2)(b x+7)=15 x^{2}+c x+14$ for all values of $x$, and $a+b=8$, what are the two possible values for $c$ ?
Choices:
  A: 3 and 5
  B: 6 and 35
  C: 10 and 21
  D: 31 and 41
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
To find the two possible values for $c$, we need to expand the equation $(a x+2)(b x+7)$ and compare it to $15 x^{2}+c x+14$.
Expanding the equation, we get $a b x^{2}+7 a x+2 b x+14$.
Since $a+b=8$, we can write $b=8-a$.
Substituting this into the expanded equation, we get $a(8-a) x^{2}+7 a x+2(8-a) x+14$.
Comparing this to $15 x^{2}+c x+14$, we can see that $a(8-a)=15$ and $7 a+16-2 a=c$.
Solving for $a$, we get $a=3$ or $a=5$.
Substituting these values into the equation for $c$, we get $c=3$ or $c=5$.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: D
