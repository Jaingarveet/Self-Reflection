## Assistant 2:
  My apologies for my previous mistake. Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. We know that 10% of the chocolates are cocoa flavored.
2. We also know that 90% of the rest (which means 90% of the 90% that are not cocoa flavored) are squashed.
3. Therefore, the number of chocolates that are not squashed and not cocoa flavored can be calculated as follows:

90% of the chocolates are not cocoa flavored (i.e., 90% x 100% = 9000%)
90% of the remaining 90% are squashed (i.e., 90% x 90% = 81%)
The percentage of chocolates that are not squashed and not cocoa flavored is 100% - 81% = 19%

So, the percentage of chocolates that are both vanilla flavored and not squashed is 19%.

Action: Answer("C")
