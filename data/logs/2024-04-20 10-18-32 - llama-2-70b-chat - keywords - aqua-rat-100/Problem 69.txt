## Assistant 2:
  My apologies for my previous mistake. I misunderstood the intersection of the two sets and lacked attention to detail.
Let's break it down step by step:
The bookshelf contains 45 books, and 30 of them are hardcover.
That means 15 books are not hardcover.
20 books are fiction, and 15 books are not hardcover.
Therefore, the maximum number of books that are both hardcover and fiction is 15.
Action: Answer("B")

Agent Answer: B
