## Assistant 2:
  My apologies for my previous mistake. Let's reflect on the problem and the correct answer.
The question asks for the number of ways to choose 2 oranges from a basket of 10 oranges.
This is a classic problem of combinations.
The formula for combinations is:
n! / (k! \* (n-k)!)

In this case, n = 10 (the total number of oranges)
k = 2 (the number of oranges we want to choose)

Now, let's calculate:
10! = 10 \* 9 \* 8 \* 7 \* 6 \* 5 \* 4 \* 3 \* 2 \* 1 = 3,628,800

2! = 2 \* 1 = 2

(10 - 2)! = 8 \* 7 \* 6 \* 5 \* 4 \* 3 \* 2 \* 1 = 3,628,800

Now, we can apply the multiplication principle:
The number of ways to choose 2 oranges = 10! / (2! \* (10-2)!)
= 3,628,800 / (2 \* 3,628,800)
= 180

Therefore, the correct answer is E: 180.
