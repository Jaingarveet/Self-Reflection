## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Assistant 2:
  My apologies for my previous mistake. I realize that I misunderstood the problem and incorrectly applied the Pythagorean theorem.
To solve this problem, we need to use vector addition.
A starts at a point and travels 3 km south, so the vector from the starting point to A's new position is (-3, 0).
Then, A travels 5 km east, so the vector from A's new position to B is (0, 5).
Next, A travels 3 km north, so the vector from B to C is (0, -3).
Finally, A travels 2 km west, so the vector from C to D is (-2, 0).
We can add these vectors using the tip-to-tail method:
(-3, 0) + (0, 5) + (0, -3) + (-2, 0) = (-5, -3)
The magnitude of this vector is √((-5)^2 + (-3)^2) = √(25 + 9) = √34 km
Therefore, A is 34 km away from home.
Action: Answer("E")
