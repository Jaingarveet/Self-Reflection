## Assistant 2:
  My apologies for my previous mistake. Let's analyze the problem again.
The space shuttle's maximum speed is 700m/40s = 17.5 m/s.
It takes 5 seconds to pass a point, so the distance it covers in those 5 seconds is:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 17.5 m/s x 5 s
Distance = 87.5 m
The length of the space shuttle is the distance it covers in 5 seconds. Therefore, the length of the space shuttle is 87.5 m.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
