## Assistant 2:
  My apologies for my previous mistake. Let's break down the problem step by step:
Jack buys 18 sharpeners (white and brown) for Rs. 100.
If he pays 1 rupee more for each white than brown sharpeners, then the cost of a white sharpener is 1 rupee more than the cost of a brown sharpener.
Let the cost of a brown sharpener be x.
Then, the cost of a white sharpener is x + 1.
The total cost of 18 sharpeners is Rs. 100.
So, we can set up the equation:
x + (x + 1) + 18 = 100

Simplifying the equation:
2x + 18 = 100

Subtracting 18 from both sides:
2x = 82

Dividing both sides by 2:
x = 41

Now, we know that the cost of a brown sharpener is Rs. 41, and the cost of a white sharpener is Rs. 41 + 1 = Rs. 42.

So, Jack bought 9 brown sharpeners (since 9 x 41 = 369, which is less than 100) and 9 white sharpeners (since 9 x 42 = 378, which is greater than 100).

Therefore, the correct answer is B: 9,8.

I made a mistake in my previous answer by misunderstanding the problem and using an incorrect equation. I reflected on my mistake and corrected my solution to arrive at the correct answer.
