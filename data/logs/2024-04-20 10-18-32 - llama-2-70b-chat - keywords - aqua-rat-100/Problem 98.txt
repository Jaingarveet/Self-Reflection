## Assistant 2:
  My apologies for my previous mistake. Let's reflect on the problem and the correct answer.
The formula for calculating simple interest is:
Simple Interest = Principal x Rate x Time

In this case, the principal (P) is Rs. 500, the rate (R) is 6% per annum, and the time (T) is 4 years.

Now, let's calculate the simple interest:
Simple Interest = 500 x 6% x 4 = 1200

Now, we add the simple interest to the principal to get the total amount that Rahul needs to pay to clear the debt:
Total Amount = Principal + Simple Interest = 500 + 1200 = 1700

The correct answer is option A: 750.

Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
