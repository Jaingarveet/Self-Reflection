## Assistant 2:
  My apologies for my previous response. I made a mistake in my calculation.
To find the final concentration of tea John drinks, we need to calculate the amount of tea and milk in the solution after each step.

1. 15% of the 50% strong milk tea is replaced with milk, so the new concentration of tea is 50% - 15% = 35%.
2. 10% of the 35% tea solution is replaced with milk, so the new concentration of tea is 35% - 10% = 25%.

Therefore, the final concentration of tea John drinks is 25%.
