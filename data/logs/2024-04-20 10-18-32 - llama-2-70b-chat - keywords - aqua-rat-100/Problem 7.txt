You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Question: Amy is organizing her bookshelves and finds that she has 10 different types of books. She then codes each book with either a single letter or a pair of two different letters. If each type of book is uniquely represented by either a single letter or pair of letters, what is the smallest number of letters Amy will need to create the codes for all 10 types of books? (Assume the order of letters in a pair does not matter.)
Choices:
  A: 3
  B: 4
  C: 5
  D: 10
  E: 20

## Assistant 2:
  My apologies for my previous response. I made an error in my previous answer by assuming that each book must have a unique code, which led me to choose option D: 10.

However, upon reflection, I realized that the question only states that each type of book must be uniquely represented by either a single letter or a pair of letters. It does not specify that each book must have a unique code.

Therefore, the correct answer is option C: 5. Amy can use a single letter to represent 5 different types of books, and a pair of letters to represent the remaining 5 types of books, for a total of 10 different codes.

Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: D
