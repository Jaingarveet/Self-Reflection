## Assistant 2:
  My apologies for my previous mistake. I misunderstood the question and calculated the number of sales needed to reach a salary of $1000, not realizing that the question asked for the number of sales needed to reach a salary of at least $1000.

Let's break down the problem:

* The salesperson gets a 10% commission on each sale.
* The salesperson needs to make at least $1000 in commission.
* Each sale is $250, so the commission for each sale is $25 (10% of $250).

Now, let's calculate the number of sales needed:

$1000 / $25 = 40 sales

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 40 sales.

Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
