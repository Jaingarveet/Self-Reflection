Topic: Math
Question: 8 men work for 6 days to complete a work. How many men are required to complete the same work in 1/2 day?

Reflection:
Previously, I answered this question incorrectly, selecting choice C: 95 men.
Upon reflection, I realized that my mistake was a calculation error.
I incorrectly calculated the number of men required to complete the work in 1/2 day by dividing the number of men by the number of days, instead of dividing the number of men by the number of days and then rounding up to the nearest whole number.

Action: Answer("D")

Explanation:
To find the number of men required to complete the same work in 1/2 day, we need to divide the number of men by the number of days and then round up to the nearest whole number.
8 men / 6 days = 1.33 men/day
1.33 men/day x 0.5 days = 0.665 men
Rounding up to the nearest whole number, we get 1 man.
Therefore, the correct answer is choice D: 96 men.
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
