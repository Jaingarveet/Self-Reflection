## Assistant 2:
  My apologies for my previous mistake. I misunderstood the formula and failed to double-check my work.
Let's break down the problem step by step:
An athlete runs M miles in 4 hours, then rides a bike N miles in the same number of hours.
The average speed for the running activity is M/4 miles per hour.
The average speed for the cycling activity is N/4 miles per hour.
To find the average speed for both activities combined, we need to add the two speeds and divide by 2:
(M/4 + N/4) miles per hour.
Simplifying, we get:
(M + N)/8 miles per hour.
The correct answer is choice C: M + N/4.
I will double-check my work to ensure that I have selected the correct answer this time.
Action: Answer("C")

Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: A
