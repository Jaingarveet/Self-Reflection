## Assistant 2:
  My apologies for my previous mistake. Let's reflect on the problem and the correct answer.
The greatest common factor of two positive integers is 11. The least common multiple of these two integers is 7700. If one of the integers is 350, what is the other?
The correct answer is C: 352.

My previous answer was A: 242, which is incorrect.
The error in my previous answer was a calculation error. I mistakenly calculated the least common multiple of 11 and 350 as 242 instead of 7700.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to find the other integer that has a greatest common factor of 11 with 350 and has a least common multiple of 7700.
We can start by factoring 350: 350 = 2 x 3 x 5 x 7.
The greatest common factor of 350 and 11 is 11.
The least common multiple of 11 and 350 is 7700.
Therefore, the other integer is 352 (11 x 32).

Action: Answer("C")
