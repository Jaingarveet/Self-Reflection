## Assistant 2:
  My apologies for my previous mistake. Let's break down the problem step by step:

A group of friends planned to spend Rs. 96 on eatables for a picnic.
Four of them did not turn up, and as a result, the remaining friends had to contribute Rs. 4 extra each.
We need to find the number of friends who attended the picnic.

Let's call the number of friends who attended the picnic "x".
The total amount spent on eatables was Rs. 96, so the amount spent per person was Rs. 96/x.
Since four friends did not turn up, the number of friends who attended the picnic is reduced by 4, which we'll call "x-4".
The amount each person had to contribute extra was Rs. 4, so the total extra amount contributed was 4(x-4).

We know that the total amount spent on eatables was Rs. 96, so the sum of the original amount spent per person and the extra amount contributed must equal Rs. 96:

Rs. 96/x + 4(x-4) = Rs. 96

Now, let's solve for x:

x/x + 4(x-4)/x = 1 + 4/x

Simplifying, we get:

1 + 4/x = 1 + 4(x-4)/x

4/x = 4(x-4)/x

4 = 4x - 16

x = 16/4

x = 4

So, there were 4 friends who attended the picnic.
