## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Assistant 2:
Thought:
We can solve this system of equations using elimination.
Let's multiply the second equation by 3 to make the coefficients of x the same:
$$\begin{array}{r}3 x+4 y=-23 \\-3 x+6 y=-57\end{array}$$Now, add the two equations together to eliminate x:
$$10y = -80$$Divide both sides by 10 to solve for y:
$$y = -8$$Substitute y = -8 into the first equation to solve for x:
$$3x + 4(-8) = -23$$
$$3x - 32 = -23$$
$$3x = 9$$
$$x = 3$$
Therefore, the solution to the system of equations is (3, -8).
Action: Answer("B") 
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
