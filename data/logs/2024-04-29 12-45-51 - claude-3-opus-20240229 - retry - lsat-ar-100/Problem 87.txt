## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The organizer must select at least 5 works total.
2. No more than 4 French works can be selected. So at least 1 Russian work must be selected.
3. At least 3 but no more than 4 novels must be selected. So at least 1 play must be selected.
4. At least as many French novels as Russian novels must be selected. 
5. If both French plays are selected, the Russian play cannot be selected. But we know at least 1 Russian work must be selected from point 2.
6. Putting this together, to satisfy all conditions, the organizer must select:
   - At least 1 Russian novel (to have a Russian work)
   - At least 1 French novel (to have at least as many French novels as Russian)
   - At least 1 play (French or Russian)
Therefore, the organizer must at least select one Russian novel and one French novel. The play could be either French or Russian.
