Context: A chemistry class has six lab sessions scheduled over three days—Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday—one session heing held each morning and one each afternoon. Each session will be led by a different lab assistant—Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, or Rebecca. The assignment of lab assistants to sessions is constrained as follows: Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day. Nessa must lead an afternoon session. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
Question: If Lan does not lead a Wednesday session, then which one of the following lab assistants must lead a Thursday session?
Choices:
  A: Rebecca
  B: Olivia
  C: Nessa
  D: Kevin
  E: Julio

## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions on the same day. So if Lan does not lead a Wednesday session, Olivia must lead a Wednesday session (since those are the only two days left).
2. Julio's session must be earlier in the week than Olivia's. Since Olivia is leading a Wednesday session, Julio must also lead a Wednesday session.
3. Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions on the same day. Since both Wednesday sessions are taken by Olivia and Julio, Kevin and Rebecca must lead the Thursday sessions.
4. The only remaining lab assistant is Nessa. We're told Nessa must lead an afternoon session. The only afternoon session left is on Friday. So Nessa will lead the Friday afternoon session.
Therefore, if Lan does not lead a Wednesday session, both Kevin and Rebecca must lead Thursday sessions.
Since the question only asks for one lab assistant, either Kevin or Rebecca is a correct answer. I'll choose Kevin arbitrarily.
Action: Answer("D")
