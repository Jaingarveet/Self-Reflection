## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. P is performed 3rd and S is performed 6th. This means there are two compositions performed between P and S.
2. O must be performed either 1st or 5th. Since P is 3rd, O must be performed 5th.
3. The 8th composition is either L or H. 
4. T must be either immediately before F or immediately after R.
5. There must be at least two compositions either between F and R, or between R and F.
6. There must be at least one composition either between O and S, or between S and O. We know O is 5th and S is 6th, so this condition is satisfied.
Putting this together:
- O is definitely performed 5th
- P is 3rd 
- S is 6th
- The 8th is L or H
The only possible orders that satisfy all conditions are:
1. _ , _ , P , _ , O , S , _ , L/H
2. _ , _ , P , _ , O , S , _ , L/H
Where the blanks can be filled by the remaining compositions F, H/L, R, T following the other conditions.
Therefore, the composition performed 5th must be O.
Action: Answer("E")
