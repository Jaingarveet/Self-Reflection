Context: A bakery makes exactly three kinds of cookieâ€”oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar. Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day. The following conditions apply: No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
Question: If one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, then which one of the following could be false?

## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. We know the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday. So one of the other two batches of sugar cookies must be made on Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday. 
2. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. This means the first batch of oatmeal cookies must be made before this day, and the third batch after.
3. One kind of cookie's first batch is made the same day as another kind's third batch. This means all three batches of one of the cookie types must be completed in the first three days (Mon-Wed).
4. Given the above, the only cookie type that could have all three batches done by Wednesday is peanut butter cookies. The first batch would be Monday, second with the second oatmeal on Tues or Wed, and third on the other of those two days.
5. This means that one batch of sugar cookies and one of oatmeal cookies must be made on Friday. 
6. Therefore, it cannot be true that exactly one batch of cookies is made on Friday. Two batches must be made that day.
Action: Answer("E")
## Result:
Agent Answer: E
Correct Answer: E
Score: 1
