Topic: Law
Context: A government needs to assign new ambassadors to Venezuela, Yemen, and Zambia. The candidates for these ambassadorships are Jaramillo, Kayne, Landon, Novetzke, and Ong. One ambassador will be assigned to each country, and no ambassador will be assigned to more than one country. The assignment of the ambassadors must meet the following constraints: Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships. If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne. If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen. If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
Question: If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Jaramillo is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela.
  B: Landon is assigned as ambassador to Zambia.
  C: Ong is assigned as ambassador to Zambia.
  D: Jaramillo is not assigned to an ambassadorship.
  E: Ong is not assigned to an ambassadorship.

## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. We are told that either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned an ambassadorship. Since the question states that Kayne is assigned to Yemen, we know Novetzke is not assigned an ambassadorship.
2. We are also told that if Jaramillo is assigned an ambassadorship, then so is Kayne. Since Kayne is assigned, Jaramillo may or may not be assigned. We don't have enough information to determine this for certain.
3. If Ong is assigned to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned to Yemen. But since Kayne is assigned to Yemen, we can conclude that Ong is not assigned to Venezuela. However, Ong could still be assigned to Zambia.
4. If Landon is assigned, it must be to Zambia. But we don't know for certain if Landon is assigned at all.
5. Looking at the answer choices:
   A: We can't determine if Jaramillo is assigned to Venezuela. Insufficient information.
   B: We can't determine if Landon is assigned to Zambia. Insufficient information.
   C: We can't determine if Ong is assigned to Zambia. Insufficient information.
   D: We can't determine if Jaramillo is not assigned an ambassadorship. Insufficient information.
   E: We know Ong is not assigned to Venezuela, but Ong could still be assigned to Zambia. So this statement is not necessarily true.
None of the answer choices can be definitively determined to be true based on the information provided. The question cannot be answered with certainty.
Action: Answer("E")

Agent Answer: E
