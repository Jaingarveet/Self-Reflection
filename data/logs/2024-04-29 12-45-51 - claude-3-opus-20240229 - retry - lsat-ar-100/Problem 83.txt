Context: A chemistry class has six lab sessions scheduled over three days—Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday—one session heing held each morning and one each afternoon. Each session will be led by a different lab assistant—Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, or Rebecca. The assignment of lab assistants to sessions is constrained as follows: Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day. Nessa must lead an afternoon session. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
Question: If Julio and Kevin both lead morning sessions, then any of the following could be true EXCEPT:
Choices:
  A: Lan's session meets Wednesday morning.
  B: Lan's session meets Thursday afternoon.
  C: Nessa's session meets Friday afternoon.
  D: Olivia's session meets Thursday morning.
  E: Olivia's session meets Friday morning.

## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. Julio and Kevin are both leading morning sessions. This means they must be on different days, since there is only one morning session per day.
2. Rebecca must lead a session on the same day as Kevin. Since Kevin is leading a morning session, Rebecca must lead the afternoon session on the same day.
3. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions on the same day. 
4. Julio's session must be on an earlier day than Olivia's. Since Julio is leading a morning session, Olivia must lead either an afternoon session on the same day as Julio, or any session on a later day.
5. Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
Now, let's consider each answer choice:
A: Lan's session could meet Wednesday morning, as this doesn't violate any constraints.
B: Lan's session could meet Thursday afternoon, as long as Olivia's session is not on Thursday.
C: Nessa's session could meet Friday afternoon, as this satisfies the constraint that Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
D: Olivia's session cannot meet Thursday morning, because this would mean Julio's session is on Wednesday (earlier than Olivia's), and Kevin's session is also on Thursday (same day as Olivia's). This violates the constraint that Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions on the same day, because the only remaining day for Lan would be Thursday.
E: Olivia's session could meet Friday morning, as long as Lan's session is on Wednesday.
Therefore, the answer choice that cannot be true is D.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
