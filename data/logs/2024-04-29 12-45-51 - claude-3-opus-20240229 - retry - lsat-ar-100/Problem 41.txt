Topic: Law
Context: On the first day of a two-day study for a cycling magazine, four riders—Reynaldo, Seamus, Theresa, and Yuki—will each test one of four bicycles—F, G, H, and J. Each rider will then test a different one of the bicycles on the second day. Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day. The assignment of riders to bicycles is subject to the following conditions: Reynaldo cannot test F. Yuki cannot test J. Theresa must be one of the testers for H. The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
Question: If Theresa tests G on the second day, then which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Reynaldo tests H on the first day.
  B: Reynaldo tests J on the first day.
  C: Theresa tests H on the second day.
  D: Theresa tests J on the first day.
  E: Yuki tests H on the second day.

## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. We know Theresa tests G on the second day. 
2. Theresa must test one of the bicycles on H, and since she's testing G on the second day, she must test H on the first day.
3. Yuki can't test J, so the only options for Yuki on the first day are F, G, or H. But we know Theresa is testing H on the first day, so Yuki must test either F or G on the first day.
4. Whichever bicycle Yuki tests on the first day, Seamus must test that same bicycle on the second day. 
5. Reynaldo can't test F. So if Yuki tests F on the first day, Reynaldo must test G on the first day (since Theresa is testing H). But then Seamus would have to test F on the second day, leaving no option for Reynaldo on the second day (since he can't test F, and G and H are already taken on the second day).
6. Therefore, Yuki must test G on the first day, and Seamus must test G on the second day.
7. This leaves F and J for Reynaldo. Since Reynaldo can't test F, Reynaldo must test J on the first day.
Therefore, the correct answer is B: Reynaldo tests J on the first day.
Action: Answer("B")
