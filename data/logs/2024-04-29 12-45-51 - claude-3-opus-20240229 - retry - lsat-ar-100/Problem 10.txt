## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The selection must have at least 5 works but no more than 6 total.
2. No more than 4 French works can be selected. This means 1-4 French works.
3. At least 3 novels but no more than 4 novels must be selected. 
4. The number of French novels must be greater than or equal to the number of Russian novels.
5. If both French plays are selected, the Russian play cannot be selected.
Now let's evaluate each choice:
A. 1 French novel, 2 Russian novels, 1 French play, 1 Russian play
   - This has 5 works total, 3 novels, and 2 French works. Meets all criteria so far.
   - But it has more Russian novels than French novels. Violates rule 4.
B. 2 French novels, 1 Russian novel, 2 French plays, 1 Russian play 
   - 6 works total, 4 French works, 3 novels. Meets criteria 1-3.
   - 2 French novels >= 1 Russian novel. Meets rule 4.
   - But it selects both French plays and the Russian play. Violates rule 5.
C. 2 French novels, 2 Russian novels, 2 French plays
   - 6 works, 4 French works, 4 novels. Meets criteria 1-3. 
   - Equal number of French and Russian novels. Meets rule 4.
   - Selects both French plays but not the Russian play. Meets rule 5.
   - Meets all the criteria. This could be a valid selection.
D. 3 French novels, 1 Russian novel, 2 French plays
   - 6 works, all 6 are French. Violates rule 2 (max 4 French works).
E. 3 French novels, 2 Russian novels, 1 Russian play
   - 6 works, 5 novels, 3 French works. Meets criteria 1-3.
   - But it has fewer French novels than Russian novels. Violates rule 4.
Therefore, the only selection that meets all the criteria is choice C.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
