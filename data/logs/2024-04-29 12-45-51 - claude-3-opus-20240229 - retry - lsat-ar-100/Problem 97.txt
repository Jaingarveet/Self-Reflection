Context: A bakery makes exactly three kinds of cookieâ€”oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar. Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day. The following conditions apply: No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
Question: If the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday, then each of the following could be true EXCEPT:

## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. We know the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies, which is Tuesday. 
2. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
3. No two batches of the same kind are made on the same day. So on Thursday, only the second batch of sugar cookies can be made.
4. Therefore, choice D "Two different kinds of cookie have their second batch made on Thursday" cannot be true. The second batch of only one kind (sugar) is made on Thursday.
5. All other choices are possible:
   A: First batches of oatmeal and sugar could be Monday 
   B: First batches of oatmeal and peanut butter are Tuesday
   C: Second batches of peanut butter and sugar could be Wednesday
   E: Third batches of any two kinds could be Friday
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
