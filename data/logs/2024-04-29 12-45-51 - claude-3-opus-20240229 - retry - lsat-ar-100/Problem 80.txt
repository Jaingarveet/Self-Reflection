Context: An administrator must assign parking spaces to six new employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young. Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
Question: Which one of the following could be the assignment of parking spaces to the new employees?
Choices:
  A: #1: Young; #2: Souza; #3: Vaughn; #4: Robertson; #5: Togowa; #6: Xu
  B: #1: Vaughn; #2: Togowa; #3: Young; #4: Souza; #5: Robertson; #6: Xu
  C: #1: Togowa; #2: Young; #3: Xu; #4: Robertson; #5: Souza; #6: Vaughn
  D: #1: Togowa; #2: Robertson; #3: Young; #4: Souza; #5: Vaughn; #6: Xu

## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. This eliminates choices C and D, which have Togowa in a higher space than Young.
2. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. This eliminates choice A, which has Souza in a higher space than Xu. 
3. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. This eliminates choice B, which has Young in a higher space than Robertson.
4. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4. The only remaining choice that satisfies this is E, which has Robertson in space #4.
Therefore, the only assignment that satisfies all the given rules is:
#1: Souza 
#2: Togowa
#3: Young
#4: Robertson
#5: Xu
#6: Vaughn
Action: Answer("E")
## Result:
Agent Answer: E
Correct Answer: E
Score: 1
