You are an expert in Law.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Topic: Law
Context: A panel of five scientists will be formed. The panelists will be selected from among three botanists—F, G, and H—three chemists—K, L, and M—and three zoologists—P, Q, and R. Selection is governed by the following conditions: The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types. If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. F and K cannot both be selected. K and M cannot both be selected. If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
Question: If four of the scientists selected are F, L, Q, and R, which one of the following must be the fifth scientist selected?
Choices:
  A: G
  B: H
  C: K
  D: M
  E: P

## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The panel already includes F (a botanist), L (a chemist), Q and R (both zoologists). 
2. The conditions state that if more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist can be selected. Since F is already on the panel, selecting G or H would mean having more than one botanist. And since Q and R are already selected, that would violate this condition. So G and H cannot be selected.
3. K cannot be selected because F is already on the panel, and the conditions state that F and K cannot both be selected.
4. If M is selected, then both P and R must be selected according to the conditions. But R is already on the panel, and adding both M and P would make the panel have 6 members instead of 5. So M cannot be the fifth scientist.
5. The only remaining option is P. Selecting P satisfies all the conditions: 
   - The panel would have at least one of each type of scientist (F-botanist, L-chemist, P/Q/R-zoologists)
   - It has only one botanist (F) and more than one zoologist, which is allowed
   - It doesn't include both F and K, or both K and M
   - M is not selected, so the condition about selecting both P and R with M doesn't apply
Therefore, P must be the fifth scientist selected.
Action: Answer("E")
