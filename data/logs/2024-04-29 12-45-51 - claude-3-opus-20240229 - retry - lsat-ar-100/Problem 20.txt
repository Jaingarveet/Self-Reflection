## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. Kyle and Lenore are not giving reports, so we only need to consider the other 6 students.
2. George can only give a report on Tuesday. So if he's giving a morning report, it must be on Tuesday morning.
3. Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports. So if they are giving reports, they must be in the morning.
4. If Nina gives a report, then the next day both Helen and Irving must give reports (unless Nina reports on Wednesday). 
5. Looking at the answer choices:
   A) Helen, George, and Nina - This could work. Helen and Nina could go Monday and Wednesday morning, with George on Tuesday morning.
   
   B) Irving, Robert, and Helen - This doesn't work. If Robert goes in the morning, he must go Monday or Wednesday. But then Irving and Helen would need to go the next day, which isn't possible.
   
   C) Nina, Helen, and Olivia - This doesn't work. If Nina goes Monday, then Helen and Irving must go Tuesday. If Nina goes Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must go Wednesday. Either way, Olivia can't fit.
   
   D) Olivia, Robert, and Irving - This doesn't work for the same reason as B. Robert must go Monday or Wednesday morning, forcing Irving to go the next day, but that's not what's listed.
   
   E) Robert, George, and Helen - This works. Robert Monday morning, George Tuesday morning, Helen Wednesday morning.
Therefore, the possible correct answers are A and E. But E makes the most sense logically, as it spreads out the morning reports evenly among Robert, George, and Helen.
Action: Answer("E")
## Result:
Agent Answer: E
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
