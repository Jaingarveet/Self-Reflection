The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.

## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4. This means Robertson has 4 possible spaces.
2. Young must be assigned a lower-numbered parking space than Robertson. Since Robertson can be in spaces #1-4, Young must be in space #5 or #6. Young has 2 possible spaces.
3. Togowa must be assigned a lower-numbered parking space than Young. Since Young is in space #5 or #6, Togowa must be in spaces #1-4. Togowa has 4 possible spaces. 
4. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. This means Souza must be in a lower-numbered space than Xu. But we don't know specifically which spaces they can be in.
5. We haven't determined anything specific about Vaughn's parking space.
In summary:
- Robertson: 4 possible spaces (#1-4)
- Young: 2 possible spaces (#5-6) 
- Togowa: 4 possible spaces (#1-4)
- Xu, Souza, Vaughn: No specific limitations determined
Therefore, only 1 employee (Young) is limited to one of 2 possible spaces.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
