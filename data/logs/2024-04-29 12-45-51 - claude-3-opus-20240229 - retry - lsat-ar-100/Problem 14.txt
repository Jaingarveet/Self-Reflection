Context: At a concert, exactly eight compositions—F, H, L, O, P, R, S, and T—are to be performed exactly once each, consecutively and one composition at a time. The order of their performance must satisfy the following conditions: T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R. At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F. O is performed either first or fifth. The eighth composition performed is either L or H. P is performed at some time before S. At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
Question: If T is performed fifth and F is performed sixth, then S must be performed either

  A: fourth or seventh
  B: third or sixth
  C: third or fourth

## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. We know T is performed fifth and F is performed sixth. This satisfies the condition that T is performed immediately before F.
2. Since there are 8 compositions total, and T and F take up the 5th and 6th slots, that leaves 6 other slots: 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 7th, and 8th.
3. O must be performed either first or fifth. Since T is fifth, O must be first.
4. The eighth composition is either L or H. So the 7th slot is still open.
5. P must be performed before S. And there must be at least one composition either between O and S, or between S and O.
6. Given O is first, and the 7th and 8th slots are taken by either L or H, that means S must be either 2nd, 3rd, or 4th in order to have at least one composition between O and S. 
7. And for P to be before S, P must be either 2nd or 3rd (if S is 4th), or just 2nd (if S is 3rd).
Therefore, S must be performed either third or fourth.
Action: Answer("C")
