Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day.

## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. No two batches of the same cookie are made on the same day. This means each cookie type must be made on 3 different days.
2. At least one batch is made on Monday. Let's assume it's a batch of oatmeal cookies for now.
3. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday. So the other two batches must be on Monday and one other day (not Thursday).
4. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. 
   If oatmeal starts Monday, the second batch can't be Monday or Thursday (sugar cookie day). Let's say it's Tuesday.
   So peanut butter is also made Tuesday, and must have two other non-Tuesday days.
5. Looking at the answer choices, only B and D have oatmeal on Monday and Tuesday, and sugar on Monday and Thursday.
6. Between B and D, only D has peanut butter not on Tuesday, fitting the criteria.
Therefore, the answer that fits all the conditions is D.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
