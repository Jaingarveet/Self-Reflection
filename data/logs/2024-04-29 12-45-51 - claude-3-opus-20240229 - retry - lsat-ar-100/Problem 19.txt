## User 2:
Topic: Law
Context: Of the eight students—George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert—in a seminar, exactly six will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
Question: If Helen, Kyle, and Lenore, not necessarily in that order, give the three morning reports, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Helen gives a report on Monday.
  B: Irving gives a report on Monday.
  C: Irving gives a report on Wednesday.
  D: Kyle gives a report on Tuesday.

## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. Helen, Kyle, and Lenore give the three morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, in some order.
2. George can only report on Tuesday. Since the morning slot on Tuesday is taken by one of Helen, Kyle or Lenore, George must report in the afternoon on Tuesday.
3. Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports. So the afternoon reports on Monday and Wednesday must be given by either Irving or Nina. 
4. If Nina gives a report, then the next day both Helen and Irving must give reports (unless Nina reports on Wednesday). But we know Helen gives a morning report. So if Nina reports, she must do so on Monday or Tuesday afternoon, so that Irving can report the following afternoon.
5. Since Irving must report on the afternoon following Nina, he cannot give a morning report. Therefore, the morning reports must be given by Helen, Kyle and Lenore.
6. The only way to satisfy all the conditions is:
   Monday morning: Helen, Kyle or Lenore
   Monday afternoon: Nina
   Tuesday morning: Helen, Kyle or Lenore
   Tuesday afternoon: George
   Wednesday morning: Helen, Kyle or Lenore
   Wednesday afternoon: Irving
7. Looking at the answer choices, only C fits this scenario - Irving must give a report on Wednesday (afternoon).
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
