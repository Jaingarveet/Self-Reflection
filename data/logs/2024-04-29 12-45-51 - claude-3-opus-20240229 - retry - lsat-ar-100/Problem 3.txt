Context: An administrator must assign parking spaces to six new employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young. Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.

## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. Robertson is assigned parking space #3. This means spaces #1 and #2 are open for others.
2. Young must be assigned a lower-numbered space than Robertson. Since Robertson has #3, the only options for Young are #1 and #2. 
3. Togowa must be assigned a lower-numbered space than Young. Since Young has to be in #1 or #2, the only option for Togowa is #1.
4. So if Robertson is in #3, then Young must be in #2 (to be lower than Robertson but higher than Togowa).
5. Xu must be higher than Souza. The remaining spots are #4, #5 and #6. Souza and Xu could be arranged in any of those in a way that fits this rule.
6. Vaughn gets whichever of #4, #5 or #6 is left after assigning Xu and Souza.
Therefore, if Robertson is assigned parking space #3, then Young must be assigned parking space #2.
Action: Answer("E")
