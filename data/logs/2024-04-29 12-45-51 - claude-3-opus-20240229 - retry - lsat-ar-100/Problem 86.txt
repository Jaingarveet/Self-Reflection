Each bay is holding a different one of exactly six types of cargoâ€”fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles. The following apply: The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock. The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles. The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel. The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
Question: If bay 4 is holding produce, then for exactly how many of the six bays is the type of cargo that bay is holding completely determined?

## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. Bay 4 is holding produce. This is given in the question.
2. The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce. So textiles must be in either bay 3 or bay 5. 
3. The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles. Since textiles is in either bay 3 or 5, livestock must be in a higher numbered bay. It can't be bay 4 (produce) or bay 5 (the only option higher than bay 3 for textiles). So livestock must be in bay 6.
4. The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock. But livestock is in the highest numbered bay (6), so this is impossible. There is no arrangement that satisfies all the conditions.
Since the given information leads to an impossible situation, not all the bays can be determined. The question asks for the number of bays that are completely determined. We know for sure the cargo of two bays: bay 4 (produce) and bay 6 (livestock).
Action: Answer("A")
