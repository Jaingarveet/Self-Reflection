## Reflection on Incorrect Answer:
My initial answer was incorrect because I focused solely on the aspect of discretionary nonenforcement without considering the broader context of social costs and alternative solutions. While the plan described in Passage B does involve selective enforcement, it also raises concerns about fairness and potential negative consequences.
## Error Keywords:
* **Overgeneralization:** Applying the concept of discretionary nonenforcement without considering the specific circumstances and potential drawbacks.
* **Limited perspective:** Focusing solely on the agency's actions without considering the impact on individuals and the availability of alternative solutions.
## Step-by-Step Solution:
1. **Identify the key arguments in Passage A:**
    * Law enforcement agencies often use discretionary nonenforcement to address overinclusive rules.
    * This approach helps reduce the social costs of enforcing such rules strictly.
    * However, it's crucial to ensure that discretionary enforcement is not arbitrary and aligns with the intended purpose of the law.
2. **Analyze the plan described in Passage B:**
    * The plan involves selectively cutting off water to high-income households with outstanding bills.
    * This approach aims to deter delinquency and demonstrate seriousness in collecting debts.
    * However, it raises concerns about fairness and potential negative consequences for affected individuals.
3. **Compare the plan to the author's arguments in Passage A:**
    * The plan can be seen as a form of discretionary nonenforcement, as it targets specific individuals rather than enforcing the rule uniformly.
    * However, the author would likely raise concerns about the potential social costs of this approach, particularly for those who might be unfairly targeted.
4. **Consider alternative solutions mentioned in Passage B:**
    * Placing liens on properties could provide a more effective and less disruptive way to collect outstanding debts.
    * Changing the law to allow liens for water charges would address the legal loophole and provide a more comprehensive solution.
5. **Choose the answer that best reflects the author's perspective:**
    * Option B aligns with the author's argument that discretionary nonenforcement can be a useful tool but should be carefully considered in light of potential social costs and alternative solutions.
## Instructions for Future Problems:
