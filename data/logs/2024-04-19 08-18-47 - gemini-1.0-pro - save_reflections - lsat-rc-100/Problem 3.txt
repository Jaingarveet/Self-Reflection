## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I incorrectly identified the answer choice that most undermined the connection between increased size and monopoly power. 
My error was in focusing on the concept of monopoly power itself, rather than on the connection between size and monopoly power.
Error Keywords:
 - Misunderstanding the question
 - Focusing on the wrong aspect of the problem
 - Ignoring relevant information
Solution:
The author argues that increasing returns to scale create a natural tendency toward monopoly.
Choice A weakens this connection because it shows that monopoly power is possible even without large size.
Choice B is irrelevant to the connection between size and monopoly power.
Choice C strengthens the connection between size and monopoly power.
Choice D weakens the connection between size and monopoly power because it shows that increasing returns to scale are not always achieved by large businesses.
Choice E weakens the connection between size and monopoly power because it shows that increasing returns to scale may not always lead to lower costs.
Instructions:
1. Carefully read the question and identify the key concepts.
2. Identify the author's argument.
3. Consider each answer choice and determine how it affects the connection between the key concepts.
4. Choose the answer choice that most weakens the connection between the key concepts.
Advice:
 - Pay close attention to the wording of the question and the author's argument.
 - Consider all of the answer choices carefully.
 - Do not make assumptions about the author's argument.
 - Be clear and concise in your reasoning.
