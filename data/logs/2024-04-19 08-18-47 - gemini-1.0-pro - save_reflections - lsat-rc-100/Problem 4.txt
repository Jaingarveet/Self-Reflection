## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I focused on the passage's description of Marshall's use of expert testimony in lower courts rather than on the passage's description of his selection of plaintiffs.
Error Keywords:
 - Reading comprehension error
 - Focus error
 - Detail-oriented error
Solution:
The passage states that Marshall "carefully selected cases with sympathetic litigants, whose public appeal, credibility, and commitment to the NAACP's goals were unsurpassed."
This statement directly supports the claim that Marshall declined to pursue some cases that were in keeping with the NAACP's goals but whose plaintiffs' likely impression on the public he deemed to be unfavorable.
Instructions:
1. Read the passage carefully and identify the main points.
2. Identify the specific question being asked.
3. Look for specific evidence in the passage that supports or refutes each answer choice.
4. Choose the answer choice that is most directly supported by the evidence in the passage.
5. Do not make assumptions or inferences that are not supported by the passage.
Advice:
 - Pay close attention to the wording of the question and the answer choices.
 - Look for key words and phrases that can help you identify the correct answer.
 - Eliminate answer choices that are clearly wrong or that are not supported by the passage.
 - If you are unsure of the answer, choose the answer choice that is most likely to be correct based on the information in the passage.
