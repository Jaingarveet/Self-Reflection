## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:**
My initial answer was incorrect because I focused solely on the specific claim about Morrison being the first to use a musical genre as a structuring principle, neglecting the broader context of the author's argument. 
**Error Keywords:**
* **Contextual Misinterpretation:** Failing to consider the full context of the author's argument.
* **Overemphasis on Specific Claim:** Focusing too narrowly on a single point without considering its relation to the larger argument.
* **Neglecting Alternative Possibilities:** Ignoring the possibility that other factors might challenge the author's assertion.
**Solution:**
1. **Identify the Author's Main Argument:** The author argues that Morrison's novel "Jazz" innovatively uses a musical structure to shape the narrative, drawing parallels to Duke Ellington's approach to jazz composition.
2. **Analyze the Lines in Question:** Lines 11-16 specifically state that Morrison was the first African American writer to employ this technique.
3. **Consider Challenging Scenarios:** The author's claim would be most challenged if other African American writers had previously used similar musical structuring principles in their novels.
4. **Evaluate Answer Choices:** Only option D directly contradicts the author's claim by suggesting that musicality in novels is not unique to Morrison's work.
**Instructions for Future Reference:**
1. **Read the passage carefully and identify the author's main argument.**
2. **Pay close attention to the specific claim being made in the question.**
3. **Consider alternative scenarios that might challenge the author's claim.**
4. **Evaluate answer choices based on their alignment with the author's argument and the specific claim in question.**
5. **Do not focus solely on specific details while neglecting the broader context.**
**General Advice for Similar Problems:**
* **Actively engage with the text:** Don't just passively read; question, analyze, and interpret the author's arguments.
* **Consider the author's purpose and intended audience.**
* **Be aware of your own biases and assumptions.**
* **Support your answers with textual evidence.**
* **Practice critical thinking and logical reasoning.**
By following these steps and reflecting on my mistakes, I can improve my ability to answer similar questions accurately in the future.
