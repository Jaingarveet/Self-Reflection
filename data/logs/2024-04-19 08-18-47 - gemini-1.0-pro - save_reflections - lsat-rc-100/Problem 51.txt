## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I incorrectly identified the relationship between the two passages. 
I mistakenly interpreted the second passage as supporting the first passage when it actually presented an opposing viewpoint.
Error Keywords:
 - Misinterpretation
 - Misunderstanding
 - Opposing viewpoints
Solution:
The first passage discusses the role of defense lawyers and their obligation to the court and society.
The second passage discusses the relationship between the information in the first passage and the information in the sentence at lines 7-11.
The sentence at lines 7-11 states that lawyers should not present to the court assertions that they know to be false.
The second passage states that the information in the first passage does not support the statement at lines 7-11.
The second passage argues that lawyers who are convinced that their clients are guilty should not undertake to demonstrate their innocence.
This contradicts the statement at lines 7-11, which suggests that lawyers should always present the best defense possible, regardless of their personal beliefs about their client's guilt or innocence.
Instructions:
1. Carefully read and understand the information in both passages.
2. Identify the main points and arguments presented in each passage.
3. Determine the relationship between the information in the two passages.
4. Consider whether the information in one passage supports, contradicts, or is unrelated to the information in the other passage.
5. Choose the answer that accurately reflects the relationship between the two passages.
Advice:
 - Pay close attention to the language used in each passage, including keywords and phrases that indicate agreement, disagreement, or neutrality.
 - Consider the context of each passage and the overall argument being presented.
 - Be cautious of drawing conclusions based on assumptions or personal opinions.
 - If unsure, reread the passages and carefully analyze the information presented before making a decision.
