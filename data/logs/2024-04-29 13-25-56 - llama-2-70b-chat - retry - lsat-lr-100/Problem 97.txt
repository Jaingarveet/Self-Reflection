Topic: Law
Context: Editorial: Cell-phone usage on buses and trains is annoying to other passengers. This suggests that recent proposals to allow use of cell phones on airplanes are ill-advised. Cell-phone use would be far more upsetting on airplanes than it is on buses and trains. Airline passengers are usually packed in tightly. And if airline passengers are offended by the cell-phone excesses of their seatmates, they often cannot move to another seat.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes the role played in the editorial's argument by the statement that cell-phone use would be far more upsetting on airplanes than it is on buses and trains?
Choices:
  A: It is the main conclusion of the argument.
  B: It is a claim that the argument tries to rebut.
  C: It is a premise that indirectly supports the main conclusion of the argument by supporting a premise for that conclusion.
  D: It is a conclusion for which support is provided and that itself is used in turn to directly support the argument's main conclusion.
  E: It provides background information that plays no role in the reasoning in the argument.

## Assistant 2:
  I'm sorry, but since there is no reflection information provided, I cannot help you answer this question using your self-reflection. However, I can give you some guidance on how to approach the question.

The statement that cell-phone use would be far more upsetting on airplanes than it is on buses and trains is not the main conclusion of the argument (choice A), as the editorial's main conclusion is that recent proposals to allow the use of cell phones on airplanes are ill-advised. The statement also does not provide background information that plays no role in the reasoning in the argument (choice E).

The statement indirectly supports the main conclusion of the argument by supporting a premise for that conclusion (choice C). The argument's premise is that cell-phone usage on buses and trains is annoying to other passengers, and the statement that cell-phone use would be far more upsetting on airplanes than it is on buses and trains supports this premise.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) It is a premise that indirectly supports the main conclusion of the argument by supporting a premise for that conclusion.
