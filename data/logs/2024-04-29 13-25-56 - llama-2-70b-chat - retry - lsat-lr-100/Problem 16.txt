Context: There are 70 to 100 Florida panthers alive today. This represents a very large increase over their numbers in the 1970s, but their population must reach at least 250 if it is to be self-sustaining. Their current habitat is not large enough to support any more of these animals, however.
Question: If the statements above are true, which one of the following must also be true?
Choices:
  A: Some part of the panthers' current habitat is only of marginal quality.
  B: If the population of Florida panthers ever exceeds 250, it will be self-sustaining.
  C: Unless Florida panthers acquire a larger habitat, their population will not be self-sustaining.
  D: The population of Florida panthers will never increase much beyond its current level.
  E: Today, Florida panthers occupy a larger habitat than they did in the 1970s.

## Assistant 2:
  I'm sorry, but since there is no reflection information provided, I cannot use my self-reflection to help me answer this question. However, I can give you the correct answer and explain why it is correct.

The correct answer is C: Unless Florida panthers acquire a larger habitat, their population will not be self-sustaining.

The passage states that the current habitat of the Florida panthers is not large enough to support any more of these animals, and their population must reach at least 250 if it is to be self-sustaining. Therefore, if the panthers are to have a self-sustaining population, they must acquire a larger habitat. This means that choice C is the correct answer.

The other choices are not supported by the information in the passage. Choice A is not necessarily true, as the passage does not mention the quality of the panthers' current habitat. Choice B is also not necessarily true, as the passage does not state that the population will be self-sustaining if it exceeds 250. Choice D is incorrect, as the passage states that the population must reach at least 250 to be self-sustaining, implying that it will increase beyond its current level if it is to reach that threshold. Choice E is incorrect, as the passage does not mention whether the panthers' current habitat is larger or smaller than it was in the 1970s.
## Result:

Correct Answer: C
