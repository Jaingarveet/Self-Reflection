Context: Art critic: The Woerner Journalism Award for criticism was given to Nan Paulsen for her reviews of automobiles. This is inappropriate. The criticism award should be given for criticism, which Paulsen's reviews clearly were not. After alL cars are utilitarian things, not works of art. And objects that are not works of art do not reveal important truths about the culture that produced them.
Question: Which one of the following principles, if valid, most helps to justiJY the reasoning in the art critic's argument?
Choices:
  A: The Woemer Journalism Award for criticism should not be given to a writer who portrays utilitarian objects as works of art.
  B: Reviews of objects cannot appropriately be considered to be criticism unless the objects reveal important truths about the culture that produced them.
  C: Unless a review is written for the purpose of revealing important truths about the writer's culture, that review should not be considered to be criticism.
  D: The Woerner JournalismAward for criticism should not be given to writers who do not consider themselves to be critics.
  E: All writing that reveals important truths about a culture should be considered to be criticism.

## Assistant 2:
  I apologize for the confusion. Since there's no reflection information provided, I'll answer the question based on my understanding of the given information.

The principle that most helps to justify the reasoning in the art critic's argument is:

B: Reviews of objects cannot appropriately be considered to be criticism unless the objects reveal important truths about the culture that produced them.

The art critic argues that Nan Paulsen's reviews of automobiles should not have received the Woerner Journalism Award for criticism because cars are utilitarian objects, not works of art. The critic suggests that objects that are not works of art do not reveal important truths about the culture that produced them, and therefore, reviews of such objects should not be considered criticism.

Option B aligns with the critic's argument by emphasizing that reviews of objects must reveal important truths about the culture that produced them to be considered criticism. This principle supports the critic's view that Paulsen's reviews of cars were not appropriate for the criticism award since cars are not works of art that reveal important cultural truths.

While other options may also relate to the argument, option B most directly aligns with the critic's reasoning and justifies their objection to Paulsen's award.
