## Assistant 2:
  I'm sorry, but since you didn't provide any reflection information, I can't help you answer this question.

However, I can give you some general tips on how to approach this question.

First, read the question stem carefully and identify the key elements:

* The museum displays only twentieth-century works.
* The museum store sells prints of some works that are not part of the museum's permanent collection.
* Hopper's Nighthawks is a twentieth-century work that is not part of the museum's permanent collection.

Next, consider each choice and determine whether it must be true based on the given information:

A: Every print in the museum store is of a work that is either on loan to the museum from a private collector or part of the museum's permanent collection.

This choice is too broad and doesn't take into account the fact that the museum store also sells prints of works that are not part of the museum's permanent collection. Therefore, this choice cannot be true.

B: Every print that is sold in the museum store is a copy of a twentieth-century work.

This choice is also too broad, as it doesn't account for the fact that the museum store sells prints of works that are not part of the museum's permanent collection. Therefore, this choice cannot be true.

C: There are prints in the museum store of every work that is displayed in the museum and not on loan from a private collector.

This choice is incorrect, as the museum store sells prints of works that are not displayed in the museum, such as Hopper's Nighthawks. Therefore, this choice cannot be true.

D: Hopper's Nighthawks is both a twentieth-century work and a work on loan to the museum from a private collector.

This choice is incorrect, as Hopper's Nighthawks is not on loan to the museum from a private collector. Therefore, this choice cannot be true.

E: Hopper's Nighthawks is not displayed in the museum.

This choice is true, as the museum store sells prints of Hopper's Nighthawks, which is not displayed in the museum. Therefore, this choice must be true.

In summary, the correct answer is E: Hopper's Nighthawks is not displayed in the museum.
