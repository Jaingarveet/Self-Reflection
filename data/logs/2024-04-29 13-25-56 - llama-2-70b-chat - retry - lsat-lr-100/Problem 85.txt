Context: Ditalgame Corporation's computer video games are subject to widespread illegal copying. To combat this piracy, Ditalgame will begin using a new copy protection feature on its games.

Question: Which one of the following, if true, provides the most support for the president's prediction?
Choices:
  A: Ditalgame has spent millions of dollars developing the new copy protection feature , and the company can recoup these costs only if its sales increase substantially.
  B: Over the last several years, the market for computer games has grown steadily, but Ditalgame's share of that market has shrunk considerably.
  C: The copy protection feature causes a copied game to be playable just long enough for most people to come to enjoy it so much that they decide they have to have it.
  D: Game Review Monthly, the most commonly read magazine among people who frequently copy computer games, generally gives favorable reviews to Ditalgame games.
  E: Computer games produced by Ditalgame are copied more frequently than computer games

## Assistant 2:
  I apologize for the confusion. Since I don't have any reflection information to guide me, I'll answer the question based on my understanding of the given information.

The correct answer is C: The copy protection feature causes a copied game to be playable just long enough for most people to come to enjoy it so much that they decide they have to have it.

This answer choice supports the president's prediction that the new copy protection feature will lead to a substantial increase in sales. If the feature allows pirated copies to be playable for a limited time, it may encourage people who have copied the game to purchase it legally. This could result in increased sales for Ditalgame.

The other answer choices do not provide as much support for the president's prediction:

A: Ditalgame's development costs for the copy protection feature are not directly related to the company's sales. While the company may need to recoup its investment, this does not necessarily mean that sales will increase substantially.

B: Ditalgame's declining market share could be due to various factors, such as increased competition or a lack of innovation in their games. The president's prediction assumes that the new copy protection feature will address the piracy issue and help the company regain its market share.

D: Game Review Monthly's favorable reviews of Ditalgame games may increase demand, but they do not directly address the piracy issue.

E: The fact that Ditalgame's games are copied more frequently than other games does not necessarily mean that the new copy protection feature will be effective in combating piracy.

Therefore, option C provides the most support for the president's prediction.
