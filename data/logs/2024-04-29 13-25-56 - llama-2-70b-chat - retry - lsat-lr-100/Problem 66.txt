Topic: Law
Context: Lawyer: Juries are traditionally given their instructions in convoluted, legalistic language. The verbiage is intended to make the instructions more precise, but greater precision is of little use if most jurors have difficulty understanding the instructions. Since it is more important for jurors to have a basic but adequate understanding of their role than it is for the details of that role to be precisely specified, jury instructions should be formulated in simple, easily comprehensible language.

## Assistant 2:
  Answer: E

The correct answer is E: Jurors do not need to know the precise details of their role in order to have an adequate understanding of that role.

The lawyer's argument is that jury instructions should be formulated in simple, easily comprehensible language because most jurors have difficulty understanding instructions given in convoluted, legalistic language. The lawyer also argues that it is more important for jurors to have a basic but adequate understanding of their role than it is for the details of that role to be precisely specified.

Option E strengthens the lawyer's argument by suggesting that jurors do not need to know all the precise details of their role in order to have an adequate understanding of it. This means that simple, easily comprehensible language can still provide jurors with the basic understanding they need to perform their role effectively, even if it does not provide all the precise details that might be specified in convoluted, legalistic language.

The other options do not strengthen the lawyer's argument. Option A states that most jurors are less likely to understand instructions given in convoluted, legalistic language than instructions given in simple, easily comprehensible language. This supports the lawyer's argument, but it does not strengthen it because it does not address the issue of whether jurors need to know all the precise details of their role.

Option B states that most jurors do not have an adequate understanding of their role after being given jury instructions in convoluted, legalistic language. This also supports the lawyer's argument, but it does not strengthen it because it does not address the issue of whether simple, easily comprehensible language can provide jurors with an adequate understanding of their role.

Option C states that jury instructions formulated in simple, easily comprehensible language can adequately describe the role of the jurors. This is a statement of fact that does not address the issue of whether jurors need to know all the precise details of their role.

Option D states that the details of the role of the jurors cannot be specified with complete precision in simple, easily comprehensible language. This weakens the lawyer's argument by suggesting that simple language may not be sufficient to provide jurors with all the information they need to perform their role effectively. However, it does not necessarily mean that jurors need to know all the precise details of their role in order to have an adequate understanding of it. Therefore, option D does not strengthen the lawyer's argument.
