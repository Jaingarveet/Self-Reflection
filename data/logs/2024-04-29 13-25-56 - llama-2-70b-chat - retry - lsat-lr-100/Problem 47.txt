Context: Carl is clearly an incompetent detective. He has solved a smaller percentage of the cases assigned to him in the last 3 years—only 1 out of 25—than any other detective on the police force.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument above?
Choices:
  A: Because the police chief regards Carl as the most capable detective, she assigns him only the most difficult cases, ones that others have failed to solve.
  B: Before he became a detective, Carl was a neighborhood police officer and was highly respected by the residents of the neighborhood he patrolled.
  C: Detectives on the police force on which Carl serves are provided with extensive resources, including the use of a large computer database, to help them solve crimes.
  D: Carl was previously a detective in a police department in another city, and in the 4 years he spent there, he solved only 1 out of 30 crimes.
  E: Many of the officers in the police department in which Carl serves were hired or promoted within the last 5 years.

## Assistant 2:
  I apologize for not having a reflection to provide. Here's my answer:

Action: Answer("D")

Thought:
The argument states that Carl is an incompetent detective because he has only solved 1 out of 25 cases assigned to him in the last 3 years, which is a smaller percentage than any other detective on the police force. However, choice D reveals that Carl's track record in his previous position as a detective in another city was also poor, with a solve rate of 1 out of 30. This suggests that Carl's lack of success is not just a result of the cases he has been assigned, but rather a pattern of incompetence that has followed him throughout his career. Therefore, choice D most seriously weakens the argument above.
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: A
