Topic: Law
Context: Ethicist: Marital vows often contain the promise to love "until death do us part." If "love" here refers to a feeling, then this promise makes no sense, for feelings are not within one's control, and a promise to do something not within one's control makes no sense. Thus, no one—including those making marital vows—should take "love" in this context to be referring to feelings.
Question: The ethicist's conclusion follows logically if which one of the following is assumed?
Choices:
  A: None of our feelings are within our control.
  B: People should not make promises to do something that is not within their control.
  C: "Love" can legitimately be taken to refer to something other than feelings.
  D: Promises should not be interpreted in such a way that they make no sense.
  E: Promises that cannot be kept do not make any sense.

## Assistant 2:
  The ethicist's conclusion follows logically if which one of the following is assumed?

The correct answer is option D: Promises should not be interpreted in such a way that they make no sense.

The ethicist argues that the promise to love "until death do us part" doesn't make sense if "love" refers to a feeling because feelings are not within one's control. This argument relies on the assumption that promises should be interpreted in a way that makes sense and is not contradictory. Option D captures this assumption, as it states that promises should not be interpreted in such a way that they make no sense. Therefore, option D is the best answer.

It's worth noting that option A, "None of our feelings are within our control," is not necessarily true. While some feelings may be outside of our control, such as instinctual reactions or emotions triggered by external events, other feelings may be within our control, such as our long-term emotional states or our choices to cultivate certain emotions.

Option B, "People should not make promises to do something that is not within their control," is also not necessarily true. People can make promises to do things that are not within their control, such as promising to be at a certain place at a certain time despite potential unforeseen circumstances. However, it's important to consider the ethical implications of making such promises and to be mindful of the potential consequences.

Option C, "Love" can legitimately be taken to refer to something other than feelings," is not relevant to the argument. Even if "love" can refer to something other than feelings, the promise to love "until death do us part" would still not make sense if it refers to a feeling that is not within one's control.

Option E, "Promises that cannot be kept do not make any sense," is a broad statement that may not always be true. While it's true that some promises that cannot be kept may not make sense, other promises that cannot be kept may still have significance or serve a purpose, such as expressing a person's intentions or commitments.

In summary, the correct answer is option D, "Promises should not be interpreted in such a way that they make no sense," as it most closely aligns with the ethicist's argument that the promise to love "until death do us part" doesn't make sense if "love" refers to a feeling.
