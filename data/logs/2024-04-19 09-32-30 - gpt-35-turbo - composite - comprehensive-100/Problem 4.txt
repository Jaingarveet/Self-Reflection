## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: At its maximum speed, a space shuttle can travel 700m high in 40 seconds. It will also take 5 seconds to pass a point. What then is the length of the space shuttle?
Choices:
  A: 50 m
  B: 75 m
  C: 100 m
  D: 125 m
  E: 150 m
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I correctly calculated the speed of the space shuttle and the distance it covers in 5 seconds. However, I made an error in calculating the length of the space shuttle. I added the distance covered in 5 seconds to the distance traveled in 40 seconds instead of adding it to the length of the space shuttle. 
Error Keywords:
 - Addition error
 - Calculation error
 - Misinterpretation of the problem
Solution:
The space shuttle travels 700m in 40 seconds, so its speed is 700/40 = 17.5 m/s.
It takes 5 seconds to pass a point, so the distance it covers during this time is 5 x 17.5 = 87.5 m.
Let's assume the length of the space shuttle is "L".
During the 40 seconds, the space shuttle covers a distance of 17.5L m.
The total distance covered by the space shuttle is the sum of the distance covered in 40 seconds and the distance covered in 5 seconds.
Total distance = 17.5L + 87.5
But we know that the total distance is 700m.
Therefore, 17.5L + 87.5 = 700
17.5L = 612.5
L = 35
The length of the space shuttle is 35 x 2 = 70m.
Instructions:
1. Read the problem carefully and understand the question.
2. Identify the given information and what needs to be found.
3. Use the appropriate formula to solve the problem.
4. Double-check your calculations and final answer.
5. If the answer is not among the choices, recheck your calculations.
6. If the answer is still not among the choices, consider if you have misinterpreted the problem.
