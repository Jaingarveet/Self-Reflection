Error Keywords:

Solution:
Let's re-analyze the given conditions:

1. More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, so there must be at least two books on the bottom shelf.
2. I is placed on the middle shelf, so there can be at most one book on the middle shelf.
3. K is placed on a higher shelf than F, so K must be on the top shelf or the bottom shelf.
4. O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so O must be on the top shelf or the middle shelf.
5. F is placed on the same shelf as M, so M must be on the bottom shelf.

Now, let's consider the possible combinations of books on the middle shelf:

A. H, I: This combination is possible only if G is placed on the top shelf.
B. I, L: This combination is possible only if G is placed on the bottom shelf.
C. H, I, L: This combination is possible only if G is placed on the middle shelf.
D. I, K, L: This combination is possible only if G is placed on the bottom shelf.
E. F, I, M: This combination is possible only if G is placed on the top shelf.

Therefore, the complete and accurate list of books placed on the middle shelf is:

D. I, K, L
