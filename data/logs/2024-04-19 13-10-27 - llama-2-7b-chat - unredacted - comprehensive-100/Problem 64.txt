Question: In planning maintenance for a city's infrastructure, a civil engineer estimates that, starting from the present, the population of the city will decrease by 10 percent every 20 years. If the present population of the city is 50,000, which of the following expressions represents the engineer's estimate of the population of the city $t$ years from now?
Choices:
  A: $50,000(0.1)^{20 t}$
  B: $50,000(0.1)^{\frac{t}{20}}$
  C: $50,000(0.9)^{20 t}$
  D: $50,000(0.9)^{\frac{t}{20}}$

Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:

The correct answer is (D) $50,000(0.9)^{\frac{t}{20}}$.

The engineer's estimate of the population of the city $t$ years from now can be represented by a linear decay function, as the population is expected to decrease by 10% every 20 years. This means that the population will decrease at a constant rate, which can be represented by the formula:

Population ($t$ years from now) = Population present ($50,000$) x (1 - 0.10^t)

Where t is the number of years from the present.

So, the correct answer is (D) $50,000(0.9)^{\frac{t}{20}}$.

Error Keywords:

* Linear decay function
* Constant rate of change
* Population growth model

Instructions:

1. Identify the pattern in the engineer's estimate of the population of the city $t$ years from now.
2. Choose the correct formula to represent the population growth model.
3. Plug in the value of t (20 years from the present) to find the estimated population.
4. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
5. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.

Advice:

* Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
* Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
* Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
* Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
* Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
* Remember that the population growth model can be represented by different formulas, such as linear decay functions or exponential functions, depending on the specific pattern of growth.

I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand now that the correct answer is (D) $50,000(0.9)^{\frac{t}{20}}$.

To arrive at this answer, I recognized that the engineer's estimate of the population of the city $t$ years from now can be represented by a linear decay function, as the population is expected to decrease by 10% every 20 years. This means that the population will decrease at a constant rate, which can be represented by the formula:

Population ($t$ years from now) = Population present ($50,000$) x (1 - 0.10^t)

Where t is the number of years from the present.

I plugged in the value of t (20 years from the present) to find the estimated population:

Population ($20$ years from now) = $50,000$ x (1 - 0.10^20) = $50,000(0.9)^{\frac{20}{20}} = $50,000(0.9) = $45,000$

I double-checked my calculations to ensure accuracy and chose the answer that matches my calculated result, which is (D) $50,000(0.9)^{\frac{t}{20}}$.

Key Takeaways:

* The population growth model can be represented by different formulas, such as linear decay functions or exponential functions, depending on the specific pattern of growth.
* When dealing with population growth models, it is essential to identify the pattern in the estimate of the population of the city $t$ years from now and choose the correct formula to represent the population growth model.
* Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps and think through each subproblem step-by-step.
* Double-check your calculations and final answer to ensure accuracy.
