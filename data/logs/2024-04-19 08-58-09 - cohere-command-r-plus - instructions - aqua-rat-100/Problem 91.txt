# Model: cohere-command-r-plus | Agent: instructions | Exam: aqua-rat-100 | Problem 91 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:
Topic: Geography
Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: A starts travel towards south 3km, then travel 5 km towards east, and again travels 3 km to north, and finally travels 2km towards west. In the end how far from is A from home?
Choices:
  A: 3km
  B: 2km
  C: 4km
  D: 5km
  E: 6km
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Understand the problem: [REDACTED] travels in different directions and wants to know the final distance from home.
2. Identify the net displacement in each direction: south-north cancels out, leaving 3 km east and 2 km north.
3. Recognize that the east-west and south-north displacements are independent and not perpendicular.
4. Calculate the distance for each direction separately: 3 km east and 2 km north from the starting point.
5. Choose the answer that matches the calculated distance from home.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The net displacement in the east-west direction is 3 km, and in the north-south direction is 2 km (final north displacement is subtracted from the initial south displacement).

So, the total distance from home is the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle with sides of 3 km and 2 km, which is calculated as $\sqrt{3^2 + 2^2} = \sqrt{13}$ km.

The closest value in the options is 5 km.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: A
