Question: A company produces 420 units of a particular computer component every month, at a production cost to the company of $110 per component, and sells all of the components by the end of each month. What is the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee that the yearly profit (revenue from sales minus production costs) will be at least $626,400 ?
Choices:
  A: 226
  B: 230

Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Identify the given information: monthly production, monthly production cost, and the required yearly profit. 
2. Calculate the total number of components produced in a year. 
3. Determine the total sales revenue required to achieve the desired profit. 
4. Calculate the minimum selling price per component by dividing the total sales revenue by the number of components produced monthly. 
5. Ensure that you are dividing by the correct number (in this case, the monthly production, not the yearly production). 
6. Choose the answer option that matches your calculated result.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Given:
- Monthly production = 420 units
- Monthly production cost = $110 per unit
- Required yearly profit = $626,400

Calculations:
1. First, we find the total number of components produced in a year: 
420 units/month * 12 months/year = 5,040 units/year

2. Now, we can determine the total sales revenue required for the desired profit: 
Required profit = Sales revenue - Production costs
626,400 = Sales revenue - (110 * 5040)
Sales revenue = $1,136,400

3. Finally, we calculate the minimum selling price per component: 
Selling price = Total sales revenue / Total units produced
= $1,136,400 / 5,040
= $225.48

Rounding up to the nearest dollar, the minimum selling price per component is $226.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
