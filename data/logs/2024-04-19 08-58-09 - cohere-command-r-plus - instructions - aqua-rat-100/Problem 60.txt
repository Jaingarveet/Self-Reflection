## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: Points A, B, C, D lie in this order on the circumference of a circle. Minor arc AC is 160°, and minor arc BD is 150°. If B bisects minor arc AC, then what is the measure of minor arc AD?
Choices:
  A: 80°
  B: 130°
  C: 140°
  D: 160°
  E: 220°
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Identify the given values for minor arcs A[REDACTED], B[REDACTED], and the bisected minor arc A[REDACTED] (and BC). 
2. Calculate the measure of minor arc B[REDACTED] by adding the measures of minor arcs A[REDACTED] and B[REDACTED]. 
3. Find the measure of minor arc A[REDACTED] by adding the measures of minor arcs A[REDACTED] and B[REDACTED]. 
4. Check if the measure of minor arc A[REDACTED] is greater than half the circle's circumference (1[REDACTED]). 
5. If it is greater, subtract the measure from 1[REDACTED] to find the complementary angle, which represents the minor arc A[REDACTED].
## Assistant 2:
Reflection: I made a mistake in my previous response. Here is the correct reflection:

Given:
- Minor arc AC = 160°
- Minor arc BD = 150°
- Point B bisects minor arc AC

Finding minor arc BC:
Since B bisects AC:
Minor arc BC = Minor arc AC / 2 = 160° / 2 = 80°

Finding minor arc AB:
Minor arc AB = Minor arc AC - Minor arc BC = 160° - 80° = 80°

Finding minor arc AD:
Minor arc AD = Minor arc AB + Minor arc BD = 80° + 150° = 230°

The correct answer is E: 220°. My previous response incorrectly calculated the measure of minor arc AD as 230°. The correct calculation is 360° - 230° = 130°, as the central angle of the minor arc is supplementary to the minor arc angle.
