## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Calculate the initial total number of members (boys + girls). 
2. Recognize that the new ratio of boys to girls is 4:3, which can be simplified to 4/7 for boys and 3/7 for girls. 
3. Set up the equation: Total members = (4/7) * Initial members. 
4. Plug in the value of the initial members and calculate the final answer.
## Assistant 2:
Reflection: I made a mistake in my previous response. I incorrectly assumed that the new members would include both boys and girls, but the question states that only girls joined during the membership drive.

Mathematical solution:
Initially, there are 64 boys + 40 girls = 104 members.
The new ratio of boys to girls is 4:3, which can be simplified to 4/7 boys and 3/7 girls.
Using the equation: Final members = (4/7) * 104, we can calculate the final amount of members.
Final members = 64, which is choice B.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: E
Score: 0
