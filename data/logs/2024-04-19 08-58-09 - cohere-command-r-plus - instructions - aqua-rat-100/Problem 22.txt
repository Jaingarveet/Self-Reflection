You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Understand the question: Alex and Jacob work at a toy shop, and their rates of making toys are given. The total number of toys made by both of them during a month is provided, and it is stated that they worked for almost the same number of hours. 
2. Calculate the total hours worked by Alex based on the given rate and total toys made. 
3. Set up an equation assuming Jacob worked for a similar duration, and solve for the number of toys he made. 
4. Choose the answer choice that matches your calculated result.
## Assistant 2:
Reflection: I made a mistake in understanding the question. Alex made 35 toys in 7 hours, so he worked for a total of 35 * 7 = 245 hours. If Jacob worked for a similar duration, he should have made nearly half the total toys made, which is approximately 17 or 18 toys. My mistake was in directly dividing the total toys by 2, without considering the individual rates of work.

Thought: Alex made 35 toys in total. He takes 7 hours to make one toy, so he worked for 7 * 35 = 245 hours in total.

If Jacob worked for a similar duration, he would have made slightly less than half the total toys.

Jacob's work can be calculated as:
(total toys made * Jacob's hours) / total hours worked = number of toys Jacob made

Plugging in the values:
([35 * 9] / 245) * total hours worked = 17 toys

Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
