## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Topic: Math
Question: Silu and Meenu were walking on the road.
Silu said, "I weigh 51 Kgs. How much do you weigh?"
Meenu replied that she wouldn't reveal her weight directly as she is overweight.
But she said, "I weigh 29 Kgs plus half of my weight. "How much does Meenu weigh?
Choices:
  A: 12
  B: 28
  C: 27

  E: 91
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and identify the given information.
2. Understand the relationship between Silu's and Meenu's weights.
3. Represent Meenu's weight as an algebraic equation.
4. Solve the equation step-by-step for 'x'.
5. Interpret the value of 'x' as Meenu's weight.
6. Double-check your solution by substituting the value back into the original equation.
## Assistant 2:
Reflection: I made a mistake in my previous attempt. I incorrectly assumed that Meenu's statement meant that her weight was 29 kg more than half of her weight. However, her statement actually meant that her weight included 29 kg and half of her weight. This crucial distinction changes the equation I need to solve.

Correct Solution:
Meenu's statement can be represented by the equation:
x = 29 + x/2

Combining the fractions:
2x = 58

Dividing by 2:
x = 29 kg

So, Meenu weighs 29 kg.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
