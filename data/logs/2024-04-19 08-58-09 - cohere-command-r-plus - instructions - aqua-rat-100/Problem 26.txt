## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: A wire in the shape of rectangle of length 27 cm and breadth 17 cm is rebent to form a square. What will be the measure of each side?
Choices:
  A: 9
  B: 11
  C: 22
  D: 25
  E: 31
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Calculate the area of the rectangle (length x breadth). 
2. Recognize that the area of the rectangle and the square are equal since it is the same wire rebent. 
3. Set up the equation: area of the square = side x side. 
4. Divide the total area by the length of one side to find the side length. 
5. Check your calculations and ensure you have not taken the square root. 
6. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
## Assistant 2:
Reflection: I made a mistake in my previous attempt. Let's break down the solution step-by-step:
1. The area of the rectangle = length x breadth = 27 cm x 17 cm = 459 square cm.
2. The area of the rectangle and the square are equal since it is the same wire rebent. 
3. Area of the square = side x side, so 
459 = side x side
4. Divide by 'side' on both sides to find the length of one side:
side = sqrt(459) = 21.4 cm (rounded to two decimal places)

I made an error in my previous attempt by not taking the square root, which resulted in an incorrect side length.

Now, let's answer the question again:
