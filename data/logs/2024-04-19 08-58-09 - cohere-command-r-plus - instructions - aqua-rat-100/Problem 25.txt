Question: A car is being driven, in a straight line and at a uniform speed, towards the base of a vertical tower. The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower?
Choices:
  A: 5(√3 + 1)
  B: 6(√3 + √2)
  C: 7(√3 – 1)
  D: 8(√3 – 2)
  E: None of these

Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Denote the height of the tower as $h$ and the distance from the car to the base as $x$.
2. Set up trigonometric equations using the angles and ratios: $\tan(45^{\circ}) = \frac{h}{x}$ and $\tan(60^{\circ}) = \frac{h}{x - 10}$.
3. Equate these equations and solve for $x$ to find the distance traveled.
4. Calculate the remaining distance by subtracting the time passed (10 minutes) from the total distance ($x$).
5. Simplify the expression and choose the answer option that matches your result.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Let $h$ be the height of the tower and $x$ be the distance from the car to the base of the tower.

We can set up two trigonometric equations using the angles and ratios:
$\tan(45^\circ) = \frac{h}{x}$
$\tan(60^\circ) = \frac{h}{x - 10}$

Equating these equations, we get:
$\tan(45^\circ) = \frac{h}{x} = \frac{h}{x-10}\tan(60^\circ)$

Simplifying this equation, we find the value of $x$ as follows:
$x = \frac{h\tan(60^\circ)}{\tan(45^\circ) - \tan(60^\circ)} = \frac{h(\sqrt{3})}{1 - \sqrt{3}} = h(1 + \sqrt{3})$

Now, we need to find the remaining distance. Subtracting the time passed (10 minutes) from the total distance ($x$), we get:
Remaining distance $= x - 10 = h(1 + \sqrt{3}) - 10$

Converting hours to minutes, we can represent the remaining distance as:
$= 60h(1 + \sqrt{3}) - 10$

Dividing by the speed, we can find the time it will take to reach the base:
Time $= \frac{60h(1 + \sqrt{3}) - 10}{v}$

Since the car is traveling at a uniform speed, the height of the tower is irrelevant to the calculation of time. Thus, the height ($h$) and speed ($v$) cancel out, leaving a constant value.

Therefore, the answer is $A: 5(\sqrt{3} + 1)$.
