Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Calculate the total weight of the original 10 vehicles by multiplying the average weight by the number of vehicles.
2. Calculate the new average weight by adding the given increase.
3. Calculate the total weight of the new group by multiplying the new average weight by the new number of vehicles (original + 1).
4. Find the weight of the new truck by subtracting the original total weight from the new total weight.
5. Check your calculations and ensure the answer choice matches your calculated result.
## Assistant 2:
Reflection: I made an error in my previous attempt; I added the increase in weight to the average weight of the original 10 vehicles to find the weight of the new truck, which was incorrect. The correct approach is to calculate the total weight of the original vehicles and then find the new total weight after adding the new truck, using the given increase in average weight. Finally, I should find the difference between these two totals to determine the weight of the new truck.

Thought: 
First, we calculate the total weight of the original 10 vehicles: 
10 vehicles * 12.2 tons/vehicle = 122 tons

Then, we find the new total weight after adding the new truck: 
New average weight = 12.2 tons + 2.6 tons = 14.8 tons
Total weight with 11 vehicles = 14.8 tons/vehicle * 11 vehicles = 162.8 tons

Finally, we find the weight of the new truck by subtracting the original total weight from the new total weight: 
162.8 tons - 122 tons = 40.8 tons

So, the weight of the heavy-duty truck is 40.8 tons.
Action: Answer("A")
