# Model: cohere-command-r-plus | Agent: instructions | Exam: aqua-rat-100 | Problem 76 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:

Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")

Choices:
  A: 20 < x < 54
  B: 23 < x < 58
  C: 25 < x < 64
  D: 28 < x < 60
  E: None of these
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Simplify the expression for x correctly, paying attention to the radical part. 
2. Find the range of values for the numerator and denominator separately, using the given range for n. 
3. Calculate the range of values for x by finding the lower and upper bounds through division of the relevant bounds of N and [REDACTED]. 
4. Compare the calculated range of x with the given choices to select the correct answer.
## Assistant 2:
Reflection: I made a mistake in my previous attempt by not rationalizing the denominator correctly. The correct range for the denominator is actually between 12 and 20, which then leads to the correct answer for the range of x.

Thought: 
First, rationalize the denominator of the expression for x:
x = (n^2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16) / (n+ 4√n+ 4) = ((n^2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16)(n - 4√n + 4)) / ((n+ 4√n+ 4)(n - 4√n + 4))
= (n^3 - 4n^2.5 + 4n + 2n^2 + 4n + 16) / (n^2 - 8n + 16)
= (n^3 + 2n^2 + 4n + 16) / (n^2 - 8n + 16)

Now, find the range of values for the numerator and denominator separately:
- Numerator (N): 36^3 + 2(36)^2 + 4(36) + 16 = 46676
- Denominator (D): 72^2 - 8(72) + 16 = 336
- So, 46676/336 < x < 72^3 + 2(72)^2 + 4(72) + 16/ (72^2 - 8(72) + 16) = 54376/336

Calculating the range, we get:
20 < x < 54

So, the correct answer is A.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
