## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: R, S, T, and U are points on a line, and U is the midpoint of line segment ST. If the lengths of line segments RS, RT, and ST are 5, 17, and 22, respectively. What is the length of line segment RU?
Choices:
  A: 6
  B: 7
  C: 8
  D: 9
  E: 10
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Understand the given information: segment lengths RS, RT, and ST, and the fact that U is the midpoint of ST.
2. Identify the goal: find the length of RU.
3. Calculate UT since U is the midpoint of ST (divide ST by 2).
4. Find RU by subtracting UT from RT.
5. Double-check your calculations and the units used.
## Assistant 2:
Reflection: I made a calculation error in my previous attempt. To find the length of RU, I should have subtracted the length of UT from RT, not RS. Correct calculation: RT - UT = 17 - 11 = 6.

Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
