# Model: cohere-command-r-plus | Agent: instructions | Exam: aqua-rat-100 | Problem 93 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Identify the given equation and the values to be calculated.
2. Simplify the equation step-by-step, following the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS).
3. Calculate the value of X accurately, ensuring correct division.
[REDACTED]. Plug the value of X back into the original equation and simplify.
[REDACTED]. Check if the equation holds true when both sides are equal to 6.
6. If the equation holds true, choose the appropriate answer option; otherwise, select "no such value."
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
First, we simplify inside the brackets:
(5 + X * 19 - 15 - 7) / (13 * 13 - 156) = 6
= (5 + 19X - 15 - 7) / (169 - 156) = 6
= (19X - 7) / 13 = 6

Now, we divide by 13:
(19X - 7) / 13 = 6
19X - 7 = 78

Now, we isolate X:
19X = 78 + 7
19X = 85
X = 85 / 19
X = 4.47, which rounds to 4.5

Plugging this value back into the original equation:
(5 + 4.5 * 19 - 15 - 7) / (13 * 13 - 156) = 6
= (5 + 85.5 - 15 - 7) / (169 - 156) = 6
= (85.5 - 22) / 13 = 6
= 63.5 / 13 = 6
= 4.88 = 6

Since 4.88 does not equal 6, the correct answer is "no such value."
Action: Answer("no such value")
## Result:
Agent Answer: N
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
