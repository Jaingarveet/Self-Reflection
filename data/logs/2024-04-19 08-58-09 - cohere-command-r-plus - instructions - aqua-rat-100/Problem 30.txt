2. Interpret the task: Recognize that the question asks for the total time to consume all tablets, not the time interval.
3. Calculate the total time: Convert the time interval to a fraction of an hour and multiply it by the number of tablets.
4. Convert to minutes: Ensure the final answer is in minutes.
5. Choose the answer: Select the choice that matches your calculated result.
## Assistant 2:
Reflection: I made a mistake in interpreting the question. I thought the question was asking about the time interval between tablets, which is 15 minutes, but instead, it asks for the total time to consume all 5 tablets.

Correct interpretation: To find the total time, we need to multiply the time interval by the number of tablets. 

Correct answer calculation: Each tablet is taken after 15 minutes, so the time taken for 5 tablets = 5 x 15 minutes = 75 minutes. 

Therefore, the correct answer is B: 75 minutes.

Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: E
Score: 0
