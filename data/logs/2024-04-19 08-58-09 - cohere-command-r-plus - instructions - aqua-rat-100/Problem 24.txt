## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: An exam is given in a certain class. The average (arithmetic mean) of the highest score and the lowest score is equal to x. If the average score for the entire class is equal to y and there are z students in the class, where z > 5, then in terms of x, y, and z, what is the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers?
Choices:
  A: (zy – 2x)/z
  B: (zy – 2)/z
  C: (zx – y)/(z – 2)
  D: (zy – 2x)/(z -2)
  E: (zy – x)/(z + 2)
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Understand the variables: x = average of highest and lowest scores, y = average of the entire class, z = number of students.
2. Recognize that the sum of the highest and lowest scores is 2x.
3. Calculate the sum of the remaining scores excluding the highest and lowest scorers: zy - 2x.
4. Determine the number of remaining students: z - 2.
5. Find the average score for the remaining students by dividing the sum of their scores by the number of students: ((zy - 2x) / (z - 2)).
6. Ensure your algebraic manipulations are correct and that you are properly applying the order of operations.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The sum of the highest and lowest scores is 2x.
The sum of the remaining z-2 students' scores is zy - 2x.
Dividing this sum by z-2 gives the average score excluding the highest and lowest: (zy - 2x) / (z-2).
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
