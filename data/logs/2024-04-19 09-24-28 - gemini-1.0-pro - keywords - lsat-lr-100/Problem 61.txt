Context: In a recent study, each member of two groups of people, Group A (composed of persons sixty-five to seventy-five years old) and Group B (composed of college students), was required to make a telephone call to a certain number at a specified time. The time when each call was initiated was recorded electronically. Group A proved far better at remembering to make a telephone call precisely at a specified time than did Group B. There were fourteen lapses in Group B but only one lapse in Group A. Clearly, at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages.
Question: Which one of the following, if all of them are true, is LEAST helpful in establishing that the conclusion above is properly drawn?
Choices:
  A: There was the same number of people in each group.
  B: The same group of researchers answered the calls made by the callers in both study groups.
  C: Among the college students there were no persons more than forty years old.
  D: Both groups had unrestricted access to telephones for making the required calls.
  E: The members of the two groups received their instructions approximately the same amount of time before they were to make their telephone calls.

## Assistant 2:
Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly because I did not consider the possibility that the two groups might have had different levels of access to telephones. This is an important factor to consider, as it could have affected the results of the study.
In order to answer this question correctly, I need to consider all of the factors that could have affected the results of the study. I also need to make sure that I am not making any assumptions that are not supported by the evidence.
Based on my reflection, I believe that the answer to this question is **D: Both groups had unrestricted access to telephones for making the required calls.**
This is the least helpful statement in establishing that the conclusion is properly drawn because it does not provide any information about the level of access to telephones that the two groups had. If one group had more difficulty accessing telephones than the other group, this could have affected the results of the study.
Action: Answer("D")
