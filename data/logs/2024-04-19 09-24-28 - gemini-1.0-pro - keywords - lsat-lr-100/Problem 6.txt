Context: Some gardening books published by Garden Path Press recommend tilling the soil and adding compost before starting a new garden on a site, but they do not explain the difference between hot and cold composting.

## Assistant 2:
Self-reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly because I misinterpreted the argument. I focused on the conclusion that some books published by Garden Path are flawed and overlooked the assumption that any gardening book that recommends adding compost is flawed if it does not explain at least the basics of composting.
To avoid making the same mistake again, I will carefully analyze the argument and identify the key assumptions. I will also consider the context and the author's purpose to understand the argument's intended meaning.
Thought:
The argument assumes that any gardening book that recommends adding compost is flawed if it does not explain at least the basics of composting. This assumption is not explicitly stated but is necessary for the argument to be valid.
Action: Answer("E")
