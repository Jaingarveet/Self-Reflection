Context: Professor: It has been argued that freedom of thought is a precondition for intellectual progress, because freedom of thought allows thinkers to pursue their ideas, regardless of whom these ideas offend, in whatever direction they lead. However, it is clear that one must mine the full implications of interrelated ideas to make intellectual progress, and for this, thinkers need intellectual discipline. Therefore, this argument for freedom of thought fails.
Question: The conclusion drawn by the professor follows logically if which one of the following is assumed?
Choices:
  A: Thinkers who limit their line of thought to a particular orthodoxy are hindered in their intellectual progress.
  B: Thinkers can mine the full implications of interrelated ideas only in the context of a society that values intellectual progress.
  C: In societies that protect freedom of thought, thinkers invariably lack intellectual discipline.
  D: Freedom of thought engenders creativity, which aids the discovery of truth.
  E: Without intellectual discipline, thinkers can have no freedom of thought.

## Self-Reflection
**Previous Incorrect Answer:** C
**Reasoning:** I mistakenly focused on the professor's statement about intellectual discipline and assumed that the argument failed because freedom of thought leads to a lack of discipline.
**Correct Answer:** A
**Reasoning:** The professor's argument hinges on the idea that freedom of thought allows thinkers to explore diverse ideas, which is essential for intellectual progress. If thinkers are limited to a specific orthodoxy, their intellectual progress is hindered.
**Key Insights:**
* Pay close attention to the professor's argument and identify the key assumptions underlying it.
* Don't get sidetracked by specific statements about intellectual discipline or other factors that may not be directly relevant to the conclusion.
* Focus on the relationship between freedom of thought and intellectual progress, and choose the answer that best supports the professor's claim.
**Action:** Answer("A")
