Topic: Law
Context: Medical researcher: Scientists compared a large group of joggers who habitually stretch before jogging to an equal number of joggers who do not stretch before jogging. Both groups of joggers incurred roughly the same number of injuries. This indicates that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would most weaken the medical researcher's argument?
Choices:
  A: For both groups of joggers compared by the scientists, the rate of jogging injuries during the study was lower than the overall rate of jogging injuries.
  B: Among the joggers in the groups compared by the scientists, many of those previously injured while jogging experienced difficulty in their efforts to perform stretches.
  C: Most jogging injuries result from falls, collisions, and other mishaps on which the flexibility resulting from stretching would have little if any effect.
  D: The more prone a jogger is to jogging injuries, the more likely he or she is to develop the habit of performing stretches before jogging.
  E: Studies have found that, for certain forms of exercise, stretching beforehand can reduce the severity of injuries resulting from that exercise.

## Assistant 2:
Error Analysis:
I previously answered this question incorrectly because I did not consider the fact that the study compared two groups of joggers who were already in the habit of stretching or not stretching. This means that the study could not determine whether stretching before jogging actually prevents injuries, as it is possible that the two groups of joggers were already at different risks of injury due to their pre-existing habits.
Improved Response:
The medical researcher's argument would be most weakened if it were true that the two groups of joggers compared by the scientists were already at different risks of injury due to their pre-existing habits. This is because the study could not then determine whether stretching before jogging actually prevents injuries.
Action: Answer("B")
