# Model: mistral-large | Agent: composite | Exam: logiqa-en-100 | Problem 12 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Logic.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:
Topic: Geography
Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Logic
Context: Most people think that the thinking of scientists is based on strict logical reasoning, not on image thinking means such as analogy, intuition, and epiphany.However, research shows that Nobel Prize winners make more use of these image thinking methods than general scientists.Therefore, image thinking methods help to achieve major scientific breakthroughs.
Question: The above conclusion is based on which of the following assumptions?
Choices:
  A: Organized, step-by-step reasoning is essential for general scientific research.
  B: Nobel Prize winners have the ability to think creatively through analogy, intuition, and insight.
  C: Nobel winners have made major scientific breakthroughs.
  D: Nobel Prize winners are smarter and harder than ordinary scientists.
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I focused on the assumption that image thinking methods lead to major scientific breakthroughs, rather than the assumption that Nobel Prize winners have made major scientific breakthroughs.

Error Keywords:
 - Assumption error
 - Focus error
 - Misinterpretation error

Solution:
The conclusion assumes that Nobel Prize winners have made major scientific breakthroughs.
The assumption is based on the observation that Nobel Prize winners make more use of image thinking methods than general scientists.
The assumption is necessary to support the conclusion that image thinking methods help to achieve major scientific breakthroughs.

Instructions:
1. Identify the conclusion of the argument.
2. Identify the assumption that supports the conclusion.
3. Evaluate each answer choice to determine which one best represents the assumption.
4. Choose the answer that matches the assumption.

Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always identify the conclusion and assumption of the argument.
 - Always evaluate each answer choice to determine which one best represents the assumption.
 - Never assume that the correct answer is the one that seems most obvious.
 - Always double-check your answer to ensure accuracy.
 - Remember that assumptions are often unstated and must be inferred from the argument.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The conclusion of the argument is that image thinking methods help to achieve major scientific breakthroughs.
The assumption that supports the conclusion is that Nobel Prize winners have made major scientific breakthroughs.

Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
