Error Keywords:
 - Logic error
 - Inference error
 - Assumption error

Solution:
The inference is that Zhang Shan's bonus is higher than Miao Xiaoqin's.
This inference is based on the fact that Zhang Shan's bonus is higher than Li Si's and Wang Wu's bonus is higher than Miao Xiaoqin's.
The only assumption that contradicts this inference is that [REDACTED]
However, the correct answer is that Wang Wu's bonus is higher than Li Si's, which does not contradict the inference.

Instructions:
1. Identify the inference being made in the question.
2. Identify the assumptions that are given in the question.
3. Determine which assumption contradicts the inference.
4. Read each answer choice carefully and evaluate whether it contradicts the inference.
5. Choose the answer that does not contradict the inference.

Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always identify the inference being made in the question.
