## System:
You are an expert in Logic.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Logic
Context: A laboratory has three types of robots, A.B, and C.Type A can recognize colors, type B can recognize shapes, and type C can neither recognize colors nor shapes.The laboratory experimented with robots 1 and 2 with red balls, blue balls, red squares, and blue squares, and ordered them to pick up the red balls, but number 1 picked up the red squares, and number 2 picked up the blue balls.
Question: Based on the above experiment, which of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Both No.1 and No.2 are type C.
  B: Only one of No.1 and No.2 is C type.
  C: No.1 is type A and No.2 is type B.
  D: No.1 is not Type B and No.2 is not Type A.
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I made an incorrect assumption about the robots' abilities based on their mistakes.
The gap in my knowledge was not understanding that the robots could also be unable to recognize both colors and shapes.
I assumed that since robot No.1 picked up red squares instead of red balls, it must be able to recognize colors, but it could also be unable to recognize shapes. Similarly, I assumed that since robot No.2 picked up blue balls instead of red balls, it must be able to recognize shapes, but it could also be unable to recognize colors.

Error Keywords:
- Incorrect assumption
- Misinterpretation of information
- Lack of consideration of all possibilities

Solution:
The laboratory has three types of robots, [REDACTED], [REDACTED], and [REDACTED].
Type [REDACTED] can recognize colors, type [REDACTED] can recognize shapes, and type [REDACTED] can neither recognize colors nor shapes.
Robot No.1 picked up red squares instead of red balls, which means it either cannot recognize shapes or cannot recognize colors. Therefore, it cannot be type [REDACTED], but it could be type [REDACTED] or type [REDACTED].
Robot No.2 picked up blue balls instead of red balls, which means it either cannot recognize colors or cannot recognize shapes. Therefore, it cannot be type [REDACTED], but it could be type [REDACTED] or type [REDACTED].
The only option that must be true based on the information given is that robot No.1 is not type [REDACTED] and robot No.2 is not type [REDACTED].

Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and understand the problem.
2. Identify the three types of robots and their abilities.
3. Analyze the results of the experiment and what they imply about each robot's abilities.
4. Consider all possibilities and do not make assumptions about the robots' abilities based on their mistakes.
5. Eliminate answer choices that cannot be true based on the information given.
6. Choose the answer that must be true based on the information given.

Advice:
- Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
- Always consider all possibilities and do not make assumptions.
- Always eliminate answer choices that cannot be true based on the information given.
- Always choose the answer that must be true based on the information given.
- Always double-check your reasoning and final answer.

The only option that must be true based on the information given is that robot No.1 is not type B and robot No.2 is not type A.
