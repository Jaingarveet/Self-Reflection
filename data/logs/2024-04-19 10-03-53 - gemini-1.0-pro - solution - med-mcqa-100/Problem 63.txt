## Assistant 2:
I apologize for the previous incorrect answer. I have reviewed the question and my thought process and have identified the error. I incorrectly assumed that the question was asking about the inheritance pattern of Hypophosphatemic Vitamin D Resistant Rickets, when in fact it was asking about the type of rickets. 
Hypophosphatemic Vitamin D Resistant Rickets is an X-linked dominant disorder, meaning that it is caused by a mutation in a gene located on the X chromosome. Females have two X chromosomes, while males have one X chromosome and one Y chromosome. If a female inherits the mutated gene on one of her X chromosomes, she will be a carrier of the disorder but will not typically develop symptoms. However, if a male inherits the mutated gene on his X chromosome, he will develop the disorder.
Therefore, the correct answer to the question is A: AR.
I have learned from this mistake and will be more careful in the future to ensure that I fully understand the question before attempting to answer it.
## Result:
