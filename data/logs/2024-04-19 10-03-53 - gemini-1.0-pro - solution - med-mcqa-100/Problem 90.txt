Solution:
## Assistant 2:
I understand. I will use my self-reflection to answer this question correctly.
**Self-reflection:**
* I previously answered this question incorrectly because I did not consider all of the possible causes of an unstable lie.
* I have learned that an unstable lie can be caused by a variety of factors, including oligohydramnios, placenta previa, pelvic tumors, and uterine anomalies.
* I will use this knowledge to answer the question correctly this time.
**Answer:**
The correct answer is **D: Uterine anomalies**.
**Explanation:**
Uterine anomalies are a common cause of an unstable lie. This is because they can change the shape of the uterus, making it difficult for the baby to find a stable position. Other possible causes of an unstable lie include oligohydramnios, placenta previa, and pelvic tumors. However, these are less common than uterine anomalies.
**Action:** Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
