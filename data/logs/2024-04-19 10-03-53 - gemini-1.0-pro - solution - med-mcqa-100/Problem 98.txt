**Thought:**
* Pyloric stenosis is a condition in which the pylorus, the muscular valve between the stomach and the duodenum, becomes narrowed.
* This narrowing can cause a blockage, preventing food from passing from the stomach to the small intestine.
* The classic X-ray finding in pyloric stenosis is the **double bubble sign**. This sign appears as two air-filled bubbles on the X-ray, one in the stomach and one in the dilated duodenum.
**Action:** Answer("B")
