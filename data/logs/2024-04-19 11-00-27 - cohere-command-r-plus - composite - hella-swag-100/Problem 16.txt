## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The text advises talking about concerns with a trusted friend, someone who will not share those concerns with the frenemy. This is to avoid creating further issues and to get an outside perspective. The most important thing is to choose a confidant wisely and be cautious about the potential risks of sharing sensitive information.

Choice A suggests not confiding in someone just like the frenemy, which is reasonable but doesn't address the risk of information reaching the frenemy.
Choice B suggests writing down information, which is unrelated to the main advice of the text.
Choice C recommends honesty with the frenemy, which is not advised in the original text and could be risky.

Choice D completes the text with a warning about choosing a confidant carefully to avoid information reaching the frenemy. This aligns with the cautious and thoughtful tone of the original text and addresses the potential risks involved.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
