Question: A square field measures 10 meters by 10 meters. Ten students each mark off a randomly selected region of the field; each region is square and has side lengths of 1 meter, and no two regions overlap. The students count the earthworms contained in the soil to a depth of 5 centimeters beneath the ground's surface in each region. The results are shown in the table below.\begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}\hlineRegion & $\begin{array}{c}\text { Number of } \\ \text { earthworms }\end{array}$ & Region & $\begin{array}{c}\text { Number of } \\ \text { earthworms }\end{array}$ \\\hlineA & 107 & $\mathrm{~F}$ & 141 \\\hlineB & 147 & $\mathrm{G}$ & 150 \\\hlineC & 146 & $\mathrm{H}$ & 154 \\\hlineD & 135 & $\mathrm{I}$ & 176 \\\hlineE & 149 & $\mathrm{~J}$ & 166 \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}Which of the following is a reasonable approximation of the number of earthworms to a depth of 5 centimeters beneath the ground's surface in the entire field?
Choices:
  A: $\quad 150$
  B: $\quad 1,500$
  C: 15,000
  D: 150,000

 - Remember that the average of a set of numbers is the sum of the numbers divided by the number of numbers in the set.
 - Remember to round your answer to the nearest reasonable approximation.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
To find the total number of earthworms in the entire field, we need to add up the number of earthworms in each region. 
The sum of the number of earthworms in each region is $107+147+146+135+149+141+150+154+176+166=1471$.
Since there are 100 regions in the entire field, we can estimate the total number of earthworms by multiplying the average number of earthworms per region by the total number of regions. 
The average number of earthworms per region is $\frac{1471}{10}=147.1$.
Rounding this to the nearest reasonable approximation gives us $\boxed{\textbf{(A) }150}$.
Action: Answer("A")
