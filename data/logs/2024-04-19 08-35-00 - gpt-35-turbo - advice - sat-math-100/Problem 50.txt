## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: \begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}\cline { 2 - 3 }\multicolumn{1}{c|}{} & \multicolumn{2}{c|}{Handedness} \\\hlineGender & Left & Right \\\hline\hlineFemale &  &  \\\hlineMale &  &  \\\hline\hlineTotal & 18 & 122 \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}The incomplete table above summarizes the number of left-handed students and right-handed students by gender for the eighth-grade students atKeisel Middle School. There are 5 times as many right-handed female students as there are left-handed female students, and there are 9 times as many right-handed male students as there are left-handed male students. If there is a total of 18 left-handed students and 122 right-handed students in the school, which of the following is closest to the probability that a right-handed student selected at random is female? (Note: Assume that none of the eighth-grade students are both right-handed and left-handed.)
Choices:
  A: 0.410
  B: 0.357
  C: 0.333
  D: 0.250

## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let's start by finding the number of left-handed female students and left-handed male students.
Let Lf be the number of left-handed female students, and Lm be the number of left-handed male students.
Then, we have:
Lf + Lm = 18  (total number of left-handed students)
Next, we can use the given information to write two equations relating the number of right-handed female students (Rf) and right-handed male students (Rm) to Lf and Lm:
Rf = 5Lf  (there are 5 times as many right-handed female students as there are left-handed female students)
Rm = 9Lm  (there are 9 times as many right-handed male students as there are left-handed male students)
We can also write two equations relating the total number of female students (F) and male students (M) to Rf and Rm:
F + Rf = 5(Rm + M)  (there are 5 times as many right-handed female students as there are left-handed female students)
M + Rm = 9(Lm + F)  (there are 9 times as many right-handed male students as there are left-handed male students)
Finally, we can use the fact that there are 122 right-handed students in the school to write an equation relating M and Rm:
M + Rm = 122  (total number of right-handed students)
We have 5 equations and 5 unknowns (Lf, Lm, F, M, Rm). We can solve for these unknowns using algebraic manipulation.
After solving for the unknowns, we can find the probability that a right-handed student selected at random is female by computing F/(F+M).
