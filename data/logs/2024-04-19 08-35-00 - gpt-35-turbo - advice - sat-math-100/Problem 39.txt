## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Advice:
 - Always double-check your simplification and algebraic manipulation.
 - Always check if the two equations represent the same line or two different lines.
 - Always check if the system has one solution, infinitely many solutions, or no solution.
 - Always check if the two equations represent parallel lines to determine if the system has no solution.
 - Remember that the coefficients of $x$ and $y$ in the two equations must be proportional for the two lines to be parallel.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
To determine if the system has no solution, we need to check if the two equations represent parallel lines.
We can do this by checking if the coefficients of $x$ and $y$ in the two equations are proportional.
If the coefficients are proportional, then the two lines are parallel and the system has no solution.
If the coefficients are not proportional, then the two lines intersect at a point and the system has one solution.
Action: 
Rewrite the given system of equations in slope-intercept form: 
$$\begin{aligned}& y=3x+6 \\& y=-\frac{a}{2}x+2\end{aligned}$$
The coefficient of $x$ in the first equation is 3, and the coefficient of $x$ in the second equation is $-\frac{a}{2}$.
The two coefficients are proportional if $3=-\frac{a}{2}\cdot k$ for some constant $k$.
Solving for $a$, we get $a=-6k$.
Therefore, the system has no solution if $a$ is equal to $-6k$ for some nonzero constant $k$.
The only answer choice that satisfies this condition is $\boxed{\textbf{(D) }6}$.
