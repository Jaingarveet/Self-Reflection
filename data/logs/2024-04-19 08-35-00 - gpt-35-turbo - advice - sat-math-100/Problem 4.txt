## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:
Topic: Geography
Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: In the $x y$-plane, the line determined by the points $(2, k)$ and $(k, 32)$ passes through the origin. Which of the following could be the value of $k$ ?
Choices:
  A: 0
  B: 4
  C: 8
  D: 16
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that the equation of a line passing through two points can be found using point-slope form.
 - Remember that the slope of a line passing through two points can be found using the slope formula.
 - Remember that the slope of a line passing through the origin is simply the $y$-coordinate divided by the $x$-coordinate.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The line passes through the origin, so the $y$-intercept is 0.
The equation of the line passing through $(2,k)$ and $(k,32)$ is $y-k=\frac{32-k}{k-2}(x-2)$.
Substituting $x=0$ and $y=0$, we get $k=\frac{64}{k-2}$.
Simplifying, we get $k^2-2k-64=0$.
Factoring, we get $(k-8)(k+8)=0$.
Therefore, $k=8$ or $k=-8$.
Action: Answer("C")
