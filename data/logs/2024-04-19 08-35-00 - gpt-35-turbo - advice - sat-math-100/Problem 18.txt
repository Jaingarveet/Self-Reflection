## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:

## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: Which of the following is equivalent to $9^{\frac{3}{4}}$ ?
Choices:
  A: $\sqrt[3]{9}$
  B: $\sqrt[4]{9}$
  C: $\sqrt{3}$
  D: $3 \sqrt{3}$

Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Advice:
 - Always simplify expressions step-by-step.
 - Always apply the rules of exponents carefully.
 - Always double-check your simplification and calculations.
 - Remember that $(a^b)^c$ is equal to $a^{bc}$.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
$9^{\frac{3}{4}}$ can be written as $(3^2)^{\frac{3}{4}}$.
Using the rule $(a^b)^c$ is equal to $a^{bc}$, we can simplify $(3^2)^{\frac{3}{4}}$ to $3^{2 \cdot \frac{3}{4}}$.
$2 \cdot \frac{3}{4} = \frac{6}{4} = \frac{3}{2}$.
Therefore, $9^{\frac{3}{4}}$ is equivalent to $3^{\frac{3}{2}}$.
Using the rule $\sqrt{a^b} = a^{\frac{b}{2}}$, we can simplify $3^{\frac{3}{2}}$ to $3 \sqrt{3}$.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
