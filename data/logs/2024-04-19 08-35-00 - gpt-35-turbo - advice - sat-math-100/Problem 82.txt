# Model: gpt-35-turbo | Agent: advice | Exam: sat-math-100 | Problem 82 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")

Question: $$y=a(x-2)(x+4)$$In the quadratic equation above, $a$ is a nonzero constant. The graph of the equation in the $x y$-plane is a parabola with vertex $(c, d)$. Which of the following is equal to $d$ ?
Choices:
  A: $-9 a$
  B: $-8 a$
  C: $-5 a$
  D: $-2 a$
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always use the correct formulae and equations for the problem.
 - Always double-check your algebraic manipulations and substitutions.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that the vertex of a parabola is given by $(h,k)$ in the vertex form $y=a(x-h)^2+k$.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The given quadratic equation is in the form of vertex form $y=a(x-h)^2+k$ where $h= -\frac{b}{2a}$ and $k$ is the $y$-coordinate of the vertex.
Here, $h=\frac{-2+4}{2} = 1$.
To find $k$, substitute $x=1$ in the given equation and simplify.
$$y=a(1-2)(1+4)$$
$$y=-9a$$
Therefore, the $y$-coordinate of the vertex is $d=-9a$.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
