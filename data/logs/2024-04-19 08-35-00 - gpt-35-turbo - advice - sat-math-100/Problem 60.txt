## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let's assign a variable to the unknown quantity, the number of students in the class.
Let's call it "s".
From the problem, we know that if each student gets 3 milliliters of solution, there will be 5 milliliters left over.
So, we can set up the equation: n = 3s + 5.
We also know that if each student gets 4 milliliters of solution, Mr. Kohl will need an additional 21 milliliters.
So, we can set up another equation: n = 4s - 21.
Now we have two equations with two variables. We can solve for "s".
n = 3s + 5
n = 4s - 21
3s + 5 = 4s - 21
s = 26
Action: Answer("D")
