## Get Reflection:
  Action: Answer("A")

Explanation:
The passage explains that the chemical ingredients in Thermacare wraps need to be exposed to air to activate, and that attaching the wrap too early will limit its exposure to air, causing it to heat more slowly. Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is choice A, which states that attaching the wrap too early will limit its exposure to air, causing it to heat more slowly.

The other choices do not relate to the topic of activating Thermacare heat wraps. Choice B discusses precautions for using a Thermacare wrap on your entire body when it is hot outside, but does not relate to activating the wrap. Choice C suggests placing one layer of foil on top of the wrapped wrap, but this is not related to activating the wrap. Choice D suggests breaking the wrap open to better see or setting a timer, but this is not necessary for activating the wrap.

Therefore, the correct answer is A.
