## Get Reflection:
 Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question as A: Unequal and known chances. However, the correct answer is B: Equal and known chances.

Randomization implies that the groups being compared have equal and known chances of being assigned to each group. This is important in medical research to minimize bias and ensure that the results are generalizable to the population.

Error Keywords:

* Randomization
* Bias
* Generalizability

Solution:
Randomization is a fundamental principle in medical research, used to minimize bias and ensure that the results are generalizable to the population.

To solve the problem, I should have:

1. Understood the concept of randomization and its importance in medical research.
2. Recognized that the correct answer is B: Equal and known chances.
3. Double-checked my calculations to ensure accuracy.

Instructions:

1. Understand the concept of randomization and its importance in medical research.
2. Identify the correct answer based on the given choices.
3. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.

Advice:

* Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
* Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
* Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
* Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
* Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
* Remember that randomization is a fundamental principle in medical research, used to minimize bias and ensure that the results are generalizable to the population.
