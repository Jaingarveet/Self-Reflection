## Get Reflection:
 Explanation:
I incorrectly selected option C, CT, as the investigation of choice for pyloric stenosis.

The correct answer is option A, USG (Ultrasound). USG is the investigation of choice for pyloric stenosis in children under 1 year of age, as it is non-invasive and can accurately diagnose the condition. UGI series (option B) and MRI (option D) are not suitable for diagnosing pyloric stenosis in young children.

Error Keywords:

* Misunderstanding the age range for USG as the investigation of choice
* Overlooking the non-invasive nature of USG
* Confusing UGI series and MRI with USG

Solution:
Pyloric stenosis is a condition where the pylorus, the opening between the stomach and small intestine, becomes narrowed or blocked. The investigation of choice for pyloric stenosis depends on the age of the patient and the severity of the symptoms.

1. Identify the age range of the patient.
2. Assess the severity of the symptoms.
3. Choose the appropriate investigation: USG for children under 1 year of age, UGI series for older children and adults, and MRI for rare cases where other investigations are inconclusive.

Instructions:

1. Always consider the age range and severity of symptoms when selecting an investigation.
2. Understand the advantages and limitations of each investigation.
3. Double-check your answer to ensure accuracy.

Advice:

* Always prioritize the patient's age and symptoms when selecting an investigation.
* Familiarize yourself with the advantages and limitations of each investigation.
* Take your time and double-check your answer to ensure accuracy.
* Remember that USG is the investigation of choice for young children under 1 year of age.
