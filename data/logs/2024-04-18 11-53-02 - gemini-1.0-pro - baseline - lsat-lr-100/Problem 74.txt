Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.

Context: Traditional "talk" therapy, in which a patient with a psychological disorder discusses it with a trained therapist, produces chemical changes in the brain. These changes seem to correspond to improvements in certain aspects of the patient's behavior. Thus, physicians will eventually be able to treat such patients as effectively through pharmacological intervention in the brain's neurochemistry as through the lengthy intermediary of traditional "talk" methods.
Question: Which one of the following is an assumption on which the argumoot depends?
Choices:
  A: All neurochemical changes produce corresponding psychological changes.
  B: improvements in a patient's behavior produced by "talk" therapy occur only through chemical changes in the brain's neurochemistry.
  C: Talk therapy has not been effective at bringing about psychological change.
  D: If chemical changes in the brain's neurochemistry correspond to improvemeots in patient behavior, then psychology and neuroscience will eventually be indistinguishable.
  E: Direct intervention in the brain's neurochemistry is likely to become a less expensive way of treating psychological disorders than is "talk" therapy.
## Assistant 2:
## Thought Process:
The argument claims that "talk" therapy produces chemical changes in the brain, which correspond to improvements in behavior. It then concludes that pharmacological intervention will eventually be as effective as "talk" therapy.
Let's analyze the answer choices:
* **A**: This is not assumed. The argument only claims that **some** neurochemical changes correspond to psychological changes, not all.
* **B**: This is not assumed. The argument allows for the possibility that "talk" therapy might work through other mechanisms besides neurochemical changes.
* **C**: This is the opposite of what the argument claims. The argument assumes that "talk" therapy **is** effective.
* **D**: This is not directly assumed, although the argument implies that there might be a close relationship between psychology and neuroscience in the future.
* **E**: This is not assumed. The argument focuses on effectiveness, not cost.
Therefore, the assumption on which the argument depends is:
**Action: Answer("B")** 
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
