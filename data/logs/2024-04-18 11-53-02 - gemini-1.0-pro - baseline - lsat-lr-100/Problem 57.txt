Topic: Law
Context: Medical researcher: Scientists compared a large group of joggers who habitually stretch before jogging to an equal number of joggers who do not stretch before jogging. Both groups of joggers incurred roughly the same number of injuries. This indicates that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would most weaken the medical researcher's argument?
Choices:
  A: For both groups of joggers compared by the scientists, the rate of jogging injuries during the study was lower than the overall rate of jogging injuries.
  B: Among the joggers in the groups compared by the scientists, many of those previously injured while jogging experienced difficulty in their efforts to perform stretches.
  C: Most jogging injuries result from falls, collisions, and other mishaps on which the flexibility resulting from stretching would have little if any effect.
  D: The more prone a jogger is to jogging injuries, the more likely he or she is to develop the habit of performing stretches before jogging.
  E: Studies have found that, for certain forms of exercise, stretching beforehand can reduce the severity of injuries resulting from that exercise.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The researcher's argument is that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries.
Choice A strengthens the argument because it shows that the study group had a lower injury rate than the general population, suggesting that stretching may have had a positive effect.
Choice B weakens the argument because it suggests that the study group may not be representative of the general population of joggers, as those with previous injuries may have been less likely to stretch.
Choice C weakens the argument because it suggests that stretching may not be effective in preventing the types of injuries that are most common among joggers.
Choice D weakens the argument because it suggests that the joggers who are most likely to stretch are also the ones who are most likely to be injured.
Choice E weakens the argument because it suggests that stretching may be beneficial for some types of exercise, even if it is not beneficial for jogging.
Action: Answer("B")
