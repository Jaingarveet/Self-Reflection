Context: Art critic: The Woerner Journalism Award for criticism was given to Nan Paulsen for her reviews of automobiles. This is inappropriate. The criticism award should be given for criticism, which Paulsen's reviews clearly were not. After alL cars are utilitarian things, not works of art. And objects that are not works of art do not reveal important truths about the culture that produced them.
Question: Which one of the following principles, if valid, most helps to justiJY the reasoning in the art critic's argument?
Choices:
  A: The Woemer Journalism Award for criticism should not be given to a writer who portrays utilitarian objects as works of art.
  B: Reviews of objects cannot appropriately be considered to be criticism unless the objects reveal important truths about the culture that produced them.
  C: Unless a review is written for the purpose of revealing important truths about the writer's culture, that review should not be considered to be criticism.
  D: The Woerner JournalismAward for criticism should not be given to writers who do not consider themselves to be critics.
  E: All writing that reveals important truths about a culture should be considered to be criticism.
## Assistant 2:
## Analysis:
The art critic argues that Paulsen's reviews of automobiles are not appropriate for the Woerner Journalism Award for criticism because:
1. **Cars are utilitarian, not works of art.**
2. **Objects that are not works of art do not reveal important truths about the culture.**
Let's analyze the answer choices:
* **A**: This directly reflects the critic's argument but is too specific to the Woerner Award and Paulsen's case.
* **B**: This aligns with the critic's reasoning, emphasizing the need for cultural revelation in criticism.
* **C**: This focuses on the writer's intent, which is not directly addressed in the critic's argument.
* **D**: This is irrelevant to the argument, focusing on the writer's self-perception.
* **E**: This is too broad and does not address the specific issue of utilitarian objects.
## Conclusion:
The principle that most supports the critic's argument is:
**Action: Answer("B")** 
**B: Reviews of objects cannot appropriately be considered to be criticism unless the objects reveal important truths about the culture that produced them.** 
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
