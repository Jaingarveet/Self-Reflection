Topic: Law
Context: Ethicist: Marital vows often contain the promise to love "until death do us part." If "love" here refers to a feeling, then this promise makes no sense, for feelings are not within one's control, and a promise to do something not within one's control makes no sense. Thus, no one—including those making marital vows—should take "love" in this context to be referring to feelings.
Question: The ethicist's conclusion follows logically if which one of the following is assumed?
Choices:
  A: None of our feelings are within our control.
  B: People should not make promises to do something that is not within their control.
  C: "Love" can legitimately be taken to refer to something other than feelings.
  D: Promises should not be interpreted in such a way that they make no sense.
  E: Promises that cannot be kept do not make any sense.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The conclusion is that "love" in marital vows should not be taken to refer to feelings.
This conclusion follows logically if we assume that promises should not be interpreted in such a way that they make no sense.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
