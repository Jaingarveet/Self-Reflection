Context: Physician: In an experiment, 50 patients with chronic back pain were divided into two groups. Small magnets were applied to the backs of one group; the other group received no treatment. Most of the patients in the first group, but very few in the second group, reported a significant reduction in pain. This shows that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, constitutes the logically strongest counter to the physician's argument?
Choices:
  A: A patient's merely knowing that a treatment has been applied can lead to improvement in his or her condition.
  B: Most physicians believe that medication relieves chronic back pain more effectively than magnets do.
  C: No other experiments have been done showing that magnetic fields reduce pain in any area other than the back.
  D: Some of the scientists who helped design the experiment believed even before the experiment that magnetic fields relieve back pain, but they were not directly involved in conducting the experiment.
  E: There was wide variation in the specific causes of the chronic back pain suffered by the patients in the experiment.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The physician's argument is based on the observation that a significant reduction in pain was reported by most patients in the group that received magnetic treatment, while very few patients in the control group reported such a reduction.
A: This is a valid counterargument. The placebo effect can lead to significant improvements in a patient's condition even if the treatment itself has no effect.
B: This is not a relevant counterargument. The physician's argument is not about the effectiveness of medication compared to magnets.
C: This is not a strong counterargument. The physician's argument is based on the results of a specific experiment, and it does not claim to be universally applicable to all types of pain.
D: This is not a relevant counterargument. The beliefs of the scientists who designed the experiment do not affect the validity of the results.
E: This is a valid counterargument. The wide variation in the causes of chronic back pain could mean that the results of the experiment are not generalizable to all patients with chronic back pain.
Action: Answer("A")
