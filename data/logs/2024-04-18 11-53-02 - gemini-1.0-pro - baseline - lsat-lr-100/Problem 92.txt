Context: Museum curakor: Our ancient Egyptian collection includes an earthenware hippopotamus that resembles a child's roy. It was discovered in a tomb, upside down, with its legs broken off. We know that the ancient Egyptians believed the dead had to wage eternal war with beasts. Breaking the legs off a representation of an animal was thought to help a deceased person in this war. We conclude that, far from being a roy, this hippopotamus was a religious object.
Question: Which one of the following is an assumption required by the curator's argument?
Choices:
  A: The tomb in which the hippopotamus was found was not the tomb of a child.
  B: Earthenware figures were never used as children's roys in ancient Egypt.
  C: The tomb in which the hippopotamus was found was not reentered from the time of burial until archaeologists opened it.
  D: The hippopotamus' legs were not broken 1hrough some natural occurrence after it was placed in the tomb.
  E: The hippopotamus was originally placed upside down in the tomb.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The curator argues that the hippopotamus was a religious object because it was found in a tomb with its legs broken off. This implies that the curator believes that the hippopotamus was intentionally damaged as part of a religious ritual.
Assumption A is not required because the argument does not depend on whether the tomb belonged to a child.
Assumption B is not required because the argument does not depend on whether earthenware figures were ever used as children's toys.
Assumption C is not required because the argument does not depend on whether the tomb was undisturbed after the hippopotamus was placed in it.
Assumption D is required because if the hippopotamus' legs were broken naturally, then it would not be evidence of a religious ritual.
Assumption E is not required because the argument does not depend on whether the hippopotamus was originally placed upside down in the tomb.
Action: Answer("D")
