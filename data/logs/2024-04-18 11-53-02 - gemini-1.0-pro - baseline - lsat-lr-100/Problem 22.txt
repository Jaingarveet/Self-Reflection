## User 2:
Topic: Law
Context: In his book, published in 1892, Grey used the same metaphor that Jordan used in her book, which was published in 1885. The metaphor is so unusual that there is little chance that two different people independently created it. Therefore, it is highly likely that Grey read Jordan's book.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the argument?
Choices:
  A: A text that was probably known to both Jordan and Grey was published in 1860 and also contained the same unusual metaphor.
  B: The passage in Grey's book that employs the unusual metaphor expresses an idea that bears little relation to any ideas expressed in Jordan's book.
  C: Both Grey's book and Jordan's book were written for the same audience.
  D: Jordan used the same metaphor in a work that she wrote in 1894 and published in 1895.
  E: According to most scholars, Grey was generally a more inventive writer than Jordan and developed many original metaphors.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The argument claims that Grey likely read Jordan's book because they both used the same unusual metaphor.
A: This weakens the argument because it provides an alternative explanation for the shared metaphor. If both authors knew of a third source containing the metaphor, they could have independently drawn from it.
B: This strengthens the argument. If the metaphor is unrelated to the content of Jordan's book, it is even more unlikely that Grey would have come up with it independently.
C: This is irrelevant. The audience of the books does not affect the likelihood of Grey having read Jordan's book.
D: This strengthens the argument. If Jordan used the same metaphor in a later work, it suggests she was the originator of the metaphor, further increasing the likelihood that Grey borrowed it from her.
E: This weakens the argument. If Grey was known for his inventiveness, it is less likely that he would have borrowed a metaphor from another author.
Action: Answer("A")
