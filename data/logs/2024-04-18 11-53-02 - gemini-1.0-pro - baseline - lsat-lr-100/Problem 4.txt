Topic: Law
Context: A film makes a profit if the number of people who see it is sufficient to generate revenues from ticket sales greater than the amount spent to make it. Hence, the primary goal of movie executives is to maximize the number of people who see a film. However, it is not the primary goal of television executives to maximize the number of viewers for their shows.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain the difference between the goals of movie executives and those of television executives?
Choices:
  A: More people are willing to see a film more than once than are willing to watch a television show more than once.
  B: There is no analog in television to the large profits that owners of movie theaters make by selling refreshments to their customers.
  C: The average cost of producing an hour of film is much greater than the average cost of producing an hour of television.
  D: Television shows make their profits from sponsors, who are chiefly concerned with the purchasing power of the people who watch a television show.
  E: Over half of the most popular television shows are shows that viewers do not have to pay to watch.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The passage states that the primary goal of movie executives is to maximize the number of people who see a film, while the primary goal of television executives is not to maximize the number of viewers for their shows.
Option A is irrelevant as it does not explain the difference in goals between movie and television executives.
Option B is irrelevant as it focuses on the profits of movie theater owners, not movie executives.
Option C is the most likely explanation. The higher cost of producing films means that movie executives need to maximize viewership to recoup their investment, while television executives can rely on advertising revenue even if viewership is lower.
Option D is partially correct, but it does not fully explain the difference in goals. Television shows do make money from sponsors, but the number of viewers is still important for attracting sponsors.
Option E is irrelevant as it focuses on the viewing habits of the audience, not the goals of the executives.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
