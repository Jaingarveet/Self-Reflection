## System:
You are an expert in Law.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Context: Game show winners choosing between two equally desirable prizes will choose either the one that is more expensive or the one with which they are more familiar. Today's winner, Ed, is choosing between two equally desirable and equally unfamiliar prizes, A and B. He will thus choose A, which is more expensive.
Question: The reasoning in which one of the following is most similar to the reasoning above?
Choices:
  A: With a book contract, an academic writer receives either an advance or a guarantee of royalties. Professor al-Sofi received an advance for a book contract, so al-Sofi did not receive a guarantee of royalties.
  B: When entering this amusement park, children always choose to take their first ride on either the Rocket or the Mouse. Janine insisted on the Rocket for her first ride. Thus, Janine would not have been standing near the Mouse during her first half hour in the amusement park.
  C: The elliptical orbit of an asteroid is only slightly eccentric unless it is affected by the gravitational pull of a planet. Asteroid Y is affected by Jupiter's gravitational pull and asteroid X is not. Thus, the orbit of asteroid Y is the more eccentric of the two.
  D: New students in this program must choose either a physics class or an art class. Miyoko has no desire to take a class in either of those fields, so Miyoko will probably not enter this program.
  E: To avoid predators, rabbits will either double back on their pursuers or flee for nearby cover. The rabbit being pursued by a fox in this wildlife film is in a field that offers no opportunity for nearby cover, so it will try to double back on the fox.
## Assistant 2:
## Reasoning Analysis:
**Original scenario:**
* Ed chooses the more expensive prize (A) because both prizes are equally desirable and unfamiliar.
**Answer choices:**
* **A:** This scenario involves a choice between two mutually exclusive options, but the decision is based on different criteria (advance vs. royalties) rather than relative value like in the original scenario.
* **B:** This scenario describes a preference for a specific option (Rocket) but doesn't involve choosing between two equally desirable options like in the original scenario.
* **C:** This scenario involves comparing two objects based on a specific characteristic (eccentricity) and choosing the one with a more pronounced feature, similar to the original scenario where Ed chooses the more expensive prize.
* **D:** This scenario describes avoiding both options due to lack of interest, which is not applicable to the original scenario where Ed chooses one of the two prizes.
* **E:** This scenario involves choosing between two options based on the available environment, which is not related to the original scenario where Ed chooses based on the prizes' value.
## Conclusion:
The reasoning in choice **C** is most similar to the original scenario because both involve comparing two options based on a specific characteristic and choosing the one with a more pronounced feature.
**Action: Answer("C")** 
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: E
Score: 0
