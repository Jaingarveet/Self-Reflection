## Assistant 2:
Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly because I focused on the most common cause of unstable lie in late pregnancy, which is placenta previa. However, I failed to consider the specific details of the case, such as the patient being a multigravida with previous normal deliveries. This information suggests that factors like placenta previa and pelvic tumors are less likely, as they would have likely caused complications in previous pregnancies.
