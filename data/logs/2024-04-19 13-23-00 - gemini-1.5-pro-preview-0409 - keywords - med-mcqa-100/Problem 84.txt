## Assistant 2:
Thought:
I recall this question and my previous incorrect response. 
The trabecular meshwork is responsible for draining aqueous humor, and drugs affecting this outflow are used to treat glaucoma. 
From my reflection, I learned that Timolol is a beta-blocker, Pilocarpine is a cholinergic agonist, Brimonidine is an alpha-2 agonist, and Brinzolamide is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor. 
Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors reduce aqueous humor production, thus impacting outflow indirectly.
