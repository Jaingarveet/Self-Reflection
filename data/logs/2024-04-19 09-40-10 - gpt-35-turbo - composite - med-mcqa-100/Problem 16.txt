# Model: gpt-35-turbo | Agent: composite | Exam: med-mcqa-100 | Problem 16 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Medicine.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Subtopic: Anatomy
Question: In obstruction of second pa of axillary aery, the anastomosis between the following aery will maintain the blood supply of upper limb
Choices:
  A: Deep branch of transverse cervical aery & subscapular aery
  B: Anterior & posterior circumflex humeral
  C: Posterior circumflex humeral & circumflex scapular aery
  D: Suprascapular & anterior circumflex humeral aery
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I incorrectly chose option [REDACTED], which is incorrect. The correct answer is [REDACTED]. The subscapular artery and the deep branch of the transverse cervical artery anastomose to form the scapular anastomosis, which provides collateral circulation to the upper limb in case of obstruction of the axillary artery. The anterior and posterior circumflex humeral arteries are not part of this anastomosis and do not provide collateral circulation in case of obstruction of the axillary artery.
Error Keywords:
 - Misunderstanding of anatomy
 - Misinterpretation of the question
 - Incorrect reasoning
Solution:
In obstruction of the second part of the axillary artery, the anastomosis between the deep branch of the transverse cervical artery and the subscapular artery will maintain the blood supply of the upper limb. The scapular anastomosis is formed by the subscapular artery and the deep branch of the transverse cervical artery, which anastomose around the scapula to provide collateral circulation to the upper limb in case of obstruction of the axillary artery.
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and understand the problem.
2. Identify the parts of the axillary artery and their branches.
3. Identify the anastomoses between the arteries that provide collateral circulation to the upper limb.
4. Choose the option that correctly identifies the anastomoses that provide collateral circulation in case of obstruction of the axillary artery.
5. Double-check your reasoning and answer.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always review your anatomy knowledge before answering anatomy questions.
 - Always think through each option step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your reasoning and final answer.
