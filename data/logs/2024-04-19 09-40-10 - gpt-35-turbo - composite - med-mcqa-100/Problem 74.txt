Question: A patient underwent lateral skull base surgery few months back and has presented with complaints of recurrent aspirations. There is no change in voice of the patient. Which of the following nerve is most likely injured during surgery?
Choices:
  A: Vagus nerve
  B: Glossopharyngeal nerve
  C: SLN nerve
  D: RLN nerve
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I incorrectly chose the vagus nerve as the nerve most likely injured during surgery. The correct answer is the superior laryngeal nerve (SLN) because it is responsible for the sensation of the larynx and the cough reflex. Damage to the SLN can cause difficulty in swallowing and recurrent aspirations. The glossopharyngeal nerve is also involved in swallowing, but it is not the most likely nerve to be injured during lateral skull base surgery. The recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) is responsible for the movement of the vocal cords and can cause hoarseness if damaged during surgery. 
Error Keywords:
 - Misidentification of the nerve
 - Lack of knowledge of the function of the nerves
 - Failure to consider all the options
Solution:
Recurrent aspirations suggest a problem with the swallowing mechanism.
The nerves involved in swallowing are the vagus nerve, glossopharyngeal nerve, and the superior and recurrent laryngeal nerves.
Lateral skull base surgery can damage the nerves in the area.
The [REDACTED] is responsible for the sensation of the larynx and the cough reflex.
Damage to the SLN can cause difficulty in swallowing and recurrent aspirations.
Instructions:
1. Identify the symptoms presented by the patient.
2. Identify the nerves involved in swallowing.
3. Understand the function of each nerve.
4. Identify the nerve most likely to be injured during lateral skull base surgery.
5. Choose the nerve that best matches the patient's symptoms.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your answer to ensure accuracy.
 - Remember that the function of each nerve is critical to understanding the symptoms and diagnosis.
