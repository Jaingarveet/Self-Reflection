The gap in my knowledge was not in geography but in basic arithmetic. 
I knew the correct city and state but made a calculation error.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error

The city name "Ames" contains 4 letters.
The state name "Iowa" contains 4 letters.
The product of 4*4 is 16.

1. Identify the city where the university is located.
2. Identify the state where the university is located.
3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.
4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.
5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.
6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.
7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.

Topic: Law
Context: There are two kinds of horror stories: those that describe a mad scientist's experiments and those that describe a monstrous beast. In some horror stories about monstrous beasts, the monster symbolizes a psychological disturbance in the protagonist. Horror stories about mad scientists, on the other hand, typically express the author's feeling that scientific knowledge alone is not enough to guide human endeavor. However, despite these differences, both kinds of horror stories share two features: they describe violations of the laws of nature and they are intended to produce dread in the reader.
Question: If the statements above are true, which one of the following would also have to be true?
Choices:
  A: All descriptions of monstrous beasts describe violations of the laws of nature.
  B: Any story that describes a violation of a law of nature is intended to invoke dread in the reader.
  C: Horror stories of any kind usually describe characters who are psychologically disturbed.
  D: Most stories about mad scientists express the author's antiscientific views.
  E: Some stories that employ symbolism describe violations of the laws of nature.

Thought:
The passage states that both kinds of horror stories describe violations of the laws of nature and are intended to produce dread in the reader. It also mentions that horror stories about mad scientists express the author's feeling that scientific knowledge alone is not enough to guide human endeavor, while horror stories about monstrous beasts may symbolize a psychological disturbance in the protagonist. 
Action: Answer("B")

 --- 
Correct Answer: E
## Assistant 2:
Response:
Explanation:
I incorrectly chose answer choice B, which states that any story that describes a violation of a law of nature is intended to invoke dread in the reader. This statement is too broad and not supported by the passage. The passage only states that horror stories, which describe violations of the laws of nature, are intended to produce dread in the reader. 
The correct answer is E, which states that some stories that employ symbolism describe violations of the laws of nature. This statement is true based on the passage, which states that horror stories about monstrous beasts may symbolize a psychological disturbance in the protagonist. 
Error Keywords:
 - Overgeneralization
 - Misinterpretation
 - Unsupported assumption
Solution:
The passage states that both kinds of horror stories describe violations of the laws of nature and are intended to produce dread in the reader. It also mentions that horror stories about monstrous beasts may symbolize a psychological disturbance in the protagonist. Therefore, it is possible for some stories that employ symbolism to describe violations of the laws of nature. 
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and identify the key information in the passage.
2. Eliminate answer choices that are too broad or not supported by the passage.
3. Choose the answer choice that is most directly supported by the passage.
4. Double-check your answer choice to ensure that it is a logical conclusion based on the information in the passage.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and identify the key information in the passage.
 - Eliminate answer choices that are too broad or not supported by the passage.
 - Choose the answer choice that is most directly supported by the passage.
 - Double-check your answer choice to ensure that it is a logical conclusion based on the information in the passage.
