You are an expert in Law.
You have incorrectly answered the following multiple-choice question.
Your task is to reflect on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
You will then use this information help you answer the same question in the future.
First, explain why you answered the question incorrectly.
Second, list the keywords that describe the type of your errors from most general to most specific. 
Third, solve the problem again, step-by-step, based on your knowledge of the correct answer.
Fourth, create a list of detailed instructions to help you correctly solve this problem in the future.
Finally, create a list of general advice to help you solve similar types of problems in the future.  
Be concise in your response; however, capture all of the essential information.  
For guidance, I will provide you with a single generic example problem and reflection (below).

Question: What is the product of the number of letters contained in the name of the city where Iowa State University is located multiplied by the number of letters contained in the name of the state?
Choices:
    A: 16
    B: 20
    C: 24
    D: 32
Thought:

## Assistant 1:
Explanation:
I miscalculated the product of the number of letters in the city and state names. 
The gap in my knowledge was not in geography but in basic arithmetic. 
I knew the correct city and state but made a calculation error.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Arithmetic error
 - Multiplication error
Solution:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
Iowa State University is located in the state of Iowa.
The city name "Ames" contains 4 letters.
The state name "Iowa" contains 4 letters.
The product of 4*4 is 16.
Instructions:
1. Identify the city where the university is located.
2. Identify the state where the university is located.
3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.
4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.
5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.
6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.
7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them.

Question: Which one of the following arguments has a flawed pattern of reasoning most like the flawed reasoning in the argument above?
Choices:
  A: It is clear that most drivers in West Ansland are safe drivers since there are very few driving accidents in West Ansland and most accidents there are not serious.
  B: It is clear that John cannot drive, since he does not own a car and no one in his family who does not own a car can drive.
  C: It is clear that Fernando's friends usually drive to school, since all of his friends can drive and all of his friends go to school.
  D: It is clear that most people in Highland County drive sedans, since most people who commute to work drive sedans and most people in Highland County commute to work.
  E: It is clear that most of Janine's friends are good drivers, since she accepts rides only from good drivers and she accepts rides from most of her friends.

Thought:
The argument above uses a flawed pattern of reasoning called "hasty generalization," which draws a broad conclusion based on insufficient evidence.
Action: Answer("A")

Correct Answer: D
## Assistant 2:
Response:
Explanation:
I misidentified the flawed pattern of reasoning in the argument above. The argument uses a flawed pattern of reasoning called "hasty generalization," which draws a broad conclusion based on insufficient evidence. 
Option D is the correct answer because it also uses a hasty generalization by assuming that most people in Highland County drive sedans based on the fact that most people who commute to work drive sedans and most people in Highland County commute to work. 
Error Keywords:
 - Misidentification of the flawed pattern of reasoning
 - Hasty generalization
Solution:
The argument above uses a flawed pattern of reasoning called "hasty generalization," which draws a broad conclusion based on insufficient evidence. 
Option D is the correct answer because it also uses a hasty generalization by assuming that most people in Highland County drive sedans based on the fact that most people who commute to work drive sedans and most people in Highland County commute to work. 
Instructions:
1. Read the argument carefully and identify the pattern of reasoning used.
2. Read each option and identify the pattern of reasoning used in each.
3. Compare the pattern of reasoning used in each option to the pattern of reasoning used in the argument.
4. Choose the option that uses a pattern of reasoning most like the flawed reasoning in the argument.
Advice:
 - Always read the argument carefully and identify the pattern of reasoning used.
 - Always read each option carefully and identify the pattern of reasoning used in each.
 - Always compare the pattern of reasoning used in each option to the pattern of reasoning used in the argument.
 - Remember that there are many different patterns of reasoning that can be flawed, so be familiar with them.
