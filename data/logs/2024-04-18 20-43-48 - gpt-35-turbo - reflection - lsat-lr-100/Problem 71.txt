## Assistant 1:
Explanation:
I miscalculated the product of the number of letters in the city and state names. 
The gap in my knowledge was not in geography but in basic arithmetic. 
I knew the correct city and state but made a calculation error.
Error Keywords:

Context: Curator: Our museum displays only twentieth-century works, which are either on loan from private collectors or in the museum's permanent collection. Prints of all of the latter works are available in the museum store.

  B: Every print that is sold in the museum store is a copy of a twentieth-century work.
  C: There are prints in the museum store of every work that is displayed in the museum and not on loan from a private collector.
  D: Hopper's Nighthawks is both a twentieth-century work and a work on loan to the museum from a private collector.
  E: Hopper's Nighthawks is not displayed in the museum.

Response:
Explanation:
I misinterpreted the statement "Prints of all of the latter works are available in the museum store" to mean that all prints in the museum store are of works in the museum's permanent collection. 
The correct interpretation is that all prints of works in the museum's permanent collection are available in the museum store. 
Error Keywords:
 - Misinterpretation
 - Assumption
 - Logical error
Solution:
The museum displays only twentieth-century works.
The works are either on loan from private collectors or in the museum's permanent collection.
Prints of all of the latter works are available in the museum store.
The museum store also sells prints of some works that are not part of the museum's permanent collection, such as Hopper's Nighthawks.
Therefore, prints of works that are displayed in the museum and not on loan from a private collector are available in the museum store.
