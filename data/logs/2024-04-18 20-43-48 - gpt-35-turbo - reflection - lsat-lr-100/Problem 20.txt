Choices:
    A: 16
    B: 20

## Assistant 1:
Explanation:
I miscalculated the product of the number of letters in the city and state names. 
The gap in my knowledge was not in geography but in basic arithmetic. 
I knew the correct city and state but made a calculation error.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Arithmetic error
 - Multiplication error
Solution:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
Iowa State University is located in the state of Iowa.
The city name "Ames" contains 4 letters.
The state name "Iowa" contains 4 letters.
The product of 4*4 is 16.
Instructions:
1. Identify the city where the university is located.
2. Identify the state where the university is located.
3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.
4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.
5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.
6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.
7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them.

Topic: Law
Context: Judge: The defendant admits noncompliance with national building codes but asks that penalties not be imposed because he was confused as to whether national or local building codes applied to the area in which he was building. This excuse might be acceptable had he been charged with noncompliance with local codes, but since he is charged with noncompliance with national codes, his excuse is unacceptable.
Question: Which one of the following principles, if valid, most helps to justify the judge's reasoning?
Choices:
  A: Local codes and national codes must not overlap with each other.
  B: Local codes may be less strict, but not more strict, than national codes.
  C: Any behavior required by national codes is also required by local codes.
  D: Ignorance of the difference between two codes is not an adequate excuse for noncompliance.
  E: A behavior that is in compliance with one law is not necessarily in compliance with another.

Thought:
The defendant admits noncompliance with national building codes.
The defendant's excuse is that he was confused as to whether national or local building codes applied to the area in which he was building.
The judge's reasoning is that the defendant's excuse is unacceptable because he was charged with noncompliance with national codes.
Action: Answer("D")
