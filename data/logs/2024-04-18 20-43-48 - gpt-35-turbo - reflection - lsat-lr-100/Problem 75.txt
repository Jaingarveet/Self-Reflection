## System:
You are an expert in Law.
You have incorrectly answered the following multiple-choice question.
Your task is to reflect on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
You will then use this information help you answer the same question in the future.
First, explain why you answered the question incorrectly.
Second, list the keywords that describe the type of your errors from most general to most specific. 
Third, solve the problem again, step-by-step, based on your knowledge of the correct answer.
Fourth, create a list of detailed instructions to help you correctly solve this problem in the future.
Finally, create a list of general advice to help you solve similar types of problems in the future.  
Be concise in your response; however, capture all of the essential information.  
For guidance, I will provide you with a single generic example problem and reflection (below).

Topic: Geography and Math
Question: What is the product of the number of letters contained in the name of the city where Iowa State University is located multiplied by the number of letters contained in the name of the state?
Choices:
    A: 16
    B: 20
    C: 24
    D: 32
Thought:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
ISU is located in the state of Iowa.
Action: Answer("D")
---
Correct Answer: A
## Assistant 1:
Explanation:
I miscalculated the product of the number of letters in the city and state names. 
The gap in my knowledge was not in geography but in basic arithmetic. 
I knew the correct city and state but made a calculation error.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Arithmetic error
 - Multiplication error
Solution:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
Iowa State University is located in the state of Iowa.
The city name "Ames" contains 4 letters.
The state name "Iowa" contains 4 letters.
The product of 4*4 is 16.
Instructions:
1. Identify the city where the university is located.
2. Identify the state where the university is located.
3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.
4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.
5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.
6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.
7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them.

Topic: Law
Context: Figorian Wildlife Commission: The development of wetlands in industrialized nations for residential and commercial uses has endangered many species. To protect wildlife we must regulate such development in Figoria: future wetland development must be offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats. Thus, development would cause no net reduction of wetlands and pose no threat to the species that inhabit them. Figorian Development Commission: Other nations have flagrantly developed wetlands at the expense of wildlife. We have conserved. Since Figorian wetland development might not affect wildlife and is necessary for growth, we should allow development. We have as much right to govern our own resources as countries that have already put their natural resources to commercial use.
Question: Which one of the following principles, if accepted, would most strongly support the Figorian Development Commission's position against the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position?
Choices:
  A: National resources should be regulated by international agreement when wildlife is endangered.
  B: The right of future generations to have wildlife preserved supersedes the economic needs of individual nations.
  C: Only when a reduction of populations of endangered species by commercial development has been found should regulation be implemented to prevent further damage.
  D: Environment regulation must aim at preventing any further environmental damage and cannot allow for the different degrees to which different nations have already harmed the environment.
  E: It is imprudent to allow further depletion of natural resources.

Thought:
The Figorian Development Commission believes that Figoria should be allowed to develop wetlands for growth, and that they have the right to govern their own resources. Therefore, the principle that would most strongly support their position would be one that emphasizes the right of individual nations to govern their own resources.
Action: Answer("D")

 --- 
Correct Answer: C
## Assistant 2:
Response:
Explanation:
I incorrectly chose answer choice D because it emphasizes the prevention of any further environmental damage and does not allow for different degrees of harm already done by different nations. However, this principle does not support the Figorian Development Commission's position because it does not address the issue of Figoria's right to govern its own resources. Answer choice C is the correct answer because it supports the Figorian Development Commission's position by suggesting that regulation should only be implemented when a reduction of populations of endangered species by commercial development has been found. This principle implies that Figoria should be allowed to develop wetlands for growth unless there is evidence that endangered species are being harmed.
Error Keywords:
 - Misinterpretation of the question
 - Incorrect assumption
 - Incorrect reasoning
Solution:

Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and understand the positions of both sides.
2. Identify the principle that would most strongly support the Figorian Development Commission's position.
3. Consider each answer choice and evaluate whether it supports the Figorian Development Commission's position.
4. Eliminate answer choices that do not support the Figorian Development Commission's position.
5. Choose the answer choice that most strongly supports the Figorian Development Commission's position.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the positions of both sides.
 - Always evaluate each answer choice in relation to the question and the positions of both sides.
 - Never assume that an answer choice is correct without evaluating it carefully.
 - Always eliminate answer choices that do not support one side or the other.
 - Remember that the correct answer is the one that most strongly supports one side or the other.
