## System:
You are an expert in Law.
You have incorrectly answered the following multiple-choice question.
Your task is to reflect on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
You will then use this information help you answer the same question in the future.
First, explain why you answered the question incorrectly.
Second, list the keywords that describe the type of your errors from most general to most specific. 
Third, solve the problem again, step-by-step, based on your knowledge of the correct answer.
Fourth, create a list of detailed instructions to help you correctly solve this problem in the future.
Finally, create a list of general advice to help you solve similar types of problems in the future.  
Be concise in your response; however, capture all of the essential information.  
For guidance, I will provide you with a single generic example problem and reflection (below).

Topic: Geography and Math
Question: What is the product of the number of letters contained in the name of the city where Iowa State University is located multiplied by the number of letters contained in the name of the state?
Choices:
    A: 16
    B: 20
    C: 24
    D: 32
Thought:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
ISU is located in the state of Iowa.
Action: Answer("D")
---
Correct Answer: A
## Assistant 1:
Explanation:
I miscalculated the product of the number of letters in the city and state names. 
The gap in my knowledge was not in geography but in basic arithmetic. 
I knew the correct city and state but made a calculation error.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Arithmetic error
 - Multiplication error
Solution:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
Iowa State University is located in the state of Iowa.
The city name "Ames" contains 4 letters.
The state name "Iowa" contains 4 letters.
The product of 4*4 is 16.
Instructions:
1. Identify the city where the university is located.
2. Identify the state where the university is located.
3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.
4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.
5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.
6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.
7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them.

Topic: Law
Context: Although Pluto has an atmosphere and is much larger than any asteroid, Pluto is not a true planet. Pluto formed in orbit around the planet Neptune and was then ejected from orbit around Neptune when Triton, Neptune's largest moon, was captured by Neptune's gravity.
Question: The conclusion of the argument follows logically if which one of the following is assumed?
Choices:
  A: No celestial body can simultaneously be a moon and a planet.
  B: Not all celestial bodies that have an atmosphere and orbit the sun are true planets.
  C: If Pluto had not been ejected from its orbit around Neptune, Pluto would not have its current orbit around the sun and would still be a moon.
  D: The size of a celestial body in orbit around the sun is not relevant to determining whether or not it is a true planet.
  E: For a celestial body to be a true planet it must have formed in orbit around the sun exclusively.

Thought:
The argument states that Pluto is not a true planet because it was ejected from orbit around Neptune when Triton was captured by Neptune's gravity. Therefore, the assumption must be related to this fact.
Option A is incorrect because there are celestial bodies that can be both a moon and a planet.
Option B is a possible assumption because it suggests that having an atmosphere and orbiting the sun are not sufficient conditions to be a true planet.
Option C is not necessary to the argument because it does not explain why Pluto is not a true planet.
Option D is incorrect because the size of a celestial body is relevant to determining whether or not it is a true planet.
Option E is incorrect because it is not necessary for a celestial body to form in orbit around the sun exclusively to be a true planet.
Action: Answer("B")

 --- 
Correct Answer: E
## Assistant 2:
Response:
Explanation:
I misinterpreted the argument and did not consider all the relevant facts. The argument states that Pluto is not a true planet because it was ejected from orbit around Neptune when Triton was captured by Neptune's gravity. The assumption must be related to this fact and the definition of a true planet.
Option B is incorrect because it does not explain why Pluto is not a true planet.
Option E is the correct answer because it assumes that a celestial body must form in orbit around the sun exclusively to be a true planet. This assumption is necessary because Pluto formed in orbit around Neptune and was then ejected from orbit around Neptune.
Error Keywords:
 - Misinterpretation
 - Insufficient consideration
 - Definition error
Solution:
The argument states that Pluto is not a true planet because it was ejected from orbit around Neptune when Triton was captured by Neptune's gravity. The assumption must be related to this fact and the definition of a true planet.
Option B is incorrect because it does not explain why Pluto is not a true planet.
Option E is the correct answer because it assumes that a celestial body must form in orbit around the sun exclusively to be a true planet. This assumption is necessary because Pluto formed in orbit around Neptune and was then ejected from orbit around Neptune.
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and understand the argument.
2. Identify the relevant facts and assumptions in the argument.
3. Consider all the options and eliminate the incorrect ones.
4. Choose the option that logically follows from the argument and is necessary to the conclusion.
5. Double-check your answer to ensure accuracy.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the argument.
 - Consider all the relevant facts and assumptions in the argument.
 - Eliminate the incorrect options systematically.
 - Choose the option that logically follows from the argument and is necessary to the conclusion.
 - Double-check your answer to ensure accuracy.
 - Remember that assumptions are necessary to the conclusion of an argument.
