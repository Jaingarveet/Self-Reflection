## Assistant 1:

The gap in my knowledge was not in geography but in basic arithmetic. 
I knew the correct city and state but made a calculation error.
Error Keywords:

Topic: Law
Context: Anyone who knows Ellsworth knows that he is bursting with self-righteousness, touting the idealism of his generation over the greed of the previous generation. So no one who knows him will be surprised that Ellsworth is offended by the suggestions in the media that he has engaged in unethical business practices.
Question: The conclusion drawn above follows logically if which one of the following is assumed?
Choices:
  A: Everyone suspects self-righteous people of being, in actuality, unethical.
  B: Ellsworth has been accused of unethical business practices before.
  C: Hypocrites often hide behind righteous indignation.
  D: Ellsworth is in fact innocent of all wrongdoing.
  E: Everyone expects self-righteous people to be easily offended.

Thought:
The conclusion is that Ellsworth is offended by the suggestions in the media that he has engaged in unethical business practices. 
The assumption required to draw this conclusion logically must be related to Ellsworth's character or behavior.
Option D is a possibility, but it is not the only assumption that can be made.
Option B is not relevant to the conclusion.
Option A and E are too general and do not relate to Ellsworth's character or behavior.
Option C is a possibility, but it is not the only assumption that can be made.
Action: Answer("D")
