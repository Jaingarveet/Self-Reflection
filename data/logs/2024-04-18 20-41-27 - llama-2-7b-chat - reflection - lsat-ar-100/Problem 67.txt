Explanation:
I miscalculated the product of the number of letters in the city and state names. 
The gap in my knowledge was not in geography but in basic arithmetic. 
I knew the correct city and state but made a calculation error.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Arithmetic error
 - Multiplication error
Solution:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
Iowa State University is located in the state of Iowa.
The city name "Ames" contains 4 letters.
The state name "Iowa" contains 4 letters.
The product of 4*4 is 16.

Topic: Law
Context: A bakery makes exactly three kinds of cookie—oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar. Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day. The following conditions apply: No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
Question: If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Exactly three batches of cookies are made on Tuesday.
  B: Exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday.
  C: At least two batches of cookies are made on Monday.
  D: At least two batches of cookies are made on Thursday.
  E: Fewer batches of cookies are made on Monday than on Tuesday.

  Thought: Let's analyze the given conditions to determine which statement must be true if no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday.

1. No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
2. At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
3. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
4. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.

Action: Let's use a diagram to represent the information given in the problem.

| Monday | Tuesday | Wednesday | Thursday | Friday |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 🍪 | 🍪 | 🚫 | 🍪 | 🍪 |
| 🍪 | 🍪 | 🚫 | 🍪 | 🍪 |
| 🍪 | 🚫 | 🍪 | 🍪 | 🍪 |
| 🍪 | 🚫 | 🍪 | 🍪 | 🍪 |
| 🍪 | 🚫 | 🚫 | 🍪 | 🍪 |

From the diagram, we can see that at least one batch of cookies is made on Monday, and the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Action: Answer("C")
