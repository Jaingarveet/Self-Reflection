The gap in my knowledge was not in geography but in basic arithmetic. 
I knew the correct city and state but made a calculation error.
Error Keywords:

Topic: Law
Context: A maintenance company that takes service requests from three clients—Image, Solide, and Truvest—plans to set targets for its average service response times. Service targets will be set at 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day. Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail. The six targets are set according to the following conditions: None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
Question: If Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Image's voicemail target is 2 days.
  B: Image's website target is 2 days.
  C: Image's website target is 1 day.
  D: Solide's website target is 2 days.
  E: Solide's website target is 1 day.

  Thought: Based on the given conditions, we need to determine which one of the following must be true if Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target.

Let's analyze the conditions:

1. None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
2. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
3. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.

Now, let's evaluate each choice:

A: Image's voicemail target is 2 days. This is not a possible answer because Image's voicemail target is shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets, which means Image's website target cannot be longer than its voicemail target.

B: Image's website target is 2 days. This is not a possible answer because Image's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target, which means Image's website target cannot be longer than Truvest's website target.

C: Image's website target is 1 day. This is a possible answer because if Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, then Image's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.

D: Solide's website target is 2 days. This is not a possible answer because Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target, which means Solide's website target cannot be longer than Truvest's website target.

E: Solide's website target is 1 day. This is a possible answer because if Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, then Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) Image's website target is 1 day.
