Thought: 
Post-radiation skin lesions like desquamation are typically managed with supportive care, as the skin heals over time.

Observation is also important to ensure healing and to catch any early signs of infection or other complications. Therefore, Choices A and B are appropriate management strategies for post-radiation skin desquamation.
