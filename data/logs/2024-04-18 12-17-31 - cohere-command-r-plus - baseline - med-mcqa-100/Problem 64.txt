Question: Which of the following ovarian tumor is most prone to undergo torsion during pregnancy :
Choices:
  A: Serous cystadenoma
  B: Mucinous cystadenoma
  C: Dermoid cyst
  D: Theca lutein cyst
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Ovarian tumors that occur during pregnancy are at an increased risk of torsion due to the increased blood supply and weight of the growing uterus. 
- Serous cystadenomas are typically solid and do not have a high risk of torsion.
- Mucinous cystadenomas are characterized by the production of mucus, which can make them quite large and thus more prone to torsion.
- Dermoid cysts are firm and usually do not tors, but they can cause pain and discomfort.
- Theca lutein cysts are hormone-producing tumors that typically regress after pregnancy. They are not particularly associated with an increased risk of torsion.

Therefore, the correct answer is B: Mucinous cystadenoma.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
