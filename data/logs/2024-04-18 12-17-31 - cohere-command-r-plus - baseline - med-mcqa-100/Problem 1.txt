## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The correct answer is "C: Meningeal artery."

The internal carotid artery can be divided into three parts: the cervical, petrous, and cavernous parts. The cavernous part of the internal carotid artery gives rise to several branches, including the cavernous branch, inferior hypophyseal artery, and ophthalmic artery. However, the meningeal artery is not a branch of the cavernous part but rather a branch of the middle meningeal artery, which arises from the maxillary artery.
