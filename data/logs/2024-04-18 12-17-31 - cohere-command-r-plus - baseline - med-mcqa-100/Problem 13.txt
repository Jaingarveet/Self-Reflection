Question: Investigation of choice in pyloric stenosis-
Choices:

## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Pyloric stenosis is a condition that causes the pylorus (the valve between the stomach and the small intestine) to become narrowed. This can obstruct the passage of food from the stomach, causing vomiting and other symptoms.

The investigation of choice for diagnosing pyloric stenosis is an upper gastrointestinal (UGI) series, sometimes called a "gastrografin series." This involves the patient swallowing a barium contrast liquid, which coats the digestive tract and allows for X-ray images to be taken. These images can clearly show the location and degree of pyloric narrowing, confirming the diagnosis.
Action: Answer("B")

Agent Answer: B
