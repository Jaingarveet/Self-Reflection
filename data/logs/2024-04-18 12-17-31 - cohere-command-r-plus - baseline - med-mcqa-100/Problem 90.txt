Question: At 34 weeks multigravida with previous 2 normal delivery has an unstable lie with the present pregnancy. It can be due to:
Choices:
  A: Oligohydramnios
  B: Placenta pre
  C: Pelvic tumor
  D: Uterine anomalies
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
An unstable lie in pregnancy refers to the position of the fetus, which can change frequently and is considered common in early pregnancy but rare in the third trimester. 

Oligohydramnios refers to a decrease in amniotic fluid, which can occur due to a variety of reasons but is not directly related to an unstable lie. 

Placenta praevia (placenta previa), however, is a condition where the placenta is located in the lowest part of the uterus, either covering the cervical os or close to it. This can cause vaginal bleeding and an unstable lie, especially in the third trimester, and is a serious complication requiring medical attention. 

Therefore, the correct answer is:
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
