You are an expert in Logic.
You have incorrectly answered the following multiple-choice question.
Your task is to reflect on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
You will then use this information help you answer the same question in the future.
First, explain why you answered the question incorrectly.
Second, list the keywords that describe the type of your errors from most general to most specific. 
Third, solve the problem again, step-by-step, based on your knowledge of the correct answer.
Fourth, create a list of detailed instructions to help you correctly solve this problem in the future.
Finally, create a list of general advice to help you solve similar types of problems in the future.  
Be concise in your response; however, capture all of the essential information.  
For guidance, I will provide you with a single generic example problem and reflection (below).
## User 1:
Topic: Geography and Math
Question: What is the product of the number of letters contained in the name of the city where Iowa State University is located multiplied by the number of letters contained in the name of the state?
Choices:
    A: 16
    B: 20
    C: 24
    D: 32
Thought:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
ISU is located in the state of Iowa.
Action: Answer("D")
---
Correct Answer: A
## Assistant 1:
Explanation:
I miscalculated the product of the number of letters in the city and state names. 
The gap in my knowledge was not in geography but in basic arithmetic. 
I knew the correct city and state but made a calculation error.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Arithmetic error
 - Multiplication error
Solution:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
Iowa State University is located in the state of Iowa.
The city name "Ames" contains 4 letters.
The state name "Iowa" contains 4 letters.
The product of 4*4 is 16.
Instructions:
1. Identify the city where the university is located.
2. Identify the state where the university is located.
3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.
4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.
5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.
6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.
7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them.
## User 2:
Topic: Logic
Context: A provincial Go team coach selects 4 of the 7 players from E, F, G, H, J, K and M to participate in the professional league.The selection must meet the following conditions? E or F has one person to participate, but not both .One of J or K will participate, but not both.If J participates, then G participates.Unless F participates, M does not participate.
Question: Which two of the following players will be selected by the coach to make the four-person team the only choice?
Choices:
  A: F and H
  C: G and M
  B: G and J
  D: H and M

Thought:
* **E or F, but not both:** This eliminates options with both (none) or neither (D).
* **J or K, but not both:** Eliminates options with both (none) or neither (A).
* **J then G:** Option C has G but not J, so it's invalid.
* **Unless F, no M:**  Option A has F, so M's presence doesn't matter. 
Therefore, the only remaining valid option is:
Action: Answer("A") 


 --- 
Correct Answer: D
## Assistant 2:
Response:
## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:** My error stemmed from misinterpreting the "unless" condition. I assumed it meant "if F then M," but it actually implies "if not F then not M." This oversight led me to eliminate option D incorrectly.
**Error Keywords:**
*   Logical reasoning error
*   Conditional statement misinterpretation
*   "Unless" statement misunderstanding
## Step-by-Step Solution
1.  **E or F, but not both:** Eliminates options with both (none) or neither (D remains).
2.  **J or K, but not both:** Eliminates options with both (none) or neither (A and D remain).
3.  **J then G:** This doesn't eliminate any remaining options.
4.  **Unless F, no M:** This means if F is NOT chosen, then M cannot be chosen. Option A has F, so it's still valid. However, option D does NOT have F, so it must also NOT have M. Since option D has M, it is invalid.
Therefore, the only remaining valid option is **A: F and H**.
## Instructions for Future Problem Solving
1.  Carefully analyze each condition, paying close attention to keywords like "unless," "or," and "and."
2.  Break down complex conditions into simpler "if-then" statements.
3.  Consider each option and systematically eliminate those that violate any of the conditions.
4.  Double-check your reasoning and ensure you haven't misinterpreted any statements.
## General Advice for Similar Problems
*   Practice identifying different types of conditional statements and their logical implications.
*   Create truth tables or diagrams to visualize the relationships between conditions and outcomes.
*   Work through similar logic puzzles to improve your reasoning skills and identify common pitfalls.
*   Don't rush; take your time to carefully analyze each condition and its consequences.
