First, explain why you answered the question incorrectly.
Second, list the keywords that describe the type of your errors from most general to most specific. 
Third, solve the problem again, step-by-step, based on your knowledge of the correct answer.
Fourth, create a list of detailed instructions to help you correctly solve this problem in the future.
Finally, create a list of general advice to help you solve similar types of problems in the future.  
Be concise in your response; however, capture all of the essential information.  
For guidance, I will provide you with a single generic example problem and reflection (below).

Topic: Geography and Math
Question: What is the product of the number of letters contained in the name of the city where Iowa State University is located multiplied by the number of letters contained in the name of the state?
Choices:
    A: 16
    B: 20
    C: 24
    D: 32
Thought:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
ISU is located in the state of Iowa.
Action: Answer("D")
---
Correct Answer: A
## Assistant 1:
Explanation:
I miscalculated the product of the number of letters in the city and state names. 
The gap in my knowledge was not in geography but in basic arithmetic. 
I knew the correct city and state but made a calculation error.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Arithmetic error
 - Multiplication error
Solution:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
Iowa State University is located in the state of Iowa.
The city name "Ames" contains 4 letters.
The state name "Iowa" contains 4 letters.
The product of 4*4 is 16.
Instructions:
1. Identify the city where the university is located.
2. Identify the state where the university is located.
3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.
4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.
5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.
6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.
7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them.

Topic: Logic
Context: There are 7 heart disease patients E, F, G, H, I, J, K to be assigned to 4 doctors for treatment, they are Dr.Zhang, Dr.Li, Dr.Wang and Dr.Liu.Only one doctor is responsible for each patient, and each doctor is responsible for the treatment of up to two patients.Among the patients, J and K are children, and the remaining 5 are adults; E, F, and J are males, and the remaining 4 are females.The following conditions must be met? (1) Dr.Zhang is only responsible for treating male patients.(2) Dr.Li can only be responsible for the treatment of 1 patient.(3) If a doctor is responsible for treating a child patient, then he must be responsible for the treatment of an adult patient of the same sex as the child.
Question: Based on the above conditions, which of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Doctor F is responsible for treatment.
  C: J is treated by Dr.Zhang.
  B: C is treated by Dr.Liu.
  D: H is treated by Dr.Wang.

Thought:
We need to analyze the constraints to determine which statement must be true.
*   Dr. Zhang treats only males (E, F, J).
*   Dr. Li treats only 1 patient.
*   A doctor treating a child also treats an adult of the same sex.
Analyzing options:
*   A: We don't know for sure who treats F. 
*   B: We have no information on who treats C.
*   C: J being a child requires a same-sex adult (female) also assigned to the same doctor. This might not be possible with the given constraints.
*   D: We have no information on who treats H.
None of the options are definitively true based on the given constraints. 
Action: Answer("None of the Above")

Correct Answer: C

Response:
## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:** My reasoning was flawed because I focused too much on the uncertainty of each option rather than deducing the implications of the given constraints. I failed to recognize the forced pairing of J with a female adult due to the third constraint, leading me to overlook the certainty of J being treated by Dr. Zhang.
**Error Keywords:**
*   Logic error
*   Inference error
*   Constraint misinterpretation 
## Step-by-Step Solution
1. **Analyze Constraints:**
    *   Dr. Zhang treats only males (E, F, J).
    *   Dr. Li treats only 1 patient.
    *   A doctor treating a child (J or K) also treats a same-sex adult.
2. **Focus on Child Patients:**
    *   J (male child) requires a female adult to be treated by the same doctor.
    *   The only female adults are C, H, and I.
3. **Deduce Doctor Assignments:**
    *   Dr. Zhang must treat J and one of the female adults (C, H, or I) due to the constraints.
4. **Evaluate Options:**
    *   Option C (J is treated by Dr. Zhang) is the only option that aligns with the deduced assignments. 
## Instructions for Future Similar Problems
1. **Identify all constraints and their implications.**
2. **Focus on unique or restrictive conditions (like child patients in this case).**
3. **Deduce forced pairings or assignments based on the constraints.**
4. **Eliminate options that contradict the deduced assignments.**
5. **Choose the option that aligns with the logical deductions.**
## General Advice for Logic Problems
*   **Read the problem carefully and ensure understanding of all conditions.**
*   **Break down complex constraints into smaller, manageable parts.**
*   **Focus on the relationships and implications between constraints.**
*   **Use a step-by-step approach to deduce information and eliminate possibilities.**
*   **Don't make assumptions or jump to conclusions without logical reasoning.** 
*   **Double-check your reasoning and ensure it aligns with all given information.**
