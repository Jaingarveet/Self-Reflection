## System:
You are an expert in Logic.
You have incorrectly answered the following multiple-choice question.
Your task is to reflect on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
You will then use this information help you answer the same question in the future.
First, explain why you answered the question incorrectly.
Second, list the keywords that describe the type of your errors from most general to most specific. 
Third, solve the problem again, step-by-step, based on your knowledge of the correct answer.
Fourth, create a list of detailed instructions to help you correctly solve this problem in the future.
Finally, create a list of general advice to help you solve similar types of problems in the future.  
Be concise in your response; however, capture all of the essential information.  
For guidance, I will provide you with a single generic example problem and reflection (below).

Topic: Geography and Math
Question: What is the product of the number of letters contained in the name of the city where Iowa State University is located multiplied by the number of letters contained in the name of the state?
Choices:
    A: 16
    B: 20
    C: 24
    D: 32
Thought:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
ISU is located in the state of Iowa.
Action: Answer("D")
---
Correct Answer: A
## Assistant 1:
Explanation:
I miscalculated the product of the number of letters in the city and state names. 
The gap in my knowledge was not in geography but in basic arithmetic. 
I knew the correct city and state but made a calculation error.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Arithmetic error
 - Multiplication error
Solution:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
Iowa State University is located in the state of Iowa.
The city name "Ames" contains 4 letters.
The state name "Iowa" contains 4 letters.
The product of 4*4 is 16.
Instructions:
1. Identify the city where the university is located.
2. Identify the state where the university is located.
3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.
4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.
5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.
6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.
7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them.

Topic: Logic
Context: There are five volcanic islands E, F, G, H, and I in the east coast of a country.They are arranged in a straight line from north to south, and they are found? (1) F is adjacent to H and is on the north side of H.(2) I and E are adjacent.(3) G is somewhere in the north of F.
Question: If it is found that G is the northernmost island, how many possible arrangements are there for this group of islands?
Choices:
  A: 2
  B: 3
  C: 4
  D: 5

Thought:
*   G is the northernmost, so the order starts with G.
*   From (3), G is north of F, so F must come after G.
*   From (1), F is north of and adjacent to H, so the order becomes GFH.
*   From (2), I and E are adjacent, and they must come after H as the only remaining islands. 
*   This leaves only two possible arrangements: GFHI and GFHIE. 
Action: Answer("A")

Correct Answer: C

Response:
## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:** My error was assuming that I and E must come after H, limiting the possible arrangements. I failed to consider the possibility of I and E being located between G and F.
**Error Keywords:**
*   Logic error
*   Assumption error
*   Ordering error
**Step-by-Step Solution:**
1.  **G is northernmost:** The order starts with G.
2.  **F is south of G:** From (3), F must come after G. Order is now GF.
3.  **H is south of F:** From (1), H must come after F. Order is now GFH.
4.  **I and E are adjacent:** From (2), I and E are together. They can be placed in three positions:
    *   **South of H:** GFHI, GFHIE (two possibilities as I and E can switch)
    *   **Between G and F:** GIFH, GIEFH (two possibilities as I and E can switch)
**Instructions for Future:**
1.  **Analyze each statement individually:** Break down the given information into separate facts.
2.  **Consider all possibilities:** Don't make assumptions about the order or placement of elements unless explicitly stated.
3.  **Systematically explore placements:** Try placing the remaining elements in all possible valid positions.
4.  **Count distinct arrangements:** Ensure each arrangement is unique and adheres to all given conditions.
**General Advice for Similar Problems:**
*   **Visualize the problem:** Draw diagrams or use objects to represent the elements and their relationships.
*   **Work systematically:** Avoid jumping to conclusions and explore all possibilities in an organized manner.
*   **Check for consistency:** Ensure your solution satisfies all the given conditions and constraints.
*   **Practice similar problems:** The more you practice, the better you become at identifying potential pitfalls and applying logical reasoning.
