Context: The Internet makes possible the instaotaoeous transmission and retrieval of digital text. It is widely assumed that this capacity will lead to the displacement of printed books by digitized books that are read mainly on computer screens or handheld electronic devices. But it is more likely, I believe, that most digital files of books will be prioted and bound on demand at point of sale by machines that can quickly and inexpensively make single copies that are indistinguishable from books made in fiIctories. Once most books have been digitized, aoyone with access to the Internet will be able to purchase printed books from a practieally limitless digital catalog that includes even those books that, under traditional publishing assumptions, would have been desigoated "out of print." Also, the digital publication of a book online involves no pbysical inventory', thereby eliminating the costs of warehousing, shipping books to wholesalers and to retail stores, displaying pbysieal books in retail stores, and returning unsold books to publishers. This would make digital publishing much less expensive than traditional publishing. Given the economic efficiency and convenience for customers of this new digital model of publishing, it is likely to eventually supplant or at least rival traditional publishingalthough it will be some time before a catalog of printable digitized books becomes large enough to jusillY investment in book prioting machines at numerous regional sites. Moreover, the elimination of whole categories of expensemeans that under the digital publishing model,authors would be responsible for a greater proportion of the value of the final product and would therefore, according to literal)' agents, be entitled to a larger share of the proceeds. Currently a large percentage of publishers' revenue is absorbed by the costs of printing, selling, and distributing pbysical books, costs that are irrelevant to digital publication. LiteraI)' agents marketing new manuscripts could thus be expected to demand a significantly bigger slice of revenue for their authors than has been traditional. But large, established publishing houses, which are heavily invested in the infrastructure of traditional publishing, initially will be reluctant to accede. So the opportunity to bid for new manuscripts will go first to upstart digital-publishing firms unfettered by traditional practices or infrastructure. Under this competitive pressure, traditional publishers will have to reduee their redundant functions in order to accommodate higher royalty payments to authors or else they will lose their authors. Such adjustments are typical of the interval between a departing economic model and its successor and may help explain the caution with which today's publishing conglomerates are approaching the digital future.

Great, let's break down the answer:

The correct answer is (D) There will be significantly less demand by publishers for the services of copy editors and book designers.

The passage suggests that with the shift towards digital publishing, the cost savings and efficiency gains will lead to a decrease in the demand for traditional publishing services such as copy editing and book design. This is because digital publishing allows for more automation and streamlining of the publishing process, which reduces the need for these services.

The other options are not supported by the passage:

(A) The need for warehousing will shift mainly from that of individual books to that of paper and binding material to make books is not supported by the passage. While it is true that the demand for paper and binding material may increase, the passage does not suggest that the need for warehousing will shift in this way.

(B) The patronage of stores that sell used books will increase significantly is not supported by the passage. The passage does not mention used book stores or suggest that their patronage will increase.

(C) Most publishers will sell their own books individually and will not use distributors or retailers is not supported by the passage. While the passage does suggest that digital publishing will make traditional publishing less expensive and more efficient, it does not suggest that publishers will start selling their own books directly to consumers.

(E) The demand for book-grade paper will decrease significantly is not supported by the passage. While it is true that the demand for paper may decrease with the shift towards digital publishing, the passage does not suggest that this will happen significantly.

Overall, the passage suggests that the shift towards digital publishing will lead to a decrease in the demand for traditional publishing services such as copy editing and book design, so option (D) is the correct answer.
