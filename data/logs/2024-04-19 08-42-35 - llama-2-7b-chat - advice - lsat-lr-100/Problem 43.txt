## User 2:
Topic: Law
Context: Ethicist: Marital vows often contain the promise to love "until death do us part." If "love" here refers to a feeling, then this promise makes no sense, for feelings are not within one's control, and a promise to do something not within one's control makes no sense. Thus, no one—including those making marital vows—should take "love" in this context to be referring to feelings.
Question: The ethicist's conclusion follows logically if which one of the following is assumed?
Choices:
  A: None of our feelings are within our control.
  B: People should not make promises to do something that is not within their control.
  C: "Love" can legitimately be taken to refer to something other than feelings.
  D: Promises should not be interpreted in such a way that they make no sense.
  E: Promises that cannot be kept do not make any sense.

  E: Promises that cannot be kept do not make any sense.
Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and then I reflected on the problem, my solution, and the correct answer. Here is my reflection:

I mistakenly assumed that the ethicist's conclusion followed logically from the assumption that none of our feelings are within our control. However, upon further reflection, I realize that the ethicist's conclusion can also be supported by the assumption that people should not make promises to do something that is not within their control. This assumption highlights the fact that making a promise to love someone until death do us part is a commitment to do something that is beyond one's control, as love is a complex emotion that cannot be forced or controlled.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) People should not make promises to do something that is not within their control.

Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: D
