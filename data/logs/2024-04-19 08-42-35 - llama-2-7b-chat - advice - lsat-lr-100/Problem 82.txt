Context: Patricia: During Japan's Tokugawa period, martial arts experts known as ninjas were trained for the purposes of espionage and assassination. Yet at that time there was actually very little ninja activity in Japan, and most Japanese did not fear ninjas. Tamara: That is not true. Many wealthy Japanese during the Tokugawa period had their houses constructed with intentionally squeaky floors so that they would receive warning if a ninja were in the house.
Question: Of the following, which one, if true, is the strongest counter Patricia can make to Tamara's objection?
Choices:
  A: Many poor Japanese during the Tokugawa period also had houses constructed with intentionally squeaky floors.
  B: As part of their secret training, ninjas learned to walk on squeaky floors without making a sound.
  C: The wealthy made up a small portion of Japan's population during the Tokugawa period.
  D: The fighting prowess of ninjas was exaggerated to mythic proportions in the years following the Tokngawa period.
  E: There were very few ninjas at any time other than during the Tokugawa period.

Question: Of the following, which one, if true, is the strongest counter Patricia can make to Tamara's objection?

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand the mistake. Here is my reflection on the problem and the correct answer:

Problem: Patricia claims that there was little to no ninja activity in Japan during the Tokugawa period, while Tamara argues that many wealthy Japanese had their houses constructed with intentionally squeaky floors to detect ninjas. To counter Tamara's objection, I need to find the most convincing argument.

Option A: Many poor Japanese during the Tokugawa period also had houses constructed with intentionally squeaky floors.

Reflection: While this option may seem counterintuitive, it is actually a strong counterargument to Tamara's objection. If many poor Japanese also had squeaky floors, it suggests that the fear of ninjas was not limited to the wealthy. This undermines Tamara's claim that the wealthy were the only ones who feared ninjas.

Option B: As part of their secret training, ninjas learned to walk on squeaky floors without making a sound.

Reflection: This option is not a strong counterargument. While it is true that ninjas were trained to move silently, it does not address the fact that there was little to no ninja activity in Japan during the Tokugawa period.

Option C: The wealthy made up a small portion of Japan's population during the Tokugawa period.

Reflection: This option is irrelevant to the argument. The fact that the wealthy made up a small portion of the population does not affect the likelihood of ninjas being present in Japan during the Tokugawa period.

Option D: The fighting prowess of ninjas was exaggerated to mythic proportions in the years following the Tokugawa period.

Reflection: This option is also irrelevant to the argument. While it is true that the mythology surrounding ninjas has evolved over time, it does not change the fact that there was little to no ninja activity in Japan during the Tokugawa period.

Option E: There were very few ninjas at any time other than during the Tokugawa period.

Reflection: This option is incorrect. While it is true that the number of ninjas may have been small during the Tokugawa period, there is evidence to suggest that they existed in Japan as early as the 14th century and continued to exist until the Meiji period.

Conclusion:
The strongest counterargument to Tamara's objection is Option A: Many poor Japanese during the Tokugawa period also had houses constructed with intentionally squeaky floors. This undermines Tamara's claim that the fear of ninjas was limited to the wealthy and suggests that the fear of ninjas was more widespread in Japanese society during the Tokugawa period.
