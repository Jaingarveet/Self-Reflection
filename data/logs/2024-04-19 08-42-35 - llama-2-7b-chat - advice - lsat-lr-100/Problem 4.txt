Topic: Law
Context: A film makes a profit if the number of people who see it is sufficient to generate revenues from ticket sales greater than the amount spent to make it. Hence, the primary goal of movie executives is to maximize the number of people who see a film. However, it is not the primary goal of television executives to maximize the number of viewers for their shows.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain the difference between the goals of movie executives and those of television executives?
Choices:
  A: More people are willing to see a film more than once than are willing to watch a television show more than once.
  B: There is no analog in television to the large profits that owners of movie theaters make by selling refreshments to their customers.
  C: The average cost of producing an hour of film is much greater than the average cost of producing an hour of television.
  D: Television shows make their profits from sponsors, who are chiefly concerned with the purchasing power of the people who watch a television show.
  E: Over half of the most popular television shows are shows that viewers do not have to pay to watch.

## Assistant 2:
  Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, selecting choice (A) as the correct answer. However, upon further reflection, I realize that the correct answer is choice (D).

The correct answer is (D) because television shows make their profits from sponsors, who are chiefly concerned with the purchasing power of the people who watch a television show. This means that television executives are more focused on attracting a large audience to generate revenue from sponsorships, rather than maximizing the number of viewers for their shows.

In contrast, movie executives are more focused on maximizing the number of people who see a film, as they generate revenue primarily through ticket sales. The cost of producing a film is typically higher than a television show, so movie executives need to recoup these costs through ticket sales.

Therefore, the difference in goals between movie and television executives can be attributed to the different revenue streams and production costs associated with each industry.

Answer: (D) Television shows make their profits from sponsors, who are chiefly concerned with the purchasing power of the people who watch a television show.
