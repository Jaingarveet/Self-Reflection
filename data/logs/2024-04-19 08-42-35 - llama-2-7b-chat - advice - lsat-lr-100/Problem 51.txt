Topic: Law
Context: Political scientist: People become unenthusiastic about voting if they believe that important problems can be addressed only by large numbers of people drastically changing their attitudes and that such attitudinal changes generally do not result from government action. The decreasing voter turnout is thus entirely due to a growing conviction that politicians cannot solve the most important problems.
Question: The reasoning in the political scientist's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that the argument
Choices:
  A: presumes, without providing justification, that there is no cause of decreasing voter turnout other than the belief that few important problems can be solved by government action
  B: presumes, without providing justification, that there are no political solutions to the most important problems
  C: infers that important problems can be seriously addressed if people's attitudes do change from the premise that these problems cannot be addressed if people's attitudes do not change
  D: undermines its claim that people no longer believe there are political solutions to important problems by suggesting that people are dissatisfied with politicians
  E: presumes, without providing justification, that voter apathy prevents the attitudinal changes that result in finding solutions to important problems
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Advice:
When analyzing arguments, it is important to identify the assumptions and inferences made, and to evaluate whether they are supported by evidence and reasoning. In this case, the argument relies on an unjustified inference, and therefore is vulnerable to criticism.

In general, it is important to consider alternative explanations and to evaluate arguments based on their logical coherence and evidence support. By doing so, you can develop a more nuanced understanding of the issue and make more informed judgments.
## Assistant 2:
  Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, selecting choice A, which presumes without justification that there is no cause of decreasing voter turnout other than the belief that few important problems can be solved by government action. However, upon further reflection, I realize that this argument is vulnerable to criticism because it relies on an unjustified inference. The argument infers that important problems can be seriously addressed if people's attitudes do change, but it does not provide any evidence to support this claim. Therefore, the correct answer is choice C, which infers that important problems can be seriously addressed if people's attitudes do change.

In general, it is important to consider alternative explanations and to evaluate arguments based on their logical coherence and evidence support. By doing so, one can develop a more nuanced understanding of the issue and make more informed judgments.
