Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand now that the correct answer is (D) It is not possible to raise cacti in the country.

Explanation:
The statements provided in the passage indicate that it is difficult to grow cacti in a humid climate and orange trees in a cold climate. Therefore, if most parts of a certain country are either easy to grow cacti or easy to raise orange trees, then it must be the case that the country is not suitable for growing cacti.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The passage states that it is difficult to grow cacti in a humid climate.
2. The passage also states that it is difficult to raise orange trees in a cold climate.
3. Most parts of the country are either easy to grow cacti or easy to raise orange trees.
4. Therefore, it must be the case that the country is not suitable for growing cacti.

Conclusion:
The correct answer is (D) It is not possible to raise cacti in the country.
