## Assistant 2:
  Topic: Law
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument?

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and after reflecting on the problem, my solution, and the correct answer, I realized that the correct answer is (E) Community officials have shown that a relatively small number of repeat offenders commit the majority of violent crimes in the town.

Explanation:
The argument that violent crime in the town is becoming a serious problem is based on the fact that local law enforcement agencies have responded to 17 percent more calls involving violent crimes compared to last year. However, if community officials have shown that a relatively small number of repeat offenders commit the majority of violent crimes in the town, this weakens the argument because it suggests that the increase in violent crime may not be as significant as initially thought.

Therefore, the correct answer is (E) Community officials have shown that a relatively small number of repeat offenders commit the majority of violent crimes in the town.
