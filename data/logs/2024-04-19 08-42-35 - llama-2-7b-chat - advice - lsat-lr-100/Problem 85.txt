Context: Ditalgame Corporation's computer video games are subject to widespread illegal copying. To combat this piracy, Ditalgame will begin using a new copy protection feature on its games.

## Assistant 2:
  Topic: Law
Question: Which one of the following, if true, provides the most support for the president's prediction?

Reflection:
Initial Answer: I previously answered this question incorrectly. I selected choice (C) as the correct answer.

However, upon further reflection, I realize that choice (A) provides the most support for the president's prediction. The fact that Ditalgame has spent millions of dollars developing the new copy protection feature means that the company has a significant investment in the feature. If the feature is effective in combating piracy, it is likely that Ditalgame will see a substantial increase in sales, which would help to recoup the costs of developing the feature.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A): Ditalgame has spent millions of dollars developing the new copy protection feature, and the company can recoup these costs only if its sales increase substantially.
