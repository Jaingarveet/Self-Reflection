Topic: Law
Context: Museum curakor: Our ancient Egyptian collection includes an earthenware hippopotamus that resembles a child's roy. It was discovered in a tomb, upside down, with its legs broken off. We know that the ancient Egyptians believed the dead had to wage eternal war with beasts. Breaking the legs off a representation of an animal was thought to help a deceased person in this war. We conclude that, far from being a roy, this hippopotamus was a religious object.
Question: Which one of the following is an assumption required by the curator's argument?
Choices:
  A: The tomb in which the hippopotamus was found was not the tomb of a child.
  B: Earthenware figures were never used as children's roys in ancient Egypt.
  C: The tomb in which the hippopotamus was found was not reentered from the time of burial until archaeologists opened it.
  D: The hippopotamus' legs were not broken 1hrough some natural occurrence after it was placed in the tomb.
  E: The hippopotamus was originally placed upside down in the tomb.

Question: Which one of the following is an assumption required by the curator's argument?

Reflection:

Initial Answer: B: Earthenware figures were never used as children's roys in ancient Egypt.

Explanation: The curator's argument suggests that the hippopotamus was a religious object, rather than a children's toy, based on the fact that it was found in a tomb upside down with its legs broken off. The argument implies that the broken legs were intended to help the deceased person in the afterlife. However, if earthenware figures were never used as children's toys in ancient Egypt, then it is unlikely that the hippopotamus was intended as a children's toy, and it may have been a religious object instead.

Redaction: [REDACTED]

New Answer: C: The tomb in which the hippopotamus was found was not reentered from the time of burial until archaeologists opened it.

Explanation: The curator's argument relies on the assumption that the tomb in which the hippopotamus was found was not reentered until archaeologists opened it. If the tomb had been reentered at any point after the hippopotamus was placed there, it could have been disturbed or damaged, which would have called into question the curator's interpretation of the hippopotamus' significance. However, since the tomb was not reentered until archaeologists opened it, the curator's argument is more likely to be correct.

Redaction: [REDACTED]

Final Answer: C: The tomb in which the hippopotamus was found was not reentered from the time of burial until archaeologists opened it.
