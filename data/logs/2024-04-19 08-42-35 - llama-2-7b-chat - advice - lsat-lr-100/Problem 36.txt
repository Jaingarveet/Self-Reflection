Context: Native speakers perceive sentences of their own language as sequences of separate words. But this perception is an illusion. This is shown by the fact that travelers who do not know a local language hear an unintelligible, uninterrupted stream of sound, not sentences with distinct words.
Question: Which one of the following is an assumption on which the argument depends?
Choices:
  A: It is impossible to understand sentences if they are in fact uninterrupted streams of sound.
  B: Those who do not know a language cannot hear the way speech in that language actually sounds.
  C: People pay less close attention to the way their own language sounds than they do to the way an unfamiliar language sounds.
  D: Accomplished non-native speakers of a language do not perceive sentences as streams of sound.
  E: Native speakers' perceptions of their own language are not more accurate than are the perceptions of persons who do not know that language.

## Assistant 2:
  Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and after reevaluating the problem, I realized that the argument depends on the assumption that "travelers who do not know a local language hear an unintelligible, uninterrupted stream of sound, not sentences with distinct words."

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) Those who do not know a language cannot hear the way speech in that language actually sounds.

Explanation:
The argument states that native speakers perceive sentences of their own language as sequences of separate words, but this perception is an illusion. However, travelers who do not know the local language hear an unintelligible, uninterrupted stream of sound, not sentences with distinct words. This implies that the way speech sounds in a language is not perceivable to those who do not know the language. Therefore, the assumption on which the argument depends is that those who do not know a language cannot hear the way speech in that language actually sounds.
