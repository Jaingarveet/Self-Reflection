## User 2:
Topic: Law
Context: Rossi: It is undemocratic for people to live under a government in which their interests are not represented. So children should have the right to vote, since sometimes the interests of children are different from those of their parents. Smith: Granted, children's interests are not always the same as their parents'; governmental deficits incurred by their parents' generation will later affect their own generation's standard of living. But even if children are told about the issues affecting them, which is not generally the case, their conceptions of what can or should be done are too simple, and their time horizons are radically different from those of adults, so we cannot give them the responsibility of voting.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes Rossi's argument?
Choices:
  A: It makes an appeal to a general principle.
  B: It denies the good faith of an opponent.
  C: It relies on evaluating the predictable consequences of a proposal.
  D: It substitutes description for giving a rationale for a policy.
  E: It employs a term on two different occasions in different senses.

Reflection:

Initial Answer: D

After reflecting on the problem, my solution, and the correct answer, I realize that my initial answer was incorrect. The correct answer is:

C: It relies on evaluating the predictable consequences of a proposal.

Rossi's argument is based on the idea that children's interests are not always the same as those of their parents, and that they have a different time horizon and perspective. He argues that it is undemocratic for children to live under a government that does not represent their interests, and that they should have the right to vote to ensure that their interests are represented. However, he also acknowledges that children's conceptions of what can or should be done are too simple, and that their time horizons are radically different from those of adults. Therefore, he does not think that children should be given the responsibility of voting.

The correct answer, C, reflects Rossi's argument that he is evaluating the predictable consequences of a proposal (giving children the right to vote) and finding that it is not feasible or appropriate.
