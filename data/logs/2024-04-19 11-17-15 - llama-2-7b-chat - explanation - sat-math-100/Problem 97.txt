## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: $$h(x)=2^{x}$$The function $h$ is defined above. What is $h(5)-h(3) ?$
Choices:
  A: 2
  B: 4
  C: 24
  D: 28
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I understand now that the function $h(x) = [REDACTED]^x$ means that $h(x)$ is equal to $[REDACTED]$ raised to the power of $x$. To find $h(5)-h(3)$, I evaluated $h(5)$ and $h(3)$ and then subtracted their values:

$h(5) = [REDACTED]^5 = 3[REDACTED]$

$h(3) = [REDACTED]^3 = 8$

$h(5) - h(3) = 3[REDACTED] - 8 = [REDACTED][REDACTED]$

Action: Answer("[REDACTED]")

I hope this updated response meets your requirements. Please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns.
