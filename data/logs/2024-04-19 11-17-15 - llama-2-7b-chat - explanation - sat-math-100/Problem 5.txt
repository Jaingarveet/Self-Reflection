## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

## Assistant 2:
  Thought:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and upon reflection, I realized that I made a mistake in my calculation. I need to use the correct equation to solve for the number of states that joined between 1850 and 1900.

Action:
I will use the equation $2x = 30$, where $x$ is the number of states that joined between 1850 and 1900.

Reflection:
I correctly identified the equation that is true based on the given information. I made a mistake in my initial calculation, but I was able to reflect on my error and correct it.

Answer:
The correct answer is (B) $2x = 30$.
## Result:
Agent Answer: None
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
