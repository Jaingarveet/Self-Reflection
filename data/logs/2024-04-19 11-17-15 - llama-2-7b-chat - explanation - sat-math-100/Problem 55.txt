Explanation:

The equation $y = - (x - 3)^2 + a$ is a parabola, and we need to determine the minimum or maximum value of the parabola. To do this, we find the stationary points of the function, which are the points where the derivative of the function is equal to zero.

The derivative of the function is:

$$\frac{dy}{dx} = -4x + 2a$$

Solving for $x$, we get:

$$x = -4a/3$$

Now, we need to determine the minimum or maximum value of the parabola. If the stationary point is a minimum, then the value of $y$ is a minimum, and if it's a maximum, then the value of $y$ is a maximum. In this case, the stationary point is a minimum, so the minimum value of the parabola is:

$$y = - (x - 3)^2 + a = - (x - 3)^2 \times min(a)$$

Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("[REDACTED]: Its minimum occurs at $(-3, a)$")

Correct Answer: D
