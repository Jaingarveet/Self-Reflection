## Assistant 2:
  Thought: I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I am now reflecting on my solution and the correct answer.

Action: I will use my self-reflection to help me answer the question.

Value of $g(-4)$:

I previously answered $g(-4) = 8$, but I realize now that this is incorrect.

Using the given function $g(x) = a x^2 + 24$, we can find the value of $g(-4)$ by substituting $-4$ for $x$.

$g(-4) = a (-4)^2 + 24 = a 16 + 24 = a 40$

Therefore, the value of $g(-4)$ is $40$.

Answer: $D: -8$
