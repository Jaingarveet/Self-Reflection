## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: A line in the $x y$-plane passes through the origin and has a slope of $\frac{1}{7}$. Which of the following points lies on the line?
Choices:
  A: $(0,7)$
  B: $(1,7)$
  C: $(7,7)$
  D: $(14,2)$
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I made a mistake in my reasoning and answered incorrectly.

The correct answer is (D) [REDACTED].

Here's why:

The line passes through the origin, so one of the points must be the origin. The slope of the line is $\frac{1}{7}$, which means that for every $1$ unit of $x$, the line moves $7$ units to the right.

So, if the line passes through the origin, it must also pass through the point [REDACTED], since $14$ units to the right of the origin is $2$ units above the origin.
