## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Explanation:
I made a mistake in my solution to the problem. I crossed-multiplied the equation incorrectly, which led to an incorrect calculation.
## Assistant 2:
  Thought: 
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand the mistake I made. I crossed-multiplied the equation incorrectly, which led to an incorrect calculation.

Action:
To solve this problem correctly, I will use the correct method of cross-multiplying.

Value of $w$:

$$\frac{3}{5}w = \frac{4}{3}$$

Cross-multiplying:

$$3w = 4$$

Divide both sides by $3$:

$$w = 4/3$$

Answer: $w = \frac{4}{3}$

Reflection:
I reflected on my previous mistake and corrected it by using the correct method of cross-multiplying. I understand the importance of accuracy and attention to detail in solving mathematical problems.
## Result:
Agent Answer: None
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
