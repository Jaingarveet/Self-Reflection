Question: \begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}\cline { 2 - 3 }\multicolumn{1}{c|}{} & \multicolumn{2}{c|}{Handedness} \\\hlineGender & Left & Right \\\hline\hlineFemale &  &  \\\hlineMale &  &  \\\hline\hlineTotal & 18 & 122 \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}The incomplete table above summarizes the number of left-handed students and right-handed students by gender for the eighth-grade students atKeisel Middle School. There are 5 times as many right-handed female students as there are left-handed female students, and there are 9 times as many right-handed male students as there are left-handed male students. If there is a total of 18 left-handed students and 122 right-handed students in the school, which of the following is closest to the probability that a right-handed student selected at random is female? (Note: Assume that none of the eighth-grade students are both right-handed and left-handed.)
