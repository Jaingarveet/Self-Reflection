Explanation:

To find the sum of $(7+3i) + (-8+9i)$, we need to first simplify the expressions inside the parentheses.

$7+3i = 7 + 3(i/\sqrt{-1}) = 7 + 3i\sqrt{-1}$

$(-8+9i) = (-8 - 9i)/\sqrt{-1} = (-8 - 9i)\sqrt{-1}$

Now, we can add the two expressions:

$= 7 + 3i\sqrt{-1} + (-8 - 9i)\sqrt{-1}$

$= 7 + 3i\sqrt{-1} - 8\sqrt{-1} - 9i\sqrt{-1}$

$= 7 + 3i\sqrt{-1} - 17\sqrt{-1}$

As you can see, the correct answer is option [REDACTED]: $-1+12i$.
## Assistant 2:
  Reflection:

I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand now that the sum of $(7+3i) + (-8+9i)$ is actually $7 + 3i\sqrt{-1} - 8\sqrt{-1} - 9i\sqrt{-1} = -1 + 12i$.

To arrive at this answer, I simplified the expressions inside the parentheses by factoring out the square root of -1:

$7+3i = 7 + 3(i/\sqrt{-1}) = 7 + 3i\sqrt{-1}$

$(-8+9i) = (-8 - 9i)/\sqrt{-1} = (-8 - 9i)\sqrt{-1}$

Then, I added the two expressions:

$= 7 + 3i\sqrt{-1} + (-8 - 9i)\sqrt{-1}$

$= 7 + 3i\sqrt{-1} - 8\sqrt{-1} - 9i\sqrt{-1}$

$= 7 + 3i\sqrt{-1} - 17\sqrt{-1}$

Therefore, the correct answer is option [REDACTED]: $-1+12i$.

I will make sure to be more careful and thorough in my calculations in the future. Thank you for providing this opportunity for self-reflection and improvement.
