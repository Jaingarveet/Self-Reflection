Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I made a mistake in my answer by selecting option [REDACTED], which is not equivalent to $9^{\frac{3}{4}}$.

The correct answer is option [REDACTED], [REDACTED].

Here's why:

$9^{\frac{3}{4}} = 9 \times \sqrt[4]{9} = 9 \times \sqrt{3} \times 3 = 3 \sqrt{3}$

So, the equivalent of $9^{\frac{3}{4}}$ is [REDACTED].
## Assistant 2:
