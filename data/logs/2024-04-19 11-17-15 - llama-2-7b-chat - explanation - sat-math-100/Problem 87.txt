## Assistant 2:
  Thought:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand the mistake. The parabola intersects the line at two points, $A$ and $B$, and the length of $\overline{A B}$ is the distance between these two points.

Action:
I will use the correct equation of the parabola and the line to find the length of $\overline{A B}$.

$$y = (x-11)^2$$
$$y = 25$$

Solving for $x$, we get:

$$x = \frac{y + 11}{2}$$

Substituting $y = 25$, we get:

$$x = \frac{25 + 11}{2} = 14$$

Now, we need to find the distance between $A$ and $B$. Let's assume that $A$ is at $x = a$ and $B$ is at $x = b$.

$$\overline{A B} = \sqrt{(b-a)^2}$$

Since we are given that $A$ and $B$ are the points of intersection of the parabola and the line, we can set up the equation:

$$\frac{y - (x-11)^2}{2} = 0$$

Solving for $x$, we get:

$$x = 11 + \sqrt{16 - (y/2)^2}$$

Substituting $y = 25$, we get:

$$x = 11 + \sqrt{16 - (25/2)^2} = 14$$

Therefore, the length of $\overline{A B}$ is $2 \times \sqrt{16 - (25/2)^2} = 14$.

Answer: $B$

Explanation:

The length of $\overline{A B}$ is the distance between the two points $A$ and $B$, which we have just calculated to be $14$. Therefore, the correct answer is $B$.
