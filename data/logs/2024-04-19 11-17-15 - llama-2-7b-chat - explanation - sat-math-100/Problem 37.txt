## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: The volume of right circular cylinder A is 22 cubic centimeters. What is the volume, in cubic centimeters, of a right circular cylinder with twice the radius and half the height of cylinder A?

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly. My solution was:

V = πr^2h

Where r is the radius of the cylinder A, and h is the height of the cylinder A.

However, I made an error in my calculation. I multiplied the radius of cylinder A by 2, which gave me a radius of 4 for the new cylinder. But, I should have multiplied the radius by 4 to get the correct radius of 8.

So, the correct calculation for the volume of the new cylinder is:

V = π(8)^2h = 64πh

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 22 cubic centimeters.
