Topic: Logic
Context: Right and wrong and whether they violate the rules are two things.There may be regulations that prohibit things that are not wrong in themselves, such as laws in certain countries that prohibit criticism of the government; there may also be regulations that require things that are inherently wrong, such as laws that require apartheid in public places.And, like evaluating behavior, we can also evaluate some of the prescribed right and wrong.
Question: Which of the following does not weaken, but supports the argument in the question stem?
Choices:
  A: If we do not follow some pre-existing regulations or standards, how can we judge right and wrong?
  B: "People are doing, heaven is watching." Failure to act in accordance with ethical regulations will incur punishment from heaven.
  C: Behind the judgment of right and wrong, you can always find the rules or standards on which people judge.
  D: The basis for judgment of right and wrong lies in pushing oneself and one's moral conscience.It is common and universal; however, the moral regulations on how to act for people vary from person to person and from place to place.

Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I misunderstood the argument in the question stem. I thought the argument was that regulations are necessary to judge right and wrong, but the argument was actually that right and wrong and whether they violate the rules are two different things.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The argument in the question stem states that right and wrong and whether they violate the rules are two different things. Therefore, the correct answer should support this argument by showing that there are rules or standards that are separate from right and wrong.

Choice A weakens the argument by suggesting that regulations are necessary to judge right and wrong.
Choice B weakens the argument by suggesting that ethical regulations are the same as right and wrong.
Choice C supports the argument by stating that there are always rules or standards behind the judgment of right and wrong.
Choice D weakens the argument by suggesting that moral conscience is the basis for judging right and wrong, rather than rules or standards.

Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: D
