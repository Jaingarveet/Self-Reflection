Let's analyze the information given step-by-step:

1. Fuyi Station is east of Haoyun Station and west of Huyao Station, and is adjacent to Huyao Station.
2. Jiushang Station is adjacent to Yinling Station.
3. Jiushang Station is adjacent to Haoyun Station and east of Haoyun Station.

From points 1 and 3, we can deduce that the order of the stations from west to east is Haoyun, Jiushang, Fuyi, and Huyao.

Now let's analyze the answer choices:

A: Hu Yao is standing on the east side - This is true, as Huyao is the easternmost station in the order.
B: Fuyi is standing in the west - This is false, as Fuyi is not the westernmost station in the order.
C: Yinling is standing on the east side - This cannot be determined, as we don't have enough information about Yinling's position relative to the other stations.
D: Leek standing on the west side - This cannot be determined, as there is no information about a station called "Leek."

Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
