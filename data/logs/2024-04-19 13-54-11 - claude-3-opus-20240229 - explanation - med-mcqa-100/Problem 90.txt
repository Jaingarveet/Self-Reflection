## System:
You are an expert in Medicine.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Question: At 34 weeks multigravida with previous 2 normal delivery has an unstable lie with the present pregnancy. It can be due to:
Choices:
  A: Oligohydramnios
  B: Placenta pre
  C: Pelvic tumor
  D: Uterine anomalies

Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that all the listed choices could cause an unstable lie at 34 weeks in a multigravida. While oligohydramnios, pelvic tumors, and uterine anomalies can contribute to an unstable lie, placenta previa is the most likely cause among the given options. I failed to prioritize the most probable cause based on the clinical scenario.
## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
The question is asking about the most likely cause of an unstable lie at 34 weeks in a multigravida (woman who has been pregnant more than once) with two previous normal deliveries.
Key points:
- 34 weeks gestation (late third trimester)
- Multigravida with history of normal deliveries
- Unstable lie (fetal position keeps changing)
Considering the choices:
A. Oligohydramnios: Low amniotic fluid can allow more room for fetal movement, but is less likely the primary cause here.
B. Placenta previa: A low-lying placenta can prevent the fetus from engaging in the pelvis, leading to unstable lie. This is a probable cause, especially in late pregnancy.
C. Pelvic tumor: While a large pelvic mass could displace the fetus, it's less common than placenta previa and would likely have been noted earlier in pregnancy.
D. Uterine anomalies: Mullerian anomalies can cause unstable lie, but are unlikely given her history of two normal deliveries.
Upon reflection, placenta previa is the most probable cause among these choices in this clinical scenario of a late third trimester unstable lie in a multigravida.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
