## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The total cost of the gift is Rs. D and initially, it was to be divided among M men. So, each man was to contribute D/M. 
When 3 men drop out, the cost is to be divided among (M-3) men. So, each man will now have to contribute D/(M-3). 
The increase in the amount each man has to contribute is D/(M-3) - D/M. 
Action: Answer("E")
## Result:
Agent Answer: E
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
