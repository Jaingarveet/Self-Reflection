## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The difference between 7/8 and 7/18 of a number is 770. 
So, (7/8 - 7/18) * number = 770
Solving this equation will give us the number.
Action: 
First, find the common denominator for 8 and 18, which is 72. 
So, (63/72 - 28/72) * number = 770
Then, (35/72) * number = 770
So, number = 770 * 72 / 35
Solving this will give us the number.
Answer: 
The number is 1584. So, the answer is "A".
## Result:
Agent Answer: None
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
