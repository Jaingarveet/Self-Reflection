## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The ages are in an arithmetic progression (A.P.) with a common difference of 3 months or 0.25 years. The youngest member is 7 years old. The sum of the ages is 250 years. 
We can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: S = n/2 * (a + l), where S is the sum of the series, n is the number of terms, a is the first term, and l is the last term.
We know S (250 years), a (7 years), and d (0.25 years), but we don't know n or l. However, we can express l in terms of n and d: l = a + (n-1)*d.
Substituting l into the sum formula gives: 250 = n/2 * (7 + 7 + (n-1)*0.25), which simplifies to 250 = n/2 * (14 + 0.25n - 0.25).
Solving this equation for n gives the number of members in the club.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
