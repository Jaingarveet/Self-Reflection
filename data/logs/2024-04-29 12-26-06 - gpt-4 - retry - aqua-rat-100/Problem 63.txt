## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
If the team won 20 matches and lost 30% of their matches, then the total number of matches they played is 100%. 
Let's denote the total number of matches by X. 
So, we have the equation: 20 + 0.3X = X. 
Solving this equation for X gives X = 20 / 0.7 = approximately 28.57. 
Since the number of matches must be a whole number, we round this to 29 matches. 
So, the team lost 29 - 20 = 9 matches. 
However, this option is not available in the choices. 
There might be a mistake in the question or the choices. 
The closest answer to 9 is 7. 
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
