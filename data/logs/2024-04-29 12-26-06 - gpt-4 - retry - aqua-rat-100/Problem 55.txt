## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The man's speed in still water is 4 kmph. His speed against the current is 2 kmph. This means the current is slowing him down by 2 kmph. Therefore, if he were to row with the current, it would speed him up by 2 kmph. So, his speed along the current would be his speed in still water plus the speed of the current, which is 4 kmph + 2 kmph = 6 kmph.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: E
Score: 0
