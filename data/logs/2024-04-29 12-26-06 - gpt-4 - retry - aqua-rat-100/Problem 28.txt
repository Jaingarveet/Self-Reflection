## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

  A: 0.22
  B: 0.26
  C: 0.37

## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The probability that Stock A will not increase is 1 - 0.56 = 0.44.
The probability that Stock B will not increase is 1 - 0.74 = 0.26.
The greatest value for the probability that neither of these two events will occur is the product of these two probabilities, which is 0.44 * 0.26 = 0.1144.
However, the choices do not include this value. The closest value to this is 0.22.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
