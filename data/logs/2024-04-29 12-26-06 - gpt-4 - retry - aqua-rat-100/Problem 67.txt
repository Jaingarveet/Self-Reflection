## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Let's denote the amount of falafel in one pita bread as P, in one roll as R, and in one baguette as B. From the problem, we have the following equations:
6P = 2R (1)
3R = 5B (2)
We need to find the amount of falafel in two baguettes in terms of pita breads, i.e., we need to find 2B in terms of P.
First, we can express R in terms of P from equation (1): R = 3P.
Substitute R = 3P into equation (2), we get 3*3P = 5B, or 9P = 5B, or B = 9P/5.
So, 2B = 2*9P/5 = 18P/5 = 3.6P.
So, two baguettes contain the same amount of falafel as 3.6 pita breads do. But this is not one of the choices. Let's check if we made a mistake.
From equation (1), we have R = 3P.
From equation (2), we have B = 3R/5 = 3*3P/5 = 9P/5.
So, 2B = 2*9P/5 = 18P/5 = 3.6P.
So, we didn't make a mistake in our calculations. The problem might be in the choices. Let's check them.
A: 12/25 = 0.48
B: 3/2 = 1.5
C: 3
D: 2
E: 25/3 = 8.33
None of these choices is equal to 3.6. So, there seems to be a mistake in the problem or in the choices. But since we have to choose one of the given choices, let's choose the one that is closest to our answer, which is 3.6. The closest choice is C: 3.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
