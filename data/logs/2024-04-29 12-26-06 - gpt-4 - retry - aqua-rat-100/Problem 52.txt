Question: X and Y are two alloys which were made by mixing zinc and copper in the ratio 6:9 and 7:11, respectively. If 40 grams of alloy X and 60 grams of alloy Y are melted and mixed to form alloy Z, what is the ratio of zinc and copper in the alloy Z ?
Choices:
  A: 69:91
  B: 59:91
  C: 59:90
  D: 59:91
  E: 69:101

Thought: 
First, we need to find the amount of zinc and copper in each alloy. 
For alloy X, the total ratio is 6+9 = 15. So, the amount of zinc is (6/15)*40 = 16 grams and the amount of copper is (9/15)*40 = 24 grams.
For alloy Y, the total ratio is 7+11 = 18. So, the amount of zinc is (7/18)*60 = 23.33 grams and the amount of copper is (11/18)*60 = 36.67 grams.
Then, we add the amounts of zinc and copper from both alloys to get the total amount in alloy Z. The total amount of zinc is 16 + 23.33 = 39.33 grams and the total amount of copper is 24 + 36.67 = 60.67 grams.
Finally, we find the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z by dividing the total amount of each by their greatest common divisor. The greatest common divisor of 39.33 and 60.67 is approximately 1, so the ratio is approximately 39.33:60.67. 
However, the choices are given in whole numbers, so we need to round the ratio to the nearest whole number. The closest ratio to 39.33:60.67 is 39:61, but this is not one of the choices. The closest choice to this ratio is 59:91.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
