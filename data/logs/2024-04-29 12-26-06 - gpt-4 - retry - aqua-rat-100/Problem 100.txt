## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The area of a rectangle is given by the formula length * breadth = area. 
Given that the area is 150 sq m and the length is 1m more than 4 times the breadth, we can set up the equation as follows: 
breadth * (4*breadth + 1) = 150.
Solving this quadratic equation for breadth, we get breadth = 5m.
Substituting breadth = 5m into the equation for length, we get length = 4*5 + 1 = 21m.
The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula 2*(length + breadth).
Substituting length = 21m and breadth = 5m into the equation for perimeter, we get perimeter = 2*(21 + 5) = 52m.
Action: Answer("A")

Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: C
