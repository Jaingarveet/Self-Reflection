## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Consecutive odd numbers have a difference of 2 between each number. If we take the middle number as x, the five numbers will be x-4, x-2, x, x+2, x+4. The sum of these numbers is 5x. This sum divided by 10 should be a perfect square, so 5x/10 = x/2 should be a perfect square. This means x should be an even number. Among the choices, only 44 is an even number. But 44 is not an odd number, so it can't be the answer. So, we need to check each option one by one.
Let's start with option A: 47. The five consecutive odd numbers would be 43, 45, 47, 49, 51. Their sum is 235, which divided by 10 is 23.5, not a perfect square.
Option B: 91. The five consecutive odd numbers would be 87, 89, 91, 93, 95. Their sum is 455, which divided by 10 is 45.5, not a perfect square.
Option C: 41. The five consecutive odd numbers would be 37, 39, 41, 43, 45. Their sum is 205, which divided by 10 is 20.5, not a perfect square.
Option D: 67. The five consecutive odd numbers would be 63, 65, 67, 69, 71. Their sum is 335, which divided by 10 is 33.5, not a perfect square.
None of the options form a perfect square when the sum of the five consecutive odd numbers is divided by 10. There seems to be a mistake in the question or the options provided.
Action: Answer("E")
