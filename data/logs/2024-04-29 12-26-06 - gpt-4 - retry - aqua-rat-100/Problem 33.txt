## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The area of the square is side^2 = 20^2 = 400 cm^2.
The diameter of each semicircle is 20 cm, so the radius is 10 cm.
The area of a full circle is πr^2, so the area of a semicircle is 1/2 * πr^2.
The area of two semicircles (which is a full circle) is π * 10^2 = 100π cm^2.
The area of the remaining paper is the area of the square minus the area of the full circle, which is 400 - 100π cm^2.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
