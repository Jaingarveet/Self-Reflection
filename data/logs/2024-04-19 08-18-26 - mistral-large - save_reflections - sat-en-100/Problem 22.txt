# Model: mistral-large | Task: save_reflection | Exam: sat-en-100 | Problem 22 of 100
## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misinterpreted the question and did not carefully read the choices provided. I focused on finding the percentages of adenine and thymine, and guanine and cytosine, but the choices provided were not related to these pairs.

Error Keywords:

* Misinterpretation of the question
* Lack of careful reading of the choices

Solution:
To solve the problem again, I will first carefully read the question and the choices provided. The question asks for the pair of base percentages in sea urchin DNA that provides evidence in support of the answer to the previous question, which was about base pairing in DNA. The choices provided are pairs of percentages, not the actual bases themselves.

Looking at the table, I can see that the percentage of guanine in sea urchin DNA is 17.7%, and the percentage of cytosine is 17.3%. These percentages match the percentages in choice A.

Instructions:

1. Carefully read the question and the choices provided.
2. Identify the relevant information in the question and the table.
3. Look for the pair of base percentages in the table that matches the choices provided.
4. Select the correct answer based on the information in the table and the choices provided.

Advice:

* Always carefully read the question and the choices provided.
* Make sure to understand what the question is asking before looking for the answer.
* Pay attention to the details in the question and the table.
* Double-check your answer to make sure it matches the information in the table and the choices provided.
