## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misinterpreted the passage. I focused on the fact that no crops were planted in the pilot experiments, but I failed to consider the effect that planting crops would have had on the weeds.
The gap in my knowledge was not in English but in my understanding of the passage.
I knew the correct information but misinterpreted its meaning.
Error Keywords:
 - Misinterpretation
 - Passage comprehension
 - Reading comprehension
Solution:
The passage suggests that planting crops would have reduced the percentage of the surface covered with weeds because the crops would have competed with the weeds for resources.
The passage states that no crops were planted in the pilot experiments to avoid possible competition with the emerging weeds.
Therefore, if Seydel had planted wheat or corn on the two agricultural strips in Hartmann's experiment, the percentage of the surface of each strip covered with weeds would likely have been lower than the percentage that Hartmann found.
Instructions:
1. Read the passage carefully and understand its meaning.
2. Identify the relevant information in the passage.
3. Consider the effect that planting crops would have had on the weeds.
4. Use your understanding of the passage to answer the question.
5. Double-check your answer to ensure accuracy.
Advice:
 - Always read the passage carefully and understand its meaning.
 - Always identify the relevant information in the passage.
 - Always consider the effect that different factors would have on the situation.
 - Never assume that the answer is obvious; always use the passage to support your answer.
