Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misinterpreted the table. I assumed that since each pathogen had 100% infection rate in colonies with colony collapse disorder, all four pathogens together would also have a 100% infection rate. However, the table does not provide information on the percentage of colonies infected by all four pathogens together.

Error Keywords:

* Misinterpretation of data
* Misunderstanding of table
* Assumption without evidence

Solution:
The table shows the percentage of colonies infected by each pathogen separately, not the percentage of colonies infected by all four pathogens together. Therefore, we cannot determine the percentage of colonies infected by all four pathogens based on the data provided in the table.

Instructions:

1. Read the question carefully and identify what information is being asked for.
2. Examine the table and identify the relevant data.
3. Interpret the data correctly, without making assumptions or drawing conclusions not supported by the data.
4. If the data does not provide the information needed to answer the question, indicate that the answer cannot be determined from the data provided.

Advice:

* Always read the question carefully and make sure you understand what information is being asked for.
* Examine the data provided carefully and make sure you interpret it correctly.
* Do not make assumptions or draw conclusions not supported by the data.
* If the data does not provide the information needed to answer the question, indicate that the answer cannot be determined from the data provided.

Topic: English
Question: What is the product of the number of letters contained in the name of the city where Iowa State University is located multiplied by the number of letters contained in the name of the state?
Choices:
A: 16
B: 20
C: 24
D: 32

Thought:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames, which has 4 letters. The state is Iowa, which also has 4 letters. Therefore, the product of the number of letters in the city and state names is 4 x 4 = 16.

---

Correct Answer: A

Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I made a calculation error. I multiplied the number of letters in the city and state names incorrectly.

Error Keywords:

* Calculation error
* Multiplication error

Solution:
The city name "Ames" contains 4 letters. The state name "Iowa" contains 4 letters. The product of 4 x 4 is 16.

Instructions:

1. Identify the city where the university is located.
2. Identify the state where the university is located.
3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.
4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.
5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.
6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.
7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.

Advice:

* Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
* Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
* Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
* Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
* Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
* Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them.
