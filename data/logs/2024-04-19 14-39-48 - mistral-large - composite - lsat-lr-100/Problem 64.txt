Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Topic: Law
Context: Studies have found that human tears contain many of the same hormones that the human body produces in times of emotional stress. Hence, shedding tears removes significant quantities of these hormones from the body. Therefore, crying must have the effect of reducing emotional stress.
Question: The reasoning in the argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that the argument
Choices:
  A: overlooks the possibility that if crying has a tendency to reduce emotional stress, this tendency might arise because of something other than the shedding of tears
  B: confuses a condition that is required for the production of a given phenomenon with a condition that in itself would be sufficient to cause the production of that phenomenon
  C: fails to adequately address the possibility that, even if one phenomenon causally contributes to a second phenomenon, the second phenomenon may causally influence the first as well
  D: fails to adequately distinguish between two distinct factors that are jointly responsible for causing a given phenomenon
  E: takes for granted that because certain substances are present whenever a condition occurs, those substances are a cause of that condition

You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I focused on the argument's assumption that crying reduces emotional stress, but I failed to identify the specific flaw in the argument's reasoning.
The gap in my knowledge was not in the subject matter but in the logical reasoning.
I knew the argument's assumption but did not correctly identify the flaw in the argument's reasoning.
Error Keywords:
 - Logical reasoning error
 - Assumption error
 - Causation error
Solution:
The argument assumes that the presence of hormones in tears is the cause of the reduction of emotional stress.
However, the argument does not provide evidence to support this assumption.
The argument takes for granted that because certain substances (hormones) are present whenever a condition (crying) occurs, those substances are a cause of that condition (reduction of emotional stress).
Instructions:
1. Identify the argument's assumption.
2. Identify the specific flaw in the argument's reasoning.
3. Evaluate the argument's evidence to support its assumption.
4. Determine whether the argument takes for granted that a correlation between two factors implies causation.
5. Choose the answer that matches the specific flaw in the argument's reasoning.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always identify the argument's assumption and the specific flaw in its reasoning.
 - Always evaluate the argument's evidence to support its assumption.
 - Always determine whether the argument takes for granted that a correlation between two factors implies causation.
 - Always choose the answer that matches the specific flaw in the argument's reasoning.
 - Remember that correlation does not imply causation.
