Context: A recent study shows that those highways that carry the most traffic, and thus tend to be the most congested, have the lowest rate of fatal traffic accidents.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain the phenomenon described above?
Choices:
  A: Drivers have more accidents when they become distracted.
  B: The highways that have the highest rate of fatal accidents have moderate volumes of traffic.
  C: Most of the motorists on very heavily traveled highways tend to be commuting to or from work.
  D: Most serious accidents occur when vehicles are moving at a high rate of speed.
  E: Heavily traveled highways do not always carry a higher proportion of large trucks.
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I did not consider the fact that high traffic volume can lead to slower speeds, which in turn can reduce the severity of accidents.
The gap in my knowledge was not in law but in traffic safety.
I failed to consider the relationship between traffic volume and speed.
Error Keywords:
 - Incorrect assumption
 - Lack of consideration
 - Traffic safety
Solution:
The question asks for an explanation of why highways with the most traffic have the lowest rate of fatal accidents.
Choice [REDACTED] is not relevant to the phenomenon described.
Choice [REDACTED] contradicts the information given in the question.
Choice [REDACTED] suggests that commuters may be more experienced drivers or that they drive more cautiously due to familiarity with the route, but it does not explain why heavily traveled highways have lower rates of fatal accidents.
Choice [REDACTED] suggests that high traffic volume can lead to slower speeds, which in turn can reduce the severity of accidents.
Choice [REDACTED] is not relevant to the phenomenon described.
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and identify the phenomenon that needs to be explained.
2. Consider the relationship between traffic volume and speed.
3. Evaluate each answer choice in light of this relationship.
4. Eliminate answer choices that are not relevant to the phenomenon described.
5. Choose the answer that best explains the phenomenon.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always consider the relationship between different factors.
 - Always evaluate each answer choice in light of this relationship.
 - Never make assumptions without considering all possible factors.
 - Always double-check your answer to ensure that it explains the phenomenon described.
