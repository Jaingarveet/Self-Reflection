Explanation:
I incorrectly focused on finding a choice that directly contradicted the experts' opinion about livestock trampling causing the salamander population decline. However, the question asked which choice would raise the most doubts about the experts' opinion in general, not just the specific livestock trampling hypothesis.
While choice C does seem to contradict the livestock trampling hypothesis, choice B actually raises more fundamental doubts about the experts' overall opinion. Decreased rainfall and falling groundwater levels affecting the salamanders' water source environment could be an alternative explanation for the population decline that the experts did not consider. This gap in their analysis raises doubts about the completeness and validity of their opinion.
Error Keywords:
 - Misinterpreting the question 
 - Focusing on a specific detail instead of the big picture
 - Failing to consider alternative explanations
 - Logical reasoning error
Solution:
The experts believe that trampling by cattle and sheep on the grassland is causing the sharp decline in the northern salamander population in Xinjiang. 
Choice B states that in recent years, decreased rainfall and falling groundwater levels have affected the water source environment where the salamanders live. This environmental change could be an alternative explanation for the salamander population decline that the experts did not consider.
If the salamanders' water source habitat is being negatively impacted by climate factors, that alone could account for the population decline, regardless of any trampling by livestock. The fact that the experts did not address this possibility raises doubts about whether their opinion considered all the relevant factors.
Therefore, choice B raises the most doubts about the experts' opinion by suggesting an alternative environmental explanation for the salamander decline that their analysis seems to have overlooked.
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and make sure you understand what it is asking. Focus on the big picture, not just specific details.
2. Analyze each answer choice and consider how it relates to the information and opinion presented in the question context. 
3. Look for choices that suggest alternative explanations or raise doubts about the completeness, logic or validity of the presented opinion.
4. Be wary of choices that seem to contradict a specific detail but don't necessarily undermine the overall opinion.
5. Select the choice that most directly challenges the key assumptions or conclusions of the opinion, or suggests the most compelling alternative explanation.
Advice:
 - Always make sure you are answering the specific question being asked. Don't get sidetracked by tangential details.
 - Consider each answer choice from multiple angles. The best choice may not be the most obvious one.
 - When evaluating an opinion, look for gaps in logic, unstated assumptions, and failure to consider alternative explanations. 
 - Just because a choice contradicts one specific detail of an argument doesn't necessarily mean it raises the most doubts about the overall opinion.
 - The choice that suggests the most compelling alternative explanation is often the one that raises the greatest doubts about the original opinion.
