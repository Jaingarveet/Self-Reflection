## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I selected an answer that seemed to support the expert's view rather than cast doubt on it. Choice B suggests demolishing the bridge may not be necessary, while I failed to recognize that Choice D provides evidence directly contradicting the expert's claim that the bridge must be demolished to allow giant ships to pass.
Error Keywords:
 - Misinterpreting answer choices
 - Failing to identify contradictory evidence 
 - Focusing on irrelevant information
 - Confirmation bias
Solution:
The expert asserts the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge must be demolished and rebuilt to allow giant ships to pass. 
Choice A supports this view by noting goods must be transported by road/rail due to large ships being unable to pass.
Choice B casts some doubt by suggesting few large ships travel above Nanjing.
Choice C also supports the expert by pointing out other bridges have the same low 24m clearance. 
However, Choice D directly contradicts the expert's key claim by stating that 8000-ton ships designed for the Yangtze have already passed through Nanjing to Wuhan. This proves giant ships can in fact pass under the bridge, so demolishing it is not necessary.
Therefore, Choice D raises the most doubt about the expert's view.
Instructions:
1. Read the question and expert's claim carefully.
2. For each answer choice, determine if it supports, opposes, or is irrelevant to the expert's view.
3. Look for choices that provide direct evidence contradicting a key part of the expert's assertion.
4. Avoid choices that seem relevant but don't actually disprove the main claim.
5. Avoid focusing only on choices that confirm your initial thoughts.
6. Select the choice that most strongly calls the expert's conclusion into question.
Advice:
 - Always read the full question and understand the key claim you are evaluating.
 - Always consider each answer choice carefully and look for direct evidence that contradicts the main assertion.
 - Never just pick an answer because it seems related to the topic or matches your first instinct.
 - Always be on the lookout for your own potential biases and try to set them aside.
 - Never ignore an answer choice just because it doesn't fit your initial assumptions.
