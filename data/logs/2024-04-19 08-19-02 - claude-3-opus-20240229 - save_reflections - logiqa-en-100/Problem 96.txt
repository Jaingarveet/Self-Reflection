## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I incorrectly chose option B as the answer that would most strengthen the argument. Upon reflection, I realize that option D provides stronger support for the claim that advertisers consider factors beyond just economic benefits.
Error Keywords:
- Misinterpreting answer choices
- Failing to identify the most relevant information
- Overlooking key details
- Logical reasoning error
Solution:
The passage argues that some advertisers consider ethical responsibilities in addition to economic benefits, as evidenced by their refusal to renew contracts with "Inferno" magazine after it changed its content to include violence and pornography.
To strengthen this argument, we should look for additional evidence that supports the claim about advertisers' motivations.
A: The cost and pricing of "Inferno" do not directly relate to advertisers' ethical considerations. (Irrelevant)
B: Advertisers maintaining benefits after switching publications suggests they didn't suffer economically, but it doesn't necessarily prove they were motivated by ethics. (Weak support)
C: Reader preferences don't directly address advertisers' motivations. (Irrelevant)
D: If some advertisers are switching to "Inferno" despite the content change, it suggests that not all advertisers are prioritizing ethical concerns over reaching the new target audience. This weakens the claim that advertisers are motivated by ethical responsibilities, thereby strengthening the argument by contrast. (Strongest support)
Therefore, option D most strengthens the argument.
Instructions:
1. Read the passage carefully to identify the main argument or claim.
2. Analyze each answer choice to determine how it relates to the main argument.
3. Eliminate choices that are irrelevant or do not directly address the argument.
4. Identify the choice that provides the strongest support or evidence for the argument.
5. If the question asks which choice strengthens the argument, also consider if any choices weaken the argument by contrast.
6. Double-check your reasoning and ensure you have selected the most relevant and impactful choice.
Advice:
- Always read the passage and question carefully to identify the main argument and what the question is asking.
- Consider how each answer choice relates to and impacts the main argument.
- Eliminate irrelevant choices to narrow down your options.
- Look for the choice that most directly and significantly supports or strengthens the argument.
- Remember that a choice that weakens the argument can sometimes strengthen it by contrast.
- Take your time and think through the logical connections between the argument and the answer choices.
