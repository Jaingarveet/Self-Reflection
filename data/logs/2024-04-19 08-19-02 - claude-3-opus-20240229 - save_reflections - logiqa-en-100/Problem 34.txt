## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I incorrectly chose option A as the statement that was not a logical inference from Confucius' quote. Upon further reflection, I realize that option B "If you want, then give it to others" is actually the choice that does not logically follow. Confucius was advising against doing unwanted things to others, but option B incorrectly infers that you should give others what you want for yourself.
Error Keywords:
 - Logical inference error
 - Misinterpretation of quote
 - Incorrect contrapositive inference
Solution:
Confucius said: "Do not do what you don't want to do to others."
A: "Only those who do what they want can do it to others." This is not a logical inference, as Confucius did not imply that wanting something gives you permission to do it to others.
B: "If you want, then give it to others." This is not a logical inference. Confucius was talking about not doing unwanted things to others, not about giving others what you want for yourself. 
C: "Don't treat others unless you want to." This logically follows, as it is equivalent to not doing unwanted things to others.
D: "Whatever is applied to people should be what they want." This is a logical inference, as it restates that you should only do to others what they would want.
Therefore, the correct answer is B.
Instructions:
1. Read the given quote or statement carefully.
2. Identify the core message or principle being conveyed.
3. Analyze each answer choice one by one.
4. For each choice, determine if it is a logical inference or consequence of the original statement.
5. Eliminate choices that directly follow from the statement or are equivalent restatements.
6. Select the choice that does not logically follow or is not implied by the original statement.
7. Double-check your selection to ensure it is the only choice that is not a logical inference.
Advice:
 - Always read the question and given information carefully to fully understand the problem.
 - Focus on the core message and identify the guiding principle or rule being expressed.
 - Consider each answer choice independently and systematically.
 - A choice can fail to be a logical inference by either being unrelated to the statement or by misinterpreting it.
 - Be careful not to choose an option just because it seems untrue; it must be illogical based on the given statement.
 - Eliminate choices methodically and double-check your final selection to avoid mistakes.
