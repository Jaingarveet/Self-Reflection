## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I incorrectly identified choice C as the answer that does not constitute a doubt or rebuttal to the argument for the external world's existence. However, upon further reflection, I realize that choice D is actually the one that does not pose a doubt or rebuttal. Choice D in fact supports the existence of the external world by pointing to the practical successes of science. My error was in misinterpreting the question and not carefully considering how each choice relates to the argument.
Error Keywords:
- Question misinterpretation 
- Incorrect choice elimination
- Faulty reasoning about choice implications
Solution:
Let's reconsider each choice in light of the original argument:
A: Poses a valid doubt by highlighting the circular reasoning in using sensory evidence to prove the external world. 
B: Raises a valid question about proving others have similar experiences, casting doubt on that aspect of the argument.
C: Points out that if visual experience is reliable, then mirages would be real. This challenges the reliability of visual experience, a key part of the original argument. So this is a relevant doubt.
D: Argues that science's practical successes suggest there is a real external world that science reflects. This supports the original argument rather than challenging it.
Therefore, choice D is the one that does not constitute a doubt or rebuttal to the argument.
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully to understand what is being asked.
2. Read through the original argument to grasp its main points and reasoning.
3. Consider each answer choice in turn.
4. For each choice, ask: Does this pose a challenge, doubt, or rebuttal to the original argument? Or does it support the argument?
5. Eliminate the choices that do express doubts or rebuttals.
6. The remaining choice should be the one that does not challenge the argument.
7. Double check that your selected answer fits the question asked.
Advice:
- Always read questions thoroughly to ensure you understand what is being asked.
- Take time to carefully consider how each answer choice relates to the main argument.
- Don't just look for the "right" answer; also consider how the "wrong" answers fail to fit the question.
- Be careful not to let your own opinions bias your choice; stick closely to the logic of the argument and question at hand.
- If a choice seems to support the argument rather than challenge it, it's likely the odd one out for a question like this.
