## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I incorrectly chose option C because I misinterpreted the logical implications of the given statements. I focused too much on the market conditions and failed to properly consider the relationship between the 10% and 20% productivity increases.
Error Keywords:
 - Logical reasoning error
 - Misinterpretation of implications
 - Failure to consider all relevant information
 - Incorrect deduction
Solution:
Given:
- Green Island must increase productivity by 10% over the next two years to avoid bankruptcy.
- If Green Island can increase productivity by 10%, then it can achieve a 20% increase.
Analyzing the answer choices:
A. If Green Island cannot achieve a 20% increase, it will go bankrupt. - This must be true. If Green Island can achieve a 10% increase, it can also achieve a 20% increase. Therefore, if it cannot achieve a 20% increase, it cannot achieve a 10% increase either, leading to bankruptcy.
B. If Green Island increases productivity by 20%, it will not go bankrupt. - While this is likely true, it is not a necessary conclusion based on the given information.
C. If the market does not change, Green Island does not need to increase productivity to prevent bankruptcy. - The statement does not provide information about what happens if the market does not change.
D. Green Island may increase productivity by 10%, but it is impossible to achieve a 20% increase. - This contradicts the given information, which states that a 10% increase implies a 20% increase is possible.
Therefore, the correct answer is A.
Instructions:
1. Read the given statements carefully and identify the key information.
2. Consider the logical implications of the statements.
3. Analyze each answer choice by applying the given information.
4. Eliminate choices that are not necessarily true or contradict the given information.
5. Choose the answer that must be true based on the logical implications of the given statements.
Advice:
 - Always read the question and given information carefully to identify the key facts and relationships.
 - Consider the logical implications of the statements and how they relate to each other.
 - Analyze each answer choice systematically, applying the given information to determine if it must be true.
 - Be cautious of answer choices that may be likely but are not necessarily true based on the given information.
 - Eliminate choices that contradict the given statements or are not supported by the information provided.
 - Choose the answer that is a logical necessity based on the given premises.
