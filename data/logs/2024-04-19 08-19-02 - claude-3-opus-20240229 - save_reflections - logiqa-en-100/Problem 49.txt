## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I did not fully utilize the information provided to logically deduce the meaning of "Doximayo". While I correctly determined that "Mugbudengs" means "reporter", I failed to use that knowledge along with the sentence structures to infer the meaning of "Doximayo".
Error Keywords:
- Incomplete analysis
- Failure to synthesize information 
- Missed logical deduction
- Incomplete problem solving
Solution:
Given:
1. "Alingoits Doximayo Makasey" means "kidnapping student (host) hostage"
2. "Huholikaso Makasey Mugbudengs" means "hostage holding (see) reporter" 
3. "Mugbudengs Ftoufgke Alingoits" means "kidnapping reporters away"
From sentences 2 and 3, we can deduce that "Mugbudengs" means "reporter(s)".
Now, looking at sentence 1, we see that "Doximayo" is in the same position as "student" in the translation. 
Since we know "Mugbudengs" means "reporter(s)", by process of elimination, "Doximayo" must mean "student".
Therefore, the correct answer is B: "Doximayo" means "student".
Instructions:
1. Carefully read and analyze each piece of given information.
2. Look for words that appear in multiple sentences and use their positions to deduce their meanings.
3. Once you have determined the meaning of a word, use that knowledge to help deduce other word meanings.
4. Use process of elimination based on sentence structure to determine the meanings of remaining words.
5. Synthesize all of the information to arrive at a logical conclusion.
6. Choose the answer choice that matches your deduction.
Advice:
- Always fully utilize all of the given information when solving logic problems.
- Look for patterns and similarities in the structure of the information provided.
- If you can definitively determine the meaning of some elements, use that knowledge to deduce the meaning of other elements.
- Employ process of elimination to systematically rule out incorrect possibilities.
- Synthesize the information and patterns you have identified to reach a logical conclusion.
- If you get stuck, methodically go through the problem-solving steps one-by-one.
