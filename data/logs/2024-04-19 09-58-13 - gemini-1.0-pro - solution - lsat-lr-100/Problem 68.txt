Context: City dog licensing records show that more cocker spaniels are registered to addresses in the Flynn Heights neighborhood than to addresses in all other neighborhoods combined. So if an animal control officer finds a stray cocker spaniel anywhere near Flynn Heights, it is likely that the dog belongs to someone in Flynn Heights.

Choices:
  A: whether cocker spaniels are more likely than dogs of other breeds to stray from their owners
  B: whether there are more cocker spaniels registered to addresses in Flynn Heights than any other breed of dog
  C: whether the city's animal control officers find more stray dogs in and around Flynn Heights than in any other part of the city
  D: whether the number of pets owned, per capita, is greater for residents of Flynn Heights than for residents of any other neighborhood

Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
The argument is based on the premise that if a stray cocker spaniel is found near Flynn Heights, it is likely that the dog belongs to someone in Flynn Heights. This premise is based on the fact that more cocker spaniels are registered to addresses in Flynn Heights than to addresses in all other neighborhoods combined.
To evaluate the argument, it would be most useful to know whether residents of Flynn Heights are more likely to license their dogs than residents of other neighborhoods. If residents of Flynn Heights are more likely to license their dogs, then the argument is stronger. This is because the fact that more cocker spaniels are registered to addresses in Flynn Heights is a more reliable indicator of the actual number of cocker spaniels in the neighborhood.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The argument is based on the assumption that the number of registered cocker spaniels in a neighborhood is a good indicator of the actual number of cocker spaniels in that neighborhood. 
However, this assumption is only valid if residents of all neighborhoods are equally likely to register their dogs. 
If residents of Flynn Heights are more likely to register their dogs than residents of other neighborhoods, then the argument is stronger. 
This is because the fact that more cocker spaniels are registered to addresses in Flynn Heights is a more reliable indicator of the actual number of cocker spaniels in the neighborhood.
Action: Answer("E")
