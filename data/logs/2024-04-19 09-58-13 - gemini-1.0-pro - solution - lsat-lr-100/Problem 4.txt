Topic: Law
Context: A film makes a profit if the number of people who see it is sufficient to generate revenues from ticket sales greater than the amount spent to make it. Hence, the primary goal of movie executives is to maximize the number of people who see a film. However, it is not the primary goal of television executives to maximize the number of viewers for their shows.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain the difference between the goals of movie executives and those of television executives?
Choices:
  A: More people are willing to see a film more than once than are willing to watch a television show more than once.
  B: There is no analog in television to the large profits that owners of movie theaters make by selling refreshments to their customers.
  C: The average cost of producing an hour of film is much greater than the average cost of producing an hour of television.
  D: Television shows make their profits from sponsors, who are chiefly concerned with the purchasing power of the people who watch a television show.
  E: Over half of the most popular television shows are shows that viewers do not have to pay to watch.

## Self-Reflection
**Previous Incorrect Answer:** C
**Reasoning:** I incorrectly assumed that the higher cost of producing films was the primary reason for the difference in goals between movie and television executives.

**Reflection:**

* I should not jump to conclusions based on limited information.
* It's important to consider all the answer choices and their implications before selecting the best answer.
## Applying the Reflection to the Current Question
