## Self-Reflection
**Previous Incorrect Answer:**
Action: Answer("A")
**Reasoning:**
My previous reasoning was flawed. I incorrectly assumed that since most Acme employees cannot afford housing within a 30-minute commute of Ocean View, they must be able to afford housing within a 30-minute commute of Milltown. This is a non sequitur.
**Correct Answer:**
Action: Answer("D")
**Reasoning:**
The argument explicitly states that "most Acme employees will have a commute of more than 30 minutes" once the company moves to Ocean View. This implies that currently, most Acme employees have a commute of less than 30 minutes. 
**Key Takeaways:**
* Be careful not to make assumptions that are not explicitly stated in the argument.
* Pay close attention to the wording of the question and the answer choices.
* Consider all possible interpretations of the argument before selecting an answer.
