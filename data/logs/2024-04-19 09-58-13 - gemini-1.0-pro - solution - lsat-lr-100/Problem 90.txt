Context: Science journalist: Brown dwarfs are celestial objects with more mass than planets but less mass than stars. They are identified by their mass and whether or not lithium is present in their atmospheres. Stars at least as massive as the Sun have lithium remaining in their atmospheres because the mixing of elements in their internal nuclear furnaces is incomplete. Stars with less mass than the Sun have no lithium because the element has been fully mixed into their nuclear furnaces and consumed. A brown dwarf does not have a fully functional nuclear furnace and so its lithium cannot be consumed.
Question: Which one of the following is most strongly supported by the science journalist's statements?
Choices:
  A: Any celestial object without lithium in its atmosphere is a star with less mass than the Sun.
  B: Any celestial object with lithium in its atmosphere has a nuclear furnace that has incompletely mixed the object's elements.
  C: No celestial object that has no lithium in its atmosphere is a brown dwarf.
  D: No celestial object with lithium in its atmosphere has less mass than the Sun.
  E: No celestial object less massive than a brown dwarf has lithium in its atmosphere.

## Self-Reflection
**Previous Incorrect Answer:** C
**Reasoning for Incorrect Answer:** I incorrectly focused on the statement "No celestial object that has no lithium in its atmosphere is a brown dwarf" and ignored the information about stars with less mass than the Sun.
**Correct Answer:** D
**Reasoning for Correct Answer:** The passage states that stars with less mass than the Sun have no lithium in their atmospheres. Therefore, no celestial object with lithium in its atmosphere can have less mass than the Sun.
**Key Takeaways:**
* Pay close attention to all the information provided in the passage, not just specific statements.
* Consider all possible options and eliminate those that are contradicted by the information.
* Be mindful of potential biases or assumptions that might influence your interpretation.
## Applying Self-Reflection to the Current Question
Based on my self-reflection, I will approach the current question with the following strategies:
1. **Read the passage carefully and identify the key points.**
2. **Consider all the answer choices and eliminate those that are contradicted by the information.**
3. **Choose the answer that is most strongly supported by the passage.**
## Answer to the Current Question
The correct answer is **D: No celestial object with lithium in its atmosphere has less mass than the Sun.**
This is because the passage states that stars with less mass than the Sun have no lithium in their atmospheres. Therefore, any celestial object with lithium in its atmosphere must have more mass than the Sun. 
I am confident that I have correctly answered this question based on my self-reflection and the information provided in the passage.
