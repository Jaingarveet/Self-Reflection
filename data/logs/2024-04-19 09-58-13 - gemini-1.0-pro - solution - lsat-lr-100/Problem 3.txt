Context: Editorial: Painting involves a sequential application of layers, each of which adheres satisfactorily only if the underlying layer has been properly applied. Education is, in this respect, like the craft of painting. Since the most important steps in painting are preparation of the surface to be painted and application of the primer coat, it makes sense to suppose that .
Question: Which one of the following most logically completes the editorial's argument?
Choices:
  A: in the educator's initial contact with a student, the educator should be as undemanding as possible
  B: students who have a secure grasp of the fundamentals of a subject are likely to make progress in that subject
  C: educators who are not achieving the goals they intended should revise their teaching methods
  D: teaching new students is rewarding but much more difficult than teaching more advanced students
  E: the success of a student's overall educational experience depends above all upon that student's initial educational experience

I understand. I will try my best to answer the question correctly this time.
**Thought:**
The editorial compares education to painting, suggesting that a strong foundation is crucial for progress. This implies that the most important aspect of education is laying the groundwork for future learning.
**Analysis of Choices:**
* **A:** This contradicts the analogy, as an undemanding approach wouldn't ensure a solid foundation.
* **B:** This aligns with the analogy, as a strong foundation (fundamentals) enables progress.
* **C:** This is a valid point but doesn't directly relate to the analogy or the conclusion.
* **D:** This is irrelevant to the analogy and the overall argument.
* **E:** This emphasizes the importance of early education, which aligns with the analogy but is too broad.
**Conclusion:**
Choice B aligns best with the analogy and the editorial's argument about the importance of a strong foundation in education.
**Action:** Answer("B")
