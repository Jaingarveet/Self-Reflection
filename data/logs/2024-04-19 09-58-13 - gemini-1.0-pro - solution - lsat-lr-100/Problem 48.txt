Solution:
The university president's argument is that if the university does not increase its enrollment, it will be forced to reduce spending. This reduction in spending will lead to a decline in the quality of education provided by the university. Therefore, the university must market its programs more aggressively in order to increase enrollment and avoid reducing spending.
The conclusion of the argument relies on the assumption that reducing spending will lead to a decline in the quality of education. This assumption is not explicitly stated in the argument, but it is implied by the president's statement that "we will be forced to reduce spending next year if we do not increase our enrollment."
