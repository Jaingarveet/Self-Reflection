Topic: Law
Context: There are two kinds of horror stories: those that describe a mad scientist's experiments and those that describe a monstrous beast. In some horror stories about monstrous beasts, the monster symbolizes a psychological disturbance in the protagonist. Horror stories about mad scientists, on the other hand, typically express the author's feeling that scientific knowledge alone is not enough to guide human endeavor. However, despite these differences, both kinds of horror stories share two features: they describe violations of the laws of nature and they are intended to produce dread in the reader.
Question: If the statements above are true, which one of the following would also have to be true?
Choices:
  A: All descriptions of monstrous beasts describe violations of the laws of nature.
  B: Any story that describes a violation of a law of nature is intended to invoke dread in the reader.
  C: Horror stories of any kind usually describe characters who are psychologically disturbed.
  D: Most stories about mad scientists express the author's antiscientific views.
  E: Some stories that employ symbolism describe violations of the laws of nature.

## Self-Reflection
**Problem:** I incorrectly answered the previous question by choosing option A, which stated that all descriptions of monstrous beasts describe violations of the laws of nature. This was incorrect because the passage only stated that some horror stories about monstrous beasts use the monster to symbolize a psychological disturbance in the protagonist, not that all stories about monstrous beasts do this.
**Solution:** To avoid making the same mistake again, I will pay closer attention to the specific details provided in the passage and avoid making assumptions or generalizations that are not supported by the text. I will also carefully consider the answer choices and choose the one that most accurately reflects the information presented in the passage.
**Correct Answer:** 
Following the steps outlined in the solution, I will now analyze the answer choices:
* **A:** This option is incorrect because the passage does not state that all descriptions of monstrous beasts violate the laws of nature.
* **B:** This option is incorrect because the passage only states that horror stories that describe violations of the laws of nature are intended to invoke dread, not that all stories that describe such violations have this intention.
* **C:** This option is incorrect because the passage only mentions that some horror stories about monstrous beasts involve psychologically disturbed characters, not that all horror stories do.
* **D:** This option is incorrect because the passage does not state that most stories about mad scientists express the author's antiscientific views.
* **E:** This option is correct because the passage states that horror stories of any kind may employ symbolism, and symbolism can involve violations of the laws of nature.
Therefore, the correct answer is **E: Some stories that employ symbolism describe violations of the laws of nature.**
**Action: Answer("E")**
