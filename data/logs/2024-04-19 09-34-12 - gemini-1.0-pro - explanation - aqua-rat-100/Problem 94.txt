Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Explanation:
## Assistant 2:
I understand that I previously answered this question incorrectly. I have reflected on the problem, my solution, and the correct answer. I will use my self-reflection to help me answer this question correctly.
Here is my self-reflection:
* I initially thought that the question was asking for the total number of bike numbers that could be formed using 2 letters followed by 2 numbers, regardless of whether the letters were distinct. However, I realized that the question is actually asking for the total number of bike numbers that can be formed using 2 letters followed by 2 numbers, where the letters must be distinct.
* I made the mistake of not carefully reading the question and not paying attention to the detail that the letters must be distinct.
* I have learned that it is important to carefully read the question and pay attention to all of the details.
* I have also learned that it is important to double-check my work to make sure that I have not made any mistakes.
I will now use my self-reflection to answer the question correctly.
Here is my solution:
* There are 26 letters in the alphabet.
* There are 10 numbers.
* There are 26 * 26 * 10 * 10 = 67600 possible bike numbers that can be formed using 2 letters followed by 2 numbers.
* However, we need to subtract the number of bike numbers that have repeated letters.
* There are 26 * 25 * 10 * 10 = 65000 possible bike numbers that have repeated letters.
* Therefore, there are 67600 - 65000 = 2600 possible bike numbers that can be formed using 2 letters followed by 2 numbers, where the letters must be distinct.
Therefore, the answer is 2600.
