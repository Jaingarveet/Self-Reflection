Explanation:
## Assistant 2:
I understand. I will use my self-reflection to answer this question correctly.
**Self-reflection:**
* **Mistake:** I initially calculated the area of the remaining paper by subtracting the area of the two semicircles from the area of the square. However, this approach was incorrect because it did not account for the overlap between the semicircles.
* **Correction:** To address this mistake, I need to calculate the area of the overlap and subtract it from the area of the two semicircles before subtracting it from the area of the square.
**Solution:**
1. **Calculate the area of the square:** 20 cm * 20 cm = 400 cm²
2. **Calculate the area of one semicircle:** (π * (20 cm)²)/4 = 100π cm²
3. **Calculate the area of the overlap:** (π * (10 cm)²)/4 = 25π cm²
4. **Calculate the area of the two semicircles:** 2 * 100π cm² = 200π cm²
5. **Calculate the area of the remaining paper:** 400 cm² - (200π cm² - 25π cm²) = 400 cm² - 175π cm² ≈ 8.75 cm²

Action: Answer("A")
