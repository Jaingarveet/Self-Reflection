## Assistant 2:
## Self-Reflection (Previous Incorrect Answer)
**Mistake:** I initially calculated the percentage of black marbles based on the second draw (1/20 = 5%). Then, I assumed that 5% represented the total percentage of black marbles in the bag and calculated the total number of marbles (200) based on this assumption.
**Reasoning for the mistake:** I misinterpreted the information about the second draw representing the percentage of black marbles in the bag. I should have considered the initial 20 marbles that were painted black and added to the bag.
**Corrected Approach:**
1. **Calculate the total number of black marbles:** 20 (initial) + 1 (second draw) = 21 black marbles.
2. **Calculate the percentage of black marbles:** (21 black marbles / Q total marbles) x 100 = 5%.
3. **Solve for Q:** 21 = 0.05Q
4. **Therefore, Q = 420.**
