Question: A car is being driven, in a straight line and at a uniform speed, towards the base of a vertical tower. The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower?
Choices:
  A: 5(√3 + 1)
  B: 6(√3 + √2)

## Assistant 2:
## Self-Reflection on Previous Incorrect Answer:
**Previous Incorrect Answer:** C: 7(√3 – 1)
**Reasoning for Incorrect Answer:**
My previous approach involved calculating the distance traveled by the car based on the change in angle and the height of the tower. However, I made a crucial mistake in assuming that the car was traveling directly towards the base of the tower. This assumption led to an incorrect calculation of the distance and, consequently, the time it would take for the car to reach the base.
**Correct Approach:**
The correct approach involves recognizing that the car is not traveling directly towards the base of the tower but rather along a straight line that intersects the tower at a certain point. This means that the distance traveled by the car is not simply the height of the tower but rather the hypotenuse of a right triangle formed by the height of the tower, the distance traveled along the straight line, and the distance from the point of intersection to the base of the tower.
**Calculation:**
Let:
* H be the height of the tower.
* D be the distance traveled by the car along the straight line.
* X be the distance from the point of intersection to the base of the tower.
* T be the time it takes for the car to reach the base of the tower.
From the given information, we know that:
* The angle of elevation changes from 45° to 60° in 10 minutes.
* The car is traveling at a uniform speed.
Using trigonometry, we can find the following relationships:
* tan(45°) = H / D
* tan(60°) = H / (D + X)
Solving for D and X, we get:
* D = H / tan(45°) = H
* X = H / (tan(60°) - tan(45°)) = H / (√3 - 1)
The total distance traveled by the car is then:
* √(H^2 + X^2) = √(H^2 + (H^2 / (√3 - 1)^2)) = H * √(1 + 1 / (√3 - 1)^2)
Since the car is traveling at a uniform speed, the time it takes to travel this distance is:
* T = (√(H^2 + X^2)) / speed = H * √(1 + 1 / (√3 - 1)^2) / speed
**Answer:**
Therefore, the correct answer is:
**Action: Answer("A")**
