Explanation:
## Assistant 2:
Self-reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly because I did not consider the time factor for each partner's investment. I only focused on the investment amount.
To answer this question correctly, I need to calculate the ratio of the partners' investments based on the time they invested.
Here's how I will approach the problem:
1. Calculate the total investment of each partner:
A: 40,000 * 12 = 480,000 (invested for 12 months)
B: 60,000 * 10 = 600,000 (invested for 10 months)
C: 120,000 * x (invested for x months)
2. Calculate the ratio of their investments:
A:B:C = 480,000:600,000:120,000x
3. Since C gets Rs.150,000 out of a total profit of Rs.375,000, his share is 150,000/375,000 = 2/5.
4. Set up the equation based on the ratio and the share:
2/5 = 120,000x / (480,000 + 600,000 + 120,000x)
5. Solve for x:
2/5 = 120,000x / 1,080,000 + 120,000x
2,160,000 + 240,000x = 120,000x
120,000x = 2,160,000
x = 18
Therefore, C joined the business after 18 months.
