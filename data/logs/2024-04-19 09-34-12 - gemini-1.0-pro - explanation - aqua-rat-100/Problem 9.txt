## Assistant 2:
I understand. I apologize for the previous incorrect answer. I have reviewed my solution and identified the error. I will use my self-reflection to answer this question correctly.
**Thought:**
* The grocer makes a 25% profit on the selling price of each bag of flour.
* The selling price of each bag is $100.
* The total profit made is $3,000.
**Calculation:**
* To find the cost price of each bag, we need to subtract the profit from the selling price: $100 - 25% of $100 = $75.
* To find the number of bags sold, we need to divide the total profit by the profit per bag: $3,000 / $25 = 120 bags.
**Action:** Answer("E")
## Result:
Agent Answer: E
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
