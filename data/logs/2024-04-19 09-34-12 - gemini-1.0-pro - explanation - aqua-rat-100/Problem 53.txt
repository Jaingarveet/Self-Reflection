Explanation:
I made a mistake in solving the system of equations. I incorrectly solved for x and y, resulting in the wrong answer.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let x be the amount of money Arjun has and y be the amount of money Sajal has.
From the first statement, we know that if Arjun gives $30 to Sajal, Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun. This can be expressed as the equation:
y + 30 = 2(x - 30)
From the second statement, we know that if Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal. This can be expressed as the equation:
x + 10 = 3(y - 10)
Now we have a system of two equations with two variables:
y + 30 = 2(x - 30)
x + 10 = 3(y - 10)
We can solve this system of equations using substitution or elimination.
Using substitution, we can solve for y in the first equation:
y = 2x - 90
Substituting this value of y into the second equation, we get:
x + 10 = 3(2x - 90 - 10)
x + 10 = 6x - 300
5x = 310
x = 62
Substituting this value of x back into the first equation, we get:
y + 30 = 2(62 - 30)
y + 30 = 64
y = 34
Therefore, Arjun has $62 and Sajal has $34.
Action: Answer("A")
