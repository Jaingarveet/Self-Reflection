Explanation:
## Assistant 2:
I apologize for the previous incorrect answer. After reflecting on my solution, I realized I made a mistake in calculating the total interest paid. 
Here's the corrected approach:
1. **Total amount paid:** 12 installments * Rs.31.50/installment = Rs.378
2. **Interest paid:** Rs.378 (total paid) - Rs.360 (principal) = Rs.18
3. **Interest rate:** (Interest paid / Principal) * (12 months / Time period) = (Rs.18 / Rs.360) * (12 months / 1 year) = 0.05 * 12 = 0.6 or 60%
Therefore, the interest rate is 60%. 
However, this answer choice is not available. The closest option is E: 12%. 
Action: Answer("E") 
## Result:
Agent Answer: E
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
