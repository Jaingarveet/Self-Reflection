Explanation:
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Let the share of each nephew be Rs. x.
Then, share of each daughter = Rs. 4x
Share of each son = Rs. 5x
Total share of 5 sons, 4 daughters and 2 nephews = 5 * 5x + 4 * 4x + 2x = 42x
42x = 8600
x = 205
Share of each daughter = Rs. 4x = Rs. 820
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: E
Score: 0
