## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: \begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}\cline { 2 - 3 }\multicolumn{1}{c|}{} & \multicolumn{2}{c|}{Handedness} \\\hlineGender & Left & Right \\\hline\hlineFemale &  &  \\\hlineMale &  &  \\\hline\hlineTotal & 18 & 122 \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}The incomplete table above summarizes the number of left-handed students and right-handed students by gender for the eighth-grade students atKeisel Middle School. There are 5 times as many right-handed female students as there are left-handed female students, and there are 9 times as many right-handed male students as there are left-handed male students. If there is a total of 18 left-handed students and 122 right-handed students in the school, which of the following is closest to the probability that a right-handed student selected at random is female? (Note: Assume that none of the eighth-grade students are both right-handed and left-handed.)
Choices:
  A: 0.410
  B: 0.357
  C: 0.333
  D: 0.250

## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let's start by using algebra to solve the system of equations.
Let x be the number of left-handed female students.
Then, the number of right-handed female students is 5x.
Let y be the number of left-handed male students.
Then, the number of right-handed male students is 9y.
We know that the total number of left-handed students is 18 and the total number of right-handed students is 122.
So, we can write the following system of equations:
x + 5x + y + 9y = 122
x + y = 18
Simplifying the first equation, we get:
6x + 10y = 122
Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
3x + 5y = 61
Multiplying the second equation by 3, we get:
3x + 3y = 54
Subtracting this equation from the previous one, we get:
2y = 7
y = 3.5
This is not possible since y represents the number of male students and it must be a whole number.
Therefore, there is an error in the problem statement or in the choices provided.
