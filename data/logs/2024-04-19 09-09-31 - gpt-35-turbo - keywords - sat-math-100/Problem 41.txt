## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.

Question: \begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}\hline$x$ & $f(x)$ \\\hline0 & 3 \\\hline2 & 1 \\\hline4 & 0 \\\hline5 & -2 \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}The function $f$ is defined by a polynomial. Some values of $x$ and $f(x)$ are shown in the table above. Which of the following must be a factor of $f(x)$ ?
Choices:
  A: $x-2$
  B: $x-3$
  C: $x-4$
  D: $x-5$

## Assistant 2:
Thought:
To determine which of the given choices is a factor of $f(x)$, we can use the Remainder Theorem. 
We can use the values of $x$ given in the table to evaluate $f(x)$ and check which choice(s) give a remainder of 0.
Action: 
Substitute the given values of $x$ into each choice and check which one(s) give a remainder of 0.
$f(2) = 1$ and $f(4) = 0$, so $(x-2)$ is not a factor of $f(x)$.
$f(5) = -2$ and $f(4) = 0$, so $(x-5)$ is not a factor of $f(x)$.
$f(4) = 0$, so $(x-4)$ is a factor of $f(x)$.
$f(0) = 3$ and $f(4) = 0$, so $(x-0) = x$ is not a factor of $f(x)$.
Therefore, the only choice that must be a factor of $f(x)$ is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ x-4}$.
