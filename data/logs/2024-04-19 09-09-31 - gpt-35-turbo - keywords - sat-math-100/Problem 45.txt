Question: Shipping Charges\begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}\hline$\begin{array}{c}\text { Merchandise weight } \\ \text { (pounds) }\end{array}$ & $\begin{array}{c}\text { Shipping } \\ \text { charge }\end{array}$ \\\hline5 & $\$ 16.94$ \\\hline10 & $\$ 21.89$ \\\hline20 & $\$ 31.79$ \\\hline40 & $\$ 51.59$ \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}The table above shows shipping charges for an online retailer that sells sporting goods. There is a linear relationship between the shipping charge and the weight of the merchandise. Which function can be used to determine the total shipping charge $f(x)$, in dollars, for an order with a merchandise weight of $x$ pounds?
Choices:
  A: $f(x)=0.99 x$
  B: $f(x)=0.99 x+11.99$
  C: $f(x)=3.39 x$
  D: $f(x)=3.39 x+16.94$

## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The function that represents the linear relationship between the shipping charge and the weight of the merchandise is in slope-intercept form, which is $f(x)=mx+b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept.
To find the slope, we can use the formula $m=\frac{\text{change in y}}{\text{change in x}}$.
Using the points $(5,16.94)$ and $(10,21.89)$, we get $m=\frac{21.89-16.94}{10-5}=0.99$.
To find the y-intercept, we can use the point $(5,16.94)$ and the slope we just found, and solve for $b$ in the equation $16.94=0.99(5)+b$.
Simplifying, we get $b=11.99$.
Therefore, the function that represents the total shipping charge $f(x)$, in dollars, for an order with a merchandise weight of $x$ pounds is $f(x)=0.99x+11.99$.
Action: Answer("B")
