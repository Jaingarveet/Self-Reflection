## Assistant 2:
[REDACTED] 
I made an error in my previous solution by not multiplying the denominator on the left side of the equation. This led to an incorrect value of $a$. 
Solution:
Multiplying the denominator on the left side of the equation, we get:
$24x^2 + 25x - 47 = (-8x - 3)(ax - 2) - 53$
Expanding the right side of the equation, we get:
$-8ax^2 + (2a - 24)x + (6 - 25a) = 0$
Since this equation is true for all values of $x \neq \frac{2}{a}$, the coefficients of the quadratic must be equal to zero. Therefore:
$-8a = 0 \implies a = \boxed{\textbf{(D) }16}$
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: B
