## Assistant 2:
Self-reflection:
To solve the problem, I need to set up an equation based on the given information. 
The equation is $16+4x=14+10$. 
Then, I need to solve for $x$ by simplifying the equation. 
$16+4x=24$ 
$4x=8$ 
$x=2$ 
I made a calculation error when I solved for $x$ the first time. 
The correct answer is A: 2.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: C
