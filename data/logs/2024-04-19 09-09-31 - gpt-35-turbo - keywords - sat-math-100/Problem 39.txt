## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Assistant 2:
Thought:
To determine if the system has no solution, we can check if the slopes of the two lines are equal. If they are not equal, then the system has a unique solution. If they are equal, then the system has either no solution or infinitely many solutions. 
We can rewrite the equations in slope-intercept form to compare their slopes. 
$$\begin{aligned}& -3 x+y=6 \implies y=3x+6 \\& a x+2 y=4 \implies y=-\frac{a}{2}x+2\end{aligned}$$
If the system has no solution, then the slopes of the two lines are equal and the y-intercepts are different. 
Therefore, we need to find the value of $a$ such that $3=-\frac{a}{2}$, which means $a=-6$.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
