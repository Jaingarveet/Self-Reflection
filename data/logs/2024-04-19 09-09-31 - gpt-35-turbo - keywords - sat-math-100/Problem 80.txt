## Assistant 2:
Thought:
To solve the system of equations, we can use elimination method by multiplying the first equation by 5 and the second equation by 3, and then subtracting the second equation from the first equation. This will eliminate $y$ and we can solve for $x$. Then we can substitute $x$ into one of the equations to solve for $y$. If the system has no solution, then the equations are inconsistent, which means they represent two parallel lines. This will happen if and only if the coefficients of $x$ and $y$ in the two equations are proportional to each other, but the constant terms are not proportional. 
Calculation:
Multiplying the first equation by 5 and the second equation by 3, we get:
$$\begin{aligned}& 5kx-15y=20 \\& 12x-15y=21\end{aligned}$$
Subtracting the second equation from the first equation, we get:
$$5kx-12x=20-21$$
Simplifying, we get:
$$(5k-12)x=-1$$
Dividing by $(5k-12)$ (which is nonzero), we get:
$$x=-\frac{1}{5k-12}$$
Substituting this into the second equation, we get:
$$4\left(-\frac{1}{5k-12}\right)-5y=7$$
Simplifying, we get:
$$-\frac{4}{5k-12}-5y=7$$
Multiplying both sides by $5k-12$, we get:
$$-4-5ky=7(5k-12)$$
Expanding, we get:
$$-4-5ky=35k-84$$
Adding $5ky$ to both sides, we get:
$$-4=35k-5ky-84$$
Simplifying, we get:
$$5ky-35k=-80$$
Factoring out $5k$, we get:
$$5k(y-7)=-80$$
Dividing by $(y-7)$ (which is nonzero), we get:
$$5k=-\frac{80}{y-7}$$
Therefore, for the system to have no solution, we need $5k$ to be a constant that is different for different values of $y$. This means that $k$ must be proportional to $\frac{1}{y-7}$. Looking at the answer choices, we see that only $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ -\frac{16}{7}}$ satisfies this condition. 
Reflection:
I made an algebraic manipulation error in my previous attempt to solve this problem. Specifically, I made a subtraction error when I subtracted the first equation from the second equation instead of subtracting the second equation from the first equation. This led to an incorrect expression for $x$. By reflecting on my mistake, I was able to correct my approach and arrive at the correct answer.
