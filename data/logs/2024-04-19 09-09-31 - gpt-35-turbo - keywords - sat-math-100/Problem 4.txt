## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: In the $x y$-plane, the line determined by the points $(2, k)$ and $(k, 32)$ passes through the origin. Which of the following could be the value of $k$ ?
Choices:
  A: 0
  B: 4
  C: 8
  D: 16

## Assistant 2:
Self-reflection:
To find the equation of the line, I need to find the slope of the line. Since the line passes through the origin, the slope is given by $\frac{32-0}{k-2}= \frac{k-0}{2-k}$. Solving for $k$, I got $k=8$. However, I made a calculation error. The correct value of $k$ is $k=16$. 
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
