## System:
You are an expert in Medicine.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I focused on the concept of the pKa being close to the physiological pH, which is indeed a critical factor for buffer systems. However, I overlooked the specific reason why high concentration is the ideal property for blood buffers.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Blood bicarbonate buffers are ideal because they have a high concentration.
This is important because buffers work by resisting changes in pH; when H+ ions are added to the blood, they are buffered by combining with HCO3- ions to form H2CO3, which then dissociates into H2O and CO2, thus maintaining the pH.
The high concentration of bicarbonates ensures that there are enough buffer molecules to effectively counteract any changes in pH, helping to maintain the body's acid-base balance.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
