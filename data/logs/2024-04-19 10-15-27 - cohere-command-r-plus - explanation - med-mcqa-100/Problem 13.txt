Explanation:
## Assistant 2:
Reflection: Ultrasound is the initial investigation of choice for pyloric stenosis as it is a quick, safe, and inexpensive test that can easily detect the thickened pylorus and the characteristic "hourglass" shape of the stomach. While a UGI series can also be used to diagnose pyloric stenosis, it is less commonly chosen as the first-line investigation due to its higher cost and radiation exposure. CT and MRI are not typically used for routine diagnosis of pyloric stenosis because they are more expensive and time-consuming, and they provide no additional benefit for this specific condition.
Action: Answer("A")
