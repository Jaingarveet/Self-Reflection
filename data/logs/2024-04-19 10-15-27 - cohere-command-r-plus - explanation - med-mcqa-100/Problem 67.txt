Explanation:
I focused on the general complications of surgery and the specific complications of cyst-gastrostomy without considering the anatomical context of the procedure. The correct answer, "hemorrhage," is a major concern due to the rich vascular supply of the pancreas and the potential for damage to nearby blood vessels.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Given the anatomical context of the procedure involving the pancreas, a major complication could be hemorrhage due to the rich vascular supply in this area.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
