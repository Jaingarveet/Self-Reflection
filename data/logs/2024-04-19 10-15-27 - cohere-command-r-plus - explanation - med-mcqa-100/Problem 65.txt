Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I chose "[REDACTED]" and "[REDACTED]" because I thought that keeping the affected area moist with petroleum jelly and monitoring for any signs of infection were reasonable approaches. However, the correct answer is "[REDACTED]," indicating that observation alone is sufficient.

Post-radiation skin lesions like desquamation typically heal on their own and do not require surgical intervention or antibiotic coverage unless there are signs of infection. Therefore, the best answer is "B: Observation alone."
