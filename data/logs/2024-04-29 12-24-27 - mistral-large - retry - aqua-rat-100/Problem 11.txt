## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding all its sides. Since a rectangle has two pairs of equal sides, we can simplify the calculation by multiplying the length by 2 and the width by 2, then adding the results.

In this case, the length is 8 centimeters and the width is 3 centimeters.

So, the perimeter is (8 x 2) + (3 x 2) = 16 + 6 = 22 centimeters.

Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
