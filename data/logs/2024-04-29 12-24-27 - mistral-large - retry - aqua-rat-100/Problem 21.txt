## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The amount of work done is proportional to the number of workers and the number of hours worked per day, and inversely proportional to the number of days taken to complete the work.
Let's denote the amount of work done by W.
Then, according to the problem, x men working x hours per day can complete x units of work in x days.
This can be expressed mathematically as:
W = (x men \* x hours/day \* x days) / x days
Simplifying this expression, we get:
W = x^2
Now, we need to find out how much work can be completed by y men working y hours per day in y days.
Using the same reasoning as before, we can express this mathematically as:
W' = (y men \* y hours/day \* y days) / y days
Simplifying this expression, we get:
W' = y^2
To find out how much work can be completed by y men working y hours per day in y days compared to x men working x hours per day in x days, we need to find the ratio of W' to W.
This can be expressed mathematically as:
W'/W = y^2 / x^2
Therefore, the amount of work that can be completed by y men working y hours per day in y days is y^2/x^2 units.
