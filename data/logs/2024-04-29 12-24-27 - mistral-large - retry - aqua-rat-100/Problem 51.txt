## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")

Topic: Math
Question: R, S, T, and U are points on a line, and U is the midpoint of line segment ST. If the lengths of line segments RS, RT, and ST are 5, 17, and 22, respectively. What is the length of line segment RU?
Choices:
  A: 6
  B: 7
  C: 8
  D: 9
  E: 10

## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Since U is the midpoint of line segment ST, the length of line segment SU is half the length of line segment ST.
The length of line segment ST is given as 22, so the length of line segment SU is 22/2 = 11.
The length of line segment RS is given as 5, so the length of line segment RU is the length of line segment RS plus the length of line segment SU.
The length of line segment RU is 5 + 11 = 16.
However, 16 is not one of the available choices. I must have made a mistake.
Let me double-check my calculations.
The length of line segment RU is 5 + 11 = 16.
I still get the same answer, but it's not one of the available choices.
I must have made a mistake in my reasoning.
Since U is the midpoint of line segment ST, the length of line segment SU is half the length of line segment ST.
The length of line segment ST is given as 22, so the length of line segment SU is 22/2 = 11.
The length of line segment RT is given as 17, so the length of line segment RU is the length of line segment RT minus the length of line segment SU.
The length of line segment RU is 17 - 11 = 6.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
