Question: X and Y are two alloys which were made by mixing zinc and copper in the ratio 6:9 and 7:11, respectively. If 40 grams of alloy X and 60 grams of alloy Y are melted and mixed to form alloy Z, what is the ratio of zinc and copper in the alloy Z ?
Choices:
  A: 69:91
  B: 59:91
  C: 59:90
  D: 59:91
  E: 69:101

## Assistant 2:
Thought:
First, I need to find the amount of zinc and copper in alloy X and alloy Y separately.
The ratio of zinc and copper in alloy X is 6:9, so there are 6 parts zinc and 9 parts copper. Since 40 grams of alloy X is melted, each part is equal to 40/(6+9) = 2.5 grams. Therefore, alloy X has 6\*2.5 = 15 grams of zinc and 9\*2.5 = 22.5 grams of copper.
Similarly, the ratio of zinc and copper in alloy Y is 7:11, so there are 7 parts zinc and 11 parts copper. Since 60 grams of alloy Y is melted, each part is equal to 60/(7+11) = 3 grams. Therefore, alloy Y has 7\*3 = 21 grams of zinc and 11\*3 = 33 grams of copper.
Now, I can find the total amount of zinc and copper in alloy Z by adding the amounts in alloy X and alloy Y. Alloy Z has 15+21 = 36 grams of zinc and 22.5+33 = 55.5 grams of copper.
Finally, I need to find the ratio of zinc and copper in alloy Z. The ratio is 36:55.5, which simplifies to 59:91.
