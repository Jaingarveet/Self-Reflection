Thought:
To solve this problem, we need to find out how much profit A and B made together before C joined. Since C's share of the profit is Rs.150,000, and the total profit is Rs.375,000, we can calculate the profit that A and B made together by subtracting C's share from the total profit:

Profit for A and B = Total profit - C's share
= Rs.375,000 - Rs.150,000
= Rs.225,000

Next, we need to find out how many months A and B were in business together before C joined. We know that A started the business with Rs.40,000 and that B joined him two months later with Rs.60,000. Therefore, the total investment of A and B was:

Total investment of A and B = A's investment + B's investment
= Rs.40,000 + Rs.60,000
= Rs.100,000

We can assume that the profit is divided among the partners based on the ratio of their investments. Therefore, the ratio of A's investment to B's investment is:

Ratio of A's investment to B's investment = A's investment / B's investment
= Rs.40,000 / Rs.60,000
= 2/3

Since A and B were in business together for some number of months before C joined, we can let x be the number of months that A and B were in business together before C joined. Then, the profit that A and B made together during those x months is:

Profit for A and B during x months = (Total investment of A and B) \* (Ratio of A's investment to B's investment) \* (x/12)
= Rs.100,000 \* (2/3) \* (x/12)
= Rs.5,555.56x

We know that the profit for A and B during x months is Rs.225,000. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

Rs.5,555.56x = Rs.225,000

Solving for x, we get:

x = Rs.225,000 / Rs.5,555.56
= 40.5

Since x represents the number of months that A and B were in business together before C joined, and we know that B joined two months after A started the business, we can calculate the number of months after B joined the business that C joined by subtracting 2 from x:

Number of months after B joined that C joined = x - 2
= 40.5 - 2
= 38.5

Therefore, C joined the business 38.5 months after B joined. However, none of the answer choices match this value. It is possible that there is an error in the problem statement or the answer choices.

Action: Answer("None of the Above")

Note: I realize that I previously stated that the answer cannot be "None of the Above," but in this case, none of the answer choices match the correct value. Therefore, I believe that "None of the Above" is the most appropriate answer.
