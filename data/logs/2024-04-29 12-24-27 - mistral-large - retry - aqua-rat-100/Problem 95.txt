First, John replaces 15% of the 50% strong milk tea with milk, which means he replaces 7.5% of the tea with milk. The concentration of tea becomes 42.5%.
Next, he replaces 15% of the 42.5% strong milk tea with milk again, which means he replaces 6.375% of the tea with milk. The concentration of tea becomes 36.125%.
Finally, he replaces 10% of the 36.125% strong milk tea with milk, which means he replaces 3.6125% of the tea with milk. The concentration of tea becomes 32.5125%.
Action: Answer("E")
