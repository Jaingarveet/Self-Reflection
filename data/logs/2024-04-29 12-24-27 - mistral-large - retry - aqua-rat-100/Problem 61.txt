Question: Kevin drove from A to B at a constant speed of 70 mph. Once he reached B, he turned right around with pause, and returned to A at a constant speed of 90 mph. Exactly 3 hours before the end of his trip, he was still approaching B, only 70 miles away from it. What is the distance between A and B?

## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Kevin was 70 miles away from B, 3 hours before the end of his trip. Since he was driving at a constant speed of 90 mph on his way back from B to A, he must have been driving for 70/90 = 7/9 hours after leaving B.

The remaining time of the trip is 3 - 7/9 = 20/9 hours. Since he was driving at a constant speed of 70 mph on his way from A to B, the distance between A and B is 70 \* (20/9) = 1400/9 â‰ˆ 155.56 miles.

However, none of the available choices match this distance.

Action: Answer("E") (None of the above)
## Result:
Agent Answer: E
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
