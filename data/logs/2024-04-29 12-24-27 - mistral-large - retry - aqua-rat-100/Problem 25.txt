Question: A car is being driven, in a straight line and at a uniform speed, towards the base of a vertical tower. The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower?
Choices:
  A: 5(√3 + 1)
  B: 6(√3 + √2)
  C: 7(√3 – 1)
  D: 8(√3 – 2)
  E: None of these

## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The car is moving in a straight line towards the base of the tower. The angle of elevation changes from 45° to 60° in 10 minutes. Let's call the distance traveled by the car in these 10 minutes "x".

Using trigonometry, we can set up two equations:

1. tan(45°) = h/x+y
2. tan(60°) = h/x

where h is the height of the tower and y is the distance the car will travel after 10 minutes to reach the base of the tower.

Solving these equations, we get:

1. x+y = h
2. x = h/√3

Substituting x from the second equation into the first equation, we get:

y = h - h/√3 = h(1 - 1/√3) = h(√3 - 1)/√3

Now, we need to find the time it takes for the car to travel distance y. Since the car is moving at a uniform speed, the ratio of distances traveled is equal to the ratio of times taken. Therefore:

y/x = t/10

where t is the time it takes for the car to travel distance y.

Substituting the expressions for x and y from above, we get:

h(√3 - 1)/√3 / h/√3 = t/10

Simplifying this equation, we get:

t = 10(√3 - 1)
