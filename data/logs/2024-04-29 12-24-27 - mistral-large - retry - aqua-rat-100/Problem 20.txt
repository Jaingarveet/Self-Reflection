## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The initial ratio of boys to girls is 64:40, which simplifies to 4:2.5. However, the new ratio is 4:3. Let's assume that x boys and x girls joined the group.

The new number of boys is 64 + x, and the new number of girls is 40 + x.

The new ratio of boys to girls is (64 + x) / (40 + x) = 4/3.

Solving this equation for x gives x = 24.

So, 24 boys and 24 girls joined the group.

The total number of members in the group now is 64 (initial boys) + 40 (initial girls) + 24 (new boys) + 24 (new girls) = 152 + 48 = 200.

Action: Answer("C")

Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: E
