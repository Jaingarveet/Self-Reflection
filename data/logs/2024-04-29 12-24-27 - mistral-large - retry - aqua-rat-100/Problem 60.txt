## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: Points A, B, C, D lie in this order on the circumference of a circle. Minor arc AC is 160°, and minor arc BD is 150°. If B bisects minor arc AC, then what is the measure of minor arc AD?
Choices:
  A: 80°
  B: 130°
  C: 140°
  D: 160°
  E: 220°

## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Since B bisects minor arc AC, minor arc AB and minor arc BC are equal.
Let's call the measure of minor arc AB and minor arc BC x.
Then, x + x = 160° (since minor arc AC is 160°)
So, x = 80°

Now, minor arc AD is made up of minor arc AB and minor arc BD.
The measure of minor arc BD is 150°.
So, the measure of minor arc AD is x + 150° = 80° + 150° = 230°

However, the measure of a minor arc cannot be greater than 180°.
So, we need to subtract 180° from 230° to get the measure of minor arc AD.

Action: Answer("C") (140°)
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
