## Assistant 2:
Thought:
First, we can set up a proportion to relate the amount of falafel in pita breads to rolls: 6 pita breads = 2 rolls.
Then, we can set up another proportion to relate the amount of falafel in rolls to baguettes: 3 rolls = 5 baguettes.
We can combine these proportions to relate the amount of falafel in pita breads to baguettes: 6 pita breads = (2/3) \* 5 baguettes = 10/3 baguettes.
Finally, we can set up a proportion to relate the amount of falafel in baguettes to pita breads: 2 baguettes = x pita breads.
Substituting the value of 2 baguettes in terms of pita breads from the previous proportion, we get: (2/5) \* (10/3) = x.
Simplifying this equation, we get: x = 4/3.
Action: Answer("B")
