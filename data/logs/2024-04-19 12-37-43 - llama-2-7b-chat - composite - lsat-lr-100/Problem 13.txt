Context: Economics professor: Marty's Pizza and Checkers Pizza are the two major pizza parlors in our town. Marty's sold coupon books including coupons good for one large plain pizza at any local pizza parlor, at Marty's expense. But Checkers refused to accept these coupons, even though they were redeemed by all other local pizza parlors. Accepting them would have cost Checkers nothing and would have satisfied those of its potential customers who had purchased the coupon books. This shows that Checkers's motive in refusing to accept the coupons was simply to hurt Marty's Pizza.

  C: At least one company has refused to accept coupons issued by its major local competitor simply in order to hurt that competitor, even though those coupons were accepted by all other local competitors.
  D: Any company that accepts its major competitor's coupons helps its competitor by doing so, even if it also satisfies its own actual or potential customers.
  E: If accepting coupons issued by a competitor would not enable a company to satisfy its actual or potential customers, then that company's refusal to accept the coupons is motivated by the desire to satisfy customers.

Question: Which one of the following, if assumed, enables the economics professor's conclusion to be properly drawn?

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and after reflecting on the problem, my solution, and the correct answer, I realized that I made a mistake. The correct answer is (B) Any company that wishes to hurt a competitor by refusing to accept coupons issued by that competitor will refuse to accept them even when accepting them would cost nothing and would satisfy its potential customers.

Explanation:
The passage states that Checkers refused to accept the coupons issued by Marty's Pizza, even though all other local pizza parlors accepted them. This suggests that Checkers's motive in refusing to accept the coupons was solely to hurt Marty's Pizza, as accepting the coupons would have cost Checkers nothing and would have satisfied some of its potential customers. Therefore, option (B) is the correct answer.

Error Keywords:

* I mistakenly selected option (A) as the correct answer, which is incorrect.
* I did not consider the fact that Checkers's refusal to accept the coupons would have cost nothing and would have satisfied some of its potential customers, which is a crucial aspect of the problem.

Solution:
To correctly answer the question, I should have carefully read the passage and considered the fact that Checkers's refusal to accept the coupons would have cost nothing and would have satisfied some of its potential customers. This would have led me to select option (B) as the correct answer.

Advice:
When answering multiple-choice questions, it is essential to carefully read the passage and consider all the options before selecting the correct answer.
