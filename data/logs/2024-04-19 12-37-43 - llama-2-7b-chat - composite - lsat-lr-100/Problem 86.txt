Context: Until 1985 all commercial airlines completely replenished the cabin air in planes in flight once every 30 minutes. Since then the rate has been once every hour. The less frequently cabin air is replenished in a plane in flight, the higher the level of carbon dioxide in that plane and the easier it is for airborne illnesses to be spread.
Question: Which one of the following is most strongly supported by the information above?
Choices:
  A: In 1985 there was a loosening of regulations concerning cabin air in commercial airline flights.
  B: People who fly today are more likely to contract airborne illnesses than were people who flew prior to 1985.
  C: Low levels of carbon dioxide in cabin air make it impossible for airborne illnesses to spread.
  D: In 1980 the rate at which the cabin air was replenished in commercial airliners was sufficient to protect passengers from the effects of carbon dioxide buildup.
  E: In 1980 the level of carbon dioxide in the cabin air on a two-hour commercial airline flight was lower than it is today on a similar flight.
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
The correct answer is (E) [REDACTED]

The passage does not provide direct evidence to support options (A), (B), or (C). Option (D) is also incorrect because the passage does not mention anything about the rate of cabin air replenishment in 1980 being sufficient to protect passengers from the effects of carbon dioxide buildup.

The passage only provides information about the change in the frequency of cabin air replenishment from once every 30 minutes before 1985 to once every hour since then. This information suggests that the lower the frequency of cabin air replenishment, the higher the level of carbon dioxide in the cabin and the easier it is for airborne illnesses to be spread. Therefore, option (E) is the most strongly supported by the information above.

## Assistant 2:
  Reflection:

I previously answered this question incorrectly, selecting option (B) as the most strongly supported answer. However, upon further reflection, I realize that the passage does not provide sufficient evidence to support this answer. The passage only provides information about the change in the frequency of cabin air replenishment and the potential impact on the level of carbon dioxide in the cabin and the spread of airborne illnesses.

The correct answer is option (E), which states that in 1980, the level of carbon dioxide in the cabin air on a two-hour commercial airline flight was lower than it is today on a similar flight. This information is supported by the passage, which mentions that the level of carbon dioxide in the cabin air has increased since the 1980s.

Error Keywords:

* Solutions: The passage does not provide direct evidence to support options (A), (B), or (C).
* Instructions: The passage does not provide information about the instructions or guidelines for cabin air replenishment in commercial airline flights before 1985.
* Advice: The passage does not provide advice or recommendations for reducing the level of carbon dioxide in cabin air or preventing the spread of airborne illnesses.

Conclusion:
The correct answer is option (E), which states that in 1980, the level of carbon dioxide in the cabin air on a two-hour commercial airline flight was lower than it is today on a similar flight. This information is supported by the passage, which mentions that the level of carbon dioxide in the cabin air has increased since the 1980s.
