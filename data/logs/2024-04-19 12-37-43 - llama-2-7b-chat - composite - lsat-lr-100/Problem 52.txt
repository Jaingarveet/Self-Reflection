## System:
You are an expert in Law.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Context: If squirrels eat from a bird feeder, it will not attract many birds. However, squirrels eat from a bird feeder only if it lacks a protective cover. So a bird feeder will not attract many birds if it does not have a protective cover.
Question: The flawed pattern of reasoning in the argument above is most similar to that in which one of the following arguments?
Choices:
  A: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely, and if a tire wears out prematurely, a likely cause is that the pressure was too low. So if a car owner checks the tire pressure regularly, the tires will not wear out prematurely.
  B: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely. But tire pressure will become too low only if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly. So a tire will wear out prematurely if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly.
  C: Tires wear out prematurely if car owners neglect to check the tire pressure regularly. Unless car owners are unaware of this fact, they check the tire pressure regularly. So car owners need to be made aware of the consequences of neglecting to check the tire pressure.
  D: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely. But tire pressure will become too low if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly. Therefore, if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly, a tire will wear out prematurely.
  E: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely. But it will also wear out prematurely if it is often driven on gravel roads. Therefore, if a tire is often driven on gravel roads, keeping its pressure from becoming too low will not help it to last longer.

  Topic: Law
Question: The flawed pattern of reasoning in the argument above is most similar to that in which one of the following arguments?

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and upon reflection, I realized that I made a mistake in my reasoning. Here is my self-reflection:

Error Keywords:

* "So" (used to connect two independent clauses)
* "Unless" (used to express a condition that is contrary to fact)

Solution:
The correct answer is (B) If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely. But tire pressure will become too low only if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly. So a tire will wear out prematurely if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly.

Explanation:
The argument in the question is flawed because it uses the incorrect connectives "so" and "unless." The correct connectives to use are "therefore" and "if." The argument should read: "If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely. Therefore, if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly, a tire will wear out prematurely."

Advice:
When answering this question, it is important to carefully read the argument and identify the flawed connectives. Then, use the correct connectives to rephrase the argument in a logical and coherent way.
## Result:
Agent Answer: None
Correct Answer: B
