You are an expert in Law.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Law
Context: Although Pluto has an atmosphere and is much larger than any asteroid, Pluto is not a true planet. Pluto formed in orbit around the planet Neptune and was then ejected from orbit around Neptune when Triton, Neptune's largest moon, was captured by Neptune's gravity.
Question: The conclusion of the argument follows logically if which one of the following is assumed?
Choices:
  A: No celestial body can simultaneously be a moon and a planet.
  B: Not all celestial bodies that have an atmosphere and orbit the sun are true planets.
  C: If Pluto had not been ejected from its orbit around Neptune, Pluto would not have its current orbit around the sun and would still be a moon.
  D: The size of a celestial body in orbit around the sun is not relevant to determining whether or not it is a true planet.
  E: For a celestial body to be a true planet it must have formed in orbit around the sun exclusively.

## Assistant 2:
  Topic: Law
Context: Although Pluto has an atmosphere and is much larger than any asteroid, Pluto is not a true planet. Pluto formed in orbit around the planet Neptune and was then ejected from orbit around Neptune when Triton, Neptune's largest moon, was captured by Neptune's gravity.
Question: The conclusion of the argument follows logically if which one of the following is assumed?
Choices:
A: No celestial body can simultaneously be a moon and a planet.
B: Not all celestial bodies that have an atmosphere and orbit the sun are true planets.
C: If Pluto had not been ejected from its orbit around Neptune, Pluto would not have its current orbit around the sun and would still be a moon.
D: The size of a celestial body in orbit around the sun is not relevant to determining whether or not it is a true planet.
E: For a celestial body to be a true planet it must have formed in orbit around the sun exclusively.

Self-Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, selecting choice D: The size of a celestial body in orbit around the sun is not relevant to determining whether or not it is a true planet. However, upon further reflection, I realize that this answer is incorrect. The correct answer is choice B: Not all celestial bodies that have an atmosphere and orbit the sun are true planets.

Explanation:
The argument states that Pluto formed in orbit around the planet Neptune and was then ejected from orbit around Neptune when Triton, Neptune's largest moon, was captured by Neptune's gravity. This implies that Pluto is not a true planet, as it did not form in orbit around the sun exclusively. Therefore, the conclusion of the argument follows logically if the statement "Not all celestial bodies that have an atmosphere and orbit the sun are true planets" is assumed.

Advice:
When answering this question, it is important to carefully read and understand the argument being presented. Pay attention to the language used and the assumptions being made. In this case, the argument is based on the idea that Pluto formed in orbit around a planet, rather than exclusively in orbit around the sun. By understanding this, you can correctly identify the assumption that leads to the conclusion of the argument.
