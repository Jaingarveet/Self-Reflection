Topic: Law
Context: Cigarette companies claim that manufacturing both low-and high-nicotine cigarettes allows smokers to choose how much nicotine they want. However, a recent study has shown that the levels of nicotine found in the blood of smokers who smoke one pack of cigarettes per day are identical at the end of a day's worth of smoking, whatever the level of nicotine in the cigarettes they smoke.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain the finding of the nicotine study?
Choices:
  A: Blood cannot absorb more nicotine per day than that found in the smoke from a package of the lowest-nicotine cigarettes available.
  B: Smokers of the lowest-nicotine cigarettes available generally smoke more cigarettes per day than smokers of high-nicotine cigarettes.
  C: Most nicotine is absorbed into the blood of a smoker even if it is delivered in smaller quantities.
  D: The level of tar in cigarettes is higher in low-nicotine cigarettes than it is in some high-nicotine cigarettes.
  E: When taking in nicotine by smoking cigarettes is discontinued, the level of nicotine in the blood decreases steadily.

Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain the finding of the nicotine study?

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and after reflecting on the problem, my solution, and the correct answer, I realized that I misunderstood the information provided. Here is my self-reflection:

Error Keywords:

* Misunderstood the information provided
* Did not consider the correct explanation

Solution:
The correct answer is (C) Most nicotine is absorbed into the blood of a smoker even if it is delivered in smaller quantities.

Explanation:
The study found that the levels of nicotine found in the blood of smokers who smoke one pack of cigarettes per day are identical at the end of a day's worth of smoking, whatever the level of nicotine in the cigarettes they smoke. This suggests that the body absorbs most of the nicotine from cigarettes, regardless of the level of nicotine in the cigarettes. Therefore, option (C) is the best explanation for the finding of the nicotine study.

Advice:
When answering multiple-choice questions, it is essential to carefully read and understand the question and the options provided. It is also important to consider the context of the question and the information provided. In this case, I should have considered the fact that the body absorbs most of the nicotine from cigarettes, regardless of the level of nicotine in the cigarettes. By doing so, I would have arrived at the correct answer earlier.
