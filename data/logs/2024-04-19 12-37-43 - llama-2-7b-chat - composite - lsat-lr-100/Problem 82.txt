Context: Patricia: During Japan's Tokugawa period, martial arts experts known as ninjas were trained for the purposes of espionage and assassination. Yet at that time there was actually very little ninja activity in Japan, and most Japanese did not fear ninjas. Tamara: That is not true. Many wealthy Japanese during the Tokugawa period had their houses constructed with intentionally squeaky floors so that they would receive warning if a ninja were in the house.
Question: Of the following, which one, if true, is the strongest counter Patricia can make to Tamara's objection?
Choices:
  A: Many poor Japanese during the Tokugawa period also had houses constructed with intentionally squeaky floors.
  B: As part of their secret training, ninjas learned to walk on squeaky floors without making a sound.
  C: The wealthy made up a small portion of Japan's population during the Tokugawa period.
  D: The fighting prowess of ninjas was exaggerated to mythic proportions in the years following the Tokngawa period.
  E: There were very few ninjas at any time other than during the Tokugawa period.

Explanation:
Patricia can make a strong counterargument to Tamara's objection by pointing out that the ninjas were trained to be stealthy and quiet, which would have made it difficult for the wealthy Japanese to detect them even if they did have squeaky floors in their houses. This counterargument is the strongest option, [REDACTED]: [REDACTED]

The other options do not provide a strong counterargument:

[REDACTED]: While it is true that some poor Japanese during the Tokugawa period may have had houses with intentionally squeaky floors, this does not undermine Tamara's claim that the wealthy Japanese had their houses constructed with squeaky floors to detect ninjas.

[REDACTED]: The fact that the wealthy made up a small portion of Japan's population during the Tokugawa period does not directly address Tamara's claim that the wealthy Japanese had squeaky floors to detect ninjas.

[REDACTED]: While it is true that the fighting prowess of ninjas was exaggerated in the years following the Tokugawa period, this does not affect the fact that ninjas were trained to be stealthy and quiet, which would have made it difficult for the wealthy Japanese to detect them even if they did have squeaky floors in their houses.

[REDACTED]: The statement that the fighting prowess of ninjas was exaggerated to mythic proportions in the years following the Tokugawa period does not directly address Tamara's claim that the wealthy Japanese had squeaky floors to detect ninjas.

[REDACTED]: The statement that there were very few ninjas at any time other than during the Tokugawa period does not directly address Tamara's claim that the wealthy Japanese had squeaky floors to detect ninjas.

## Assistant 2:
  Of the options provided, the strongest counterargument that Patricia can make to Tamara's objection is:

[REDACTED]: The fact that the ninjas were trained to be stealthy and quiet, which would have made it difficult for the wealthy Japanese to detect them even if they did have squeaky floors in their houses.

This counterargument directly addresses Tamara's claim that the wealthy Japanese had squeaky floors to detect ninjas, by pointing out that the ninjas were trained to be stealthy and quiet, which would have made it difficult for the wealthy Japanese to detect them even with squeaky floors. This counterargument undermines Tamara's claim and supports Patricia's argument that there was little fear of ninjas during the Tokugawa period.
