# Model: gpt-35-turbo | Agent: unredacted | Exam: sat-math-100 | Problem 49 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Assistant 2:
[Self-reflection: To solve this problem, I cross-multiplied to get rid of the denominators and simplified the equation. Then, I compared the coefficients of $x$ on both sides of the equation and set them equal to each other. This gave me a quadratic equation in terms of $a$, which I solved using factoring or the quadratic formula. After checking the answer choices, I realized that I made a sign error in my calculations, which led me to choose the wrong answer. I corrected my mistake and arrived at the correct answer, which is $a=16$.]
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
