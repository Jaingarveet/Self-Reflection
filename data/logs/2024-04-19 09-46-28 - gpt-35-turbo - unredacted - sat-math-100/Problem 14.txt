## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Assistant 2:
Reflection:
To find the linear relationship between $x$ and $y$, we need to find the equation of the line that passes through the points $(a,0)$, $(3a,-a)$, and $(5a,-2a)$. We can start by finding the slope of the line using any two of the points. For example, using the first and second points, we get:
$$\text{slope}=\frac{-a-0}{3a-a}=-\frac{a}{2a}=-\frac{1}{2}$$
Now we can use the point-slope form of the equation of a line to find the equation of the line. Using the first point $(a,0)$, we get:
$$y-0=-\frac{1}{2}(x-a)$$
Simplifying, we get:
$$y=-\frac{1}{2}x+\frac{1}{2}a$$
Multiplying both sides by 2, we get:
$$2y=-x+a$$
Adding $5a$ to both sides, we get:
$$2y+x=5a$$
Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B) } x+2y=5a}$.
