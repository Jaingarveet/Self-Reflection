## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: Mr. Kohl has a beaker containing $n$ milliliters of solution to distribute to the students in his chemistry class. If he gives each student 3 milliliters of solution, he will have 5 milliliters left over. In order to give each student 4 milliliters of solution, he will need an additional 21 milliliters. How many students are in the class?
Choices:
  A: 16
  B: 21
  C: 23
  D: 26
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
My algebraic setup was correct, but I made a mistake in solving the equations.
The correct setup of equations is:
3x + 5 = n
4x + 21 = n
Subtracting the first equation from the second, we get:
x + 16 = 0
x = -16
Since the number of students cannot be negative, this answer is not valid.
The correct answer can be found by solving for 'n' using either of the two equations and then dividing by the amount of solution each student gets.
n = 3x + 5
n = 4x + 21
Substituting the second equation into the first, we get:
3x + 5 = 4x + 21
x = 16
Therefore, there are 16 students in the class.
Error Keywords:
 - Algebraic error
 - Calculation error
 - Equation solving error
Solution:
Let's use algebra to solve the problem.
Let's assume there are 'x' students in the class.
If each student gets 3 milliliters of solution, then the total amount of solution required is 3x milliliters.
If Mr. Kohl has 5 milliliters left over, then the total amount of solution he has is 3x + 5 milliliters.
If each student gets 4 milliliters of solution, then the total amount of solution required is 4x milliliters.
If Mr. Kohl needs an additional 21 milliliters, then the total amount of solution he needs is 4x + 21 milliliters.
We can set up two equations using the above information and solve for 'x'.
3x + 5 = n
4x + 21 = n
Subtracting the first equation from the second, we get:
x + 16 = 0
x = -16
Since the number of students cannot be negative, this answer is not valid.
The correct answer can be found by solving for 'n' using either of the two equations and then dividing by the amount of solution each student gets.
n = 3x + 5
n = 4x + 21
Substituting the second equation into the first, we get:
3x + 5 = 4x + 21
x = 16
Therefore, there are 16 students in the class.
