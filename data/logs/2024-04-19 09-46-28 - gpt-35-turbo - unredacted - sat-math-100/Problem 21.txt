## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Explanation:
I used the correct formula but made a mistake in the calculation.
The correct solution is $x=-2 \pm \sqrt{2}$.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Quadratic formula error
 - Square root error
Solution:
We can solve the quadratic equation using the quadratic formula: $x=\frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^{2}-4 a c}}{2 a}$, where $a=3, b=12,$ and $c=6$.
Substituting the values, we get:
$x=\frac{-12 \pm \sqrt{12^{2}-4 \cdot 3 \cdot 6}}{2 \cdot 3}$
$x=\frac{-12 \pm \sqrt{144-72}}{6}$
$x=\frac{-12 \pm \sqrt{72}}{6}$
$x=\frac{-12 \pm 6 \sqrt{2}}{6}$
$x=-2 \pm \sqrt{2}$
Instructions:
1. Identify the coefficients of the quadratic equation.
2. Substitute the values into the quadratic formula.
3. Simplify the expression using arithmetic operations.
4. Simplify the expression using square roots.
5. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
6. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always use the correct formula for the problem.
 - Always substitute the values correctly.
 - Always simplify the expression step-by-step.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that the square root of a number is the value that, when multiplied by itself, gives the original number.
