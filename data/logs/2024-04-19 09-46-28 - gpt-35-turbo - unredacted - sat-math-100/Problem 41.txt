# Model: gpt-35-turbo | Agent: unredacted | Exam: sat-math-100 | Problem 41 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: \begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}\hline$x$ & $f(x)$ \\\hline0 & 3 \\\hline2 & 1 \\\hline4 & 0 \\\hline5 & -2 \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}The function $f$ is defined by a polynomial. Some values of $x$ and $f(x)$ are shown in the table above. Which of the following must be a factor of $f(x)$ ?
Choices:
  A: $x-2$
  B: $x-3$
  C: $x-4$
  D: $x-5$

Explanation:
I used the Factor Theorem correctly but made an error in my calculations. 
I checked which of the choices makes $f(a)=0$ but made a mistake in the calculation for choice A. 
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Algebraic error
 - Substitution error
Solution:
We can use the Factor Theorem to determine which of the choices is a factor of $f(x)$.
If $x-a$ is a factor of $f(x)$, then $f(a)=0$.
We can check which of the choices makes $f(a)=0$.
For choice A, $f(2)=1$, so $x-2$ is not a factor of $f(x)$.
For choice B, $f(3)$ is not given, so we cannot determine if $x-3$ is a factor of $f(x)$.
For choice C, $f(4)=0$, so $x-4$ is a factor of $f(x)$.
For choice D, $f(5)=-2$, so $x-5$ is not a factor of $f(x)$.
Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) } x-4}$.
Instructions:
1. Understand the Factor Theorem and how it applies to polynomial functions.
2. Identify the given values of $x$ and $f(x)$ in the table.
3. For each choice, substitute the given value of $x$ into the expression $x-a$.
4. Evaluate $f(a)$ using the given value of $a$.
5. If $f(a)=0$, then $x-a$ is a factor of $f(x)$.
6. Choose the answer that makes $f(a)=0$.
7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always use the given information to your advantage.
 - Always check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that the Factor Theorem can help you determine factors of polynomial functions.
