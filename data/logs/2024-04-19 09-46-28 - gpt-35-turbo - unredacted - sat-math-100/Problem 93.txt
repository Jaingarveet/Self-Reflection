Question: \begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|}\cline { 3 - 5 }\multicolumn{2}{c|}{} & \multicolumn{3}{c|}{Course} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{} \\\cline { 2 - 5 }\multicolumn{2}{c|}{} & Algebra I & Geometry & $\begin{array}{c}\text { Algebra } \\ \text { II }\end{array}$ & \multirow{2}{*}{Total} \\\hline\multirow{2}{*}{Gender} & Female & 35 & 53 & 62 &  \\\cline { 2 - 5 }& Male & 44 & 59 & 57 & 160 \\\hline& Total & 79 & 112 & 119 & 310 \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}A group of tenth-grade students responded to a survey that asked which math course they were currently enrolled in. The survey data were broken down as shown in the table above. Which of the following categories accounts for approximately 19 percent of all the survey respondents?

  A: Females taking Geometry
  B: Females taking Algebra II
  C: Males taking Geometry
  D: Males taking Algebra I
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I made a calculation error while finding 19% of the total number of students in the survey. 
I multiplied 0.19 by 310 instead of dividing it by 100. 
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Percentage error
 - Arithmetic error
Solution:
Total number of students in the survey = 310
19% of 310 = (19/100) x 310 = 58.9 â‰ˆ 59
Now, we need to compare the numbers in each category to see which one is closest to 59.
Males taking Geometry have 59 students, which is the closest to 59.
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and understand the problem.
2. Identify the total number of students in the survey.
3. Calculate the percentage of the total number of students that accounts for approximately 19%.
4. Compare the numbers in each category to find the closest one to the calculated value.
5. Choose the answer that matches the closest category.
6. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that percentages are calculated by dividing the percentage by 100.
