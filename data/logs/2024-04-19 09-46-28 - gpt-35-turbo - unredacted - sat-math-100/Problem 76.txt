Action: Answer("A") 
Explanation:
I solved for $x$ correctly, but I made an error in finding $\frac{x}{5}$. 
I incorrectly calculated $\frac{x}{5}$ as 2 instead of 10.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Division error
 - Misinterpretation of the question
Solution:
\begin{align*}
\frac{5}{x}&=\frac{15}{x+20}\\
5(x+20)&=15x\\
5x+100&=15x\\
10x&=100\\
x&=10\\
\frac{x}{5}&=\frac{10}{5}\\
\frac{x}{5}&=\boxed{\textbf{(C) }2}
\end{align*}
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and understand what is being asked.
2. Cross-multiply to solve for $x$.
3. Substitute the value of $x$ to find $\frac{x}{5}$.
4. Double-check your calculations and final answer.
5. Answer the question in the correct format.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand what is being asked.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Always answer the question in the correct format.

## Assistant 2:
Note: I apologize for my previous mistake. Here is the correct answer.
Action: Answer("A") 
Explanation:
\begin{align*}
\frac{5}{x}&=\frac{15}{x+20}\\
5(x+20)&=15x\\
5x+100&=15x\\
10x&=100\\
x&=10\\
\frac{x}{5}&=\frac{10}{5}\\
\frac{x}{5}&=\boxed{\textbf{(A) }10}
\end{align*}
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
