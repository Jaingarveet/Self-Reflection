Context: Music and literature, rivals among the arts, have not coexisted without intruding on each other's terrain. Ever since what we think of as "literature" developed out of the sounds of spoken, sung, and chanted art, writing bas aspired to the condition of music, in which fonn contnbutes significantly to content. Nowhere is this truer than in the African American tradition, whose music is often considered its greatest artistic achievement and one of the greatest contributions to North American art. But while many African American writers have used musicians and music as theme and metaphor in their writing, none had attempted to draw upon a musical genre as the structuring principle for an entire novel until Toni Morrison did so in her 1992 novel Jazz, a novel set in the Harlem section of New York City in 1926 . In Jazz, the connection to music is found not only in the novel's plot but, more strikingly, in the way in which the story is told. The narration slips easily from the third-person omniscience of the narrator's disembodied voice-which, though sensitive and sympathetic, claims no particular identity, gender, or immersion in specific social circumstances-to the first-person lyricism of key characters. But throughout these shifts, the narrator is both generous with the characters' voices and protective of his or her mastery over the narrative as a whole. On the one hand, the central characters are given the responsibility of relating their parts of the overarching story, but on the other hand, their sections are set offby quotation maIks, reminders that the narrator is allowing them to speak.. In this way, the narrative is analogous in structure to the playing of a jazz hand which intertwines its ensemble sound with the individuality of emhedded solo perfunnances. In jazz, composer and conductor Duke Ellington was the first to construct his compositions with his individual musicians and their unique "voices" in mind. Yet no matter how lengthy his musicians' improvisations, no matter how bold or inventive their solos might be, they always performed within the undeniable logic of the composer's frame-they always, in other words, performed as ifwith quotation marks ar01md their improvisations and solos. It is this same effect that Toni Morrison has achieved in Jazz, a literary rendering of an art of composition that Duke Ellington perfected around the time in which Jazz is set. In this novel, Morrison has found a way, paradoxically, to create the sense of an ensemble of characters improvising within the fixed scope of a carefully constructed collective narration. By simulating the style of a genius of music while exhibiting Morrison's own linguistic virtuosity, Jazz serves to redefine the very possibilities of narrative point of view.
Question: The author's discussion in the first paragraph proceeds in which one of the following ways?
Choices:
  A: from a common claim about the arts, to a denial of this claim as applied to a particular artistic tradition, to a hypothesis about a particular individual
  B: from a general remark about two art forms, to a similar observation about a particular artistic tradition, to a specific comment about a particular work that exemplifies the prior remarks
  C: from a description ofa common claim about two art fonns, to some specific evidence that supports that claim, to an inference regarding a particular individual to whom that claim applies
  D: from an observation about a specific art fonn, to a more general claim about the applicability of that observation to other art forms, to a particular counterexample to the first obsetvation
  E: from general comments about the arts, to a purported counterexample to the general comments as applied to a particular artistic tradition, to a description of a particular work that bears out the original comments

Explanation:
The author's discussion in the first paragraph proceeds from a general remark about two art forms (music and literature) to a similar observation about a particular artistic tradition (African American literature and music) to a specific comment about a particular work (Toni Morrison's Jazz) that exemplifies the prior remarks.

## Assistant 2:
  Action: Answer(B)

Explanation:
The author's discussion in the first paragraph proceeds from a general remark about two art forms (music and literature) to a similar observation about a particular artistic tradition (African American literature and music) to a specific comment about a particular work (Toni Morrison's Jazz) that exemplifies the prior remarks. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.

The correct answer is B: from a general remark about two art forms, to a similar observation about a particular artistic tradition, to a specific comment about a particular work that exemplifies the prior remarks.

The author's discussion in the first paragraph starts with a general remark about the relationship between music and literature, then focuses on the African American tradition, and finally, specifically comments on Toni Morrison's Jazz. Therefore, option B best describes the author's approach.

The other options do not accurately describe the author's discussion in the first paragraph:

Option A: The author does not deny a claim about the arts, nor does the discussion proceed from a common claim to a hypothesis about a particular individual.

Option C: The author does not describe a common claim about two art forms, nor does the discussion proceed from specific evidence to an inference regarding a particular individual.

Option D: The author does not make a more general claim about the applicability of a particular observation to other art forms, nor does the discussion include a particular counterexample to the first observation.

Option E: The author does not make general comments about the arts, nor does the discussion include a purported counterexample to the general comments as applied to a particular artistic tradition.
