Context: David Warsh's book describes a great contradiction inherent in economic theory since 1776, when Adam Smith published The Wealth of Nations. Warsh calls it the struggle between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand. Using the example of a pin factory, Smith emphasized the huge increases in efficiency that could be achieved through increased size. The pin factory's employees, by specializing on narrow tasks, produce far more than they could if each worked independently. Also, Smith was the first to recognize how a market economy can harness self-interest to the common good, leading each individual as though "by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention." For example, businesses sell products that people want, at reasonable prices, not because the business owners inherently want to please people but because doing so enables them to make money in a competitive marketplace. These two concepts, however, are opposed to each other. The parable of the pin factory says that there are increasing returns to scale—the bigger the pin factory, the more specialized its workers can be, and therefore the more pins the factory can produce per worker. But increasing returns create a natural tendency toward monopoly, because a large business can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than a small business. So given increasing returns, bigger firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business, until each industry is dominated by just a few players. But for the invisible hand to work properly, there must be many competitors in each industry, so that nobody can exert monopoly power. Therefore, the idea that free markets always get it right depends on the assumption that returns to scale are diminishing, not increasing. For almost two centuries, the assumption of diminishing returns dominated economic theory, with the Pin Factory de-emphasized. Why? As Warsh explains, it wasn't about ideology; it was about following the line of least mathematical resistance. Economics has always had scientific aspirations; economists have always sought the rigor and clarity that comes from representing their ideas using numbers and equations. And the economics of diminishing returns lend themselves readily to elegant formalism, while those of increasing returns-the Pin Factory- are notoriously hard to represent mathematically. Many economists tried repeatedly to bring the Pin Factory into the mainstream of economic thought to reflect the fact that increasing returns obviously characterized many enterprises, such as railroads. Yet they repeatedly failed because they could not state their ideas rigorously enough. Only since the late 1970s has this "underground river" -a term used to describe the role of increasing returns in economic thought-surfaced into the mainstream of economic thought. By then, economists had finally found ways to describe the Pin Factory with the rigor needed to make it respectable.

Choices:
  A: resolve an ambiguity inherent in the metaphor of the Invisible Hand
  B: illustrate the difficulty of stating the concept of the Pin Factory with mathematical rigor
  C: call attention to the increasing prevalence of industries that have characteristics of the Pin Factory
  D: point to an industry that illustrates the shortcomings of economists' emphasis on the Invisible Hand
  E: present an example of the high levels of competition achieved in transportation industries

You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
The reference to railroads serves to [REDACTED]. The passage states that railroads are an example of a business that exhibits increasing returns to scale, similar to the Pin Factory. The mention of railroads highlights the fact that many industries in the real world, like railroads and pin factories, have increasing returns to scale, which poses a challenge to the traditional assumption of diminishing returns in economic theory. This example supports the idea that the Pin Factory concept is relevant and important in understanding the realities of the economy. Therefore, choice [REDACTED] is the best answer.

Error Keywords:
- Increasing returns
- Diminishing returns
- Pin Factory
- Invisible Hand
- Railroads

Solution:
1. Identify the main contradiction in economic theory described in the passage.
2. Understand the concept of the Pin Factory and how it relates to increasing returns.
3. Recognize the challenge that increasing returns pose to the traditional assumption of diminishing returns.
4. Identify the example of railroads as a business that exhibits increasing returns to scale.
5. Understand how the reference to railroads supports the idea that the Pin Factory concept is relevant and important in understanding the realities of the economy.
6. Choose the answer that best describes the function of the reference to railroads in the passage.
