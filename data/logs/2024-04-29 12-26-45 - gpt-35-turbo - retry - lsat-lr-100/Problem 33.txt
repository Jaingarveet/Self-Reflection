Context: Physician: In an experiment, 50 patients with chronic back pain were divided into two groups. Small magnets were applied to the backs of one group; the other group received no treatment. Most of the patients in the first group, but very few in the second group, reported a significant reduction in pain. This shows that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, constitutes the logically strongest counter to the physician's argument?
Choices:
  A: A patient's merely knowing that a treatment has been applied can lead to improvement in his or her condition.
  B: Most physicians believe that medication relieves chronic back pain more effectively than magnets do.
  C: No other experiments have been done showing that magnetic fields reduce pain in any area other than the back.
  D: Some of the scientists who helped design the experiment believed even before the experiment that magnetic fields relieve back pain, but they were not directly involved in conducting the experiment.
  E: There was wide variation in the specific causes of the chronic back pain suffered by the patients in the experiment.

## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The physician's argument is that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain because most of the patients in the first group reported a significant reduction in pain. To counter this argument, we need to find a statement that weakens the conclusion. 
Option A suggests that the patients' knowledge of receiving treatment could have led to improvement in their condition, which means that the improvement in the first group could be due to a placebo effect rather than the magnetic fields. This weakens the conclusion that magnetic fields are effective in relieving back pain.
Option B is irrelevant to the argument.
Option C is also irrelevant to the argument.
Option D is not strong enough to counter the physician's argument.
Option E is also irrelevant to the argument.
Action: Answer("A")
