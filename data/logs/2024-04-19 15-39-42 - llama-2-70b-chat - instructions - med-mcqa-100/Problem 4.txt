  I apologize for my previous mistake. Let's evaluate the options again:

Option A: 100 mg iron + 500 mcg folic acid
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends 30-60 mg of iron and 400-500 mcg of folic acid for pregnant women. This option exceeds the recommended dosage of iron but meets the recommended dosage of folic acid.

Option B: 60 mg iron + 500 mcg folic acid
This option meets the recommended dosage of iron and folic acid.

Option C: 60 mg iron + 100 mcg folic acid
This option does not meet the recommended dosage of folic acid.

Option D: 100 mg iron + 100 mcg folic acid

Considering the WHO recommendations and verifying the dosages, the correct answer is Option B: 60 mg iron + 500 mcg folic acid.
