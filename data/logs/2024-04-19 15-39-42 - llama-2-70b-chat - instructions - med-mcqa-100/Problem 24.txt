Question: Which antithyroid drug can be safely used in pregnancy?
Choices:
  A: Propylthiouracil
  B: I121
  C: Methimazole
  D: Carbimazole

Reflection:
In my previous response, I incorrectly answered this question. After reflecting on the problem, my solution, and the correct answer, I realized that I should have chosen option C, Methimazole.

To answer this question, I will follow these steps:

1. Identify the antithyroid drug that is safe to use during pregnancy.

Research shows that Methimazole is generally considered safe for use during pregnancy. Although it does cross the placenta, it has not been linked to an increased risk of congenital abnormalities.

2. Research the safety profile of each antithyroid drug.

Propylthiouracil (option A) has been associated with an increased risk of congenital abnormalities, including aplastic anemia and choanal atresia.

I121 (option B) is not a commonly used antithyroid drug, and its safety profile during pregnancy is not well established.

Carbimazole (option D) is metabolized to Methimazole, which is why it is not considered safe for use during pregnancy.

3. Choose the drug with the lowest risk of adverse effects during pregnancy.

Based on the available research, Methimazole (option C) has the lowest risk of adverse effects during pregnancy.
