Question: In Spondylolisthesis, which of the following is NOT useful investigation?
Choices:
  A: Anteroposterior X-ray
  B: Lateral view X-ray
  C: CT
  D: MRI

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly. After reflecting on the problem, my solution, and the correct answer, I realized that my mistake was due to a lack of understanding of the condition being discussed. Spondylolisthesis is a condition where a vertebra in the spine slips out of place, either forward or backward. To diagnose this condition, imaging studies are essential.

Action: Answer("D")

Explanation:
The correct answer is D: MRI. Although MRI is a valuable imaging tool for many musculoskeletal conditions, it is not the most useful investigation for diagnosing Spondylolisthesis. The slippage of the vertebra can be best visualized on X-rays, either anteroposterior or lateral view. Therefore, options A and B are both useful investigations for diagnosing Spondylolisthesis. CT scans can also be helpful in some cases, but they are not as sensitive as X-rays for detecting early slippage. MRI is not the most useful investigation for diagnosing Spondylolisthesis, as it may not visualize the slippage directly.

Therefore, the answer is D: MRI.
