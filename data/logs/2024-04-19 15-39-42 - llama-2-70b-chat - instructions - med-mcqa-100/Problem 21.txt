Choices:
  A: Vivax malaria
  B: Ovale malaria
  C: Falciparum malaria
  D: Quartan malaria

Reflection:
Previously, I incorrectly answered this question as choice A, Vivax malaria.
However, upon reflection, I realized that the question is asking about the type of malaria that attacks senescent red blood cells (RBCs).
Senescent RBCs are near the end of their lifespan and are more prone to being attacked by the immune system.
Therefore, the correct answer is choice C, Falciparum malaria, as it is the only type of malaria that attacks senescent RBCs.
