Question: A patient underwent lateral skull base surgery few months back and has presented with complaints of recurrent aspirations. There is no change in voice of the patient. Which of the following nerve is most likely injured during surgery?
Choices:
  A: Vagus nerve
  B: Glossopharyngeal nerve
  C: SLN nerve
  D: RLN nerve
Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly. After reflecting on the problem, my solution, and the correct answer, I realized that I misunderstood the symptoms and medical history of the patient. I mistakenly chose the vagus nerve, which is responsible for voice changes, but the patient's voice remains unchanged.

Re-evaluating the patient's symptoms and medical history, I noted that the patient experienced recurrent aspirations after undergoing lateral skull base surgery. The glossopharyngeal nerve is responsible for the sensation of swallowing and helps coordinate the act of swallowing. Damage to this nerve during surgery could result in recurrent aspirations.

Therefore, the correct answer is B: Glossopharyngeal nerve.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
