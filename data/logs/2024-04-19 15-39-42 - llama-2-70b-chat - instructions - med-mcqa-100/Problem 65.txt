Question: Treatment for post-radiation skin lesion like desquamation: March 2013 (e)

Reflection:

1. Identify the type of skin lesion (desquamation)
Desquamation is a type of skin lesion that involves the shedding of the outer layer of skin cells, leading to skin peeling or sloughing off.

2. Recognize that post-radiation skin lesions typically resolve on their own
Post-radiation skin lesions, including desquamation, typically resolve on their own without any specific treatment. The body's natural healing process takes over, and the skin repairs itself over time.

Based on the above reflection, the correct answer is [REDACTED]: Observation alone.

Action: Answer("B")
