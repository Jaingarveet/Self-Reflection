Question: Investigation of choice in pyloric stenosis-
Choices:
  A: USG
  B: UGI series
  C: CT
  D: MRI
Reflection:
Previously, I answered this question incorrectly, selecting option A, USG.
However, upon reflection, I realized that USG is not the best diagnostic tool for pyloric stenosis.
The clinical presentation of pyloric stenosis includes vomiting, abdominal pain, and constipation.
Imaging plays a crucial role in diagnosing pyloric stenosis, and the preferred modality is UGI (Upper GI) series.
UGI series is the best choice for diagnosing pyloric stenosis because it can clearly show the narrowing or obstruction of the pylorus, which is the hallmark of the condition.
Therefore, the correct answer is option B, UGI series.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
