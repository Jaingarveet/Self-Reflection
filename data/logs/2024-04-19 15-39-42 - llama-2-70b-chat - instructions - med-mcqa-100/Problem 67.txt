Question: Major complication of cyst-gastrostomy for pseudo pancreatic cyst is?
Choices:
  A: Infection
  B: Obstruction
  C: Fistula
  D: Hemorrhage

Reflection:
Previously, I answered this question incorrectly, selecting option A: Infection. However, upon further review, I realized that the correct answer is option C: Fistula.

Cyst-gastrostomy is a surgical procedure that aims to drain a pseudo pancreatic cyst by creating a connection between the cyst and the stomach. One of the major complications of this procedure is the formation of a fistula, which is an abnormal connection between two organs or between an organ and the skin.

A fistula can develop when the communication between the cyst and the stomach is not properly established or when there is a defect in the closure of the gastrostomy site. This can lead to a persistent leak of gastric contents into the peritoneal cavity, causing peritonitis, sepsis, and other life-threatening complications.

Therefore, option C: Fistula is the correct answer.

Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
