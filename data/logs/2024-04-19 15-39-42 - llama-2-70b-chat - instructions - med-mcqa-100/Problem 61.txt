Question: Which is the COMMONEST type of seizure in newborn?
Choices:
  A: Clonic
  B: Tonic
  C: Myoclonic
  D: Subtle

Reflection:
Previously, I answered this question incorrectly. After reflecting on the problem, my solution, and the correct answer, I realized that I needed to further my knowledge of seizures in newborns.

Action: Answer("D")

Explanation:
Subtle seizures are the most common type of seizure in newborns. They are characterized by subtle signs and symptoms, such as a brief loss of muscle tone, a blank stare, or a slight tremor. These seizures can be easily missed, and it is essential to recognize their importance and seek prompt medical evaluation and treatment for newborns with seizures.

In contrast, clonic seizures are characterized by rhythmic jerking movements of the limbs, while tonic seizures are characterized by a sudden increase in muscle tone. Myoclonic seizures are characterized by sudden, brief muscle jerks or twitches. While these types of seizures can also occur in newborns, they are less common than subtle seizures.

Therefore, the correct answer is D: Subtle.
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
