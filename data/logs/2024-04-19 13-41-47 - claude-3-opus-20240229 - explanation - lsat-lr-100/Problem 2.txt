Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that answer choice [REDACTED] must be true based on the given information. However, the question asks which statement must be true, not which statement could be true. While [REDACTED] could be true, it is not necessarily true based on the given information.
## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The Lac Nichoutec Film Festival only shows Canadian films.
2. This year, most of the films that won prizes at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival also won prizes at international film festivals.
3. From these two statements, we can deduce that some Canadian films won prizes at international film festivals this year. If most prize winners at the Lac Nichoutec festival (which only shows Canadian films) also won at international festivals, then it must be true that some Canadian films won at international festivals.
4. Looking at the answer choices:
A) This can't be concluded from the given information. We don't know what proportion of Canadian films shown at international festivals won prizes at Lac Nichoutec.
B) The information doesn't say anything about what proportion of Canadian films were shown at Lac Nichoutec. 
C) This matches our deduction from step 3 - some Canadian films must have won prizes at international festivals this year.
D) and E) We can't make any definite conclusions about films that won at Lac Nichoutec but didn't win internationally, or vice versa. The information only tells us about the overlap, not the differences.
Therefore, C is the only statement that must be true based on the given information.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
