  Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand that I made a mistake in my calculation. I will use my self-reflection to help me answer the question correctly this time.

The problem states that the Type A trees produced 20 percent more pears than the Type B trees. This means that if the Type A trees produced 144 pears, the Type B trees produced 144 x 0.8 = 115 pears.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 120 pears.
