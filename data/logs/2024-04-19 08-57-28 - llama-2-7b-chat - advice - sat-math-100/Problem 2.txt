## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

## Assistant 2:
  Thought: I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand that the correct answer is $B: 8 x y^2 - 6 y^2$.

Reflection: I made a mistake in my initial solution by simplifying the expression without properly distributing the $x$ and $y$ terms. I realized that the expression can be simplified by first distributing the $x$ term to the $y$ term, and then combining like terms. This gives us $8 x y^2 - 6 y^2$, which is the correct answer.

Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
