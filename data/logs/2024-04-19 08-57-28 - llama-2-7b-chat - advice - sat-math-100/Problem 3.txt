## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Assistant 2:
  Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand that I made a mistake in my solution. To solve this problem, I will approach it step-by-step and use visual aids to help me visualize the problem and find the solution.

Step 1: Simplify the fractions
I will simplify the fractions by dividing both numerators and denominators by the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the fractions, which is 3.

$$\frac{3}{5} = \frac{3 \times 2}{5 \times 2} = \frac{6}{10}$$

$$\frac{4}{3} = \frac{4 \times 2}{3 \times 2} = \frac{8}{6}$$

Step 2: Equate the simplified fractions
I will equate the simplified fractions:

$$\frac{3}{5} = \frac{4}{3}$$

Step 3: Solve for $w$
I will solve for $w$ by multiplying both sides of the equation by the denominator of the left-hand side, which is 5:

$$5 \times \frac{3}{5} = 5 \times \frac{4}{3}$$

$$3 = 4$$

The value of $w$ is 4.

Action: Answer("B")
