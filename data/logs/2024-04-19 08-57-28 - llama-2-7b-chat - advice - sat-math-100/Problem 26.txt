## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand now that I made a mistake in my reasoning. I will follow the steps I should have taken to solve the problem correctly.

Step 1: Write the two polynomials in the form $ax^2 + bx + c$, where $a, b, c$ are constants.

For the first polynomial, $3x^2 - 5x + 2 = 3(x^2 - 2x + 1) + 2$.

For the second polynomial, $5x^2 - 2x - 6 = 5(x^2 - 2x + 1) - 6$.

Step 2: Combine like terms.

$8x^2 - 7x - 4 = 3(x^2 - 2x + 1) + 2 - 7x + 4$.

$8x^2 + 7x - 4 = 3(x^2 - 2x + 1) - 7x + 4$.

Step 3: Simplify the expressions.

$8x^2 - 7x - 4 = 3x^2 - 5x + 2$.

$8x^2 + 7x - 4 = 3x^2 - 7x + 4$.

The sum of the two polynomials is $3x^2 - 7x + 6$.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C): $8 x^{2}-7 x-4$.

I will make sure to follow these steps in the future and to double-check my calculations to ensure that I arrive at the correct answer.
