## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Assistant 2:
  Thought: 
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand the mistake. The parabola intersects the line at two points, $A$ and $B$, and the length of $\overline{A B}$ is the distance between these two points.

Action:
I will use the equation of the parabola and the line to find the length of $\overline{A B}$.

$$y = (x-11)^2$$
$$y = 25$$

Subtracting the equation of the line from the equation of the parabola, we get:

$$(x-11)^2 - 25 = 0$$

Solving for $x$, we get:

$$x = 11 + 12\sqrt{25} = 11 + 30 = 41$$

Now, we need to find the distance between $A$ and $B$. Let $A$ be the point where the parabola intersects the line, and let $B$ be the point where the line intersects the parabola.

$$\overline{A B} = \sqrt{(41 - 11)^2} = \sqrt{30}$$

Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
