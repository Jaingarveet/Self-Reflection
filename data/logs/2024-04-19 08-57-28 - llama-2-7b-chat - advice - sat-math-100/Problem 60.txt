## Assistant 2:
  Thought: I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I need to rethink my solution.

Action: Let's analyze the problem again. If Mr. Kohl gives each student 3 milliliters of solution, he will have 5 milliliters left over. This means that the total amount of solution he has is $n$ milliliters. If he wants to give each student 4 milliliters of solution, he will need an additional $21$ milliliters.

Reflection: I realized that I made a mistake in my previous answer. The total amount of solution Mr. Kohl has is $n$ milliliters, and he needs an additional $21$ milliliters to give each student 4 milliliters. Therefore, the number of students in the class is $n + 21$.

Answer: The correct answer is (B) $21$.
## Result:
Agent Answer: None
Correct Answer: D
