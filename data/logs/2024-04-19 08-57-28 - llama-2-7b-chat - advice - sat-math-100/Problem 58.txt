## Assistant 2:
  Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and after reflecting on the problem, my solution, and the correct answer, I understand that my mistake was due to a misunderstanding of the inequality symbols.

To solve the system of inequalities, we need to isolate the variable $y$ on one side of the inequality symbols.

For the first inequality, $y < x + a$, we can isolate $y$ by subtracting $x$ from both sides:

$$y - x < a$$

For the second inequality, $y > x + b$, we can isolate $y$ by adding $x$ to both sides:

$$y > a + b$$

Now, we can see that if $(0,0)$ is a solution to the system of inequalities, then $a > b$.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) $b > a$.
