## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

## Assistant 2:
  Thought: I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand that the correct answer is $\frac{8^{x}}{2^{y}} = 2^{6}$.

Reflection: I made a mistake in my previous answer by misunderstanding the expression $\frac{8^{x}}{2^{y}}$. I realized that the expression is a fraction, and the numerator and denominator are both powers of 2. I also noticed that the problem states that $3x - y = 12$, which means that $x = 4$ and $y = 9$. Therefore, the value of $\frac{8^{x}}{2^{y}} = \frac{8^{4}}{2^{9}} = 2^{6}$.

Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
