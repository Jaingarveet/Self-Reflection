## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")

Question: $$y=a(x-2)(x+4)$$In the quadratic equation above, $a$ is a nonzero constant. The graph of the equation in the $x y$-plane is a parabola with vertex $(c, d)$. Which of the following is equal to $d$ ?
Choices:
  A: $-9 a$
  B: $-8 a$
  C: $-5 a$
  D: $-2 a$
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Advice:

* Always check your work by setting the equation to $y = 0$ and solving for $x$.
* Be careful when factoring quadratic expressions to ensure that you are factoring correctly.
* Use the correct coordinate system when plotting the graph of the parabola.
* Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
## Assistant 2:
  Thought: 
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I am reflecting on my mistake. I realized that I did not factor the quadratic expression correctly, and I mistakenly chose the wrong value for $d$.

Action: I will re-solve the equation and choose the correct answer.

$$y = a(x-2)(x+4)$$

Setting $y = 0$, we get:

$$0 = a(x-2)(x+4)$$

Factoring the expression, we get:

$$0 = a(x-2)^2(x+4)$$

So, the vertex of the parabola is at $(2, 4)$.

Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
