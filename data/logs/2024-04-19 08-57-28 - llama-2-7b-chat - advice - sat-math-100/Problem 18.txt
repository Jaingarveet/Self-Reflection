# Model: llama-2-7b-chat | Agent: advice | Exam: sat-math-100 | Problem 18 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Advice:

* Always read the question carefully and understand the problem before answering.
* Always decompose complex problems into smaller, manageable subproblems.
* Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
* Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
* Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
* Remember that the power of a number is the result of raising it to that power, not the result of adding it to itself.
## Assistant 2:
  Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand now that I made a mistake in my reasoning. Here's what happened:

I read the question and saw that $9$ was the base, and the exponent was $\frac{3}{4}$. I thought that the equivalent of $9^{\frac{3}{4}}$ would be $\sqrt[3]{9}$, but I made a mistake in my calculation.

To find the equivalent of $9^{\frac{3}{4}}$, I should have decomposed the problem into smaller subproblems. First, I should have raised $9$ to the power of $\frac{3}{4}$, which is equal to $3$. Then, I should have taken the square root of $3$, which is equal to $\sqrt{3}$.

So, the correct answer is (C): $\sqrt{3}$.

Advice:

* Always read the question carefully and understand the problem before answering.
* Always decompose complex problems into smaller, manageable subproblems.
* Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
* Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
* Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
