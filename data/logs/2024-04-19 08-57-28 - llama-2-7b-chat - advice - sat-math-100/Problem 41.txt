## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Assistant 2:
  Reflection:

I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand now that the factor of the polynomial must be a linear expression. I will use the given information to determine the factor of the polynomial.

The degree of the polynomial is 1, and the constant term is 3. The coefficients of the polynomial are 1, 2, and -2.

To find the factor of the polynomial, I will use the following steps:

1. Factor out the constant term: $f(x) = 3x - 2$
2. Factor out the highest degree term: $f(x) = (x - 2)(x + 1)$

Therefore, the factor of the polynomial is $x - 2$.

Action: Answer("A")
