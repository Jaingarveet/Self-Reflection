## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: $$0.10 x+0.20 y=0.18(x+y)$$Clayton will mix $x$ milliliters of a $10 \%$ by mass saline solution with $y$ milliliters of a $20 \%$ by mass saline solution in order to create an $18 \%$ by mass saline solution. The equation above represents this situation. If Clayton uses 100 milliliters of the $20 \%$ by mass saline solution, how many milliliters of the $10 \%$ by mass saline solution must he use?
Choices:
  A: 5
  B: 25
  C: 50
  D: 100

## Assistant 2:
  Thought: I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand that the equation represents a proportion. To find the amount of the $10\%$ by mass saline solution needed, I can use the cross-multiplication method.

$$0.10x + 0.20y = 0.18(x+y)$$

$$0.10x = 0.18(x+y) - 0.20y$$

$$x = \frac{0.18(x+y) - 0.20y}{0.10}$$

$$x = \frac{0.18(100) - 0.20(50)}{0.10}$$

$$x = 120$$

So, if Clayton uses 100 milliliters of the $20\%$ by mass saline solution, he must use 120 milliliters of the $10\%$ by mass saline solution.

Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
