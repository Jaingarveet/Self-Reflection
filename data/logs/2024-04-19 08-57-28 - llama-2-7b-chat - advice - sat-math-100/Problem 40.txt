## Assistant 2:
  Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I realize now that I made a mistake in my calculation. I did not read the question carefully enough and misunderstood the problem. I will make sure to be more careful and attentive to the question in the future.

To solve this problem, I will use the information provided in the question. If $20 - x = 15$, then we can set up the equation:

$20 - x = 15$

Subtracting $x$ from both sides gives us:

$15 = x$

So, the value of $3x$ is $45$.

Action: Answer("C")
