## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Advice:

* Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
* Always identify the formula of the function and simplify it to find the solution.
* Always check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
* Remember that the value of a function at a point is equal to the value of the function at that point multiplied by the coefficient of the variable.
## Assistant 2:
  Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand now that the mistake was in simplifying the formula of the function. I will make sure to read the question carefully and understand the problem before answering.

For the function $g(x) = a x^2 + 24$, we can simplify it as follows:

$$g(x) = a x^2 + 24 = a(x^2 + 24/a)$$

Now, given that $g(4) = 8$, we can find the value of $g(-4)$ by multiplying $g(4)$ by the coefficient of the variable $x$:

$$g(-4) = a(-4)^2 + 24 = -16 + 24 = 8$$

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 8.

Action: Answer("A")
