## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Assistant 2:
  Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand that I made a mistake in my solution. To solve this equation, I will break it down into smaller steps and use visual aids to help me understand the problem and find the solution.

Step 1: Simplify the equation by combining like terms.
$$\frac{x^{2}-1}{x-1} = -2$$
$$\frac{x^{2}}{x-1} = -2$$
Step 2: Use the quadratic formula to solve for $x$.
$$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^{2}-4ac}}{2a}$$
In this case, $a = 1$, $b = -2$, and $c = 1$.
$$x = \frac{-(-2) \pm \sqrt{(-2)^{2}-4(1)(1)}}{2(1)}$$
$$x = \frac{2 \pm \sqrt{4-8}}{2}$$
$$x = \frac{2 \pm \sqrt{-4}}{2}$$
$$x = \frac{2 \pm 2}{2}$$
$$x = \frac{4}{2}$$
$$x = 2$$

Therefore, the values of $x$ that satisfy the equation are $x = 2$.

Action: Answer("C")
