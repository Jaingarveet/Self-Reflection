I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand the mistake. I will reflect on the problem, my solution, and the correct answer to ensure accuracy.

Action:

1. Simplify the expression $(7+3i) + (-8+9i)$ by combining like terms:

$$= 7 + 3i - 8 + 9i = 7 + 3i - 17i = -10 + 3i$$

2. Now, add the expression $(-10 + 3i) + (-6i)$:

$$= -10 + 3i - 6i = -13 + 3i$$

The correct answer is (C): $15+12i$.

Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
