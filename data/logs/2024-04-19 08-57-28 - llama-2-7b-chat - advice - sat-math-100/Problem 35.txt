## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

## Assistant 2:
  Thought:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand that the correct solution is $\sqrt{4x} = x - 3$. I will reflect on my previous solution and the correct solution to determine the values of $x$ that satisfy the equation.

Action:
I will start by simplifying the equation: $\sqrt{4x} = x - 3$.

$$\sqrt{4x} = x - 3$$

$$2x = 3x - 6$$

$$x = 3$$

Therefore, the values of $x$ that satisfy the equation are $x = 3$.

Answer: (C) I and II.
