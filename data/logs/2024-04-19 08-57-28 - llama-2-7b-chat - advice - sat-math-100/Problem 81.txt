## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Assistant 2:
  Thought: I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand that the correct answer is (C) $(4 a + 4 b)^2$.

Reflection: I made a mistake in my previous answer by simplifying the expression $(a^2 + b^2) + 8y$ without properly accounting for the fact that $ab = y$. I see now that the correct solution is to first simplify the expression $(a^2 + b^2) + 8y$ by combining like terms, which gives us $(4a + 4b)^2$.

Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
