You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.

Question: Dreams Recalled during One Week\begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|}\hline& None & 1 to 4 & 5 or more & Total \\\hline\hlineGroup X & 15 & 28 & 57 & 100 \\\hlineGroup Y & 21 & 11 & 68 & 100 \\\hlineTotal & 36 & 39 & 125 & 200 \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}The data in the table above were produced by a sleep researcher studying the number of dreams people recall when asked to record their dreams for one week. Group X consisted of 100 people who observed early bedtimes, and Group Y consisted of 100 people who observed later bedtimes. If a person is chosen at random from those who recalled at least 1 dream, what is the probability that the person belonged to Group Y ?
Choices:
  A: $\frac{68}{100}$
  B: $\frac{79}{100}$
  C: $\frac{79}{164}$
  D: $\frac{164}{200}$

## Assistant 2:
  Reflection:

I previously answered this question incorrectly by calculating the probability of belonging to Group Y without considering the information provided in the table. I realized my mistake and reflected on the problem, my solution, and the correct answer.

To calculate the probability of belonging to Group Y, we need to find the number of people in Group Y who recalled at least 1 dream, which is 68. Then, we can use the formula for probability to calculate the probability of belonging to Group Y:

Probability of belonging to Group Y = Number of people in Group Y who recalled at least 1 dream / Total number of people who recalled at least 1 dream

Substituting the values given in the table, we get:

Probability of belonging to Group Y = 68 / 100 = 0.68

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) $\frac{79}{100}$.
