## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Assistant 2:
  Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand now that I made a mistake in my calculation. I will take my time and work step-by-step through the problem to ensure accuracy.

The question asks for the value that is equal to $a^{\frac{2}{3}}$ for all values of $a$.

Option A, $\sqrt{a^{\frac{1}{3}}}$, is not the correct answer.

Option B, $\sqrt{a^{3}}$, is also not the correct answer.

Option C, $\sqrt[3]{a^{\frac{1}{2}}}$, is not the correct answer.

Option D, $\sqrt[3]{a^{2}}$, is also not the correct answer.

After reevaluating the problem, I have determined that the correct answer is Option A, $\sqrt{a^{\frac{1}{3}}}$.

Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
