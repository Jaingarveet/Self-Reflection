## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

## Assistant 2:
  Thought: 
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I am now reflecting on my solution and the correct answer.

Action: Plug in -1 for x in the function f(x) = (x+3)/2.
f(-1) = (âˆ’1 + 3)/2
= (4)/2
= 2

Answer: B

Reflection:
I made a mistake in my previous answer by simplifying the fraction without properly canceling the common denominator. I corrected this mistake by plugging in -1 for x and simplifying the fraction correctly. It is important to always check my work by plugging in different values and verifying the results to ensure accuracy.
