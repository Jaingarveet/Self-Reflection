## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Assistant 2:
  Thought: I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand that the correct solution involves factoring the expression inside the parentheses. I will carefully analyze the problem again to find the correct answer.

Action:

1. Factor the expression inside the parentheses: $(a x+2)(b x+7) = 15 x^{2} + c x + 14$
2. Use the given condition $a + b = 8$ to find the values of $a$ and $b$.
3. Solve for $c$ by using the fact that the expression inside the parentheses is equal to $15 x^{2} + c x + 14$.

Reflection:

I realized that I made a mistake in my previous answer by not factoring the expression inside the parentheses. Thankfully, I caught the error and was able to continue with the problem.

To find the values of $c$, I used the given condition $a + b = 8$ to determine that $a = 4$ and $b = 4$. Then, I solved for $c$ by using the fact that the expression inside the parentheses is equal to $15 x^{2} + c x + 14$.

The two possible values for $c$ are $3$ and $5$.

Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
