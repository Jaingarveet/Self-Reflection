Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I underestimated the duration of Hepatitis [REDACTED] virus shedding in faeces. I knew that the shedding begins before the symptoms appear and continues after the onset of symptoms, but I was mistaken about the exact duration.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Hepatitis A virus is shed in the feces of an infected person before the onset of symptoms and during the first few weeks of illness. Therefore, the virus shedding in feces occurs both before and after the symptoms appear.
