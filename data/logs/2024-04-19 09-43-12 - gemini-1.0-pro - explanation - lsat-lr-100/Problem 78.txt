## Assistant 2:
I understand. I will use my self-reflection to answer this question correctly.
**Self-reflection:**
* **Problem:** I incorrectly identified the assumption required by the argument.
* **Solution:** I need to carefully analyze the argument and identify the missing information that is necessary for the argument to be valid.
* **Correct answer:** D
**Answer:**
Action: Answer("D")
**Explanation:**
The argument assumes that currently, most Acme employees have a commute of less than 30 minutes. This assumption is necessary because the argument claims that once the company moves to Ocean View, most employees will have a commute of more than 30 minutes. If most employees already had a commute of more than 30 minutes, then the move to Ocean View would not significantly change their commute times.
The other answer choices are not required assumptions of the argument.
* **A:** The argument does not require assuming that all Acme employees can afford housing within a 30-minute commute of Milltown. It only requires assuming that most employees cannot afford housing within a 30-minute commute of Ocean View.
* **B:** The argument does not require assuming that the chairperson of Acme has good financial reasons for wanting to move the company to Ocean View. It only requires assuming that the chairperson wants to move the company.
* **C:** The argument does not require assuming that none of Acme's employees except the chairperson are in favor of moving the company to Ocean View. It only requires assuming that most employees will have a commute of more than 30 minutes if the company moves.
* **E:** The argument does not require assuming that Acme's move to Ocean View will not be accompanied by a significant pay raise for Acme employees. It only requires assuming that most employees will have a commute of more than 30 minutes if the company moves.
