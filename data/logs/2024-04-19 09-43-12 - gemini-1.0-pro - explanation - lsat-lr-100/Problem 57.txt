## User 2:
Topic: Law
Context: Medical researcher: Scientists compared a large group of joggers who habitually stretch before jogging to an equal number of joggers who do not stretch before jogging. Both groups of joggers incurred roughly the same number of injuries. This indicates that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would most weaken the medical researcher's argument?
Choices:
  A: For both groups of joggers compared by the scientists, the rate of jogging injuries during the study was lower than the overall rate of jogging injuries.
  B: Among the joggers in the groups compared by the scientists, many of those previously injured while jogging experienced difficulty in their efforts to perform stretches.
  C: Most jogging injuries result from falls, collisions, and other mishaps on which the flexibility resulting from stretching would have little if any effect.
  D: The more prone a jogger is to jogging injuries, the more likely he or she is to develop the habit of performing stretches before jogging.
  E: Studies have found that, for certain forms of exercise, stretching beforehand can reduce the severity of injuries resulting from that exercise.

Explanation:
## Assistant 2:
The correct answer is C.
The medical researcher's argument is that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries. This argument is based on the observation that two groups of joggers, one of which stretched before jogging and the other of which did not, incurred roughly the same number of injuries.
Choice C weakens this argument by pointing out that most jogging injuries result from falls, collisions, and other mishaps on which the flexibility resulting from stretching would have little if any effect. In other words, even if stretching did help to prevent injuries, it would not be relevant to the types of injuries that most commonly occur in jogging.
The other choices do not weaken the medical researcher's argument. Choice A strengthens the argument by suggesting that stretching may actually be beneficial. Choice B is irrelevant because it does not address the question of whether stretching prevents injuries. Choice D is irrelevant because it does not address the question of whether stretching prevents injuries. Choice E is irrelevant because it does not address the question of whether stretching prevents jogging injuries.
Therefore, the correct answer is C.
