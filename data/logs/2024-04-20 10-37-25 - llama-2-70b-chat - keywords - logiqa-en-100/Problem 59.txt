## Assistant 2:
  Sure! Here's my reflection on the problem:

When I first encountered this problem, I tried to solve it by randomly assigning the employees to different departments without considering the conditions given in the problem. However, I quickly realized that this approach was not working, as I was unable to satisfy all the conditions simultaneously.

I then decided to take a step back and carefully read through the conditions again. I noticed that condition (1) states that H and Y must be allocated in the same department. Condition (2) states that F and G cannot be allocated in the same department. Condition (3) states that if X is allocated in the sales department, W is allocated in the production department. Condition (4) states that F must be allocated in the production department.

Using these conditions, I tried to create a valid assignment of employees to departments. I started by assigning F to the production department, as required by condition (4). Then, I assigned H and Y to the same department, satisfying condition (1). Next, I assigned G to the production department, as it cannot be in the same department as F, according to condition (2).

After that, I assigned X to the sales department, which automatically placed W in the production department, satisfying condition (3). Finally, I assigned I to the sales department, leaving only one employee, W, in the production department.

Therefore, the correct answer is option A: Public Relations Department? W; Production Department? F, H, Y; Sales Department? G, I, X.

I hope this reflection helps me answer the question correctly this time.
