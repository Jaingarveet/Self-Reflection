## Assistant 2:
  My apologies for my previous mistake. After reflecting on the problem, I realized that my previous answer was incorrect. The correct answer is D: Most people who follow this blogger's article are their loyal fans.

The blogger's conclusion that "Most people agree with me" is based on the fact that 85% of the follow-up posts agree with their opinion. However, this conclusion is flawed due to sampling bias. The sample of people who follow the blogger's articles and leave comments is not representative of the general population. The blogger's fans are more likely to agree with their opinions, creating a biased sample.

Therefore, option D is the best choice to question the blogger's conclusion. It highlights the possibility that the majority of people who follow the blogger's articles are their loyal fans, which could contribute to the biased sample and undermine the validity of the conclusion.

In contrast, option A does not directly address the sampling bias issue. Option B mentions the possibility that the blogger's other articles with higher approval ratings could be wrong, but this does not necessarily question the conclusion based on the biased sample. Option C acknowledges that some objections to the post are more fully justified, but this does not directly challenge the sampling bias either.
