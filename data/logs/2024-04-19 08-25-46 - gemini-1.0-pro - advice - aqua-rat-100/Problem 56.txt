## Assistant 2:
I understand. I will use my self-reflection to answer this question correctly.
**Self-Reflection:**
* **Mistake:** I initially calculated the total interest paid incorrectly, which led me to choose the wrong answer.
* **Reasoning:** I did not carefully consider the number of installments and the amount paid per installment.
* **Correction:** I will now calculate the total interest paid accurately and use that information to determine the interest rate.
**Solution:**
* Total amount paid = 12 installments * Rs.31.50/installment = Rs.378
* Total interest paid = Rs.378 - Rs.360 = Rs.18
* Interest rate = (Total interest paid / Principal amount) * 100% = (Rs.18 / Rs.360) * 100% = 5%
**Answer:**
Action: Answer("D")

Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
