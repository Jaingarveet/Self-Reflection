## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The team lost 30% of their matches, which means they lost 30/100 = 0.3 of their matches.
Let x be the total number of matches the team played.
The number of matches they lost is 0.3x.
We know they won 20 matches, so the total number of matches played is x = 20 + 0.3x.
Solving for x, we get x = 30.
Therefore, the team lost 0.3x = 0.3 * 30 = 9 matches.
