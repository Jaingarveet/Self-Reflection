## Assistant 2:
I understand. I will use my self-reflection to answer this question correctly.
**Self-reflection:**
* **Mistake:** I initially chose the wrong answer because I did not correctly interpret the relationship between the amounts received by the nephews, daughters, and sons.
* **Solution:** I need to carefully analyze the given information and set up equations to represent the relationships between the amounts.
* **Correct answer:** I will use the following steps to solve the problem:
1. Let x be the amount each nephew receives.
2. Each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, so each daughter receives 4x.
3. Each son receives five times as much as each nephew, so each son receives 5x.
4. The total amount received by the nephews is 2x.
5. The total amount received by the daughters is 4x * 4 = 16x.
6. The total amount received by the sons is 5x * 5 = 25x.
7. The total amount divided is Rs 8600, so we have the equation: 2x + 16x + 25x = 8600.
8. Simplifying the equation, we get 43x = 8600.
9. Solving for x, we get x = 200.
10. Therefore, each daughter receives 4x = 4 * 200 = Rs 800.
**Action:** Answer("E")
