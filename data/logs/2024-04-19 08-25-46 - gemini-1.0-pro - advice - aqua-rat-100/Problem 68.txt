## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Advice:
 - Remember that the product of two integers is equal to the product of their GCF and LCM.
 - Remember that the GCF is a factor of both integers, while the LCM is a multiple of both integers.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
## Assistant 2:
**Self-Reflection:**
* **Mistake:** I initially chose the wrong answer because I did not consider the relationship between the GCF, LCM, and the two integers.
* **Solution:** I realized that the product of the two integers is equal to the product of their GCF and LCM. Therefore, I can find the other integer by dividing the product of the GCF and LCM by the given integer.
* **Correct Answer:** 
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
