Topic: Math
Question: A car is being driven, in a straight line and at a uniform speed, towards the base of a vertical tower. The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower?
Choices:
  A: 5(√3 + 1)
  B: 6(√3 + √2)
  C: 7(√3 – 1)
  D: 8(√3 – 2)
  E: None of these

## Assistant 2:
I understand. I will use my self-reflection to answer this question correctly.
**Thought:**
* The car is moving at a uniform speed, so the distance traveled is proportional to the time elapsed.
* The angle of elevation is changing at a constant rate, which means the car is approaching the tower at a constant rate.
* We can use trigonometry to relate the angle of elevation to the distance between the car and the tower.
**Solution:**
Let $h$ be the height of the tower, $d$ be the distance between the car and the tower, and $t$ be the time elapsed.
From the angle of elevation of 45°, we have:
$$\tan 45° = \frac{h}{d} = 1$$
From the angle of elevation of 60°, we have:
$$\tan 60° = \frac{h}{d - 10v} = \sqrt{3}$$
where $v$ is the speed of the car.
Solving for $d$ in the first equation, we get:
$$d = h$$
Substituting this into the second equation, we get:
$$\sqrt{3} = \frac{h}{h - 10v}$$
Solving for $v$, we get:
$$v = \frac{h}{10(\sqrt{3} - 1)}$$
The time it takes for the car to reach the base of the tower is:
$$t = \frac{d}{v} = \frac{h}{\frac{h}{10(\sqrt{3} - 1)}} = 10(\sqrt{3} - 1)$$
Therefore, the answer is **A: 5(√3 + 1)**.
**Self-reflection:**
* I made a mistake in my previous attempt by not considering the constant rate of approach.
* I have learned the importance of carefully analyzing the problem and using all the given information.
* I will continue to practice my problem-solving skills to avoid making similar mistakes in the future.
