## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Assistant 2:
I understand. I will use my self-reflection to answer this question correctly.
**Self-Reflection:**
* **Mistake:** I initially calculated the area of the remaining paper by subtracting the area of the two semicircles from the area of the square. However, this approach is incorrect because it does not account for the overlap between the semicircles.
* **Correction:** To address this mistake, I need to calculate the area of the overlap and subtract it from the area of the two semicircles before subtracting it from the area of the square.
**Solution:**
1. **Area of the square:** 20 cm * 20 cm = 400 cm²
2. **Area of one semicircle:** (π * (20 cm)²)/4 = 100π cm²
3. **Area of two semicircles:** 2 * 100π cm² = 200π cm²
4. **Area of the overlap:** (π * (10 cm)²)/4 = 25π cm²
5. **Area of the remaining paper:** 400 cm² - (200π cm² - 25π cm²) = 400 cm² - 175π cm² ≈ 8.75 cm²
**Action:** Answer("C")
