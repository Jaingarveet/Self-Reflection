## Assistant 2:
Self-reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly because I did not consider the area of the yard. I only considered the width of one side.
To solve this problem, I need to use the formula for the area of a rectangle: area = length x width.
I know that the area of the yard is 3,000 square feet and the width of one side is 100 feet.
I can plug these values into the formula and solve for the length of the other side:
3,000 square feet = length x 100 feet
length = 3,000 square feet / 100 feet
length = 30 feet
Therefore, the length of the other side of the yard is 30 feet.
Action: Answer("A")
