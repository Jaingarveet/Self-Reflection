## Assistant 2:
I understand. I will use my self-reflection to answer this question correctly.
**Thought:**
* The percentage of black marbles pulled out the second time is 1/20 = 5%.
* This percentage represents the percentage of black marbles in the bag.
* Let Q be the total number of marbles in the bag.
* The number of black marbles in the bag is 0.05Q.
* Since 20 black marbles were added to the bag, the total number of black marbles is 0.05Q + 20.
* The total number of marbles in the bag is Q + 20.
* We know that 0.05Q + 20 = 0.05(Q + 20).
* Solving for Q, we get Q = 380.
**Action:** Answer("C")
