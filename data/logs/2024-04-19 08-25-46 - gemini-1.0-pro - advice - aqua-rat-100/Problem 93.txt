## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
I need to solve the equation step-by-step to find the value of the missing number.
First, I will simplify the denominator: 13 × 13 - 156 = 169 - 156 = 13.
Then, I will multiply both sides of the equation by 13: (5 + ? × 19 - 15 - 7) = 6 × 13.
Next, I will simplify the left side of the equation: 5 + ? × 19 - 15 - 7 = ? × 19 - 17.
Then, I will add 17 to both sides of the equation: ? × 19 = 6 × 13 + 17.
Next, I will simplify the right side of the equation: ? × 19 = 95.
Finally, I will divide both sides of the equation by 19: ? = 95/19 = 5.
Action: Answer("C")
