# Model: gemini-1.0-pro | Agent: advice | Exam: aqua-rat-100 | Problem 60 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: Points A, B, C, D lie in this order on the circumference of a circle. Minor arc AC is 160°, and minor arc BD is 150°. If B bisects minor arc AC, then what is the measure of minor arc AD?
Choices:
  A: 80°
  B: 130°
  C: 140°
  D: 160°
  E: 220°

Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Advice:
- Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
- Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
- Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
- Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
- Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
- Remember that the measure of a minor arc is always positive, even if the result of your initial calculation is negative.
## Assistant 2:
Self-reflection:
I made a mistake in my previous answer because I did not carefully read the question and understand the problem. I assumed that B was the midpoint of minor arc AC, which was not stated in the question. As a result, I calculated the measure of minor arc AD incorrectly.
To avoid making the same mistake again, I will carefully read the question and understand the problem before attempting to solve it. I will also decompose the problem into multiple simple steps and think through each subproblem step-by-step. I will not skip any steps and will be explicit in each step of my reasoning. I will double-check my calculations and final answer. Finally, I will remember that the measure of a minor arc is always positive, even if the result of my initial calculation is negative.
Thought:
Since B bisects minor arc AC, the measure of minor arc AB is half the measure of minor arc AC, which is 160°/2 = 80°.
The measure of minor arc AD is the sum of the measures of minor arcs AB and BD, which is 80° + 150° = 230°.
However, the measure of a minor arc cannot be greater than 180°, so the measure of minor arc AD is 230° - 180° = 50°.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
