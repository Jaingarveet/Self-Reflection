## Assistant 2:
## Self-reflection on previous incorrect answer:
**Mistake:** I incorrectly calculated the cost price by dividing the selling price by the profit percentage instead of dividing by one plus the profit percentage.
**Corrected approach:**
1. **Identify the selling price:** The selling price is given as Rs. 360.
2. **Convert the profit percentage to a decimal:** 20% is equal to 0.2.
3. **Calculate the cost price:** Cost price = Selling price / (1 + profit percentage) = 360 / (1 + 0.2) = 360 / 1.2 = Rs. 300.
Therefore, the cost price of the article is Rs. 300.
**Action:** Answer("B") 
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
