## Assistant 2:
## Self-Reflection on Previous Incorrect Answer:
**Mistake:** I incorrectly calculated the number of members in the club based on the given information.
**Reasoning:** I did not consider the fact that the age difference between members is 3 months, not years. This led to an overestimation of the number of members.
**Correction:** To accurately calculate the number of members, we need to convert the age difference from months to years. 
## Step-by-Step Solution:
1. **Convert the age difference to years:** 3 months = 0.25 years.
2. **Let x be the number of members in the club.**
3. **The sum of the ages of all members can be expressed as an arithmetic series:** 7 + (7 + 0.25) + (7 + 0.25*2) + ... + (7 + 0.25*(x-1)).
4. **The sum of an arithmetic series can be calculated using the formula:** `Sn = n/2 * (a + l)`, where `Sn` is the sum of the series, `n` is the number of terms, `a` is the first term, and `l` is the last term.
5. **Substitute the values into the formula:** `250 = x/2 * (7 + (7 + 0.25*(x-1)))`.
6. **Simplify and solve for x:** `500 = x * (14 + 0.25x)`.
7. **This equation is quadratic. We can solve it by factoring or using the quadratic formula.** 
8. **Factoring gives us:** `x = 20` or `x = -25`. 
9. **Since the number of members cannot be negative, the correct answer is x = 20.**
