## Assistant 2:
## Self-Reflection on Previous Incorrect Answer:
**Previous Incorrect Answer:** C: 500
**Reasoning for Previous Answer:**
1. I calculated the total number of small cubes in the hollow cube: (5-2)^3 = 27.
2. I then calculated the surface area of the hollow cube: 6 * (5^2 - (5-2)^2) = 90.
3. Assuming each small cube has 6 faces, I multiplied the surface area by the number of small cubes: 90 * 27 = 2430.
4. I then subtracted the number of faces on the outer surface (90) to get the number of unpainted faces: 2430 - 90 = 2340.
5. However, I realized that this approach counted the inner faces of the hollow cube as unpainted, which is incorrect.
**Corrected Approach:**
1. The number of small cubes on each face of the hollow cube is (5-2)^2 = 9.
2. The total number of faces on the small cubes is 6 * 9 = 54.
3. The number of faces on the outer surface of the hollow cube is 6.
4. Therefore, the number of unpainted faces is 54 - 6 = 48.
