## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: Amy is organizing her bookshelves and finds that she has 10 different types of books. She then codes each book with either a single letter or a pair of two different letters. If each type of book is uniquely represented by either a single letter or pair of letters, what is the smallest number of letters Amy will need to create the codes for all 10 types of books? (Assume the order of letters in a pair does not matter.)
Choices:
  A: 3
  B: 4
  C: 5
  D: 10
  E: 20

## Assistant 2:
Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly because I did not consider the possibility of using two letters to represent a single type of book. I assumed that each book would be represented by a single letter, which is not the case.
To solve this problem, we need to consider the number of unique codes that can be created using different combinations of letters.
If we use only single letters, we can create 26 unique codes (A-Z).
If we use pairs of letters, we can create 26 * 26 = 676 unique codes (AA, AB, AC, ..., ZZ).
Therefore, the smallest number of letters Amy will need to create the codes for all 10 types of books is 3. She can use 26 single letters and 4 pairs of letters to create a total of 30 unique codes, which is more than enough for the 10 types of books.
Action: Answer("C")
