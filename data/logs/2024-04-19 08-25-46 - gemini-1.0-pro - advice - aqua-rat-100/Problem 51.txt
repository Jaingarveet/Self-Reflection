# Model: gemini-1.0-pro | Agent: advice | Exam: aqua-rat-100 | Problem 51 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: R, S, T, and U are points on a line, and U is the midpoint of line segment ST. If the lengths of line segments RS, RT, and ST are 5, 17, and 22, respectively. What is the length of line segment RU?
Choices:
  A: 6
  B: 7
  C: 8
  D: 9
  E: 10
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Advice:
- Carefully read the problem and identify all given information.
- Pay close attention to keywords like "midpoint" and "difference."
- Visualize the problem using a diagram or sketch.
- Break down the problem into smaller, more manageable steps.
- Double-check your calculations and reasoning before selecting an answer.
## Assistant 2:
Self-reflection:
* I initially made a mistake by assuming that U was the midpoint of line segment RT instead of ST.
* I did not carefully read the problem and misinterpreted the given information.
* I did not visualize the problem using a diagram, which would have helped me identify my error.
* I did not break down the problem into smaller steps, which would have made it easier to solve.
* I did not double-check my calculations and reasoning before selecting an answer.
Action: 
* Carefully read the problem and identify all given information.
* Pay close attention to keywords like "midpoint" and "difference."
* Visualize the problem using a diagram or sketch.
* Break down the problem into smaller, more manageable steps.
* Double-check my calculations and reasoning before selecting an answer.
Solution:
* Since U is the midpoint of line segment ST, the length of line segment RU is half the length of line segment ST.
* The length of line segment ST is 22, so the length of line segment RU is 22 / 2 = 11.
