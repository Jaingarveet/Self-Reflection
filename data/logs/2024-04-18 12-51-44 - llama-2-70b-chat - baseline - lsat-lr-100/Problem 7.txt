## User 2:
Topic: Law
Context: Radio producer: Our failure to attract new listeners over the past several years has forced us to choose between devoting some airtime to other, more popular genres of music, and sticking with classical music that appeals only to our small but loyal audience. This audience, however loyal, did not generate enough advertising revenue for us to pay our bills, so if we appeal to them alone, our station risks going out of business. We should not take that risk. We should, therefore, devote some airtime to other, more popular genres of music.
Question: Which one of the following arguments is most similar in its pattern of reasoning to that used by the radio producer?
Choices:
  A: We should either buy blinds for the windows or make full-length curtains. Blinds would be very expensive to purchase. Thus, if cost is our greatest concern, we should make curtains.
  B: We should either make curtains for the windows or buy blinds. Since the windows are not standard sizes, if we buy blinds we will have to special order them. Since we do not have time to wait for special orders, we should make the curtains.
  C: For the living room windows, we can make curtains or valances or both. We want to have privacy; and while curtains provide privacy, valances do not. So we should make curtains but not valances.
  D: Since we have very little fabric, we will have to either buy more, or make valances instead of curtains. However, if we use this fabric to make valances, then we will have to buy blinds. Since it would be hard to buy fabric that matches what we already have, we should buy blinds.
  E: We should either buy blinds or make curtains for the windows. If we buy blinds but do not make valances, the windows will look bare. We should not have bare windows. So if we do not make the curtains, we should make the valances.
## Assistant 2:
  Answer: B

Explanation:
The radio producer's argument is similar in pattern to choice B. Both arguments present two options, and then present a reason why one of the options is not feasible or desirable. In the producer's argument, the station cannot afford to stick with classical music alone, so they must devote some airtime to other genres. In choice B, the person cannot afford to buy blinds, so they should make curtains. Both arguments use the "or" conjunction to present the two options and then use a reason to eliminate one of the options.
