Context: There are two kinds of horror stories: those that describe a mad scientist's experiments and those that describe a monstrous beast. In some horror stories about monstrous beasts, the monster symbolizes a psychological disturbance in the protagonist. Horror stories about mad scientists, on the other hand, typically express the author's feeling that scientific knowledge alone is not enough to guide human endeavor. However, despite these differences, both kinds of horror stories share two features: they describe violations of the laws of nature and they are intended to produce dread in the reader.
Question: If the statements above are true, which one of the following would also have to be true?
Choices:
  A: All descriptions of monstrous beasts describe violations of the laws of nature.
  B: Any story that describes a violation of a law of nature is intended to invoke dread in the reader.
  C: Horror stories of any kind usually describe characters who are psychologically disturbed.
  D: Most stories about mad scientists express the author's antiscientific views.
  E: Some stories that employ symbolism describe violations of the laws of nature.
## Assistant 2:
  Answer: "B: Any story that describes a violation of a law of nature is intended to invoke dread in the reader."

Explanation:
The passage states that both horror stories about monstrous beasts and mad scientists describe violations of the laws of nature and are intended to produce dread in the reader. Therefore, it logically follows that any story that describes a violation of a law of nature is intended to invoke dread in the reader.

The other options are not necessarily true based on the information provided in the passage.

Option A is not necessarily true because the passage only states that horror stories about monstrous beasts typically symbolize a psychological disturbance in the protagonist, but it does not mention whether all descriptions of monstrous beasts describe violations of the laws of nature.

Option C is also not necessarily true because while horror stories about monstrous beasts often involve psychological disturbances, this is not true for all horror stories.

Option D is false because the passage states that horror stories about mad scientists typically express the author's feeling that scientific knowledge alone is not enough to guide human endeavor, but it does not mention anything about the author's views on science.

Option E is not necessarily true because while some stories that employ symbolism may describe violations of the laws of nature, this is not always the case.
