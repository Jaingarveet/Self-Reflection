Context: The size of northern fur seals provides a reliable indication of their population levelsâ€”the smaller the average body size of seals in a population, the larger the population. Archaeologists studied seal fossils covering an 800-year period when the seals were hunted for food by Native peoples in North America and found that the average body size of the seals did not vary significantly.
Question: The statements above, if true, provide the most support for which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: During the 800-year period studied, seal hunting practices did not vary substantially between different groups of Native peoples in North America.
  B: The body size of northern fur seals is not strongly correlated with the overall health of the seals.
  C: Before the 800-year period studied, the average body size of northern fur seals fluctuated dramatically.
  D: Native peoples in North America made an effort to limit their hunting of northern fur seals in order to prevent depletion of seal populations.
  E: Hunting by Native peoples in North America did not significantly reduce the northern fur seal population over the 800-year period studied.
## Assistant 2:
  Answer: E

The fact that the average body size of the seals did not vary significantly over the 800-year period suggests that the population of northern fur seals remained relatively stable during that time. This stability suggests that hunting by Native peoples in North America did not significantly reduce the population of northern fur seals. Therefore, choice E is the best answer.

It is important to note that the other choices are not supported by the given information. There is no evidence to suggest that seal hunting practices did not vary substantially between different groups of Native peoples in North America (choice A). The correlation between body size and overall health of seals is not addressed in the passage (choice B). The passage does not provide information about the body size of northern fur seals before the 800-year period studied (choice C). There is no evidence to suggest that Native peoples in North America made an effort to limit their hunting of northern fur seals (choice D).
## Result:
Agent Answer: None
