## Assistant 2:
  Answer: A

The statement "Every print in the museum store is of a work that is either on loan to the museum from a private collector or part of the museum's permanent collection" must be true based on the given information.

The curator states that the museum displays only twentieth-century works, which are either on loan from private collectors or in the museum's permanent collection. Additionally, the museum store sells prints of some works that are not part of the museum's permanent collection, such as Hopper's Nighthawks. This means that all the prints in the museum store are of works that are either on loan or in the permanent collection, which makes option A the correct answer.

The other options are not necessarily true based on the given information:

Option B: This statement is not necessarily true, as the museum store may sell prints of works that are not twentieth-century works.

Option C: This statement is not necessarily true, as there may be works displayed in the museum that are not in the museum's permanent collection and for which prints are not available in the museum store.

Option D: This statement is false, as Hopper's Nighthawks is not on loan to the museum from a private collector, but rather is a print that is sold in the museum store.

Option E: This statement is false, as Hopper's Nighthawks is indeed displayed in the museum, but its print is sold in the museum store.
