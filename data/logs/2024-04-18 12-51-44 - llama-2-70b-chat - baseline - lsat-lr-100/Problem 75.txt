## User 2:
Topic: Law
Context: Figorian Wildlife Commission: The development of wetlands in industrialized nations for residential and commercial uses has endangered many species. To protect wildlife we must regulate such development in Figoria: future wetland development must be offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats. Thus, development would cause no net reduction of wetlands and pose no threat to the species that inhabit them. Figorian Development Commission: Other nations have flagrantly developed wetlands at the expense of wildlife. We have conserved. Since Figorian wetland development might not affect wildlife and is necessary for growth, we should allow development. We have as much right to govern our own resources as countries that have already put their natural resources to commercial use.
Question: Which one of the following principles, if accepted, would most strongly support the Figorian Development Commission's position against the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position?
Choices:
  A: National resources should be regulated by international agreement when wildlife is endangered.
  B: The right of future generations to have wildlife preserved supersedes the economic needs of individual nations.
  C: Only when a reduction of populations of endangered species by commercial development has been found should regulation be implemented to prevent further damage.
  D: Environment regulation must aim at preventing any further environmental damage and cannot allow for the different degrees to which different nations have already harmed the environment.
  E: It is imprudent to allow further depletion of natural resources.
## Assistant 2:
  Answer: D

Explanation:
The principle that environment regulation must aim at preventing any further environmental damage and cannot allow for the different degrees to which different nations have already harmed the environment supports the Figorian Development Commission's position. According to this principle, environmental regulation should focus on preventing further damage to the environment rather than trying to address past harm. Since the Figorian Development Commission argues that Figorian wetland development would not affect wildlife and is necessary for growth, this principle would support their position against the Figorian Wildlife Commission's call for regulation to protect wildlife.

The other options do not support the Figorian Development Commission's position:

A: National resources should be regulated by international agreement when wildlife is endangered. This principle would support the Figorian Wildlife Commission's call for regulation to protect wildlife, as it suggests that international agreements should be in place to regulate national resources when wildlife is endangered.

B: The right of future generations to have wildlife preserved supersedes the economic needs of individual nations. This principle would also support the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position, as it suggests that the need to preserve wildlife for future generations is more important than economic needs.

C: Only when a reduction of populations of endangered species by commercial development has been found should regulation be implemented to prevent further damage. This principle would not support either side, as it suggests that regulation should only be implemented after damage has been done, whereas the Figorian Wildlife Commission is calling for preventative regulation.

E: It is imprudent to allow further depletion of natural resources. This principle would support the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position, as it suggests that it is unwise to allow further depletion of natural resources.
