Topic: Law
Context: Brooks: I'm unhappy in my job, but I don't know whether I can accept the risks involved in quitting my job. Morgenstern: The only risk in quitting is that of not finding another job. If you don't find one, you're going to be pretty unhappy. But you're already unhappy, so you might as well just quit.
Question: Morgenstern's argument is flawed in that it
Choices:
  A: fails to take into account that unhappiness can vary in intensity or significance
  B: relies on an assumption that is tantamount to assuming that the conclusion is true
  C: mischaracterize what Brooks says
  D: conllates two different types of risk
  E: reaches a generalization on the basis of a single case
## Assistant 2:
  Answer: A

Explanation:
Morgenstern's argument assumes that Brooks' unhappiness in his current job is the same level of unhappiness he would experience if he were to quit and not find another job. However, this assumption is not necessarily true. Brooks' unhappiness in his current job may be significantly greater than the unhappiness he would experience if he were to quit and not find another job. Therefore, Morgenstern's argument fails to take into account that unhappiness can vary in intensity or significance, making it a flawed argument.
