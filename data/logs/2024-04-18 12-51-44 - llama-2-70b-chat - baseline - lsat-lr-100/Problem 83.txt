Context: Although Pluto has an atmosphere and is much larger than any asteroid, Pluto is not a true planet. Pluto formed in orbit around the planet Neptune and was then ejected from orbit around Neptune when Triton, Neptune's largest moon, was captured by Neptune's gravity.
Question: The conclusion of the argument follows logically if which one of the following is assumed?
Choices:
  A: No celestial body can simultaneously be a moon and a planet.
  B: Not all celestial bodies that have an atmosphere and orbit the sun are true planets.
  C: If Pluto had not been ejected from its orbit around Neptune, Pluto would not have its current orbit around the sun and would still be a moon.
  D: The size of a celestial body in orbit around the sun is not relevant to determining whether or not it is a true planet.
  E: For a celestial body to be a true planet it must have formed in orbit around the sun exclusively.
## Assistant 2:
  Answer: 
The conclusion that Pluto is not a true planet follows logically if assumption E is made: for a celestial body to be a true planet, it must have formed in orbit around the sun exclusively. Pluto did not form in orbit around the sun exclusively, as it formed in orbit around Neptune and was later ejected. Therefore, Pluto does not meet the criteria for being a true planet.
Action: Answer("E")
