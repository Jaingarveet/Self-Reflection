Context: It is difficult to grow cacti in a humid climate. It is difficult to raise orange trees in a cold climate. In most parts of a certain country, it is either easy to grow cacti or easy to raise orange trees.
Question: If the statements above are true, which one of the following must be false?
Choices:
  A: Half of the country is both humid and cold.

  C: Some parts of the country are neither cold nor humid.
  D: It is not possible to raise cacti in the country.
  E: Most parts of the country are humid.
## Assistant 2:
  Thought: 
The statements provided imply that it is either easy to grow cacti or easy to raise orange trees in most parts of the country. This means that the climate in most parts of the country is either humid or cold, but not both.
Therefore, the correct answer is choice A: Half of the country is both humid and cold. This statement must be false because it is not possible for half of the country to be both humid and cold if it is either easy to grow cacti or easy to raise orange trees in most parts of the country.
