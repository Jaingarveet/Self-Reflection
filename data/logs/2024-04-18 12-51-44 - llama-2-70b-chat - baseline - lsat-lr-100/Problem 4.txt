Context: A film makes a profit if the number of people who see it is sufficient to generate revenues from ticket sales greater than the amount spent to make it. Hence, the primary goal of movie executives is to maximize the number of people who see a film. However, it is not the primary goal of television executives to maximize the number of viewers for their shows.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain the difference between the goals of movie executives and those of television executives?
Choices:
  A: More people are willing to see a film more than once than are willing to watch a television show more than once.
  B: There is no analog in television to the large profits that owners of movie theaters make by selling refreshments to their customers.
  C: The average cost of producing an hour of film is much greater than the average cost of producing an hour of television.
  D: Television shows make their profits from sponsors, who are chiefly concerned with the purchasing power of the people who watch a television show.
  E: Over half of the most popular television shows are shows that viewers do not have to pay to watch.
## Assistant 2:
  Thought: 
The primary goal of movie executives is to maximize the number of people who see a film because the profitability of a film depends on the number of people who see it. In contrast, television executives do not have the same goal because their profitability does not depend on the number of viewers in the same way.

Option C provides the best explanation for this difference. The average cost of producing an hour of film is much greater than the average cost of producing an hour of television. This means that movie executives need to generate more revenue from ticket sales to cover their production costs and make a profit. In contrast, television executives have lower production costs and generate revenue from sponsors, who are concerned with the purchasing power of the viewers. Therefore, television executives do not need to maximize the number of viewers to achieve their profit goals.

Action: Answer("C")
