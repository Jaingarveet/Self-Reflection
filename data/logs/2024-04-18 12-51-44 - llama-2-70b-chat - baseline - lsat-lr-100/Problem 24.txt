## User 2:
Topic: Law
Context: Only a minority of those who engage in political action do so out of a sense of social justice. Therefore, some people who have a sense of social justice do not engage in political action.
Question: Which one of the following uses flawed reasoning most similar to that used in the argument above?
Choices:
  A: Most scholars are not motivated by a desire to win prestigious academic prizes. Thus, some of those who want to win prestigious academic prizes are not scholars.
  B: Only foolish politicians disregard the wishes of most voters. Thus, most voters deserve to be represented by foolish politicians.
  C: Some corporations only feign a concern for the environment when they advertise a product as environmentally friendly. Thus, no corporation has a genuine concern for the environment.
  D: Some parents show no interest in the curricula used in the schools that their children attend. Thus, some of the decisions regarding school curricula should be made without regard for the wishes of the children's parents.
  E: Only a small percentage of the profits that companies make are directly attributable to good management decisions. Thus, even companies that are managed badly will usually turn a profit.
## Assistant 2:
  Answer: C

Explanation:
The argument states that some corporations feign a concern for the environment, thus, no corporation has a genuine concern for the environment. This is similar to the original argument, which states that only a minority of people who engage in political action do so out of a sense of social justice, thus, some people who have a sense of social justice do not engage in political action. Both arguments use a faulty reasoning that a small percentage of the whole (corporations or people) means that none of the whole (corporations or people) have a particular characteristic (genuine concern for the environment or sense of social justice).

Choice A is not similar to the original argument. It states that most scholars are not motivated by a desire to win prestigious academic prizes, thus, some of those who want to win prestigious academic prizes are not scholars. This argument does not use the same faulty reasoning as the original argument.

Choice B is also not similar to the original argument. It states that only foolish politicians disregard the wishes of most voters, thus, most voters deserve to be represented by foolish politicians. This argument uses a different type of reasoning, where it implies that most voters deserve to be represented by foolish politicians because only foolish politicians disregard their wishes.

Choice D is also not similar to the original argument. It states that some parents show no interest in the curricula used in the schools that their children attend, thus, some of the decisions regarding school curricula should be made without regard for the wishes of the children's parents. This argument does not use the same faulty reasoning as the original argument.

Choice E is not similar to the original argument. It states that only a small percentage of the profits that companies make are directly attributable to good management decisions, thus, even companies that are managed badly will usually turn a profit. This argument does not use the same faulty reasoning as the original argument.
