Topic: Law
Context: In a recent study, each member of two groups of people, Group A (composed of persons sixty-five to seventy-five years old) and Group B (composed of college students), was required to make a telephone call to a certain number at a specified time. The time when each call was initiated was recorded electronically. Group A proved far better at remembering to make a telephone call precisely at a specified time than did Group B. There were fourteen lapses in Group B but only one lapse in Group A. Clearly, at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages.
Question: Which one of the following, if all of them are true, is LEAST helpful in establishing that the conclusion above is properly drawn?
Choices:
  A: There was the same number of people in each group.
  B: The same group of researchers answered the calls made by the callers in both study groups.
  C: Among the college students there were no persons more than forty years old.
  D: Both groups had unrestricted access to telephones for making the required calls.
  E: The members of the two groups received their instructions approximately the same amount of time before they were to make their telephone calls.
## Assistant 2:
  Answer: "D"

The fact that both groups had unrestricted access to telephones for making the required calls (D) is the least helpful in establishing that the conclusion is properly drawn.

The study aims to compare the memory abilities of Group A (people aged 65-75) and Group B (college students). The conclusion is that Group A is better at remembering to make a phone call at a specified time than Group B.

Option D does not provide any information that would affect the conclusion. Even if both groups had equal access to phones, it does not necessarily mean that the difference in memory abilities between the two groups can be attributed to age. Other factors such as lifestyle, habits, and individual differences could still be at play.

On the other hand, options A, B, C, and E provide important information that supports the conclusion. Option A ensures that the sample size was the same for both groups, which helps to minimize any potential bias. Option B ensures that the same researchers answered the calls, which helps to maintain consistency in the data collection process. Option C ensures that there were no older individuals in Group B, which helps to isolate the effect of aging on memory. Option E ensures that both groups received their instructions at approximately the same time, which helps to minimize any potential confounding variables related to the timing of the instructions.

Therefore, option D is the least helpful in establishing that the conclusion is properly drawn.
