Context: In a party game, one person leaves the room with the understanding that someone else will relate a recent dream to the remaining group. The person then returns and tries to reconstruct the dream by asking only yes-or-no questions. In fact, no dream has been related: the group simply answers the questions according to some arbitrary rule. Surprisingly, the person usually constructs a dream narrative that is both coherent and ingenious.
Question: The example presented above most closely conforms to which one of the following propositions?
Choices:
  A: The presumption that something has order and coherence can lead one to irubue it with order and coherence.
  B: One is less apt to reach a false understanding of what someone says than to make no sense out of it at all.
  C: Dreams are often just collections ofiruages and ideas without coherent structures.
  D: Interpreting another person's dream requires that one understand the dream as a coherent narrative.
  E: People often invent clever and coherent stories to explain their behavior to other people.
## Assistant 2:
  Answer:  A

Explanation:
The example presented above most closely conforms to proposition A: "The presumption that something has order and coherence can lead one to imbue it with order and coherence." The person in the game assumes that the group's answers are related to a dream, and they try to construct a coherent narrative based on the yes-or-no answers they receive. Even though there is no actual dream, the person's presumption that there is a coherent narrative leads them to create one based on the arbitrary answers given by the group. This illustrates how our tendency to look for order and meaning can sometimes lead us to create coherent narratives where none exist.
