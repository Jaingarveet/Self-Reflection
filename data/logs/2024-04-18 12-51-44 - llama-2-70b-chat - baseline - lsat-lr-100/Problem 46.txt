Context: Archaeologist: The mosaics that were removed from Zeugma, the ancient city now flooded by the runoff from Turkey's Birecik Dam, should have been left there. We had all the information about them that we needed to draw archaeological conclusions, and future archaeologists studying the site, who may not have access to our records, might be misled by their absence.
Question: Which one of the following, if assumed, most helps to justify the reasoning in the archaeologist's argument?
Choices:
  A: The only considerations that bear upon the question of whether the mosaics should have been removed are archaeological.
  B: Archaeologists studying a site can tell whether or not that site had been flooded at some time.
  C: The materials used in the construction of a mosaic are readily apparent when the mosaic is examined in its original location.
  D: Archaeological sites from which artifacts have been removed rarely mislead archaeologists who later study the site.
  E: The removal of artifacts from archaeological sites rarely has any environmental impact.
## Assistant 2:
  Answer: C

The archaeologist argues that the mosaics should have been left in their original location because future archaeologists studying the site may be misled by their absence. The best way to justify this argument is to assume that the materials used in the construction of a mosaic are readily apparent when the mosaic is examined in its original location (choice C). If the materials used in the mosaic are not readily apparent, then future archaeologists may not be able to accurately determine the history of the site, and the absence of the mosaics could lead to misinterpretation.

The other choices do not support the archaeologist's argument as well:

A: The only considerations that bear upon the question of whether the mosaics should have been removed are archaeological. This choice does not address the potential impact of removing the mosaics on future archaeological study.

B: Archaeologists studying a site can tell whether or not that site had been flooded at some time. This choice is not relevant to the issue of whether the mosaics should have been removed.

D: Archaeological sites from which artifacts have been removed rarely mislead archaeologists who later study the site. This choice is not necessarily true, and even if it were, it would not address the specific concern about the potential misinterpretation of the site due to the absence of the mosaics.

E: The removal of artifacts from archaeological sites rarely has any environmental impact. This choice is not relevant to the issue of whether the mosaics should have been removed.
