Topic: Law
Context: Ethicist: Only when we know a lot about the events that led to an action are we justified in praising or blaming a person for that actionâ€”as we sometimes are. We must therefore reject Tolstoy's rash claim that if we knew a lot about the events leading up to any action, we would cease to regard that action as freely performed.
Question: Which one of the following, if assumed, enables the conclusion of the ethicist's argument to be properly drawn?
Choices:
  A: People should not be regarded as subject to praise or blame for actions that were caused by conditions beyond their control.
  B: Whether an act is one for which the person doing it is genuinely responsible is not determined by how much information others possess about that act.
  C: We can be justified in praising or blaming a person for an action only when we regard that action as freely performed.
  D: The responsibility a person bears for an action is not a matter of degree; however, our inclination to blame or praise whoever performed the action varies with the amount of information available.
  E: If we do not know much about the events leading up to any given action, we will regard that action as freely performed.
## Assistant 2:
  Answer: C

The ethicist's argument concludes that we must reject Tolstoy's claim that if we knew a lot about the events leading up to any action, we would cease to regard that action as freely performed. The ethicist suggests that we can be justified in praising or blaming a person for an action only when we regard that action as freely performed. Therefore, choice C, which states that we can be justified in praising or blaming a person for an action only when we regard that action as freely performed, enables the conclusion of the ethicist's argument to be properly drawn.

The other choices do not support the ethicist's argument. Choice A states that people should not be regarded as subject to praise or blame for actions that were caused by conditions beyond their control. While this may be true, it does not address the issue of whether we can be justified in praising or blaming someone for an action that we regard as freely performed. Choice B states that whether an act is one for which the person doing it is genuinely responsible is not determined by how much information others possess about that act. This choice also does not address the issue of whether we can be justified in praising or blaming someone for an action that we regard as freely performed.

Choice D states that the responsibility a person bears for an action is not a matter of degree; however, our inclination to blame or praise whoever performed the action varies with the amount of information available. This choice suggests that our inclination to blame or praise someone for an action may depend on how much information we have, but it does not address the issue of whether we can be justified in praising or blaming someone for an action that we regard as freely performed.

Finally, choice E states that if we do not know much about the events leading up to any given action, we will regard that action as freely performed. While this may be true, it does not address the issue of whether we can be justified in praising or blaming someone for an action that we regard as freely performed.
