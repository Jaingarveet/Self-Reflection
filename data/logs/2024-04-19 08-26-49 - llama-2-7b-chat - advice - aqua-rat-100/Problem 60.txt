## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Assistant 2:
  Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand now that I made a mistake in my calculation. I will use my self-reflection to help me answer the question correctly this time.

The problem states that minor arc AC is 160°, and minor arc BD is 150°. If B bisects minor arc AC, then the measure of minor arc AD is equal to the difference between the measures of minor arcs AC and BD.

Using the information provided, we can calculate the measure of minor arc AD as follows:

AD = AC - BD
= 160° - 150°
= 10°

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 10°.

Agent Answer: None
Correct Answer: B
