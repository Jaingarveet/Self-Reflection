## Assistant 2:
  Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand the mistake. I made a calculation error when working with the percentage profit. I will make sure to double-check my calculations and apply the formula correctly this time.

To find the cost price of the article, we need to use the formula:
Cost price = Selling price / (1 + Percentage profit)

In this case, the selling price is Rs.360, and the percentage profit is 20%.

Cost price = Selling price / (1 + 0.20)
Cost price = Rs.360 / (1 + 0.20)
Cost price = Rs.360 / 1.20
Cost price = Rs.300

Therefore, the cost price of the article is Rs.300.

Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
