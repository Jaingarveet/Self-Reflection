## Assistant 2:
  Thought: I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I need to reassess the problem.

Reflection: I calculated the distance traveled based on the initial cost of $3.50 for the first quarter-mile, and I did not take into account the additional 10 cents for each additional quarter-mile. This means that the maximum distance I can travel with $8.50 is actually less than what I previously calculated.

Action: I will recalculate the maximum distance I can travel with $8.50 by considering the additional 10 cents for each additional quarter-mile.

Maximum distance = $3.50 (first quarter-mile) + ($0.10 x number of additional quarter-miles)

Number of additional quarter-miles = distance - first quarter-mile

Distance = 11.75 miles (from previous answer) - 0.25 miles = 11.5 miles

Maximum distance = $3.50 (first quarter-mile) + ($0.10 x number of additional quarter-miles)
Maximum distance = $3.50 + ($0.10 x 11.5 miles)
Maximum distance = $3.50 + $1.15
Maximum distance = $4.65

Therefore, the maximum distance I can travel with $8.50 on a cab that charges $3.50 for the first quarter-mile and 10 cents for each additional quarter-mile is 4.65 miles.

Answer: C) 17.75 miles
