## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: Let A and B be independent events with P(A) = 0.2 and P(B) = 0.8. Find P(A/B)?
Choices:
A: 0.2
B: 0.4
C: 0.6
D: 1.2
E: 1.5

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and upon reflection, I realized that I made a mistake in my calculation. Here is my self-reflection:

* I misunderstood the concept of conditional probability and calculated the probability of A given B instead of the probability of A divided by B.
* I misinterpreted the problem statement and thought it was asking for the probability of A given B, which is P(A|B).
* I made a calculation error and arrived at the wrong answer.

To solve the problem correctly, I will use the formula for conditional probability: P(A/B) = P(A) / P(B).

Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
