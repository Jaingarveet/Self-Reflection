## Assistant 2:
  Thought: I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand that the hotel buys twice as many newspapers on Sunday as it does on the other days of the week. I also know that the cost per newspaper is $4 on Sunday and $1 on the other days.

Action: Let's use the information provided to calculate the number of newspapers the hotel buys on Monday.

Monday is not included in the problem, so we can assume that the hotel buys the same number of newspapers on Monday as it does on the other days of the week.

The hotel pays $210 per week for newspapers, and it buys twice as many on Sunday as it does on the other days. Therefore, the total number of newspapers the hotel buys per week is:

2 x 30 = 60 newspapers

So, the hotel buys 60 newspapers on Monday.

Answer: B - 30

Reflection: I reflected on my previous answer and realized that I made a mistake in my calculation. I hope this answer is correct.
