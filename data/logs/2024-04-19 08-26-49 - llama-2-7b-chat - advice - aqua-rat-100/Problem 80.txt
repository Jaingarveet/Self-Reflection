## Assistant 2:
  Thought: I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand that I need to use the information provided in the problem to find the correct answer.

Reflection: I analyzed my previous answer and realized that I made a mistake in my calculation. I misunderstood the information provided in the problem and ended up with an incorrect solution.

To solve this problem, I will use the information provided in the question: Jack buys 18 sharpeners (white and brown) for Rs. 100. If he pays 1 rupee more for each white than brown sharpeners.

I will start by identifying the number of white sharpeners Jack bought. According to the problem, Jack pays 1 rupee more for each white sharpeners than brown sharpeners. So, if he buys x brown sharpeners, he will pay 1 rupee more for each of them, which means he will pay a total of Rs. 100 + (x x 1) = Rs. 100 + x for the brown sharpeners.

Since Jack buys 18 sharpeners in total, the number of brown sharpeners he bought is:

x = 18 - 10 = 8

So, Jack bought 8 brown sharpeners.

Now, to find the number of white sharpeners Jack bought, we can use the fact that he pays 1 rupee more for each white sharpeners than brown sharpeners. So, if he buys x white sharpeners, he will pay a total of Rs. 100 + (x x 1) = Rs. 100 + x for the white sharpeners.

Since Jack buys 18 sharpeners in total, the number of white sharpeners he bought is:

x = 18 - 8 = 10

So, Jack bought 10 white sharpeners.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

A: 10,8

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.
