## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Assistant 2:
  Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and after reflecting on the problem, my solution, and the correct answer, I understand that my mistake was in not properly accounting for the units of measurement. I will make sure to be more careful in my calculations and to use the correct formula to solve the problem.

The correct formula to use in this problem is:

Average speed = Total distance / Time taken

In this case, the total distance is M miles + N miles = 2M + N miles. The time taken is 4 hours + 4 hours = 8 hours.

So, the average speed for these two activities combined is:

Average speed = (2M + N) / 8

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 2M + N / 8.

I will make sure to be more careful in my calculations and to use the correct formula to solve the problem in the future. Thank you for providing me with the opportunity to reflect on my mistake and to improve my problem-solving skills.
