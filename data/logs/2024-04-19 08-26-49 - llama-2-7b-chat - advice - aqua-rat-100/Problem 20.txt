## Assistant 2:
  Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand now that the ratio of boys to girls is 4:3. To find the total number of members in the group, I will use the ratio and the given information.

The number of boys is 64, and the number of girls is 40. The ratio of boys to girls is 4:3, so the total number of members in the group is:

64 x 4 = 256 (boys)
+ 40 x 3 = 120 (girls)
= 376

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 288.

Action: Answer("B")
