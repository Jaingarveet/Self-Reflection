Question: An exam is given in a certain class. The average (arithmetic mean) of the highest score and the lowest score is equal to x. If the average score for the entire class is equal to y and there are z students in the class, where z > 5, then in terms of x, y, and z, what is the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers?
Choices:
  A: (zy – 2x)/z
  B: (zy – 2)/z
  C: (zx – y)/(z – 2)
  D: (zy – 2x)/(z -2)
  E: (zy – x)/(z + 2)

## Assistant 2:
  Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and upon reflection, I realized that I made a mistake in my calculation and formula application. I misunderstood the problem and applied the wrong formula.

The correct formula for this problem is (zy – 2x)/z.

To solve the problem, we need to find the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers. The average score for the entire class is y, and there are z students in the class. The highest score is x, and the lowest score is also x.

Using the correct formula, we can calculate the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers as follows:

(zy – 2x)/z

Therefore, the answer is (zy – 2x)/z.
## Result:
Agent Answer: None
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
