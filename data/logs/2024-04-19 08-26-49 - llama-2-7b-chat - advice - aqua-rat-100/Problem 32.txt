## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Advice:

* Always read the problem carefully and understand the given information.
* Always break down complex problems into smaller, manageable steps.
* Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
* Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
* Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
* Remember that division is the inverse operation of multiplication, so when dividing a number by another number, you are essentially multiplying by the reciprocal of the divisor.
## Assistant 2:
  Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand now that I made a mistake in my calculation. I will use my self-reflection to help me answer the question correctly this time.

To solve this problem, I will break it down into smaller steps:

Step 1: Identify the given information: The cyclist travels at 12 miles per hour, and the distance to be traveled is 48 miles.

Step 2: Determine the time it takes to travel a single mile: 12 miles/hour = 1 hour (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

Step 3: Calculate the time it takes to travel 48 miles: 48 miles / 1 hour = 48 hours.

Step 4: Check your calculation: 48 hours = 48 x 60 minutes/hour = 2880 minutes.

Therefore, the answer is (B) 240 minutes.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.
