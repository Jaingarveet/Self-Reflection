## Assistant 2:
  Thought: I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand that the servant's monthly income should be 6000 rupees. To calculate the required monthly sale, I will use the formula:

Monthly sale = Monthly salary + Commission

Monthly salary = 1500 rupees
Commission = 15% of monthly sale

So, the required monthly sale is:

Monthly sale = 1500 + (15% of 6000)
= 1500 + 900
= 2400

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 415000 rupees.

Reflection: I realized that I made a mistake in my previous answer by not considering the commission. I also learned that it's important to carefully review and reflect on my work to ensure accuracy and avoid mistakes.
