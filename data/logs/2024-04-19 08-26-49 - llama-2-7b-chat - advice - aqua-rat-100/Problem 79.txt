## Assistant 2:
  Thought: I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand that I need to use the information provided in the problem to determine the correct amount each daughter receives.

Action: Let's analyze the problem step by step:

1. The man divides Rs 8600 among 5 sons, 4 daughters, and 2 nephews.
2. Each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew.
3. Each son receives five times as much as each nephew.

From the information provided, we can create a chart to organize the information:

| Person | Amount |
| --- | --- |
| Sons | 5 x Rs 8600 = Rs 43000 |
| Daughters | 4 x Rs 8600 = Rs 33200 |
| Nephews | Rs 8600 |

Now, let's calculate the amount each daughter receives:

Daughters: Rs 33200 x 4 = Rs 132800

So, each daughter receives Rs 132800.

Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: E
Score: 0
