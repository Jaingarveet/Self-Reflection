  Thought: 
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand that I made a mistake in my calculation. I will reflect on my solution and the correct answer.

Action:
Meenu said that she weighs 29 Kgs plus half of her weight. So, Meenu's weight is 29 + (half of her weight) = 29 + 29 = 58 Kgs.

Answer: (D) 58 Kgs.

Reflection:
I realized that I made a mistake in my calculation by adding the weight instead of multiplying it. I also made sure to use the correct formula for finding the product of two numbers.
