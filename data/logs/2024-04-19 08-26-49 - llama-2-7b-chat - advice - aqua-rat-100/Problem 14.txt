Question: If Raj was one-third as old as Rahim 5 years back and Raj is 17 years old now, How old is Rahim now?
Choices:
  A: 37
  B: 41
  C: 40
  D: 42
  E: 43

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly as B: 41.
I realized that I made a mistake in my calculation.

To solve this problem, I will break it down into smaller steps:

1. Raj was one-third as old as Rahim 5 years back, so Rahim's age 5 years ago was 3/3 = 1 times Raj's age.
2. Raj is currently 17 years old, so Rahim's age 5 years ago was 17 - 5 = 12 years old.

Therefore, Rahim is currently 12 + 5 = 17 years old.

The correct answer is (D) 42.

Advice:

* Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
* Break down complex problems into smaller, manageable steps.
* Double-check your calculations and ensure accuracy.
* Use visual aids or diagrams to help with calculations and problem-solving.
* Practice, practice, practice to improve math skills and accuracy.
