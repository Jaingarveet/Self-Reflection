## Assistant 2:
  Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand now that I made a mistake in my calculation. The correct solution is as follows:

Let the speed of the ship be x miles per hour. The plane started with 10 times the speed of the ship, so the speed of the plane is 10x miles per hour.

After the ship has traveled 180 miles, the distance between the ship and the plane is:

Distance = Speed x Time = x miles

Since the plane started with a speed of 10x miles per hour, it will take it x/10 hours to catch up to the ship.

Therefore, the distance between the ship and the plane when they meet is:

Distance = Speed x Time = x miles + (x/10) hours = (x + 10x/10) miles

So, the distance between the ship and the plane when they meet is (11x/10) miles.

Action: Answer("B")
