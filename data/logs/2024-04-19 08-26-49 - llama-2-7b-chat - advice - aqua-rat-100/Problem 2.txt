## Assistant 2:
  Thought: I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I need to reassess the problem.

Reflection: I calculated the average weight of the group of vehicles before adding the new heavy-duty truck, which was 12.2 tons. However, I made a mistake in my calculation. I added the weight of the new truck to the average weight of the group, which resulted in an incorrect answer.

To solve the problem correctly, I need to find the weight of the new heavy-duty truck. Let's assume the weight of the new truck is x tons.

The average weight of the group of vehicles increased by 2.6 tons after adding the new truck, so the new average weight of the group is:

Average weight of group = (10 x 12.2) + (x x 2.6) = 122 + 2.6x

Now, I need to find the value of x that satisfies the equation.

Solution:

To find the value of x, I can use the equation:

122 + 2.6x = 12.2 + 2.6(x)

Simplifying the equation, I get:

2.6x = 100

x = 40.8

Therefore, the weight in tons of the heavy-duty truck is 40.8 tons.

Action: Answer("B")
