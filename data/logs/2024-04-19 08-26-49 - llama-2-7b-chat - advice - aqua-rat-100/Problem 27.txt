I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand that I made a mistake in my calculation. I will use my self-reflection to help me answer the question correctly this time.

The problem states that M men agree to purchase a gift for Rs. D. If 3 men drop out, the remaining men will have to contribute more towards the purchase of the gift. To find out how much more each man will have to contribute, we need to calculate the new ratio of the number of men to the amount of money needed.

Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. The original number of men is M.
2. The original amount of money needed is D.
3. After 3 men drop out, the new number of men is M - 3.
4. The new amount of money needed is D - 3D.

Now, let's calculate the new ratio of men to money:

New ratio = (M - 3) / (D - 3D)

Simplifying the ratio, we get:

New ratio = M / D

Now, we need to find out how much more each man will have to contribute. We can do this by multiplying the new ratio by the original amount of money needed:

Each man's contribution = D x (M / D)

Substituting the values given in the question, we get:

Each man's contribution = D x (M / D) = D(M/D)

Since the answer choices are:

A: D/(M-3)
B: MD/3
C: M/(D-3)
D: 3D/(M2-3M)
E: None of these

We can see that the correct answer is (D(M/D)). Therefore, the answer is (B): MD/3.
## Result:
Agent Answer: None
Correct Answer: D
