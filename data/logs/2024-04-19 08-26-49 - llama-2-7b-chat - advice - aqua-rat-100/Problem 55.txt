Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand now that I made a mistake in my calculation. Here is my reflection on the problem, my solution, and the correct answer:

Problem: A man rows at the rate of 4 kmph in still water and his rate against the current is 2 kmph. What is the man's rate along the current?

Solution (incorrect): I initially thought that the man's rate along the current would be 6 kmph (4 kmph in still water + 2 kmph against the current).

Correct Answer: The man's rate along the current is 12 kmph (4 kmph in still water + 2 kmph against the current).

Explanation: To find the man's rate along the current, we need to add the man's rate in still water to his rate against the current. The total rate is 12 kmph.

Action: Answer("C")

Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: E
