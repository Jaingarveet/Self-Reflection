## Assistant 2:
  Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand now that I made a mistake in my calculation. I will use my self-reflection to help me answer the question correctly this time.

The problem states that a salesperson gets a 10% commission on each sale they make. To calculate the number of sales required to reach a salary of at least $1000, I will divide the desired salary by the commission earned per sale.

The desired salary is $1000, and the commission earned per sale is 10% of the sale price. Therefore, I will divide $1000 by 0.10 (the commission percentage) to get the number of sales required:

$1000 รท 0.10 = 10 sales

So, the salesperson must make 10 sales of $250 each to reach a salary of at least $1000.

Action: Answer("C")

Correct Answer: D
