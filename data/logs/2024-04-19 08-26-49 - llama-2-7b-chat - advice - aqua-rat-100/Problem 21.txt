Question: x men working x hours per day can do x units of a work in x days. How much work can be completed by y men working y hours per day in y days?

Self-Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and upon reflection, I realized that I made a mistake in my calculation. I misunderstood the ratio of the number of men and hours worked, which led to an incorrect answer.

To solve this problem, we need to use the formula:

Work done = Number of men x Hours worked x Rate of work

Where "Number of men" is the number of men working, "Hours worked" is the number of hours worked per day, and "Rate of work" is the rate at which the work is being done.

In the original problem, we are given that x men working x hours per day can do x units of work in x days. Let's call this rate of work "W".

Now, we are asked how much work can be completed by y men working y hours per day in y days. Let's call this rate of work "Wy".

We can use the formula above to find the work that y men can do in y days:

Wy = Number of men (y) x Hours worked (y) x Rate of work (W)

Substituting the values given in the problem, we get:

Wy = y x y x W

Simplifying, we get:

Wy = Wy

This means that the work completed by y men working y hours per day is equal to the work completed by x men working x hours per day.

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) y2/x2 units.

Advice: When solving a problem, it's important to carefully read and understand the problem statement, and to use the correct formula to solve the problem. In this case, we needed to use the formula for rate of work, which is W = Number of men x Hours worked x Rate of work. By using this formula, we were able to find the correct answer.
