## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Advice:

* Always use the least common multiple to find the time until two events occur again.
* Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
* Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
* Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
* Always double-check your calculations and final answer.

I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand the mistake. I will use my self-reflection to help me answer the question correctly this time.

The problem states that Train A leaves every 16 minutes, and Train B leaves every 17 minutes. To find the time until they both leave the station again, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 16 and 17.

I will break down the problem into simpler steps:

Step 1: Find the multiples of 16: 16, 32, 48, 64, ...
Step 2: Find the multiples of 17: 17, 34, 51, 68, ...
Step 3: Find the least common multiple (LCM) of 16 and 17: 16 x 17 = 252.

Therefore, the time until both trains leave the station again is 252 minutes, or 4 hours and 2 minutes.

Action: Answer("C")
