## Assistant 2:
  Thought: I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand that the semi-circles drawn on the opposite sides of the square paper as diameters will result in a total area of 8.75 square centimeters. However, I made a mistake in my calculation.

Reflection: I realized that I misunderstood the problem and calculated the area of the remaining paper incorrectly. I should have taken into account the area of the semi-circles as well.

Action: To calculate the area of the remaining paper, I will use the formula for the area of a semi-circle, which is A = πr^2, where r is the radius of the semi-circle. Since the semi-circles are drawn as diameters, the radius of each semi-circle is half the length of the side of the square paper.

Using this formula, I can calculate the area of each semi-circle as follows:

Area of semi-circle = π(half length of side of square paper)^2
= π(20 cm)^2
= 400π cm^2

Now, I need to add the area of both semi-circles to find the total area of the remaining paper.

Total area of remaining paper = Area of semi-circle 1 + Area of semi-circle 2
= 400π cm^2 + 400π cm^2
= 800π cm^2

Therefore, the area of the remaining paper is 800π cm^2.

Answer: E: 8.72

I hope this reflection and explanation help me answer the question correctly this time.
