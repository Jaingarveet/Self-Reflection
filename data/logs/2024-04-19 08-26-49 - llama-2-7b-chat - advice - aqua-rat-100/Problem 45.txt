Question: At what price should the Karan mark a sewing machine that costs him Rs. 1200/- so that even after offering a 20% discount, he makes 20% profit?

  B: 1,875
  C: 1,876
  D: 1,872
  E: 1,800

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand the mistake. The correct formula to use is:

Selling Price = Cost Price + Profit Margin - Discount

So, to find the selling price that will give Karan a 20% profit and a 20% discount, we can use the formula like this:

Selling Price = 1200 + (20/100) x 1200 - (20/100) x 1200

Simplifying the calculation, we get:

Selling Price = 1200 + 240 - 240
Selling Price = 1200 + 0

So, the selling price should be Rs. 1200.

Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: E
Score: 0
