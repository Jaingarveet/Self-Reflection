## Assistant 2:
  Thought: I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand the problem now. Let's analyze the situation:

Arjun gives $30 to Sajal, so Sajal now has twice as much money as Arjun. So, Sajal has $30 + $30 = $60 left.

Now, Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, so Arjun now has thrice as much money as Sajal. So, Arjun has $60 x 3 = $180 left.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 34, 62.

Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
