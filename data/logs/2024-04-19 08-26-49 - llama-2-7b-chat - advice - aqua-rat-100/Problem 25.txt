## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Question: A car is being driven, in a straight line and at a uniform speed, towards the base of a vertical tower. The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower?
Choices:
  A: 5(√3 + 1)
  B: 6(√3 + √2)
  C: 7(√3 – 1)
  D: 8(√3 – 2)
  E: None of these

## Assistant 2:
  Thought: 
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand that the angle of elevation changes from 45° to 60° in 10 minutes. This means that the car is moving at a constant speed towards the base of the tower.
Action: Answer("B")

Explanation:
The correct answer is (6√3 + √2) minutes.

Here's how I arrived at this answer:

1. The angle of elevation changes from 45° to 60° in 10 minutes, which means the car moves a distance of (60° - 45°) / 10 = 15°.
2. Since the car is moving at a constant speed, the distance traveled is equal to the speed multiplied by the time taken. Therefore, the distance traveled is (15° / 60) = 0.25 radians.
3. Converting radians to meters, we get (0.25 radians) x (1000 / π) = 150 meters.

Therefore, the car will reach the base of the tower in 150 meters / 60 = 2.5 minutes.
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
