  Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand now that I need to use the principle of permutations to solve it. The problem states that there are 10 oranges in a basket, and we want to choose 2 oranges from the basket. To calculate the number of ways to choose a subset of 2 oranges from a set of 10 oranges, we can use the formula:

n! / (k! \* (n-k)!)

where n is the total number of oranges (10), k is the number of oranges we want to choose (2), and the factorial symbol "!" represents the number of ways to arrange the oranges in a particular order.

Using this formula, we can calculate the number of ways to choose 2 oranges from 10 oranges as follows:

n! = 10! = 10 x 9 x 8 x 7 x 6 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 3,628,800

k! = 2! = 2 x 1 = 2

(n-k)! = (10-2)! = 8

So, the number of ways to choose 2 oranges from a basket of 10 oranges is:

3,628,800 / (2! x 8) = 181,440

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 90.
