I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand that I need to break down the problem into simpler steps to solve it correctly.

Step 1: Identify the given information:

* 10% of the chocolates are cocoa flavored.
* 90% of the rest are squashed.

Step 2: Calculate the percentage of vanilla flavored chocolates:

* 100% - 10% = 90% of the chocolates are not cocoa flavored.
* 90% of the non-cocoa flavored chocolates are not squashed (since 90% of the rest are squashed).

Step 3: Calculate the percentage of vanilla flavored chocolates that are not squashed:

* 90% of the non-cocoa flavored chocolates are not squashed = 90% of 90% = 81% of the total chocolates.

Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
