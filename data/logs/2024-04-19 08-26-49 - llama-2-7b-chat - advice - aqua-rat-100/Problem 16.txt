## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

  Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand now that I made a mistake in my calculation. I will follow the steps I should have taken to solve the problem correctly.

Step 1: Read the question carefully and understand the problem.
The question states that the length of the road from Town F to Town G is measured to be 20 inches on a map, and that 1/4 inch represents an actual distance of 10 miles.

Step 2: Decompose the problem into smaller subproblems.
I will break down the problem into two subproblems:

a. Convert the map distance (20 inches) to miles.
b. Convert the actual distance (10 miles) to inches.

Step 3: Think through each subproblem step-by-step.

a. Convert the map distance to miles:
I will use the conversion ratio of 1/4 inch = 10 miles to convert the map distance of 20 inches to miles.

20 inches / 1/4 inch = 80 miles

b. Convert the actual distance to inches:
I will use the conversion ratio of 10 miles = 80 inches to convert the actual distance of 10 miles to inches.

10 miles x 80 inches/mile = 800 inches

Step 4: Double-check my calculations and final answer.
I have calculated the actual distance from Town F to Town G to be 800 inches.

Correct answer: E: 800 inches

Therefore, the actual distance from Town F to Town G along this road is 800 inches.
