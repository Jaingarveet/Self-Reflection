## Assistant 2:
  Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand now that I made a mistake in my calculation. I will follow the steps I should have taken to solve the problem correctly.

Step 1: Identify the given information:
The shopkeeper gives a discount of 5% and earns Rs. 15 less as profit. The marked price of the watch is Rs. x.

Step 2: Calculate the discount:
The discount given by the shopkeeper is 5%, which means he will deduct 5% of the marked price. So, the discount amount is 5% of Rs. x.

Discount amount = 5% of Rs. x
Discount amount = Rs. 0.05x

Step 3: Calculate the profit:
The shopkeeper earns Rs. 15 less as profit, which means he will subtract Rs. 15 from the marked price.
Profit = Rs. 15

Step 4: Solve for the marked price:
We are given two equations:

Discount amount = Rs. 0.05x
Profit = Rs. 15

We can solve this system of equations by substituting the value of discount amount in the second equation:

Profit = Rs. 15
Rs. 0.05x = Rs. 15

x = Rs. 300

So, the marked price of the watch is Rs. 300.

Action: Answer("B")
