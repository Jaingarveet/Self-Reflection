Question: A club consists of members whose ages are in A.P. The common difference being 3 months. If the youngest member of the club is just 7 years old and the sum of the ages of all the members is 250, then number of members in the club are :

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I realized that I made a mistake in my calculation. Here's what happened:

I initially thought that the sum of the ages of all the members was 250, and I calculated the number of members based on that assumption. However, I noticed that the youngest member is only 7 years old, which means that the sum of the ages of all the members cannot be 250.

So, I went back to the problem and recalculated the number of members based on the correct information. I realized that the number of members in the club is 20.

Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
