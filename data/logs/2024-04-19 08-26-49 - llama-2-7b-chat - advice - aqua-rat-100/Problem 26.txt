## Assistant 2:
  Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand that I made a mistake in my calculation. To solve this problem, I will break it down into smaller steps and double-check my calculations to ensure accuracy.

Step 1: Determine the length and breadth of the original rectangle.
The length of the rectangle is 27 cm, and the breadth is 17 cm.

Step 2: Find the length and breadth of the square that will be formed after the rectangle is rebent.
The square will have the same length and breadth as the original rectangle, so the length and breadth of the square will be 27 cm and 17 cm, respectively.

Step 3: Calculate the measure of each side of the square.
The measure of each side of the square is the length of the side, which is equal to the length of the original rectangle. Therefore, the measure of each side of the square is 27 cm.

Action: Answer("B")
