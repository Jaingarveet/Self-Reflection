## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Assistant 2:
  Thought: I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand that the greatest common factor of two positive integers is 11. The least common multiple of these two integers is 7700.

Action: Let's use the information provided to find the other integer.

The greatest common factor of 350 and x is 11. Therefore, we can divide both numbers by 11:

350 รท 11 = 32

x รท 11 = 69

Now, we can see that the least common multiple of 32 and 69 is 7700. Therefore, the other integer is 69.

Action: Answer("C")

Reflection: I reflected on my previous mistake and how I was able to find the correct answer this time. I realized that I needed to divide both numbers by the greatest common factor to find the least common multiple. I also noticed that I was able to find the correct answer by using the information provided in the question.
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
