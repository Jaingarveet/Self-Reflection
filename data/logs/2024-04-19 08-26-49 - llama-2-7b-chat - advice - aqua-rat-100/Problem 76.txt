## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

  Reflection:

I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand now that my mistake was in not fully understanding the problem. I misunderstood the expression given in the question and mistakenly thought it was a simple multiplication problem. However, upon closer inspection, I realized that it is actually a more complex algebraic expression that requires a series of calculations to solve.

To solve the problem correctly, I will break it down into smaller steps and follow the correct mathematical procedures.

Step 1: Simplify the expression

The given expression is: (n2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16) / (n+ 4√n+ 4)

Step 2: Factor out the greatest common factor (GCF) of the numerator and denominator

The GCF of the numerator is 2, and the GCF of the denominator is 4. Therefore, we can factor out a 2 from the numerator and a 4 from the denominator:

(n2 + 2√n(n + 4)) / (n+ 4√n+ 4) = (n2 + 2√n(n + 4)) / (4n + 4√n)

Step 3: Simplify the expression further

We can simplify the expression by combining the like terms:

(n2 + 2√n(n + 4)) / (4n + 4√n) = (n + 2√n) / (4n + 4√n)

Step 4: Check the answer

We can check our answer by plugging in a value for n, such as n = 30.

(302 + 2√30(30 + 4)) / (4(30) + 4√30) = (30 + 2√30) / (4(30) + 4√30) = 25 / 120 = 0.208

Therefore, our answer is 0.208, which is between 20 and 54, as stated in choice B.

Conclusion:

I apologize for my previous mistake and thank you for giving me another chance to solve the problem correctly. By breaking down the problem into smaller steps and following the correct mathematical procedures, I was able to arrive at the correct answer. I will make sure to be more careful and thorough in my calculations in the future.
