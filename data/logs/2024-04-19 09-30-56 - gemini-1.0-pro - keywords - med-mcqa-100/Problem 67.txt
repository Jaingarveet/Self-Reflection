## Assistant 2:
I understand. I will use my self-reflection to answer this question correctly.
**Self-Reflection:**
* **Error:** I previously answered the question incorrectly, selecting "A: Infection" as the major complication of cyst-gastrostomy for pseudo pancreatic cyst.
* **Reason for Error:** I did not consider the full range of potential complications and focused only on the most common one.
* **Solution:** I will carefully analyze all the answer choices and consider the specific context of the question.
**Answer:**
Based on my self-reflection and a thorough analysis of the answer choices, I believe the correct answer is:
**Action: Answer("C")**
**Explanation:**
* **Fistula:** A fistula is an abnormal connection between two organs or vessels. In the case of cyst-gastrostomy, a fistula can develop between the pancreatic cyst and the stomach, leading to leakage of pancreatic fluid and potentially serious complications.
* **Infection:** While infection is a potential complication of any surgery, it is not the most common or severe complication in this specific case.
* **Obstruction:** Obstruction is less likely than fistula in this context.
* **Hemorrhage:** Hemorrhage is a serious complication, but it is less common than fistula in cyst-gastrostomy.
Therefore, based on the specific context of the question and the potential complications of cyst-gastrostomy, the most likely major complication is a fistula.

Agent Answer: C
