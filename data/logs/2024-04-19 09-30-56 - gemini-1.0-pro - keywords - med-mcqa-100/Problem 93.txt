## Assistant 2:
Self-reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly by selecting "A: Topical antibiotic" as the answer. This was incorrect because topical antibiotics are not the first-line treatment for comedonal acne.
I have learned from my mistake and will use the following steps to answer this question correctly:
1. Identify the type of acne: Comedonal acne is characterized by the presence of comedones, which are blackheads and whiteheads.
2. Consider the patient's situation: The patient is about to marry, which may be a stressful time that could exacerbate her acne.
3. Choose the most appropriate treatment: Based on the type of acne and the patient's situation, the most appropriate treatment is a combination of topical retinoids and benzoyl peroxide.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
