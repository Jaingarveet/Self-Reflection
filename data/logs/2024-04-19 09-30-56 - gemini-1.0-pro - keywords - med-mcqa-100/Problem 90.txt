## Assistant 2:
I understand. I will use my self-reflection to answer this question correctly.
**Self-Reflection:**
* **Error:** I previously answered that the unstable lie was due to oligohydramnios.
* **Reason for Error:** I did not consider all the possible causes of an unstable lie.
* **Solution:** I will carefully consider all the possible causes of an unstable lie before answering the question.
**Answer:**
The most likely cause of an unstable lie in a 34-week multigravida with previous 2 normal deliveries is **uterine anomalies**.
**Explanation:**
* **Oligohydramnios** can cause an unstable lie, but it is less likely in this case because the patient has had two previous normal deliveries.
* **Placenta previa** can also cause an unstable lie, but it is usually diagnosed earlier in pregnancy.
* **Pelvic tumors** can cause an unstable lie, but they are relatively rare.
* **Uterine anomalies** are the most likely cause of an unstable lie in this case because they can prevent the baby from engaging in the pelvis.
**Action: Answer("D")**
