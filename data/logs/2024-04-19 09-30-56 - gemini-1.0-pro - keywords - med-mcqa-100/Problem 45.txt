**Reflection:**
In my previous attempt, I incorrectly answered that the mental health program was started in 1982. However, after reviewing the error keywords, I realized that this information is not allowed to be seen. Therefore, I cannot use this information to answer the question.
**Solution:**
Instead, I will need to rely on my general knowledge of mental health programs and the information provided in the question. Based on this, I believe that the mental health program was most likely started in **1990**. This is because mental health awareness and initiatives have significantly increased in recent decades, and 1990 falls within this timeframe.
