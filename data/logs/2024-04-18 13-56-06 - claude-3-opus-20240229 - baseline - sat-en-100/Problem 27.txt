Context: The chemical formula of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is now well established. The molecule is a very long chain, the backbone of which consists of a  regular alternation of sugar and phosphate groups.To each sugar is attached a nitrogenous base, which can be of four different types. Two of the possible bases-adenine and guanine - are purines, and the other two-thymine and cytosine-are pyrimidines. So far as is known, the sequence of bases along the 10 chain is irregular. The monomer unit, consisting of phosphate, sugar and base, is known as a nucleotide.The first feature of our structure which is of biological interest is that it consists not of one chain, but of two. These two chains are both coiled around15 a common fiber axis. It has often been assumed that since there was only one chain in the chemical formula there would only be one in the structural unit. However, the density, taken with the X-ray evidence, suggests very strongly that there are two.The other biologically important feature is the manner in which the two chains are held together. This is done by hydrogen bonds between the bases. The bases are joined together in pairs, a single base from one chain being hydrogen-bonded to a single25 base from the other. The important point is that only certain pairs of bases will fit into the structure.One member of a pair must be a purine and the other a pyrimidine in order to bridge between the two chains. If a pair consisted of two purines, for 30 example, there would not be room for it.We believe that the bases will be present almost entirely in their most probable forms. If this is true, the conditions for forming hydrogen bonds are more restrictive, and the only pairs of bases possible are: 35 adenine with thymine, and guanine with cytosine. Adenine, for example, can occur on either chain; but when it does, its partner on the other chain must always be thymine.The phosphate-sugar backbone of our model is 40 completely regular, but any sequence of the pairs of bases can fit into the structure. It follows that in a long molecule many different permutations are possible, and it therefore seems likely that the precise sequence of bases is the code which carries the45 genetical information. If the actual order of the bases on one of the pair of chains were given, one could write down the exact order of the bases on the other one, because of the specific pairing. Thus one chain is, as it were, the complement of the other, and it is50 this feature which suggests how the deoxyribonucleic acid molecule might duplicate itself.The table shows, for various organisms, the percentage of each of the four types of nitrogenous bases in that organism's DNA.\begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|}\hline\multicolumn{5}{|c|}{Base Composition of DNA} \\\hline\multirow{3}{*}{Organism} & \multicolumn{4}{|c|}{$\begin{array}{c}\text { Percentage of base } \\\text { in organism's DNA }\end{array}$} \\\cline { 2 - 5 }& $\begin{array}{c}\text { adenine } \\ (\%)\end{array}$ & $\begin{array}{c}\text { guanine } \\ (\%)\end{array}$ & $\begin{array}{c}\text { cytosine } \\ (\%)\end{array}$ & $\begin{array}{c}\text { thymine } \\ (\%)\end{array}$ \\\hline& 26.8 & 22.8 & 23.2 & 27.2 \\\hlineOctopus & 33.2 & 17.6 & 17.6 & 31.6 \\\hlineChicken & 28.0 & 22.0 & 21.6 & 28.4 \\\hlineRat & 28.6 & 21.4 & 20.5 & 28.4 \\\hlineHuman & 29.3 & 20.7 & 20.0 & 30.0 \\\hlineGrasshopper & 29.3 & 20.5 & 20.7 & 29.3 \\\hlineSea urchin & 32.8 & 17.7 & 17.3 & 32.1 \\\hlineWheat & 27.3 & 22.7 & 22.8 & 27.1 \\\hlineYeast & 31.3 & 18.7 & 17.1 & 32.9 \\\hlineE. coli & 24.7 & 26.0 & 25.7 & 23.6 \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}
Question: Do the data in the table support the authors' proposed pairing of bases in DNA?
Choices:
  A: Yes, because for each given organism, the percentage of adenine is closest to the percentage of thymine, and the percentage of guanine is closest to the percentage of cytosine.
  B: Yes, because for each given organism, the percentage of adenine is closest to the percentage of guanine, and the percentage of cytosine is closest to the percentage of thymine.
  C: No, because for each given organism, the percentage of adenine is closest to the percentage of thymine, and the percentage of guanine is closest to the percentage of cytosine.
  D: No, because for each given organism, the percentage of adenine is closest to the percentage of guanine, and the percentage of cytosine is closest to the percentage of thymine. 30
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The authors propose that in the DNA structure, adenine pairs with thymine, and guanine pairs with cytosine.
2. If this pairing is correct, we would expect that in the DNA of any organism, the percentage of adenine should be close to the percentage of thymine, and the percentage of guanine should be close to the percentage of cytosine.
3. Looking at the data in the table:
   - For E. coli, adenine (24.7%) is close to thymine (23.6%), and guanine (26.0%) is close to cytosine (25.7%).
   - For yeast, adenine (31.3%) is close to thymine (32.9%), and guanine (18.7%) is close to cytosine (17.1%).
   - This pattern holds for all the organisms in the table.
4. The data supports the authors' proposed pairing of bases in DNA.
5. The correct answer is choice A: "Yes, because for each given organism, the percentage of adenine is closest to the percentage of thymine, and the percentage of guanine is closest to the percentage of cytosine."
