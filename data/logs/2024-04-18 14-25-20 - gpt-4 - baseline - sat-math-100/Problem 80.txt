# Model: gpt-4 | Agent: baseline | Exam: sat-math-100 | Problem 80 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:
Topic: Geography
Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:

  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: $$\begin{aligned}& k x-3 y=4 \\& 4 x-5 y=7\end{aligned}$$In the system of equations above, $k$ is a constant and $x$ and $y$ are variables. For what value of $k$ will the system of equations have no solution?
Choices:
  A: $\frac{12}{5}$
  B: $\frac{16}{7}$
  C: $-\frac{16}{7}$
  D: $-\frac{12}{5}$
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
A system of linear equations has no solution if the lines are parallel, which means their slopes are equal. The slope of a line in the form ax + by = c is -a/b. So, we need to find the value of k for which the slopes of the two lines are equal.
The slope of the first line is k/3 and the slope of the second line is 4/5. Setting these equal gives k/3 = 4/5. Solving for k gives k = 12/5.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
