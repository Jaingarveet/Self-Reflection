## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.

Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: In the $x y$-plane, the graph of the function $f(x)=x^{2}+5 x+4$ has two $x$-intercepts. What is the distance between the $x$-intercepts?
Choices:
  A: 1
  B: 2
  C: 3
  D: 4
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The x-intercepts of the function are the solutions to the equation f(x) = 0, or x^2 + 5x + 4 = 0. This can be factored into (x+1)(x+4) = 0, which gives the solutions x = -1 and x = -4. The distance between these two points is |-1 - (-4)| = 3.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
