# Model: gpt-4 | Agent: baseline | Exam: sat-math-100 | Problem 25 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:

## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: $$\begin{aligned}y & =x^{2} \\2 y+6 & =2(x+3)\end{aligned}$$If $(x, y)$ is a solution of the system of equations above and $x>0$, what is the value of $x y$ ?
Choices:
  A: 1
  B: 2
  C: 3
  D: 9
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
First, simplify the second equation: 2y + 6 = 2x + 6. This simplifies to 2y = 2x, or y = x.
Substitute y = x into the first equation: x = x^2. This simplifies to x^2 - x = 0.
Factor the equation: x(x - 1) = 0. This gives two solutions: x = 0 or x = 1.
Since the problem states that x > 0, the only valid solution is x = 1.
Substitute x = 1 into the equation y = x to find y = 1.
Therefore, xy = 1 * 1 = 1.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
