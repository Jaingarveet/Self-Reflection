## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: \begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}\cline { 2 - 3 }\multicolumn{1}{c|}{} & \multicolumn{2}{c|}{Handedness} \\\hlineGender & Left & Right \\\hline\hlineFemale &  &  \\\hlineMale &  &  \\\hline\hlineTotal & 18 & 122 \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}The incomplete table above summarizes the number of left-handed students and right-handed students by gender for the eighth-grade students atKeisel Middle School. There are 5 times as many right-handed female students as there are left-handed female students, and there are 9 times as many right-handed male students as there are left-handed male students. If there is a total of 18 left-handed students and 122 right-handed students in the school, which of the following is closest to the probability that a right-handed student selected at random is female? (Note: Assume that none of the eighth-grade students are both right-handed and left-handed.)
Choices:
  A: 0.410
  B: 0.357
  C: 0.333
  D: 0.250
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let's denote the number of left-handed female students as x. Then, the number of right-handed female students is 5x. 
Similarly, let's denote the number of left-handed male students as y. Then, the number of right-handed male students is 9y. 
From the problem, we know that the total number of left-handed students is 18, so x + y = 18. 
We also know that the total number of right-handed students is 122, so 5x + 9y = 122. 
We can solve this system of equations to find the values of x and y. 
From the first equation, we can express y as 18 - x. Substituting this into the second equation, we get 5x + 9(18 - x) = 122. Simplifying this equation, we get 5x + 162 - 9x = 122, which simplifies to -4x = -40. Solving for x, we get x = 10. 
Substituting x = 10 into the first equation, we get 10 + y = 18, so y = 8. 
So, there are 10 left-handed female students and 8 left-handed male students. This means there are 50 right-handed female students and 72 right-handed male students. 
The probability that a right-handed student selected at random is female is the number of right-handed female students divided by the total number of right-handed students, which is 50 / 122 = 0.410.
