## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.

Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: $$g(x)=a x^{2}+24$$For the function $g$ defined above, $a$ is a constant and $g(4)=8$. What is the value of $g(-4)$ ?
Choices:
  A: 8
  B: 0
  C: -1
  D: -8
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
First, we need to find the value of a. We know that g(4) = 8, so we can substitute these values into the equation to solve for a:
8 = a * 4^2 + 24
8 = 16a + 24
16a = 8 - 24
16a = -16
a = -16 / 16
a = -1
Now that we know a = -1, we can substitute this value and x = -4 into the equation to find g(-4):
g(-4) = -1 * (-4)^2 + 24
g(-4) = -1 * 16 + 24
g(-4) = -16 + 24
g(-4) = 8
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
