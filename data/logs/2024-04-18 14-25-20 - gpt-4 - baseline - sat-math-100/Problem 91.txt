# Model: gpt-4 | Agent: baseline | Exam: sat-math-100 | Problem 91 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:
Topic: Geography
Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")

Topic: Math
Question: \begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|c||c|c|c|c|}\hline$n$ & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\\hline$f(n)$ & -2 & 1 & 4 & 7 \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}The table above shows some values of the linear function $f$. Which of the following defines $f$ ?
Choices:
  A: $f(n)=n-3$
  B: $f(n)=2 n-4$
  C: $f(n)=3 n-5$
  D: $f(n)=4 n-6$
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The function is linear, so the difference between consecutive y-values (f(n)) should be constant. From the table, the difference between consecutive y-values is 3 (1 - -2 = 3, 4 - 1 = 3, 7 - 4 = 3). This means the coefficient of n in the function should be 3. So, the function should be of the form f(n) = 3n + c. To find c, we can substitute one of the given points into the function. Let's use the point (1, -2). Substituting these values into the function gives -2 = 3*1 + c. Solving for c gives c = -5. So, the function is f(n) = 3n - 5.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
