## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Context: \begin{center}.\begin{tabular}{|l|c|}.\hline.\multicolumn{1}{|c|}{Planet} & Acceleration due to gravity $\left(\frac{\mathrm{m}}{\mathrm{sec}^{2}}\right)$ \\.\hline\hline.Mercury & 3.6 \\.\hline.Venus & 8.9 \\.\hline.Earth & 9.8 \\.\hline.Mars & 3.8 \\.\hline.Jupiter & 26.0 \\.\hline.Saturn & 11.1 \\.\hline.Uranus & 10.7 \\.\hline.Neptune & 14.1 \\.\hline.\end{tabular}.\end{center}.The chart above shows approximations of the acceleration due to gravity in meters per.second squared $\left(\frac{\mathrm{m}}{\sec ^{2}}\right)$ for the eight planets in our solar system. The weight of an object on a given planet can be found by using the formula $W=m g$, where $W$ is the weight of the object measured in newtons, $m$ is the mass of the object measured in kilograms, and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity on the planet measured in $\frac{m}{\sec ^{2}}$
Question: An object on Earth has a weight of 150 newtons. On which planet would the same object have an approximate weight of 170 newtons?
Choices:
  A: Venus
  B: Saturn
  C: Uranus
  D: Neptune
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The weight of an object is given by the formula W = mg, where m is the mass of the object and g is the acceleration due to gravity. 
First, we need to find the mass of the object on Earth. We know that the weight on Earth is 150 newtons and the acceleration due to gravity on Earth is 9.8 m/s^2. So, we can solve for m:
150 = m * 9.8
m = 150 / 9.8
m ≈ 15.31 kg
Next, we need to find on which planet this object would weigh 170 newtons. We can use the same formula, but this time we solve for g:
170 = 15.31 * g
g = 170 / 15.31
g ≈ 11.1 m/s^2
Looking at the table, the planet with an acceleration due to gravity of approximately 11.1 m/s^2 is Saturn.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
