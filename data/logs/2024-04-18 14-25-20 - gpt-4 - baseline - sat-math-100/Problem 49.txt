# Model: gpt-4 | Agent: baseline | Exam: sat-math-100 | Problem 49 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")

Question: The equation $\frac{24 x^{2}+25 x-47}{a x-2}=-8 x-3-\frac{53}{a x-2}$ is true for all values of $x \neq \frac{2}{a}$, where $a$ is a constant.What is the value of $a$ ?
Choices:
  A: -16
  B: -3
  C: 3
  D: 16
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The equation is a rational equation, and it can be solved by equating the numerators of both sides since the denominators are already equal. 
So, we have: 
24x^2 + 25x - 47 = -8x - 3 - 53
24x^2 + 25x - 47 = -8x - 56
24x^2 + 33x + 9 = 0
This is a quadratic equation and can be solved by using the quadratic formula: x = [-b Â± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / 2a
Here, a = 24, b = 33, and c = 9. 
The discriminant (b^2 - 4ac) must be a perfect square for x to be a real number. 
So, we have: 
33^2 - 4*24*9 = 1089 - 864 = 225
Since 225 is a perfect square (15^2), the value of a does not affect the validity of the equation. 
Therefore, the value of a can be any real number. 
However, since the question asks for a specific value of a, we need to look at the choices given. 
None of the choices affect the validity of the equation, so there seems to be an error in the question. 
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
