# Model: gpt-4 | Agent: baseline | Exam: sat-math-100 | Problem 14 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:
Topic: Geography
Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")

Question: \begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}\hline$x$ & $a$ & $3 a$ & $5 a$ \\\hline$y$ & 0 & $-a$ & $-2 a$ \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}Some values of $x$ and their corresponding values of $y$ are shown in the table above, where $a$ is a constant. If there is a linear relationship between $x$ and $y$, which of the following equations represents the relationship?
Choices:
  A: $x+2 y=a$
  B: $x+2 y=5 a$
  C: $2 x-y=-5 a$
  D: $2 x-y=7 a$
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The relationship between x and y is linear, so it can be represented by the equation y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept. 
The slope can be calculated by taking the difference in y-values divided by the difference in x-values between any two points. 
From the table, we can take the points (a, 0) and (3a, -a). The slope m = (-a - 0) / (3a - a) = -a / 2a = -1/2.
The y-intercept is the y-value when x = 0. From the table, we can see that there is no x = 0, so we need to extrapolate. If we continue the pattern in the table, we can see that when x = 0, y = a.
So, the equation of the line is y = -1/2x + a. 
We can rearrange this to the form of the answer choices: 2x + y = 2a.
Action: None of the above options match the correct equation.
