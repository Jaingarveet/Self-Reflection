The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: The volume of right circular cylinder A is 22 cubic centimeters. What is the volume, in cubic centimeters, of a right circular cylinder with twice the radius and half the height of cylinder A?
Choices:
  A: 11
  B: 22
  C: 44
  D: 66
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The volume of a right circular cylinder is given by the formula V = πr²h. If we double the radius and halve the height, the new volume will be V = π(2r)²*(h/2) = 2πr²h. This is twice the original volume.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
