Question: $$0.10 x+0.20 y=0.18(x+y)$$Clayton will mix $x$ milliliters of a $10 \%$ by mass saline solution with $y$ milliliters of a $20 \%$ by mass saline solution in order to create an $18 \%$ by mass saline solution. The equation above represents this situation. If Clayton uses 100 milliliters of the $20 \%$ by mass saline solution, how many milliliters of the $10 \%$ by mass saline solution must he use?
Choices:
  A: 5
  B: 25
  C: 50
  D: 100
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The equation given is 0.10x + 0.20y = 0.18(x+y). We know that y = 100. We can substitute y = 100 into the equation and solve for x.
0.10x + 0.20(100) = 0.18(x+100)
0.10x + 20 = 0.18x + 18
20 - 18 = 0.18x - 0.10x
2 = 0.08x
x = 2 / 0.08
x = 25
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
