## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: Which of the following is an equation of a circle in the $x y$-plane with center $(0,4)$ and a radius with endpoint $\left(\frac{4}{3}, 5\right) ?$
Choices:
  A: $x^{2}+(y-4)^{2}=\frac{25}{9}$
  B: $x^{2}+(y+4)^{2}=\frac{25}{9}$
  C: $x^{2}+(y-4)^{2}=\frac{5}{3}$
  D: $x^{2}+(y+4)^{2}=\frac{3}{5}$
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The equation of a circle in the xy-plane with center (h, k) and radius r is given by (x-h)² + (y-k)² = r². 
Here, the center of the circle is (0,4), so h = 0 and k = 4. 
The radius of the circle is the distance between the center (0,4) and the endpoint (4/3, 5). 
We can calculate the radius using the distance formula: r = sqrt[(x2-x1)² + (y2-y1)²] = sqrt[(4/3-0)² + (5-4)²] = sqrt[(4/3)² + 1] = sqrt[16/9 + 1] = sqrt[25/9] = 5/3. 
So, the equation of the circle is (x-0)² + (y-4)² = (5/3)² = 25/9. 
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
