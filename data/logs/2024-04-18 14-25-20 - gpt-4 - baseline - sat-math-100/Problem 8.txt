Question: Alma bought a laptop computer at a store that gave a 20 percent discount off its original price. The total amount she paid to the cashier was $p$ dollars, including an 8 percent sales tax on the discounted price. Which of the following represents the original price of the computer in terms of $p$ ?
Choices:
  A: $0.88 p$
  B: $\frac{p}{0.88}$
  C: $(0.8)(1.08) p$
  D: $\frac{p}{(0.8)(1.08)}$
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The original price of the computer is discounted by 20 percent, so the price Alma paid before tax is 80 percent of the original price. This is represented as 0.8 * original price.
Then, an 8 percent sales tax is added to this discounted price, so the total price Alma paid is 108 percent of the discounted price. This is represented as 1.08 * discounted price.
So, the total price Alma paid, $p$, is equal to 1.08 * 0.8 * original price.
To find the original price in terms of $p$, we need to divide $p$ by 1.08 * 0.8.
Action: Answer("D")
