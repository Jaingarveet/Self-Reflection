Question: A rectangle was altered by increasing its length by 10 percent and decreasing its width by $p$ percent. If these alterations decreased the area of the rectangle by 12 percent, what is the value of $p$ ?
Choices:
  A: 12
  B: 15
  C: 20
  D: 22
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The area of a rectangle is given by the product of its length and width. If the length is increased by 10%, it becomes 1.1 times the original length. If the width is decreased by p%, it becomes (1 - p/100) times the original width. The new area is then 1.1*(1 - p/100) times the original area. 
Given that the new area is 12% less than the original area, we have:
1.1*(1 - p/100) = 0.88
Solving this equation for p gives us the percentage decrease in the width.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
