Question: \begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|l||c|c||c|}\cline { 2 - 4 }\multicolumn{1}{c||}{} & \multicolumn{2}{c||}{Age} & \multirow{2}{c|}{Total} \\\hlineGender & Under 40 & 40 or older \\\hline\hlineMale & 12 & 2 & 14 \\\hlineFemale & 8 & 3 & 11 \\\hline\hlineTotal & 20 & 5 & 25 \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}The table above shows the distribution of age and gender for 25 people who entered a contest. If the contest winner will be selected at random, what is the probability that the winner will be either a female under age 40 or a male age 40 or older?
Choices:
  A: $\frac{4}{25}$
  B: $\frac{10}{25}$
  C: $\frac{11}{25}$
  D: $\frac{16}{25}$
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The number of females under age 40 is 8 and the number of males age 40 or older is 2. 
So, the total number of people who are either a female under age 40 or a male age 40 or older is 8 + 2 = 10.
The total number of people is 25.
So, the probability that the winner will be either a female under age 40 or a male age 40 or older is 10/25.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
