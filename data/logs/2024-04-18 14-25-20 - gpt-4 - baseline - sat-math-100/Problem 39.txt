# Model: gpt-4 | Agent: baseline | Exam: sat-math-100 | Problem 39 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:

The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: $$\begin{aligned}& -3 x+y=6 \\& a x+2 y=4\end{aligned}$$In the system of equations above, $a$ is a constant. For which of the following values of $a$ does the system have no solution?
Choices:
  A: -6
  B: -3
  C: 3
  D: 6
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
A system of linear equations has no solution if the coefficients of x and y form parallel lines. This happens when the ratios of the coefficients of x and y in both equations are equal. 
In the given system of equations, the coefficients of x are -3 and a, and the coefficients of y are 1 and 2. 
The system will have no solution if -3/a = 1/2.
Solving for a gives a = -6.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
