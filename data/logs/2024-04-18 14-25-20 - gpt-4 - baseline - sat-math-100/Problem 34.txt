Topic: Math
Question: A book was on sale for $40 \%$ off its original price. If the sale price of the book was $\$ 18.00$, what was the original price of the book? (Assume there is no sales tax.)
Choices:
  A: $\$ 7.20$
  B: $\$ 10.80$
  C: $\$ 30.00$
  D: $\$ 45.00$
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The sale price of the book is 60% of the original price (100% - 40% = 60%). 
So, if $18.00 is 60% of the original price, we can find the original price by dividing $18.00 by 60% (or 0.60 in decimal form).
Action: 
Calculate $18.00 / 0.60 = $30.00
Answer: "C"
## Result:
Agent Answer: None
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
