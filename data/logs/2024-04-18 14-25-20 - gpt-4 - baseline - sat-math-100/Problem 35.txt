## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: $$\sqrt{4 x}=x-3$$What are all values of $x$ that satisfy the given equation?I. 1II. 9
Choices:
  A: I only
  B: II only
  C: I and II
  D: Neither I nor II
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
To find the values of x that satisfy the equation, we can substitute the given values into the equation and see if both sides are equal.
For x = 1:
√(4*1) = 1 - 3
2 = -2
This is not true, so x = 1 does not satisfy the equation.
For x = 9:
√(4*9) = 9 - 3
6 = 6
This is true, so x = 9 does satisfy the equation.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
