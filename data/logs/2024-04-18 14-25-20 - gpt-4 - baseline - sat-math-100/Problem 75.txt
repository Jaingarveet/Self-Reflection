Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")

The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Context: $$.\begin{aligned}.& S(P)=\frac{1}{2} P+40 \\.& D(P)=220-P.\end{aligned}.$$.The quantity of a product supplied and the quantity of the product demanded in an economic market are functions of the price of the product. The functions above are the estimated supply and demand functions for a certain product. The function $S(P)$ gives the quantity of the product supplied to the market when the price is $P$ dollars, and the function $D(P)$ gives the quantity of the product demanded by the market when the price is $P$ dollars.
Question: At what price will the quantity of the product supplied to the market equal the quantity of the product demanded by the market?
Choices:
  A: $\$ 90$
  B: $\$ 120$
  C: $\$ 133$
  D: $\$ 155$
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The quantity of the product supplied to the market will equal the quantity of the product demanded by the market when S(P) = D(P). 
So, we need to solve the equation 1/2P + 40 = 220 - P.
Action: 
First, multiply the entire equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:
P + 80 = 440 - 2P
Then, add 2P to both sides to get:
3P + 80 = 440
Subtract 80 from both sides to get:
3P = 360
Finally, divide both sides by 3 to solve for P:
P = 120
Answer: Answer("B")
