## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning, so J cannot be one of them since it must be shown in the evening.
K cannot be shown in the morning, so it cannot be the first or second house shown.
L must be shown after K and before M, so it cannot be the first house shown.

Since J must be shown in the evening, it must be either the sixth or seventh house shown.
If J is the sixth house shown, then K, L, and M must be shown in the afternoon since they cannot be shown in the morning and L must be shown between K and M.
If J is the seventh house shown, then K, L, and M can be shown in either the afternoon or evening, but they must still be shown in the order K, L, M.

Choice A says that K is shown at some time after J is shown, but this cannot be true since J must be shown in the evening and K cannot be shown in the morning.
Choice B says that L is shown at some time after J is shown, but this cannot be true since L must be shown between K and M and J must be shown in the evening.
Choice C says that P is shown at some time after J is shown, which could be true if J is the sixth house shown and P is the seventh house shown.
Choice D says that both N and O are shown at some time after M is shown, which could be true if M is the fifth house shown and N and O are the sixth and seventh houses shown.
Choice E says that both N and P are shown at some time after K is shown, which could be true if K is the third house shown and N and P are the sixth and seventh houses shown.

Action: Answer("C")
