Context: A bakery makes exactly three kinds of cookieâ€”oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar. Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day. The following conditions apply: No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.

## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Since no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, the nine batches must be distributed among the other four days.
Monday already has at least one batch, and since no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day, Monday can have at most three batches.
If Monday had three batches, then the remaining six batches would have to be distributed among Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday, with at least two batches on each day. However, this is not possible since the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, so Thursday already has one batch and cannot have more than three.
Therefore, Monday must have either one or two batches.
If Monday had only one batch, then Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday would have to have at least two batches each, which is not possible since no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
Therefore, Monday must have exactly two batches.
Since the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies, these two batches must be made on Monday.
The remaining batch for Monday must be a sugar cookie batch, which means that the first batch of sugar cookies is made on Monday.
Since the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, the third batch of sugar cookies must be made on Tuesday.
The remaining batches for Tuesday must be the third batch of oatmeal cookies and the second batch of peanut butter cookies.
The remaining batches for Thursday must be the third batch of peanut butter cookies and the first batch of oatmeal cookies.
The remaining batch for Friday must be the third batch of oatmeal cookies.
Action: Answer("C")
