## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The question states that bay 4 is holding produce.
The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel, so bay 4 cannot be holding fuel.
The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock, so bay 1 cannot be holding grain or livestock.
The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles, so bay 1 cannot be holding textiles.
The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce, so bay 3 must be holding textiles.
Therefore, bay 1 cannot be holding produce, grain, livestock, or textiles, so it must be holding machinery.
Bay 2 cannot be holding produce, grain, livestock, or textiles, so it must be holding fuel.
Bay 5 cannot be holding produce, grain, livestock, or textiles, so it must be holding grain.
Bay 6 cannot be holding produce, grain, livestock, or textiles, so it must be holding livestock.
Therefore, the type of cargo that bay 1, bay 2, bay 3, bay 4, bay 5, and bay 6 is holding is completely determined.
