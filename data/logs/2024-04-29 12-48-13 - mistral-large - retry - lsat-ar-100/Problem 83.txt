## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Since Julio and Kevin both lead morning sessions, they must be on Wednesday and Thursday morning, respectively, because Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
Since Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day, Rebecca must lead the afternoon session on Thursday.
Since Nessa must lead an afternoon session, she must lead the afternoon session on Friday.
Since Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day, Lan cannot lead a session on Friday.
Therefore, Lan must lead a session on Wednesday or Thursday.
Since Lan cannot lead a session on Thursday because Rebecca is leading the afternoon session, Lan must lead the morning session on Wednesday.
Action: Answer("B")
