Topic: Law
Context: A software company employs exactly seven sales representatives—Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall—to work in its three sales zones—Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3. Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Question: If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Kim works in Zone 2.
  B: Mahr works in Zone 2.
  C: Parra works in Zone 3.
  D: Tiao works in Zone 1.

## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Since there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, and more sales representatives working in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, Zone 1 must have the most sales representatives.
If Parra works in Zone 3, then Tiao cannot work in Zone 1, and Udall cannot work in Zone 2. This means that Zone 1 would have only one sales representative, which contradicts the condition that Zone 1 has the most sales representatives.
If Tiao works in Zone 1, then Parra cannot work in Zone 1, and Udall cannot work in Zone 2. This means that Zone 2 would have only one sales representative, which contradicts the condition that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Therefore, neither Parra nor Tiao can work in Zone 3 or Zone 1.
Since Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other, and Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other, the only possible configuration is for Parra and Quinn to work in Zone 1, Stuckey and Udall to work in Zone 2, and Kim and Mahr to work in Zone 3.
Action: Answer("B") (Mahr works in Zone 2)
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: E
Score: 0
