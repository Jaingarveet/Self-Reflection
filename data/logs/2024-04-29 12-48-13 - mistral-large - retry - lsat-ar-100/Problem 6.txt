## Assistant 2:
Thought:
From the given conditions, we know that Kramer and Lopez each review fewer plays than Megregian. This means that Megregian must review all three plays (Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation). Since neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews, Jiang must review none of the three plays, which contradicts the given conditions. Therefore, Jiang must review exactly one play. Since Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, Jiang cannot review Tamerlane. Thus, Jiang must review either Sunset or Undulation. Since exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other, O'Neill must review the same play as Jiang in addition to Tamerlane. Therefore, O'Neill reviews two plays, and Megregian reviews three plays.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
