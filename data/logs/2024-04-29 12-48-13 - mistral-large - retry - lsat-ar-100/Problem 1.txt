## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Since Iturbe testifies on Wednesday, and exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday, that leaves only one witness for Monday. Franco cannot testify on the same day as Garcia, so they cannot both testify on Tuesday. Hong cannot testify on Monday, so they must testify on Tuesday or Wednesday.

If Garcia is the only witness scheduled to testify on Monday, then Franco cannot testify on Tuesday, leaving only Wednesday for Franco. But Iturbe is already scheduled for Wednesday, so this is not possible. Therefore, Garcia cannot be the only witness scheduled to testify on Monday.

If Jackson is scheduled to testify on Tuesday, then Franco and Garcia must both testify on Wednesday, which is not possible since Iturbe is already scheduled for Wednesday. Therefore, Jackson cannot be scheduled to testify on Tuesday.

If Garcia and Hong are both scheduled to testify on Tuesday, then Franco must testify on Monday. But Hong cannot testify on Monday, so this is not possible. Therefore, Garcia and Hong cannot both be scheduled to testify on Tuesday.

If Franco is the only witness scheduled to testify on Monday, then Garcia and Hong must both testify on Tuesday. But Hong cannot testify on Monday, so this is not possible. Therefore, Franco cannot be the only witness scheduled to testify on Monday.

If Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Iturbe, then they must both testify on Wednesday. But Iturbe is already scheduled for Wednesday, so this is not possible. Therefore, Franco cannot be scheduled to testify on the same day as Iturbe.

Action: Answer("B")
