## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning, so J cannot be one of them since it must be shown in the evening. K cannot be shown in the morning, so it cannot be one of the first two houses either. L must be shown after K, so it cannot be the first house shown.

Since J and K cannot be shown in the morning, the first two houses shown must be from the remaining options: L, M, N, O, and P. However, since L must be shown after K, it cannot be the first house shown. Therefore, the first house shown must be one of M, N, O, or P.

The third, fourth, and fifth houses to be shown will be shown in the afternoon. Since J must be shown in the evening, it cannot be one of these three houses. K cannot be shown in the morning, so it must be shown in the afternoon or evening. L must be shown after K, so it cannot be shown until K has been shown. Therefore, K must be shown before L, and since J must be shown in the evening, K must be shown in the afternoon.

Since K must be shown in the afternoon, and L must be shown after K and before M, L must also be shown in the afternoon.

The sixth and seventh houses to be shown will be shown in the evening. Since J must be shown in the evening, it must be one of these two houses. Since L must be shown before M, and L is shown in the afternoon, M cannot be shown until the evening. Therefore, M must be the other house shown in the evening.
