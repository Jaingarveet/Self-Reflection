Context: An administrator must assign parking spaces to six new employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young. Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.

## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Since Robertson is assigned parking space #3, Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than #3. Therefore, Young cannot be assigned parking space #2.
Since Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa, Togowa cannot be assigned parking space #2.
Since Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, Souza cannot be assigned parking space #4.
Therefore, Souza must be assigned parking space #2, and Togowa must be assigned parking space #1.
Since Robertson is assigned parking space #3, Xu cannot be assigned parking space #1 or #2. Therefore, Xu must be assigned parking space #4, #5, or #6.
Since Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa, Young must be assigned parking space #4, #5, or #6.
Since Robertson is assigned parking space #3, Vaughn cannot be assigned parking space #1, #2, or #3. Therefore, Vaughn must be assigned parking space #4, #5, or #6.
Therefore, the only possible assignment of parking spaces that satisfies all the rules is:
Togowa - #1
Souza - #2
Robertson - #3
Young - #4
Vaughn - #5
Xu - #6
Action: Answer("D")
