## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Since Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, we have four students left to give the six reports: George, Helen, Irving, and Nina.
Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report, so he must give the morning report on Tuesday.
Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report, so they cannot give a morning report either since there are only two reports per day.
If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
Since George is giving a report on Tuesday, Nina cannot give a report on Monday because Helen and Irving would have to give reports on Tuesday, which is not possible since George is already giving a report on Tuesday.
Therefore, Nina must give her report on Wednesday.
This leaves Helen and Irving to give the remaining two reports on Monday and Tuesday afternoon.
Action: Answer("A")
