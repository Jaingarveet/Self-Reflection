Context: Of the eight students—George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert—in a seminar, exactly six will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.

## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Since George can only give a report on Tuesday, he cannot be paired with anyone who must give a report on Wednesday. Therefore, choice A is not possible.
If Nina gives a report, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on the next day, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. Therefore, if Nina and Helen give reports on the same day, it must be on Wednesday.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
