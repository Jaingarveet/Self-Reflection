[header] How to get rid of chilblains [title] Use calamine lotion or witch hazel for itching. [step] Chilblains can be extremely itchy, but scratching them may result in an infection. To ease the itchiness of chilblains without scratching, apply some calamine lotion or witch hazel onto your chilblains using a cotton ball.
Choices:
  A: This will leave your chilblains feeling soft and soothing. [substeps] Do not use witch hazel or similar products if you have sensitive skin.
  B: Let it sit on the itchy rash for up to 5 minutes. [substeps] You can also purchase witch hazel at a pharmacy or physician's office.
  C: Both work well, so use whichever you have on hand. [substeps] Don't rub the lotion or witch hazel into your chilblains.
  D: Repeat this cycle every day for up to three days until the itch is gone. [substeps] If you are not used to scratching or do not want to seek medical treatment for an itch, ask your doctor to prescribe.

## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The text describes how to treat the itchiness of chilblains with calamine lotion or witch hazel. The most likely completion of the text should provide further instructions or information about the treatment.

Option A suggests that the treatment will leave the chilblains feeling soft and soothing, which is not the primary goal of the treatment; the focus is on easing itchiness and preventing infection.

Option B suggests leaving the lotion or witch hazel on the rash for a duration, which is practical advice to ensure effectiveness and avoid over-application.

Option C mentions that both treatments work well, and it is unnecessary to favor one over the other, helping to reassure readers that they can expect positive results from either option.

Option D suggests repeating the application daily for up to three days, which provides clear instructions on the frequency and duration of treatment. It also advises involving a doctor, which is sensible advice for any medical condition.

Therefore, the best answer is D, as it provides clear, sensible, and safe instructions for treating chilblains.

Action: Answer("D")
