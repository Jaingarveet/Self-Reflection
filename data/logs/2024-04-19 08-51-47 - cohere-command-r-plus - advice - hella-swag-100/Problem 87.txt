[header] How to keep a cat out of potted plants [title] Use stones or rocks. [step] If you're struggling to keep your cat out of potted plants, a barrier method may be your best option to keep him out of the soil. Some owners find using rocks or stones can be a fun, aesthetically pleasing option.
Choices:
  A: A rock can be placed on the ground next to the plant that prevents your cat from accidentally planting it underneath the plant. [substeps] If you have your own small potted plant, try placing one rock or twig inside each plant.
  B: Block off any spaces around plant entrances to potted plants with rocks. [substeps] Make sure to check under the plants for broken glass, broken twigs, or other debris.
  C: [substeps] Lay the rocks around the base of the plant, making sure not to crush any stems or dig up the roots. When you water, the water should easily slip through the cracks of the rocks and get through to the soil.
  D: You can also create a barrier by setting up flat stones or pieces of furniture in small areas that your cat will be unable to easily get to. [substeps] Placing hidden objects above or below the plants is another suggestion.

## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The text describes a method for keeping cats out of potted plants by creating a barrier with stones or rocks.

Choice A mentions placing a rock next to the plant, which doesn't quite make sense in the context of the passage.

Choice B talks about blocking off spaces around plant entrances, which is not relevant to the topic of keeping cats out of the plants.

Choice C suggests laying rocks around the base of the plant, being careful not to damage it, and allowing water to reach the soil. This is a logical and grammatically correct continuation of the passage.

Choice D mentions creating a barrier with flat stones or furniture, but the mention of placing objects "above" the plants seems odd in this context.

Therefore, the correct answer is C.

Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
