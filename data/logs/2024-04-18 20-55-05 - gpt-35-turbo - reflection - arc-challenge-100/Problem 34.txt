For guidance, I will provide you with a single generic example problem and reflection (below).
## User 1:
Topic: Geography and Math
Question: What is the product of the number of letters contained in the name of the city where Iowa State University is located multiplied by the number of letters contained in the name of the state?
Choices:
    A: 16
    B: 20
    C: 24
    D: 32
Thought:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
ISU is located in the state of Iowa.
Action: Answer("D")
---
Correct Answer: A
## Assistant 1:
Explanation:
I miscalculated the product of the number of letters in the city and state names. 
The gap in my knowledge was not in geography but in basic arithmetic. 
I knew the correct city and state but made a calculation error.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Arithmetic error
 - Multiplication error
Solution:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
Iowa State University is located in the state of Iowa.
The city name "Ames" contains 4 letters.
The state name "Iowa" contains 4 letters.
The product of 4*4 is 16.
Instructions:
1. Identify the city where the university is located.
2. Identify the state where the university is located.
3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.
4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.
5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.
6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.
7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them.
## User 2:
Topic: Science
Question: A pharmaceutical company develops a new antibiotic to treat pneumonia. After limited testing, the researchers conclude that the antibiotic seems to be effective. How can the researchers strengthen their conclusions?
Choices:
  A: Test the antibiotic on human volunteers.
  B: Publish their results in a medical journal.
  C: Ask an independent lab to retest the antibiotic.
  D: Test the effectiveness of the antibiotic at killing other bacteria.

Thought:
Limited testing is not enough to draw a strong conclusion about the effectiveness of a new antibiotic. 
To strengthen their conclusions, the researchers need to conduct further testing and analysis.
Action: Answer("A")

 --- 
Correct Answer: C
## Assistant 2:
Response:
Explanation:
I incorrectly chose answer choice A, "Test the antibiotic on human volunteers," as the way to strengthen the researchers' conclusions. However, testing on human volunteers is not a way to strengthen the conclusions drawn from limited testing. Instead, the researchers should ask an independent lab to retest the antibiotic. This would provide an additional level of verification and validation of the initial findings. 
Error Keywords:
 - Misunderstanding of the question
 - Misinterpretation of the answer choices
 - Lack of knowledge of scientific research methods
Solution:
To strengthen the researchers' conclusions, they should ask an independent lab to retest the antibiotic. This would provide an additional level of verification and validation of the initial findings. 
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and understand the problem.
2. Identify the key information in the question.
3. Analyze each answer choice and eliminate the ones that are clearly incorrect.
4. Evaluate the remaining answer choices and choose the one that best addresses the question.
5. Double-check your answer to ensure accuracy.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Pay close attention to the details and key information in the question.
 - Analyze each answer choice carefully and eliminate the ones that are clearly incorrect.
 - Evaluate the remaining answer choices and choose the one that best addresses the question.
 - Double-check your answer to ensure accuracy.
 - If you are unsure about a question, eliminate the clearly incorrect answer choices and make an educated guess.
