## User 2:
Topic: Law
Context: A study of 86 patients, all of whom suffered from disease T and received the same standard medical treatment, divided the patients into 2 equal groups. One group's members all attended weekly support group meetings, but no one from the other group attended support group meetings. After 10 years, 41 patients from each group had died. Clearly, support group meetings do not help patients with disease T live longer.
Question: Which one of the following statements, if true, most seriously weakens the argument?
Choices:
  A: Of the 4 patients who survived more than 10 years, the 2 who had attended weekly support group meetings lived longer than the 2 who had not.
  B: For many diseases, attending weekly support group meetings is part of the standard medical treatment.
  C: The members of the group that attended weekly support group meetings lived 2 years longer, on average, than the members of the other group.
  D: Some physicians have argued that attending weekly support group meetings gives patients less faith in the standard treatment for disease T.
  E: Everyone in the group whose members attended weekly support group meetings reported after 1 year that those meetings had helped them to cope with the disease.
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
The argument concludes that support group meetings do not help patients with disease T live longer. However, choice [REDACTED] states that the members of the group that attended weekly support group meetings lived 2 years longer, on average, than the members of the other group. This information directly contradicts the conclusion and suggests that attending support group meetings may indeed have a positive effect on the lifespan of patients with disease T. Therefore, choice [REDACTED] most seriously weakens the argument.
