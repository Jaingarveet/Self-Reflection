Topic: Law
Context: Studies have found that human tears contain many of the same hormones that the human body produces in times of emotional stress. Hence, shedding tears removes significant quantities of these hormones from the body. Therefore, crying must have the effect of reducing emotional stress.
Question: The reasoning in the argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that the argument
Choices:
  A: overlooks the possibility that if crying has a tendency to reduce emotional stress, this tendency might arise because of something other than the shedding of tears
  B: confuses a condition that is required for the production of a given phenomenon with a condition that in itself would be sufficient to cause the production of that phenomenon
  C: fails to adequately address the possibility that, even if one phenomenon causally contributes to a second phenomenon, the second phenomenon may causally influence the first as well
  D: fails to adequately distinguish between two distinct factors that are jointly responsible for causing a given phenomenon
  E: takes for granted that because certain substances are present whenever a condition occurs, those substances are a cause of that condition

You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
The argument assumes that the shedding of tears is the cause of the reduction of emotional stress, without considering the possibility that other factors, such as the release of endorphins or the act of expressing emotions, may also play a role in reducing stress. Therefore, the argument is vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it takes for granted that because certain substances (tears) are present whenever a condition (emotional stress) occurs, those substances are a cause of that condition.

Choice [REDACTED] accurately describes this flaw in the argument. The argument assumes that the shedding of tears is the sole cause of the reduction of emotional stress, without considering other possible factors that may contribute to this effect. Therefore, choice [REDACTED] is the best answer.

The correct answer is [REDACTED].

Reflection:
I incorrectly answered the question because I misunderstood the argument and the correct answer choice. I chose answer [REDACTED], thinking that the argument was confusing a necessary condition with a sufficient condition. However, the correct answer is [REDACTED], as the argument takes for granted that the shedding of tears is the sole cause of the reduction of emotional stress, without considering other possible factors.

In the future, I will be more careful in my analysis of the argument and the answer choices, and consider all the possible flaws in the argument before selecting an answer. I will also make sure to read the question stem carefully and provide my answer in the correct format.
