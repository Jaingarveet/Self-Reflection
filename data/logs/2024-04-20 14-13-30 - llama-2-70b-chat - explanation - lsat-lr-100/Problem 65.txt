Context: The size of northern fur seals provides a reliable indication of their population levelsâ€”the smaller the average body size of seals in a population, the larger the population. Archaeologists studied seal fossils covering an 800-year period when the seals were hunted for food by Native peoples in North America and found that the average body size of the seals did not vary significantly.
Question: The statements above, if true, provide the most support for which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: During the 800-year period studied, seal hunting practices did not vary substantially between different groups of Native peoples in North America.
  B: The body size of northern fur seals is not strongly correlated with the overall health of the seals.
  C: Before the 800-year period studied, the average body size of northern fur seals fluctuated dramatically.
  D: Native peoples in North America made an effort to limit their hunting of northern fur seals in order to prevent depletion of seal populations.
  E: Hunting by Native peoples in North America did not significantly reduce the northern fur seal population over the 800-year period studied.
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
The passage states that the average body size of northern fur seals did not vary significantly over an 800-year period, despite being hunted for food by Native peoples in North America. This suggests that the population of northern fur seals remained relatively stable during that time, and therefore, hunting by Native peoples did not significantly reduce the population of northern fur seals. This supports choice [REDACTED], "[REDACTED]"
## Assistant 2:
  I cannot view the corrected answer as I am an AI language model. However, I can provide a response that can guide you to the correct answer.

The passage states that the average body size of northern fur seals did not vary significantly over an 800-year period, despite being hunted for food by Native peoples in North America. This suggests that the population of northern fur seals remained relatively stable during that time, and therefore, hunting by Native peoples did not significantly reduce the population of northern fur seals. This supports choice [REDACTED], "[REDACTED]"

Therefore, the answer is E: Hunting by Native peoples in North America did not significantly reduce the northern fur seal population over the 800-year period studied.
