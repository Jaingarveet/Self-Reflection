## Assistant 2:
  Sure, I'd be happy to help you answer this question.

Here's my reflection on the problem:

The question asks which statement must be true based on the curator's statements. The curator states that the museum displays only twentieth-century works, either on loan from private collectors or in the museum's permanent collection, and that prints of all the latter works are available in the museum store. The museum store also sells prints of some works that are not part of the museum's permanent collection, such as Hopper's Nighthawks.

My initial answer was choice A: Every print in the museum store is of a work that is either on loan to the museum from a private collector or part of the museum's permanent collection. However, upon reflection, I realized that this statement is not necessarily true. The museum store may sell prints of works that are not on loan or part of the permanent collection, such as Hopper's Nighthawks.

Therefore, the correct answer is choice B: Every print that is sold in the museum store is a copy of a twentieth-century work. This statement must be true based on the curator's statements, as the museum only displays twentieth-century works, and the museum store sells prints of all the works displayed in the museum. Additionally, the museum store sells prints of some works that are not part of the museum's permanent collection, such as Hopper's Nighthawks, which is a twentieth-century work.

So, the correct answer is choice B.
