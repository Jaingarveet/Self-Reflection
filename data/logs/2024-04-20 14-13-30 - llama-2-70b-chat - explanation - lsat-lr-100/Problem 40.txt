Topic: Law
Context: A significant amount of the acquisition budget of a typical university library is spent on subscriptions to scholarly journals. Over the last several years, the average subscription rate a library pays for such a journal has increased dramatically, even though the costs of publishing a scholarly journal have remained fairly constant Obviously, then, in most cases publishing a scholarly journal must be much more profitable now than it was several years ago.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument?
Choices:
  A: Many university libraries have begun to charge higher and higher fines for overdue books and periodicals as a way of passing on increased journal subscription costs to library users.
  B: A university library's acquisition budget usually represents only a small fraction of its total operating budget.
  C: Publishing a scholarly journal is an expensive enterprise, and publishers of such journals cannot survive financially if they consistently lose money.
  D: Most subscnbers to scholarly journals are individuals, not hbraries, and the subscription rates for individuals have generally remained unchanged for the past several years.
  E: The majority of scholarly journals are published no more than four times a year.

Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
The argument concludes that publishing a scholarly journal must be much more profitable now than it was several years ago because the average subscription rate has increased dramatically, even though the costs of publishing have remained fairly constant. However, choice [REDACTED] states that most subscribers to scholarly journals are individuals, and the subscription rates for individuals have generally remained unchanged for the past several years. This means that the increase in subscription rates is not due to an increase in demand from individuals, but rather from an increase in the number of libraries subscribing to the journals. Therefore, the increase in subscription rates does not necessarily indicate an increase in profitability for the publishers. Choice [REDACTED] weakens the argument by providing an alternative explanation for the increase in subscription rates.
## Assistant 2:
  Answer: D

The correct answer is D: Most subscribers to scholarly journals are individuals, and the subscription rates for individuals have generally remained unchanged for the past several years.

This answer choice weakens the argument by providing an alternative explanation for the increase in subscription rates. The argument assumes that the increase in subscription rates is due to an increase in demand from individuals, but choice D reveals that the subscription rates for individuals have remained unchanged. Therefore, the increase in subscription rates must be due to another factor, such as an increase in the number of libraries subscribing to the journals. This means that the increase in subscription rates does not necessarily indicate an increase in profitability for the publishers.
