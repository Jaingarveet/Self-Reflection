Topic: Law
Context: Some vegetarians have argued that there are two individually sufficient reasons for not eating meatâ€” one based on health considerations, and the other based on the aversion to living at the expense of other conscious creatures. But suppose that eating meat were essential to good health for humans. Then it would be less clear that an aversion to living at the expense of other conscious creatures is enough of a reason to stop eating meat.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes the role played in the argument by the supposition that eating meat is essential to good health?
Choices:
  A: It is used to disprove the vegetarian position that we should not eat meat.
  B: It is used to show that the two types of reasons cited in favor of vegetarianism are independent.
  C: It is used to disprove the claim that a vegetarian diet is healthy.
  D: It is used to weaken the claim that the consciousness of animals is a sufficient reason for not eating meat.
  E: It is used to show that there is no sufficient reason for not eating meat.
