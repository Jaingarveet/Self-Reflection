## User 2:
Topic: Law
Context: Figorian Wildlife Commission: The development of wetlands in industrialized nations for residential and commercial uses has endangered many species. To protect wildlife we must regulate such development in Figoria: future wetland development must be offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats. Thus, development would cause no net reduction of wetlands and pose no threat to the species that inhabit them. Figorian Development Commission: Other nations have flagrantly developed wetlands at the expense of wildlife. We have conserved. Since Figorian wetland development might not affect wildlife and is necessary for growth, we should allow development. We have as much right to govern our own resources as countries that have already put their natural resources to commercial use.
Question: Which one of the following principles, if accepted, would most strongly support the Figorian Development Commission's position against the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position?
Choices:
  A: National resources should be regulated by international agreement when wildlife is endangered.
  B: The right of future generations to have wildlife preserved supersedes the economic needs of individual nations.
  C: Only when a reduction of populations of endangered species by commercial development has been found should regulation be implemented to prevent further damage.
  D: Environment regulation must aim at preventing any further environmental damage and cannot allow for the different degrees to which different nations have already harmed the environment.
  E: It is imprudent to allow further depletion of natural resources.
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
The correct answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED]

The Figorian Wildlife Commission is calling for regulation to protect wildlife, but the Figorian Development Commission argues that Figorian wetland development would not affect wildlife and is necessary for growth. Option [REDACTED] suggests that regulation should only be implemented after damage has been done, which means that the Figorian Development Commission's position would be supported.

The other options do not support the Figorian Development Commission's position:

[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] This principle would support the Figorian Wildlife Commission's call for regulation to protect wildlife, as it suggests that international agreements should be in place to regulate national resources when wildlife is endangered.

[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] This principle would also support the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position, as it suggests that the need to preserve wildlife for future generations is more important than economic needs.

[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] This principle would not support either side, as it suggests that environmental regulation should focus on preventing further damage, but does not address the issue of past harm.

[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] This principle would support the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position, as it suggests that it is unwise to allow further depletion of natural resources.
