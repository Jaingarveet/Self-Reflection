Context: In studying the autobiographies of Native Americans, most scholars have focused on as-told-to life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators—that emerged from "bicultural composite authorship." Limiting their studies to such written documents, these scholars have overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history. In addition, they have failed to address the cultural constructs of the highly diverse Native American peoples, who prior to contact with nonindigenous cultures did not share with Europeans the same assumptions about self, life, and writing that underlie the concept of an autobiography— that indeed constitute the English word's root meaning. The idea of self was, in a number of pre-contact Native American cultures, markedly inclusive: identity was not merely individual, but also relational to a society, a specific landscape, and the cosmos. Within these cultures, the expression of life experiences tended to be oriented toward current events: with the participation of fellow tribal members, an individual person would articulate, reenact, or record important experiences as the person lived them, a mode of autobiography seemingly more fragmented than the European custom of writing down the recollections of a lifetime. Moreover, expression itself was not a matter of writing but of language, which can include speech and signs. Oral autobiography comprised songs, chants, stories, and even the process whereby one repeatedly took on new names to reflect important events and deeds in one's life. Dance and drama could convey personal history; for example, the advent of a vision to one person might require the enactment of that vision in the form of a tribal pageant. One can view as autobiographical the elaborate tattoos that symbolized a warrior's valorous deeds, and such artifacts as a decorated shield that communicated the accomplishments and aspirations of its maker, or a robe that was emblazoned with the pictographic history of the wearer's battles and was sometimes used in reenactments. Also autobiographical, and indicative of high status within the tribe, would have been a tepee painted with symbolic designs to record the achievements and display the dreams or visions of its owner, who was often assisted in the painting by other tribal members. A tribe would, then, have contributed to the individual's narrative not merely passively, by its social codes and expectations, but actively by joining in the expression of that narrative. Such intercultural collaboration may seem alien to the European style of autobiography, yet any autobiography is shaped by its creator's ideas about the audience for which it is intended; in this sense, autobiography is justly called a simultaneous individual story and cultural narrative. Autobiographical expressions by early Native Americans may additionally have been shaped by the cultural perspectives of the people who transmitted them.
Question: Which one of the following would be most consistent with the ideas about identity that the author attributes to pre-contact Native American cultures?
Choices:
  A: A person who is born into one tribe but is brought up by members of another tribe retains a name given at birth.
  B: A pictograph that represents a specific person incorporates the symbol for a constellation.
  C: A similar ritual for assuming a new name is used in diverse communities.
  D: A name given to one member of a community cannot be given to another member of the same community.
  E: A decorated shield that belonged to an individual cannot be traced to a particular tribe.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The author describes pre-contact Native American cultures as having a sense of self that was inclusive and relational to society, specific landscapes, and the cosmos. This means that an individual's identity was closely tied to their community and the natural world. 

Now, let's evaluate the choices:
Choice A describes a person born into one tribe but brought up by another, retaining a name from their birth tribe. This could indicate a sense of individual identity being tied to one's birth community, which is consistent with the described cultural perspective. 

Choice B mentions a pictograph representing a specific person, incorporating a symbol for a constellation. This doesn't directly relate to the described cultural perspective of a relational identity. 

Choice C suggests that a ritual for assuming a new name is shared across diverse communities. This doesn't reflect the cultural perspective described, as it lacks the unique relational aspect to the individual's specific community and landscape. 

Choice D states that names within a community are unique and not repeated, which doesn't directly relate to the described cultural perspective of identity. 

Choice E mentions a decorated shield that cannot be traced to a particular tribe. This goes against the idea of identity being relational to one's specific community and cultural context. 

Choice A is the most consistent with the author's description of pre-contact Native American cultures' perspective on identity.
