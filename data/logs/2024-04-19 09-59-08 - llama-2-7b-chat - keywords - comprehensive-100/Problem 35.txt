Topic: Law
Context: Mayor: There has been a long debate in city council about how to accommodate projected increases in automobile traffic. Today, our choice is clear: either we adopt my plan to build a new expressway, or we do nothing. Doing nothing is not a viable option because our existing system of roads would be in gridlock within ten years given even a conservative estimate of future traffic levels. City council should therefore adopt my plan.
Question: The reasoning in the mayor's argument is most vulnerable to which one of the following criticisms?
Choices:
  A: It bases a projection only on conservative estimates rather than considering a wider range of estimates.
  B: It takes for granted that the options it considers are mutually exclusive.
  C: It fails to consider the possibility that the rate of increase in traffic will start to diminish after ten years.
  D: It fails to address the issue of the cost of traffic gridlock to the city's economy.
  E: It presents a choice that is limited to two options, without giving reasons for not considering any other options

Question: The reasoning in the mayor's argument is most vulnerable to which one of the following criticisms?

Reflection:
After reflecting on the problem, my solution, and the correct answer, I realize that my previous answer was incorrect. The reasoning in the mayor's argument is most vulnerable to criticism E: It presents a choice that is limited to two options, without giving reasons for not considering any other options.

The mayor's argument presents only two options: either adopting the mayor's plan to build a new expressway or doing nothing. However, there may be other viable options that the mayor has not considered, such as improving public transportation, promoting alternative modes of transportation, or implementing traffic management strategies that do not involve building a new expressway. By limiting the options to only two, the mayor's argument fails to address the possibility of other, potentially better solutions.

Therefore, the correct answer is (E) It presents a choice that is limited to two options, without giving reasons for not considering any other options.
