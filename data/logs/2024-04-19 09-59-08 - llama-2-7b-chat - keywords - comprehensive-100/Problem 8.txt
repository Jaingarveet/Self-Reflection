## Assistant 2:
  Thought: 
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand the mistake. The correct solution involves using the concept of relative speed, which is the speed at which the two cars are moving relative to each other.

Action: Answer("B")

Self-Reflection:
To solve this problem, I used the formula:
distance = speed x time

I calculated the speed of each car as follows:
car 1: 12 mph
car 2: 13 mph

Then, I calculated the time it takes for the cars to meet by dividing the distance of the highway by the relative speed of the cars:
time = distance / relative speed

I plugged in the values I had obtained:
time = 50 miles / (12 mph - 13 mph) = 1.25 hours

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 1.25 hours.

Error Keywords:
Relative speed, distance, time, speed, highway.
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: E
