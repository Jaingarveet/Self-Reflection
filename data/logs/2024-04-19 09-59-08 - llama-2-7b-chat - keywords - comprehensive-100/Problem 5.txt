Self-Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I realized that I made a mistake in my calculation. I misunderstood the problem and calculated the sum of the ages incorrectly. I will make sure to carefully read and understand the problem before answering.

To solve this problem, I will use the formula for the nth term of an A.P.:

a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d

where a_1 is the first term, n is the term number, and d is the common difference.

Given that the youngest member is 7 years old, and the sum of the ages is 250, we can set up the equation:

7 + (n - 1) * 3 = 250

Solving for n, we get:

n = 20

Therefore, there are 20 members in the club.
