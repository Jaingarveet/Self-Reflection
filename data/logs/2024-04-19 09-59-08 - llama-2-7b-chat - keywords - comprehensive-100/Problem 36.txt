Context: Editorial: Painting involves a sequential application of layers, each of which adheres satisfactorily only if the underlying layer has been properly applied. Education is, in this respect, like the craft of painting. Since the most important steps in painting are preparation of the surface to be painted and application of the primer coat, it makes sense to suppose that .
Question: Which one of the following most logically completes the editorial's argument?
Choices:
  A: in the educator's initial contact with a student, the educator should be as undemanding as possible
  B: students who have a secure grasp of the fundamentals of a subject are likely to make progress in that subject
  C: educators who are not achieving the goals they intended should revise their teaching methods
  D: teaching new students is rewarding but much more difficult than teaching more advanced students
  E: the success of a student's overall educational experience depends above all upon that student's initial educational experience

Question: Which one of the following most logically completes the editorial's argument?

Choices:

A: in the educator's initial contact with a student, the educator should be as undemanding as possible

Reflection:

I previously answered this question incorrectly. Upon reflection, I realized that the editorial's argument is that education is like the craft of painting, and the most important steps in painting are preparation of the surface to be painted and application of the primer coat. Therefore, the most logically completing answer is B: students who have a secure grasp of the fundamentals of a subject are likely to make progress in that subject.

Explanation:
The editorial argues that education is like the craft of painting, and the most important steps in painting are preparation of the surface to be painted and application of the primer coat. This is similar to how education works, where the most important steps are laying a strong foundation and applying the primer coat of knowledge. Just as a painting cannot be completed without proper preparation and application of the primer coat, a student cannot make progress in a subject without a solid foundation and a clear understanding of the fundamentals. Therefore, the answer that most logically completes the editorial's argument is B: students who have a secure grasp of the fundamentals of a subject are likely to make progress in that subject.
