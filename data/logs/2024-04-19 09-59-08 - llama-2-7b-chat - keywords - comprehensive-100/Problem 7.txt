## Assistant 2:
  Thought: 
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand that the average weight of the group of vehicles increased by 2.6 tons after the new heavy-duty truck was added. To find the weight of the heavy-duty truck, I need to use the formula for the arithmetic mean, which is:

$$ \text{Weight of heavy-duty truck} = \frac{\text{Total weight of vehicles} - \text{Average weight of vehicles before addition}}{1 - \frac{\text{Average weight of vehicles before addition}}{10}} $$

Using the given information, I can plug in the values:

$$ \text{Weight of heavy-duty truck} = \frac{10 \times 12.2}{1 - 0.12} = 43.5 \text{ tons} $$

Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: A
