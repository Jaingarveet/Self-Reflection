## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I made a mistake in my calculation. I misunderstood the phrase "half of her weight" and calculated it as (x/2) instead of (x/2) + x.
I also simplified the expression incorrectly, combining like terms instead of solving for x.
Error Keywords:
- Calculation error
- Misunderstanding the problem
- Simplification error

Solution:
Let's assume Meenu's weight to be x.
According to the statement, Meenu said she weighs 29 kg plus half of her weight.
So, Meenu's weight can be represented as: x + (x/2) + x = 3x/2
Now, we know that Meenu's weight is 29 kg plus half of her weight, which is 29 + (29/2) = 29 + 14.5 = 43.5 kg.

Instructions:
1. Read the problem carefully and understand the given information.
2. Let the weight of Meenu be x.
3. Write an expression for Meenu's weight based on the given information: x + (x/2) + x.
4. Simplify the expression: 3x/2.
5. Solve for x: 3x/2 = 43.5.
6. Calculate x: x = 29.
7. Choose the answer that matches the calculated value: D.

Advice:
- Always read the problem carefully and understand the given information.
- Be careful when simplifying expressions and solving equations.
- Double-check your calculations and final answer.
- Use a step-by-step approach to solve problems.
- Don't assume you know the answer without going through the process.
