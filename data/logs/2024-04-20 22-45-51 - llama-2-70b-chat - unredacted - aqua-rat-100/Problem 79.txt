Action: Answer("E")

Explanation:
I made a mistake in my calculation. I misunderstood the question and calculated the amount each daughter receives incorrectly. I apologize for my mistake.

Error Keywords:

* Misunderstanding of the question
* Calculation error
* Incorrect answer

Solution:
Let's assume that each nephew receives x rupees.
Since there are 2 nephews, the total amount they receive is 2x rupees.

Each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, so each daughter receives 4x rupees.

There are 4 daughters, so the total amount they receive is 4x + 4x + 4x + 4x = 16x rupees.

Since there are 5 sons, each son receives five times as much as each nephew, so each son receives 5x rupees.

The total amount the sons receive is 5x + 5x + 5x + 5x + 5x = 25x rupees.

The total amount available to divide is Rs 8600, so we can set up the following equation:

16x + 25x = 8600

Simplifying the equation, we get:

41x = 8600

Dividing both sides by 41, we get:

x = 210

So, each daughter receives 4x = 4(210) = 840 rupees.

The correct answer is:

E: Rs 800

Therefore, the answer is E.

Instructions:

1. Read the question carefully and understand the problem.
2. Let's assume that each nephew receives x rupees.
3. Calculate the total amount the daughters receive.
4. Calculate the total amount the sons receive.
5. Set up an equation using the total amount available to divide.
6. Simplify the equation and solve for x.
7. Calculate the amount each daughter receives.
8. Choose the correct answer.

Advice:

* Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
* Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
* Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
* Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
* Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
* Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them.
