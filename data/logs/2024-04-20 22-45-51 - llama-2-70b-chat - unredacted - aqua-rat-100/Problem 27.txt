Error Keywords:

* Misunderstanding the problem
* Incorrect interpretation of the information given

Solution:
Let's analyze the problem step by step:

1. M men agree to purchase a gift for Rs. D.
2. 3 men drop out, leaving M - 3 men.
3. The total amount D remains the same.
4. The contribution of each man will increase because there are fewer men to share the cost.

## Assistant 2:
  Action: Answer("A")

Explanation:
The problem states that M men agree to purchase a gift for Rs. D, but 3 men drop out. The total amount, D, remains the same, so the contribution of each man will increase. To find the new contribution per man, we can divide the total amount by the number of men remaining, which is M - 3. Therefore, the correct answer is D / (M - 3), which is option A.
