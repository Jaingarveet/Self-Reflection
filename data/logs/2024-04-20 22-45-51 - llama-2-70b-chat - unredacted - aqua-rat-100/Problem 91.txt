## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:
Topic: Geography
Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math

Explanation:
I made a mistake in my calculation. I misunderstood the question and added the vectors component-wise, which is not correct. I should have used the Pythagorean theorem to find the hypotenuse of the right triangle formed by A's journey.

Error Keywords:

* Vector addition
* Pythagorean theorem
* Right triangle

Solution:
Let's break down A's journey:

1. A travels 3 km towards the south.
2. Then, A travels 5 km towards the east.
3. Next, A travels 3 km towards the north.
4. Finally, A travels 2 km towards the west.

We can represent A's journey as a right triangle with legs of length 3 km and 5 km, and a hypotenuse of unknown length.

Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the length of the hypotenuse:

Hypotenuse = sqrt(3^2 + 5^2)

= sqrt(9 + 25)

= sqrt(34)

= 6 km

So, A is 6 km away from home.

Instructions:

1. Draw a diagram of A's journey.
2. Identify the legs of the right triangle formed by A's journey.
3. Use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the hypotenuse.
4. Calculate the length of the hypotenuse.
5. Choose the answer that matches the calculated length.

Advice:

* Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
* Always draw a diagram to visualize the problem.
* Always use the appropriate formula or theorem to solve the problem.
* Always calculate the answer precisely.
* Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
