## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Topic: Math
Question: Kevin drove from A to B at a constant speed of 70 mph. Once he reached B, he turned right around with pause, and returned to A at a constant speed of 90 mph. Exactly 3 hours before the end of his trip, he was still approaching B, only 70 miles away from it. What is the distance between A and B?
Choices:
  A: 180
  B: 90
  C: 270
  D: 360
  E: None of the above
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I made a mistake in my calculation of the distance traveled by Kevin.
I incorrectly calculated the distance traveled as 420 miles, when in fact it was 180 miles.
This mistake was due to a misapplication of the formula:

Distance = Time x Speed

I applied this formula incorrectly, using the speed of 70 mph for both the distance traveled to B and the distance traveled back to A.
However, the correct speed for the distance traveled back to A should have been 90 mph.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Formula misapplication
 - Speed mistake
Solution:
Kevin drove from A to B at a constant speed of 70 mph.
The time it took him to reach B is:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = B - A / 70

The distance traveled to B is:

Distance = Time x Speed
Distance = B - A / 70 x 70
Distance = B - A / 70 x 70

Since he turned right around and returned to A at a constant speed of 90 mph, the time it took him to return to A is:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = A - B / 90

The distance traveled back to A is:

Distance = Time x Speed
Distance = A - B / 90 x 90
Distance = A - B / 90 x 90

The total distance traveled is the sum of the distance traveled to B and the distance traveled back to A:

Total distance = Distance to B + Distance back to A
Total distance = B - A / 70 x 70 + A - B / 90 x 90
Total distance = B - A / 70 x 70 + A - B / 90 x 90

Now, let's look at the choices:

A: 180 miles - Too small
B: 90 miles - Too small
C: 270 miles - Too small
D: 360 miles - Too large
E: None of the above - Incorrect, there is a valid answer

The correct answer is:

Action: Answer("180")

Instructions:
1. Identify the formula for distance traveled:
Distance = Time x Speed
2. Use the formula to calculate the distance traveled to B:
Distance = B - A / 70 x 70
3. Use the formula to calculate the distance traveled back to A:
Distance = A - B / 90 x 90
4. Calculate the total distance traveled:
Total distance = Distance to B + Distance back to A
5. Check your answer against the given choices.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that the formula for distance traveled is:
Distance = Time x Speed
 - Be careful when applying formulas, ensure the correct variables are used.
