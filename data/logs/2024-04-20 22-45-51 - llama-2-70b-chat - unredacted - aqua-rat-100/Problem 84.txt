## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I miscounted the number of ways to arrange the children in a straight line.
I mistakenly believed that there was only one way to arrange the children, when in fact, there are three ways.
Error Keywords:
- Counting error
- Combinatorics error
- Arrangement error

Solution:
Let's list out all the ways to arrange the children in a straight line:

1. Susan, Tim, Zen
2. Tim, Susan, Zen
3. Zen, Susan, Tim

There are three ways to arrange the children in a straight line, so the answer is B.

Instructions:
1. List out all the ways to arrange the children in a straight line.
2. Count the number of ways that Susan is on the left of Tim.
3. Choose the answer that matches the number of ways you counted.

Advice:
- Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
- Always list out all possible options before selecting an answer.
- Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
- In combinatorics problems, consider all possible outcomes and count them carefully.
- Remember that the order of elements in a sequence matters.
