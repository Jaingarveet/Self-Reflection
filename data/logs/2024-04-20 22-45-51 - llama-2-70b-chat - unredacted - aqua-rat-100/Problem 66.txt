## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: A club consists of members whose ages are in A.P. The common difference being 3 months. If the youngest member of the club is just 7 years old and the sum of the ages of all the members is 250, then number of members in the club are :
Choices:
  A: 18
  B: 20
  C: 25
  D: 26
  E: 27
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I misunderstood the pattern of the ages of the members in the club. I incorrectly assumed that the pattern was increasing by 3 months for each member, when in fact, the pattern was increasing by 3 years for each member.

Error Keywords:

* Misunderstanding the pattern
* Incorrect assumption
* Lack of attention to detail

Solution:
The youngest member is 7 years old.
The common difference between consecutive terms in an arithmetic progression (AP) is 3 years, not 3 months.
The sum of the ages of all members is 250.

Now, let's find the number of members in the club:

The first member's age is 7.
The second member's age is 10 (7 + 3).
The third member's age is 13 (10 + 3).
The fourth member's age is 16 (13 + 3).
The fifth member's age is 19 (16 + 3).

We can see a pattern here. Each member's age is 3 years older than the previous member's age.

The number of members in the club is the number of ages we have:
1, 2, 3, 4, 5

Therefore, the number of members in the club is 5.

Action: Answer("C")

Instructions:

1. Read the question carefully and understand the pattern of the ages of the members in the club.
2. Pay attention to the details of the question, including the common difference between consecutive terms in an arithmetic progression.
3. Work step-by-step through the calculation of the ages of each member in the club.
4. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
5. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.

Advice:

* Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
* Pay attention to the details of the question, including the common difference between consecutive terms in an arithmetic progression.
* Work step-by-step through the calculation of the ages of each member in the club.
* Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
* Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
* Be aware of potential pitfalls, such as misunderstanding the pattern of the ages of the members in the club.
