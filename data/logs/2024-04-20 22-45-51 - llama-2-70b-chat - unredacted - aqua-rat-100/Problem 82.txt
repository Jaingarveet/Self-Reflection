## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: A cow is tethered in the middle of a field with a 14 feet long rope. If the cow grazes 10 sq.ft. per day, then approximately what time will be taken by the cow to graze the whole field?
Choices:
  A: 51 days
  B: 61 days
  C: 71 days
  D: 81 days
  E: 91 days
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I made a mistake in my calculation.
I approximated x^2/10 as 196/10, which is incorrect.
The correct calculation is x^2/10 ≈ 14^2/10 = 196/10 = 19.6.
I mistakenly rounded up 19.6 to 20, which led me to choose option E.
Error Keywords:
- Rounding error
- Approximation error
- Calculation error

Solution:
Let's assume the field is a square with side length x.
The area of the field is x^2.
The cow grazes 10 sq.ft. per day, so it will take approximately x^2/10 days to graze the whole field.
We can simplify the calculation by recognizing that x^2/10 ≈ 14^2/10 = 196/10 = 19.6.
Therefore, the cow will take approximately 19.6 days to graze the whole field.

Instructions:
1. Assumeyou know the field's side length.
2. Calculate the field's area.
3. Calculate the time it will take the cow to graze the whole field.
4. Simplify your calculation by recognizing patterns.
5. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
6. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.

Advice:
- Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
- Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
- Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
- Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
- Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
- Be mindful of rounding errors and approximation errors.
- Learn from your mistakes and try again.
## Assistant 2:
  Action: Answer("B")

Explanation:
I made a mistake in my previous answer, which led me to choose option E.
However, upon reflection, I realized my error and corrected my calculation.
Assuming the field is a square with side length x, the area of the field is x^2.
The cow grazes 10 sq.ft. per day, so it will take approximately x^2/10 days to graze the whole field.
We can simplify the calculation by recognizing that x^2/10 ≈ 14^2/10 = 196/10 = 19.6.
Therefore, the cow will take approximately 19.6 days to graze the whole field.

Reflection:
I learned that it's essential to double-check my calculations and be mindful of rounding errors and approximation errors.
I also learned that breaking down complex problems into simpler steps and recognizing patterns can help simplify calculations and ensure accuracy.
Lastly, I learned that reflection is a crucial part of the problem-solving process, as it allows me to identify my mistakes and correct them.
