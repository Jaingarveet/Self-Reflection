The second part of the axillary artery gives rise to the anterior and posterior circumflex humeral arteries, which supply the shoulder joint and the muscles around it. The subscapular artery and the circumflex scapular artery are branches of the third part of the axillary artery, which supply the scapula and the muscles attached to it. The deep branch of the transverse cervical artery and the suprascapular artery are branches of the thyrocervical trunk, which is a branch of the subclavian artery, and supply the muscles of the neck and the shoulder.
