## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: Consider there is an staircase elevator and you are coming down. If you walk 20 steps and stop, then you reach bottom in 10 minutes. If you walk 10 steps and stop, you reach to the ground in 20 minutes. What is the speed of the elevator?
Choices:
  A: 1 step/minute
  B: 2 step/minute
  C: 3 step/minute
  D: 4 step/minute
  E: None of the above
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Understand the problem: you are walking down steps while the elevator is moving.
2. Identify the number of steps you walk and the time it takes for the elevator to reach the bottom in each scenario.
3. Realize that the time it takes for the elevator to reach the bottom is the time it takes for the elevator to cover the remaining steps after you stop walking.
4. Understand that since this time does not change between scenarios, the speed of the elevator is constant.
5. Calculate the speed of the elevator by dividing the number of steps you walk by the time it takes for the elevator to reach the bottom.
6. Choose the answer that matches your calculated speed.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
In the first scenario, the elevator covers 20 steps in 10 minutes, so its speed is 20 steps/10 minutes = 2 steps/minute.
In the second scenario, the elevator covers 10 steps in 20 minutes, so its speed is 10 steps/20 minutes = 0.5 steps/minute.
These two speeds are not the same, which contradicts the assumption that the speed of the elevator is constant. Therefore, there seems to be a mistake in the problem statement or in my understanding of it. However, I have to choose an answer, so I will choose the one that matches one of the calculated speeds.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
