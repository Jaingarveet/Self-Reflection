Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Understand the question and what is being asked.
2. Identify the total cost of the gift and the initial number of men.
3. Calculate the initial contribution per man by dividing the total cost by the number of men.
4. Calculate the new contribution per man after 3 men drop out by dividing the total cost by the new number of men (M-3).
5. The new contribution per man is the answer.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The total cost of the gift is Rs. D and initially, M men agreed to purchase it. So, each man was supposed to contribute D/M. But, if 3 men drop out, the remaining men are M-3. So, each of the remaining men will have to contribute D/(M-3). The increase in the contribution per man due to the drop out of 3 men is D/(M-3) - D/M. 
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
