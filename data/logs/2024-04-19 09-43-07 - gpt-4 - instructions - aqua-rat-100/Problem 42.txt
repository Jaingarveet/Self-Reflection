Question: A straight picket fence is composed of x pickets each of which is 1/2 inch wide. If there are 6 inches of space between each pair of pickets, which of the following represents the length of fence in feet?
Choices:
  A: 13x/2
  B: 13x/2 - 6

Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Identify the width of each picket and the space between each pair of pickets.
2. Calculate the total length for each picket including the space.
3. Multiply this length by the number of pickets.
4. Subtract the space that is not present after the last picket.
5. Convert the total length from inches to feet by dividing by 12.
6. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
1. The width of each picket is 1/2 inch and the space between each pair of pickets is 6 inches.
2. The total length for each picket including the space is 1/2 inch + 6 inches = 6.5 inches.
3. The total length for x pickets including the space is 6.5x inches.
4. After the last picket, there is no space, so we subtract 6 inches from the total length, which gives us 6.5x - 6 inches.
5. To convert this length from inches to feet, we divide by 12, which gives us (6.5x - 6)/12 feet.
6. Simplifying this expression gives us (13x - 12)/24 feet.
