## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
1. The team won 20 matches and lost 30% of their matches. 
2. Let's denote the total number of matches as X. 
3. The team won 20 matches, so the rest of the matches (X - 20) were lost. 
4. According to the problem, the team lost 30% of their matches, so (X - 20) = 0.30X. 
5. Solving this equation for X gives X = 20 / (1 - 0.30) = 28.57, which we round up to 29 because the number of matches must be a whole number. 
6. The number of lost matches is X - 20 = 29 - 20 = 9. 
7. However, none of the answer choices match this result. It seems there might be a mistake in the problem or the answer choices. Let's try a different approach. 
8. If we assume that the 20 matches won are part of the 70% of matches not lost, then we can calculate the total number of matches as 20 / 0.70 = 28.57, which we round up to 29. 
9. Then the number of lost matches would be 30% of 29, which is 8.7, rounded to 9. 
10. Again, none of the answer choices match this result. 
11. Let's try one more approach. If we assume that the 20 matches won are part of the total matches, then the lost matches would be 30% of the total matches. 
12. In this case, the total number of matches would be 20 / (1 - 0.30) = 28.57, rounded up to 29. 
13. The number of lost matches would then be 30% of 29, which is 8.7, rounded to 9. 
14. Again, none of the answer choices match this result. 
15. It seems there is a mistake in the problem or the answer choices. 
Action: Answer("D")
