## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Let's denote the number of newspapers the hotel buys on Monday (and the rest of the weekdays) as x. The hotel buys 2x newspapers on Sunday. The total cost for the newspapers is $210. We can set up the equation as follows: 4*2x (cost for Sunday's newspapers) + 1*6x (cost for newspapers from Monday to Saturday) = $210.
Action: 
First, simplify the equation: 8x + 6x = $210.
Then, combine like terms: 14x = $210.
Finally, solve for x: x = $210 / 14 = 15.
Answer: Answer("A")
