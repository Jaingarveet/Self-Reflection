## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: X and Y are two alloys which were made by mixing zinc and copper in the ratio 6:9 and 7:11, respectively. If 40 grams of alloy X and 60 grams of alloy Y are melted and mixed to form alloy Z, what is the ratio of zinc and copper in the alloy Z ?
Choices:
  A: 69:91
  B: 59:91
  C: 59:90
  D: 59:91
  E: 69:101
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Identify the ratio of zinc and copper in each alloy.
2. Calculate the amount of zinc and copper in each alloy.
3. Add the amounts of zinc and copper from both alloys to get the amounts in the new alloy.
4. Find the ratio of zinc to copper in the new alloy by dividing both amounts by their greatest common divisor.
5. Round the amounts to the nearest whole number if necessary.
6. Choose the answer that matches your calculated ratio.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
In alloy X, the ratio of zinc to copper is 6:9. Since the total weight of alloy X is 40 grams, the weight of zinc in alloy X is (6/(6+9))*40 = 24 grams and the weight of copper in alloy X is (9/(6+9))*40 = 16 grams.
In alloy Y, the ratio of zinc to copper is 7:11. Since the total weight of alloy Y is 60 grams, the weight of zinc in alloy Y is (7/(7+11))*60 = 21 grams and the weight of copper in alloy Y is (11/(7+11))*60 = 39 grams.
In alloy Z, the total weight of zinc is 24 grams (from alloy X) + 21 grams (from alloy Y) = 45 grams and the total weight of copper is 16 grams (from alloy X) + 39 grams (from alloy Y) = 55 grams.
So, the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z is 45:55, which simplifies to 9:11.
None of the given options match this ratio, so there seems to be a mistake in the question or the options.
Action: Answer("A")
