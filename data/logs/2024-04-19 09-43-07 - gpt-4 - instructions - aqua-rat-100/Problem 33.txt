## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")

Question: A paper is in a square form whose one side is 20 cm. Two semi circles are drawn on its opposites as diameters. If these semi circles are cut down what is the area of the remaining paper?
Choices:
  A: 8.75
  B: 8.79
  C: 8.75
  D: 8.71
  E: 8.72
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Identify the shape and dimensions of the paper.
2. Calculate the area of the paper.
3. Identify the shape and dimensions of the cutouts.
4. Calculate the area of each cutout.
5. Multiply the area of one cutout by the number of cutouts to find the total area of the cutouts.
6. Subtract the total area of the cutouts from the area of the paper to find the remaining area.
7. If necessary, convert the remaining area to the units specified in the question.
8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
1. The paper is a square with sides of 20 cm.
2. The area of the paper is side^2 = 20^2 = 400 cm^2.
3. The cutouts are semi-circles with diameters of 20 cm, so the radius is 10 cm.
4. The area of a full circle is πr^2, so the area of a semi-circle is (πr^2)/2 = (π(10^2))/2 = 50π cm^2.
5. There are two cutouts, so the total area of the cutouts is 2*50π = 100π cm^2.
6. The remaining area of the paper is 400 - 100π = 400 - 314.16 = 85.84 cm^2.
7. The units are already in cm^2, so no conversion is necessary.
8. None of the choices match the calculated result. There seems to be a mistake in the question or the choices.
Action: 
Since the calculated result does not match any of the choices and I must select one of the available choices, I will choose the closest one.
