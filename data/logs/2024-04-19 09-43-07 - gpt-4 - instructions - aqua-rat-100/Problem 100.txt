Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Denote the breadth as x and the length as 4x + 1.
2. Set up the equation for the area of the rectangle: x * (4x + 1) = 150.
3. Solve this equation to find the values of x and 4x + 1.
4. Calculate the perimeter of the rectangle using the formula 2 * (length + breadth).
5. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
6. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
1. Let's denote the breadth as x. Then the length is 4x + 1.
2. The area of the rectangle is x * (4x + 1) = 150.
3. Solving this equation, we get x = 5 and 4x + 1 = 21.
4. The perimeter of the rectangle is 2 * (length + breadth) = 2 * (5 + 21) = 52 m.
5. Double-checking the calculations, everything seems correct.
Action: Answer("A")

Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: C
