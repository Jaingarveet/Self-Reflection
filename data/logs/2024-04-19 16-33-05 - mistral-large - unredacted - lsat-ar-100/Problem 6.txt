Context: For the school paper, five students—Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, Megregian, and O'Neill—each review one or more of exactly three plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation, but do not review any other plays. The following conditions must apply: Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
Question: Which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Jiang reviews more of the plays than Lopez does.
  B: Megregian reviews more of the plays than Jiang does.
  C: Megregian reviews more of the plays than O'Neill does.
  D: O'Neill reviews more of the plays than Jiang does.
  E: O'Neill reviews more of the plays than Kramer does.
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I made an incorrect assumption about the number of plays Jiang reviews.
The gap in my knowledge was not understanding that Jiang could review zero plays.
I assumed that Jiang must review at least one play, but the conditions do not specify this.
Error Keywords:
 - Incorrect assumption
 - Misinterpretation of conditions
 - Zero-play possibility
Solution:
From the given conditions, we can deduce that:

* Kramer and Lopez each review fewer plays than Megregian, so Megregian must review all three plays.
* Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews, so Jiang could review zero plays or one play that is not Tamerlane.
* Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, so they each review at least one play.
* Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other. Since Megregian reviews all three plays, this means that either Kramer or O'Neill must also review all three plays.

From these deductions, we can see that:

* Jiang could review zero plays, so A might not be true.
* Megregian reviews all three plays, so B must be true.
* O'Neill reviews at least one play, but we don't know if he reviews more than one, so we can't determine if C is true.
* We don't know how many plays O'Neill reviews, so we can't determine if D is true.
* Kramer reviews fewer plays than Megregian, so E must be true.

Instructions:
1. Read the question and conditions carefully.
2. Identify the relationships between the students and the plays they review.
3. Consider all possibilities, including zero-play scenarios.
4. Deduce the minimum and maximum number of plays each student could review.
5. Evaluate each answer choice based on your deductions.
6. Choose the answer that must be true based on the given conditions.
Advice:
 - Always read the question and conditions carefully.
 - Always consider all possibilities, including zero-play scenarios.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never make assumptions that are not supported by the given conditions.
 - Always double-check your deductions and final answer.
 - Remember that the correct answer must be true based on the given conditions.
