The six targets are set according to the following conditions: None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.

2. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
3. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
4. Solide's voicemail target is shorter than Truvest's website target.
From condition 4, we know that Solide's voicemail target is shorter than Truvest's website target.
Since none of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target, Solide's website target must also be shorter than Truvest's website target.
Therefore, Solide's website target must be 2 days.
