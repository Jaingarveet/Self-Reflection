Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Topic: Law
Context: A realtor will show a prospective buyer seven houses—J, K, L, M, N, 0, and P—during a single day. The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning; the third, fourth, and fifth houses to be shown will be shown in the afternoon; the sixth and seventh houses to be shown will be shown in the evening. The houses will be shown according to the following rules: J must be shown in the evening. K cannot be shown in the morning. L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
Question: Which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: K is shown at some time after J is shown.
  B: L is shown at some time after J is shown.
  C: P is shown at some time after J is shown.
  D: Both N and O are shown at some time after M is
  E: Both N and P are shown at some time after K is
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I made an incorrect assumption about the order in which the houses could be shown.
The gap in my knowledge was not in the law but in logical reasoning.
I misunderstood the constraints on when each house could be shown.
Error Keywords:
 - Incorrect assumption
 - Logical reasoning error
 - Misunderstanding of constraints
Solution:
The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning, but J must be shown in the evening, so J cannot be the first or second house.
K cannot be shown in the morning, so K cannot be the first or second house either.
L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown, so L cannot be the first house.
Therefore, the first two houses must be chosen from L, M, N, O, and P.
Since J must be shown in the evening, it must be either the sixth or seventh house.
If J is the sixth house, then K, L, M, N, and O must be shown before it, but this is not possible since L must be shown after K and before M.
Therefore, J must be the seventh house, and K, L, M, N, O, and P must be shown before it.
Since L must be shown after K and before M, K cannot be the last house shown before J, so it must be one of the first five houses.
Therefore, K could not be shown at some time after J is shown.
P could be shown at some time after J is shown if it is the sixth house shown.
Instructions:
1. Identify the constraints on when each house can be shown.
2. Determine which houses cannot be shown in the morning.
3. Determine which houses cannot be shown in the evening.
4. Determine which houses must be shown before or after other houses.
5. Determine which houses can be shown in each time slot.
6. Work step-by-step through your logical reasoning.
7. Double-check your reasoning to ensure accuracy.
8. Choose the answer that matches your logical reasoning.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your reasoning and final answer.
 - Remember that logical reasoning is a critical skill in law.
 - Practice logical reasoning exercises to improve your skills.
 - Seek feedback from others to identify and correct errors in your reasoning.
