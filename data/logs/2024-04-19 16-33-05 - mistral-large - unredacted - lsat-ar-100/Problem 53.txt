## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning, so J cannot be shown in the morning, and K cannot be shown in the morning. Therefore, the first two houses must be L and M, in that order, since L must be shown after K and before M.
The third, fourth, and fifth houses to be shown will be shown in the afternoon. Since K cannot be shown in the morning, it must be shown in the afternoon. Therefore, K must be one of the houses shown in the afternoon.
The sixth and seventh houses to be shown will be shown in the evening. Since J must be shown in the evening, it must be one of the houses shown in the evening.
Therefore, the order of the houses shown must be L, M, K, [REDACTED], [REDACTED], J, [REDACTED].
Action: Answer("B")

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly because I did not consider the rule that L must be shown after K and before M. I also did not consider the rule that J must be shown in the evening. I have now considered these rules and have determined that the correct answer is "B: L is shown in the afternoon."
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
