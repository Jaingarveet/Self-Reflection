Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.

Topic: Law
Context: A loading dock consists of exactly six bays numbered 1 through 6 consecutively from one side of the dock to the other. Each bay is holding a different one of exactly six types of cargoâ€”fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles. The following apply: The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock. The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles. The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel. The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
Question: If bay 4 is holding produce, then for exactly how many of the six bays is the type of cargo that bay is holding completely determined?
Choices:
  A: two
  B: three
  C: four
  D: five
  E: six
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I made an incorrect assumption about the number of bays with determined cargo.
The gap in my knowledge was not in the law but in logical reasoning.
I knew the correct relationships between the cargo types but made an incorrect assumption about the number of bays with determined cargo.
Error Keywords:
 - Incorrect assumption
 - Logical reasoning error
 - Overlooking information
Solution:
The bay holding produce is bay 4.
The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce, so it must be either bay 3 or bay 5.
If the bay holding textiles is bay 3, then the bay holding livestock must be bay 2, and the bay holding grain must be either bay 5 or bay 6.
If the bay holding textiles is bay 5, then the bay holding livestock must be bay 3, and the bay holding grain must be either bay 1 or bay 2.
In either case, the bay holding fuel must be either bay 1 or bay 6.
Therefore, the type of cargo that bay 4 is holding (produce) is completely determined, the type of cargo that either bay 3 or bay 5 is holding (textiles) is also completely determined, and the type of cargo that either bay 2 or bay 3 is holding (livestock) is also completely determined.
Instructions:
1. Identify the bay holding produce.
2. Identify the possible locations of the bay holding textiles.
3. Identify the possible locations of the bay holding livestock based on the location of the bay holding textiles.
4. Identify the possible locations of the bay holding grain based on the location of the bay holding livestock.
5. Identify the possible locations of the bay holding fuel based on the location of the bay holding produce.
6. Determine the number of bays with completely determined cargo.
7. Work step-by-step through your logical reasoning.
8. Double-check your reasoning and final answer.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never make assumptions; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your reasoning and final answer.
 - Remember that logical reasoning is essential in solving complex problems.
