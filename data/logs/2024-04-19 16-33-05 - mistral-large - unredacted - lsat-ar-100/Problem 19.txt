## User 2:
Topic: Law
Context: Of the eight students—George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert—in a seminar, exactly six will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
Question: If Helen, Kyle, and Lenore, not necessarily in that order, give the three morning reports, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Helen gives a report on Monday.
  B: Irving gives a report on Monday.
  C: Irving gives a report on Wednesday.
  D: Kyle gives a report on Tuesday.
  E: Kyle gives a report on Wednesday.
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I made an incorrect assumption about the order of the reports.
I assumed that since Helen, Kyle, and Lenore give the morning reports, they cannot give an afternoon report. However, the question does not specify that each student can only give one report.
I also made an incorrect assumption about the order of the reports based on Nina's report. I assumed that since Nina gives an afternoon report, she cannot give a report on Wednesday. However, the question states that Nina cannot give an afternoon report on Wednesday, not that she cannot give a report at all on Wednesday.
The gap in my knowledge was not in law but in reading comprehension and logical reasoning.
I did not carefully read and interpret the conditions of the problem.
I made assumptions that were not supported by the information given.
I did not consider all possible scenarios.
Error Keywords:
 - Incorrect assumption
 - Reading comprehension error
 - Logical reasoning error
 - Misinterpretation of conditions
Solution:
Since Helen, Kyle, and Lenore give the morning reports, they cannot give an afternoon report on the same day.
Since George can only give a report on Tuesday, he must give the afternoon report on Tuesday.
Since Olivia and Robert cannot give an afternoon report, Nina must give the other afternoon report.
Since Nina gives an afternoon report, she cannot give a report on Wednesday afternoon. Therefore, she must give her report on Monday or Tuesday afternoon.
If Nina gives her report on Monday afternoon, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Tuesday. However, this is not possible since George must give a report on Tuesday afternoon. Therefore, Nina must give her report on Tuesday afternoon.
Since Nina gives a report on Tuesday afternoon, Helen and Irving must both give reports on Wednesday.
Since Helen gives a morning report, she must give her report on Wednesday morning.
Since Irving must give a report on Wednesday and cannot give an afternoon report, he must give the morning report on Wednesday.
Since Kyle gives a morning report and cannot give a report on Tuesday (since both morning and afternoon reports are taken), he must give a report on Monday or Wednesday.
Since Lenore gives a morning report and cannot give a report on Tuesday (since both morning and afternoon reports are taken), she must give a report on Monday or Wednesday.
Since Helen gives a report on Wednesday morning, neither Kyle nor Lenore can give a report on Wednesday morning. Therefore, they must both give reports on Monday morning.
Since George gives a report on Tuesday afternoon, neither Kyle nor Lenore can give a report on Tuesday morning. Therefore, they must both give reports on Monday morning.
Since Helen, Kyle, and Lenore give the morning reports, they cannot give an afternoon report on the same day. Therefore, Irving must give the afternoon report on Monday.
Action: Answer("B")
