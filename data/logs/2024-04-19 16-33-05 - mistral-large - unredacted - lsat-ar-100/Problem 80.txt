Topic: Law
Context: An administrator must assign parking spaces to six new employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young. Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
Question: Which one of the following could be the assignment of parking spaces to the new employees?
Choices:
  A: #1: Young; #2: Souza; #3: Vaughn; #4: Robertson; #5: Togowa; #6: Xu
  B: #1: Vaughn; #2: Togowa; #3: Young; #4: Souza; #5: Robertson; #6: Xu
  C: #1: Togowa; #2: Young; #3: Xu; #4: Robertson; #5: Souza; #6: Vaughn
  D: #1: Togowa; #2: Robertson; #3: Young; #4: Souza; #5: Vaughn; #6: Xu
  E: #1: Souza; #2: Togowa; #3: Young; #4: Robertson; #5: Xu; #6: Vaughn
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I made an error in my evaluation of the options.
I incorrectly stated that Xu is assigned a lower-numbered parking space than Souza in option E, but in fact, Xu is assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza in option E.
The gap in my knowledge was not in the law but in my evaluation of the options.
I knew the correct rules but made an evaluation error.

Error Keywords:
 - Evaluation error
 - Option analysis error
 - Rule violation error

Solution:
Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.

Option A: Young is assigned a lower-numbered parking space than Togowa, which violates the first rule.
Option B: Robertson is assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young, but Robertson's parking space is not #1, #2, #3, or #4, which violates the fourth rule.
Option C: Robertson is assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young, but Xu is assigned a lower-numbered parking space than Souza, which violates the second rule.
Option D: Robertson is assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young, and all other rules are satisfied.
Option E: Robertson is assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young, and Xu is assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, and all other rules are satisfied.

Instructions:
1. Identify the rules that govern the assignment of parking spaces.
2. Evaluate each option against the rules.
3. Eliminate any options that violate the rules.
4. Choose the option that satisfies all the rules.
5. Work step-by-step through your evaluation of each option.
6. Double-check your evaluation of each option to ensure accuracy.
7. Choose the answer that matches your evaluated option.

Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your evaluation of each option and final answer.
 - Remember that the rules must be satisfied for all options, not just some.
 - Be careful not to make assumptions about the options; evaluate each option based on the rules.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The rules governing the assignment of parking spaces are:
1. Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
2. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
3. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
4. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.

I will evaluate each option against these rules.

Option A: Young is assigned a lower-numbered parking space than Togowa, which violates the first rule.
Option B: Robertson is assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young, but Robertson's parking space is not #1, #2, #3, or #4, which violates the fourth rule.
Option C: Robertson is assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young, but Xu is assigned a lower-numbered parking space than Souza, which violates the second rule.
Option D: Robertson is assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young, and all other rules are satisfied.
Option E: Robertson is assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young, and Xu is assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, and all other rules are satisfied.
