## User 2:
Topic: Law
Context: A software company employs exactly seven sales representatives—Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall—to work in its three sales zones—Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3. Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Question: If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Kim works in Zone 2.
  B: Mahr works in Zone 1.
  C: Parra works in Zone 3.
  D: Stuckey works in Zone 2.
  E: Tiao works in Zone 1.
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I made an incorrect assumption about the distribution of sales representatives in the zones.
The gap in my knowledge was not in the law but in logical reasoning.
I incorrectly assumed that Zone 3 must have at least 3 sales representatives, but it could have more.
I also incorrectly assumed that Parra and Quinn must work in Zone 3 with Mahr, Stuckey, and Udall, but they could work in Zone 1.
Error Keywords:
 - Incorrect assumption
 - Logical reasoning error
 - Distribution error
Solution:
Since Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, and Stuckey works in the same sales zone as Udall, Mahr, Stuckey, and Udall must all work in the same sales zone.
Since either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2, Udall cannot work in Zone 2, so Mahr, Stuckey, and Udall must all work in either Zone 1 or Zone 3.
Since there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, Zone 3 must have at least 2 sales representatives, and Zone 2 must have at most 2 sales representatives.
Since either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, and Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other, Parra and Quinn must both work in either Zone 1 or Zone 3.
If Parra and Quinn work in Zone 1, then Tiao must work in Zone 2, and Mahr, Stuckey, and Udall must all work in Zone 3.
If Parra and Quinn work in Zone 3, then Tiao must work in Zone 1, and Mahr, Stuckey, and Udall must all work in Zone 1.
Therefore, Kim could work in Zone 2.
Instructions:
1. Identify the sales representatives who work in the same sales zone as each other.
2. Identify the sales representatives who cannot work in the same sales zone as each other.
3. Identify the minimum and maximum number of sales representatives who can work in each sales zone.
4. Consider all possible distributions of sales representatives in the sales zones.
5. Eliminate the distributions that violate the given conditions.
6. Choose the answer that corresponds to a possible distribution.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never make assumptions that are not supported by the given information.
 - Always consider all possible distributions of elements in the problem.
 - Always double-check your reasoning and final answer.
 - Remember that logical reasoning is a critical skill in law and many other fields.

Since there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, Zone 3 must have at least 2 sales representatives, and Zone 2 must have at most 2 sales representatives.
Since either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, and Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other, Parra and Quinn must both work in either Zone 1 or Zone 3.
If Parra and Quinn work in Zone 1, then Tiao must work in Zone 2, and Mahr, Stuckey, and Udall must all work in Zone 3.
If Parra and Quinn work in Zone 3, then Tiao must work in Zone 1, and Mahr, Stuckey, and Udall must all work in Zone 1.
Therefore, Kim could work in Zone 2.
