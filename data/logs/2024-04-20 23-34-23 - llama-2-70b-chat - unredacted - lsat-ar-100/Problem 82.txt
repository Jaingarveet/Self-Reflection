Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.

Explanation:
I apologize for the mistake in my previous response. After re-evaluating the question and the choices, I realized that the correct answer is indeed B.

Here's why:

1. Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
2. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
3. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
4. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
5. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

Choice B satisfies all the conditions:

* Zone 1: Kim, Tiao (satisfies condition 1)
* Zone 2: Stuckey, Udall (satisfies condition 2)
* Zone 3: Mahr, Parra, Quinn (satisfies condition 3)

Therefore, the correct answer is B.

I apologize for any confusion caused by my previous response, and I hope this answer is helpful.
## Assistant 2:
  I'm sorry, but as an AI language model, I don't have the ability to access the previous answer or any other information that might be marked as [REDACTED]. I can, however, offer a solution to the issue based on the given information.

The question asks which of the following could be an accurate matching of the sales representatives to the sales zones in which they work, given the conditions stated. Let's analyze each choice:

A: Zone 1: Kim, Parra Zone 2: Stuckey, Udall Zone 3: Mahr, Quinn, Tiao
This option violates condition 1 because Parra and Tiao are both assigned to Zone 1.

B: Zone 1: Kim, Tiao Zone 2: Stuckey, Udall Zone 3: Mahr, Parra, Quinn
This option satisfies all the conditions:
* Zone 1: Kim, Tiao (satisfies condition 1)
* Zone 2: Stuckey, Udall (satisfies condition 2)
* Zone 3: Mahr, Parra, Quinn (satisfies condition 3)

C: Zone 1: Parra, Quinn Zone 2: Kim, Udall Zone 3: Mahr, Stuckey, Tiao
This option violates condition 1 because Parra and Quinn are both assigned to Zone 1.

D: Zone 1: Stuckey, Udall Zone 2: Kim, Tiao Zone 3: Mahr, Parra, Quinn
This option violates condition 2 because Tiao and Udall are both assigned to Zone 2.

E: Zone 1: Tiao Zone 2: Kim, Parra, Quinn Zone 3: Stuckey, Udall
This option violates condition 2 because Parra and Quinn are both assigned to Zone 2.

Therefore, the correct answer is B.

I hope this explanation helps clarify the solution to the problem.
