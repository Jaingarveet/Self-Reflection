## System:
You are an expert in Law.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")

Topic: Law
Context: A panel of five scientists will be formed. The panelists will be selected from among three botanists—F, G, and H—three chemists—K, L, and M—and three zoologists—P, Q, and R. Selection is governed by the following conditions: The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types. If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. F and K cannot both be selected. K and M cannot both be selected. If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
Question: If P is the only zoologist selected, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: If K is selected, G cannot be selected.
  B: If L is selected, F cannot be selected.
  C: If exactly one chemist is selected, it must be K.
  D: If exactly two chemists are selected, F cannot be selected.
  E: If exactly two chemists are selected, G cannot be selected.
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I misunderstood the conditions of the problem. I thought that if exactly one chemist was selected, it must be K, but that is not necessarily true.

Error Keywords:

* Misunderstanding of conditions
* Incorrect application of logic

Solution:
Let's analyze the problem again, taking into account the correct conditions:

1. If F is selected as the botanist, then K cannot be selected as the chemist since K and M cannot both be selected. In this case, L must be selected as the chemist. This combination satisfies all conditions.
2. If G is selected as the botanist, then K can be selected as the chemist. This combination also satisfies all conditions.
3. If H is selected as the botanist, then L must be selected as the chemist. In this case, M must be selected as the third scientist, and P must be selected as the zoologist. This combination satisfies all conditions.

Therefore, the correct answer is D: If exactly two chemists are selected, F cannot be selected.

Instructions:

1. Read the problem carefully and understand the conditions.
2. Decompose the problem into possible combinations.
3. Analyze each combination and eliminate those that violate the conditions.
4. Select the remaining combination that satisfies all conditions.
5. Answer the question based on the selected combination.

Advice:

* Always read the problem carefully and understand the conditions.
* Decompose the problem into possible combinations.
* Analyze each combination and eliminate those that violate the conditions.
* Select the remaining combination that satisfies all conditions.
* Answer the question based on the selected combination.
* Double-check your work to ensure that your answer satisfies all conditions.
