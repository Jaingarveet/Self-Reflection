Topic: Law
Context: An editor will edit seven articles, one at a time. Three of the articles—G, H, and J—cover finance; three other articles—Q, R, and S—cover nutrition; and the remaining article, Y, covers wildlife. The order in which the articles are edited is subject to the following conditions: Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other. S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third. S must be earlier than Y. J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
Question: In the order in which the articles are edited, S could be in any of the following positions EXCEPT:
Choices:
  A: first
  B: third
  C: fourth
  D: fifth
  E: sixth

Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I made a mistake in my diagram and article placement. I misunderstood the condition that S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third, and placed Q in the wrong position.

Error Keywords:

* Diagram error
* Placement error
* Misinterpretation of conditions

Solution:
Let's revisit the question and diagram:

G - H - J
Q - R - S
Y

We know that consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other, so we can start by placing the finance articles together:

G - H - J

We also know that S must be earlier than Y, so we can place Y in the last position:

G - H - J
Q - R - S
Y

Now, we need to determine where S can be placed. We know that S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third. Therefore, we can place Q in the third position:

G - H - J
Q
R - S
Y

However, this order violates the condition that J must be earlier than G. Therefore, we must reverse the order of the finance articles:

H - G - J
Q
R - S
Y

Now, we can place S in the fourth position:

H - G - J
Q
R
S
Y

Therefore, the correct answer is:

D: fifth

Instructions:

1. Read the question carefully and understand the conditions.
2. Create a diagram to help visualize the conditions.
3. Place the articles in the correct order based on the conditions.
4. Double-check the order to ensure it meets all the conditions.
5. Choose the answer that matches the correct order.

Advice:

* Always read the question carefully and understand the conditions.
* Use a diagram to help visualize the conditions and article placement.
* Double-check your work to ensure it meets all the conditions.
* Consider all possible options before choosing an answer.
* Practice solving similar types of questions to improve your skills.
