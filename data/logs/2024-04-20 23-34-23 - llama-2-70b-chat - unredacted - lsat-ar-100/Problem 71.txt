Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I misunderstood the conditions provided. I thought that Parra and Quinn worked together in a sales zone, and Stuckey and Udall worked together in a sales zone, which led me to choose option E. However, upon re-reading the conditions, I realized that Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other, and Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other, but not necessarily together.

Error Keywords:

* Misunderstanding of conditions
* Incorrect application of information

Solution:
I should have carefully read and analyzed the conditions provided to determine the correct answer. Based on the conditions, we know that Parra and Tiao work in the same sales zone, and Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone. We also know that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

Given these conditions, the only possible combination of sales representatives working in Zone 3 is Kim and Mahr, which is option A.

Instructions:

1. Carefully read and analyze the conditions provided.
2. Identify the relationships between the sales representatives and their work zones.
3. Determine the possible combinations of sales representatives working in each zone.
4. Choose the option that matches the determined combinations.

Advice:

* Always read and analyze the conditions carefully to avoid misunderstandings.
* Take your time to think through each step of the problem-solving process.
* Double-check your work to ensure accuracy.
* Consider all possible combinations of options before making a final decision.
