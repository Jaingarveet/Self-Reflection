Context: A bakery makes exactly three kinds of cookieâ€”oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar. Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day. The following conditions apply: No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
Question: If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Exactly three batches of cookies are made on Tuesday.
  B: Exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday.
  C: At least two batches of cookies are made on Monday.
  D: At least two batches of cookies are made on Thursday.
  E: Fewer batches of cookies are made on Monday than on Tuesday.
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I misunderstood the conditions given in the problem. I thought that the second batch of oatmeal cookies had to be made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies, and the second batch of sugar cookies had to be made on Thursday. However, the problem only states that the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies, and the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, but it does not specify that these batches have to be made on consecutive days.

Error Keywords:

* Misunderstanding of conditions
* Lack of attention to detail
* Incorrect inference

Solution:
We know that no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, so we can infer that the three batches of cookies made on Monday, Thursday, and Friday will be different kinds of cookies.

We also know that the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies, and the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday. Therefore, we can create the following possible schedules:

Schedule 1:

* Monday: Batch 1 of oatmeal cookies, Batch 1 of peanut butter cookies
* Tuesday: Batch 2 of oatmeal cookies, Batch 1 of sugar cookies
* Thursday: Batch 2 of sugar cookies, Batch 1 of peanut butter cookies
* Friday: Batch 3 of oatmeal cookies, Batch 3 of sugar cookies

Schedule 2:

* Monday: Batch 1 of oatmeal cookies, Batch 1 of sugar cookies
* Tuesday: Batch 2 of oatmeal cookies, Batch 1 of peanut butter cookies
* Thursday: Batch 2 of sugar cookies, Batch 1 of peanut butter cookies
* Friday: Batch 3 of oatmeal cookies, Batch 3 of sugar cookies

In both schedules, exactly three batches of cookies are made on Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday, and at least two batches of cookies are made on Monday and Thursday. Therefore, the correct answer is D: At least two batches of cookies are made on Thursday.

Instructions:

1. Read the problem carefully and understand the conditions given.
2. Create a possible schedule that satisfies the conditions given in the problem.
3. Check if the schedule satisfies all the conditions given in the problem.
4. If the schedule does not satisfy all the conditions, create another possible schedule and check if it satisfies all the conditions.
5. Choose the answer that is consistent with the schedule(s) you created.

Advice:

* Always read the problem carefully and understand the conditions given.
* Pay attention to detail and do not make assumptions that are not supported by the conditions given.
* Create possible schedules that satisfy the conditions given and check if they are consistent with the answer choices.
* If you are unsure of the answer, create multiple schedules and check if they all lead to the same answer.
