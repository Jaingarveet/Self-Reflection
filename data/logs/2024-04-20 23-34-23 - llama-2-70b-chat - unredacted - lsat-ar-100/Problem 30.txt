Context: During a recital, two pianists—Wayne and Zara—will perform solos. There will be five solos altogether, performed one immediately after another. Each solo will be either a modern piece or a traditional piece. The choice of pianist and type of piece for the solos must conform to the following conditions: The third solo is a traditional piece. Exactly two of the traditional pieces are performed consecutively. In the fourth solo, either Wayne performs a traditional piece or Zara performs a modern piece. The pianist who performs the second solo does not perform the fifth solo. No traditional piece is performed until Wayne performs at least one modem piece.
Question: If the pianist who performs the first solo also performs the second solo, then which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Zara performs the first solo.
  B: Wayne performs the third solo.
  C: Zara performs the fifth solo.

Action: Answer("C")

Explanation:
I apologize for the mistake in my previous response. Here's the corrected explanation:

If the pianist who performs the first solo also performs the second solo, we can deduce the following:

1. The first and second solos are performed by the same pianist.
2. Since the third solo is a traditional piece, and no traditional piece is performed until Wayne performs at least one modern piece, Wayne must perform a modern piece before the third solo.
3. Therefore, the second solo must be a modern piece.
4. Since exactly two traditional pieces are performed consecutively, the fourth solo must be a traditional piece.
5. The pianist who performs the second solo does not perform the fifth solo, so Zara must perform the fifth solo.

Thus, the answer is "C" - Zara performs the fifth solo.
