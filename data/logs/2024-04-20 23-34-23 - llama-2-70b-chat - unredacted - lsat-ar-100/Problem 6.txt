Action: Answer("B")

Explanation:

The question asks which of the following must be true based on the given conditions. Let's analyze the conditions:

1. Kramer and Lopez each review fewer plays than Megregian.
2. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
3. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
4. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.

From condition 1, we can conclude that Megregian reviews more plays than Kramer and Lopez.
From condition 2, we know that Jiang reviews a play that neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews.
From condition 3, we know that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
From condition 4, we know that exactly two students review the same play or plays as each other.

Now, let's consider each choice:

A: Jiang reviews more of the plays than Lopez does.
This is false. We know that Megregian reviews more plays than Lopez, and Jiang may review the same number of plays as Lopez or fewer plays than Megregian.

B: Megregian reviews more of the plays than Jiang does.
This is true. We know that Megregian reviews more plays than Kramer and Lopez, and Jiang may review fewer plays than Megregian.

C: Megregian reviews more of the plays than O'Neill does.
This is false. We know that O'Neill reviews Tamerlane, and Megregian may review fewer plays than O'Neill.

D: O'Neill reviews more of the plays than Jiang does.
This is false. We know that Jiang may review the same number of plays as O'Neill or fewer plays than Megregian.

E: O'Neill reviews more of the plays than Kramer does.
This is false. We know that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, so they review the same number of plays.

Therefore, the answer is "B: Megregian reviews more of the plays than Jiang does."

Action: Answer("B")
