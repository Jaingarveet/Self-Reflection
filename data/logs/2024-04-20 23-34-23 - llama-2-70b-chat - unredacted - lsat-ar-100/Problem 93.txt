Explanation:
I apologize for the mistake in my previous response. I misunderstood the format required for the answer. Thank you for pointing it out.

To answer the question, we can start by analyzing the conditions given in the problem:

1. None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
2. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
