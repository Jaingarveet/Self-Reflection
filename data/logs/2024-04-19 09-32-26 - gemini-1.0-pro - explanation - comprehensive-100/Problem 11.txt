## Assistant 2:
## Self-Reflection on Previous Incorrect Answer:
**My previous answer:** C
**Reasoning:** I incorrectly assumed that the chairman's opinion was the most doubtful because it was a subjective statement.
**Correct answer:** D
**Reasoning:** The statement "The skyrocketing housing prices are because supply has not kept up with demand" is a common explanation for rising housing prices, but it is not necessarily true in this specific context. The passage states that land prices are the chief culprit in soaring housing prices, and the provided data supports this claim. Therefore, the chairman's statement is the most doubtful.
**Lessons learned:**
* Do not rely solely on subjective opinions when evaluating the truthfulness of a statement.
* Carefully consider the context and supporting evidence when making a judgment.
* Be aware of common explanations that may not be accurate in all situations.
## Applying the lessons learned to the current question:
**Analysis of choices:**
* **A:** This statement supports the claim that land prices are the main driver of rising housing prices.
* **B:** This statement also supports the claim that land prices are the main driver of rising housing prices.
* **C:** This statement is a subjective opinion and does not provide any evidence to support or refute the claim.
* **D:** This statement is a common explanation for rising housing prices, but it is not necessarily true in this specific context. The passage states that land prices are the chief culprit, and the provided data supports this claim.
**Conclusion:**
Based on the analysis, the most doubtful statement is D.
**Action:** Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
