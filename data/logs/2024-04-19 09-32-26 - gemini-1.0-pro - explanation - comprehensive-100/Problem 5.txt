Explanation:
I made a mistake in the calculation of the sum of the ages of the members. I used the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series, but I did not take into account the fact that the youngest member is 7 years old.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Let the number of members in the club be n.
The sum of the ages of all the members is 250.
The youngest member is 7 years old.
The common difference is 3 months.
The sum of the ages of all the members is an arithmetic series.
The sum of an arithmetic series is equal to the average of the first and last term, multiplied by the number of terms.
The average of the first and last term is equal to the sum of the first term and the last term, divided by 2.
The first term is 7 years old.
The last term is equal to the first term plus the common difference multiplied by the number of terms minus 1.
The last term is equal to 7 + 3(n-1) = 3n + 4.
The sum of the ages of all the members is equal to (7 + 3n + 4)/2 * n = 250.
Simplifying the equation, we get 3n^2 + 11n - 500 = 0.
Factoring the equation, we get (3n-20)(n+25) = 0.
The possible values of n are 20 and -25.
Since the number of members cannot be negative, the number of members in the club is 20.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
