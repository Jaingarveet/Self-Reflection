Self-reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly because I did not carefully consider all of the requirements. I have learned that it is important to pay close attention to all of the details of a problem in order to arrive at the correct solution.
I will now use my self-reflection to help me answer the question correctly.
Thought:
Let's analyze each choice:
A: No Russian novels and exactly one play are selected. This is possible because we can select 3 French novels, 2 French plays, and 1 Russian play.
B: Exactly one Russian novel and both French plays are selected. This is not possible because if both French plays are selected, then the Russian play cannot be selected according to the requirements.
C: Exactly two French novels and the Russian play are selected. This is possible because we can select 2 French novels, 1 French play, 1 Russian novel, and the Russian play.
D: Exactly two French novels and exactly two plays are selected. This is possible because we can select 2 French novels, 2 French plays, and 1 Russian novel.
E: Exactly two Russian novels and exactly one play are selected. This is not possible because we must select at least as many French novels as Russian novels.
