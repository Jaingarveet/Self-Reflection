Question: In 2015 the populations of City $\mathrm{X}$ and City $\mathrm{Y}$ were equal. From 2010 to 2015, the population of City X increased by $20 \%$ and the population of City $\mathrm{Y}$ decreased by $10 \%$. If the population of City $\mathrm{X}$ was 120,000 in 2010, what was the population of City Y in 2010 ?
Choices:
  A: 60,000
  B: 90,000

Explanation:
I made a mistake in setting up the equation that represents the equality of the populations in 2015. I incorrectly assumed that the population of City X in 2015 was 1.2 times the population of City Y in 2010, when it should have been 1.2 times the population of City X in 2010.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let $x$ be the population of City X in 2010 and $y$ be the population of City Y in 2010.
We know that $x = 120,000$ and that the population of City X increased by $20\%$ from 2010 to 2015, so the population of City X in 2015 is $1.2x$.
We also know that the population of City Y decreased by $10\%$ from 2010 to 2015, so the population of City Y in 2015 is $0.9y$.
Since the populations of City X and City Y were equal in 2015, we have the equation $1.2x = 0.9y$.
Substituting $x = 120,000$ into this equation, we get $1.2(120,000) = 0.9y$, which simplifies to $144,000 = 0.9y$.
Solving for $y$, we get $y = 144,000 / 0.9 = 160,000$.
Action: Answer("C")
