Explanation:
## Assistant 2:
I apologize for the previous incorrect answer. I have reviewed the question and my thought process and have identified the error. I incorrectly assumed that the question was asking about the inheritance pattern of Hypophosphatemic Vitamin D Resistant Rickets, when in fact it was asking about the type of rickets. 
Here is my corrected thought process:
* Hypophosphatemic Vitamin D Resistant Rickets is a type of rickets.
* Rickets is a bone disease that is caused by a deficiency of vitamin D or calcium.
* There are two main types of rickets: vitamin D-dependent rickets and vitamin D-resistant rickets.
* Hypophosphatemic Vitamin D Resistant Rickets is a type of vitamin D-resistant rickets.
* Vitamin D-resistant rickets is caused by a defect in the renal phosphate transport system.
Therefore, the correct answer to the question is:
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
