D: the squeezing of food through the intestines

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I reflected on my solution and the correct answer. I realized that I misunderstood the question and selected the wrong option.

To answer this question correctly, I will choose option C: the breakdown of food substances by digestive juices. This indicates a physical change that occurs during the process of digestion, as digestive juices such as enzymes and acids break down food substances into smaller molecules that can be absorbed by the body.
