## Assistant 2:
  Thought: I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I need to reassess the problem.

To find the monthly sales required for the shop assistant to earn a monthly salary of $1500, we need to use the given information:

Salary = fixed salary + percentage of sales

Let's first calculate the fixed salary:

Fixed salary = $500 (given)

Now, let's calculate the percentage of sales:

Percentage of sales = 5% (given)

Monthly sales = fixed salary + percentage of sales

Monthly sales = $500 + (5% of $X)

Where $X is the unknown monthly sales required to reach a monthly salary of $1500.

We can solve for $X by rearranging the equation:

$X = $1500 - $500 - (5% of $X)

$X = $1000

So, the monthly sales required to reach a monthly salary of $1500 are $1000.

Action: Answer("C")
