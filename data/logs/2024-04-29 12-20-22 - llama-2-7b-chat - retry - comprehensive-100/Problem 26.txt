Question: If the shoe store is in space 2, which one of the following could be true?

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly. Upon reviewing my solution and the correct answer, I realized that I made a mistake in my reasoning.

To solve this problem, we need to use the constraints provided:

1. The pharmacy must be at one end of the row, and one of the restaurants must be at the other.
2. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
3. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
4. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.

From these constraints, we can deduce the possible locations of the businesses in the shopping center:

1. The pharmacy must be in spaces 1 or 7.
2. One of the restaurants must be in space 3.
3. The optometrist must be in space 5.
4. The veterinarian must be in space 4.
5. The toy store must be in space 6.

Therefore, the correct answer is (E) The veterinarian is in space 4.
