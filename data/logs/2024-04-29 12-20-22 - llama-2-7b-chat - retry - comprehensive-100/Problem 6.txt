## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

## Assistant 2:
  Thought: I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I am now reflecting on my solution and the correct answer.

Action: I will use my self-reflection to help me answer the question.

The length of line segment RU can be found by using the midpoint formula:

Length of RU = (distance from R to U) + (distance from U to T)

Since U is the midpoint of line segment ST, the distance from R to U is half the distance from R to T:

Distance from R to U = (5/2) = 2.5

And the distance from U to T is the same as the length of line segment ST:

Distance from U to T = 22

Therefore, the length of line segment RU is:

Length of RU = 2.5 + 22 = 24.5

Answer: B: 7
