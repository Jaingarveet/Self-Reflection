Question: A club consists of members whose ages are in A.P. The common difference being 3 months. If the youngest member of the club is just 7 years old and the sum of the ages of all the members is 250, then number of members in the club are :
Choices:
  A: 18
  B: 20
  C: 25
  D: 26
  E: 27

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand the mistake. The correct solution is as follows:

Let the age of the youngest member be x.
The sum of the ages of all the members is given as 250.
So, the age of the oldest member is 250 - x.

Since the ages are in A.P., the difference between the ages of any two members is 3 months.
So, the age of the next member after the youngest member is x + 3 months.

The age of the oldest member is 250 - x, and the age of the next member after the oldest member is x + 3 months.

The sum of the ages of all the members is 250, so we can set up the equation:
x + (x + 3 months) = 250

Simplifying the equation, we get:
2x + 3 months = 250

Subtracting 3 months from both sides, we get:
2x = 247

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
x = 123

So, the number of members in the club is 123.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 25.
