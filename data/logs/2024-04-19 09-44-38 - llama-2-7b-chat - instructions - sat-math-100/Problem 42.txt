## Assistant 2:
  Thought: I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand that the correct solution involves factoring the expression inside the parentheses. I will carefully evaluate the expression and determine the possible values of $c$.

Reflection:

1. $(a x+2)(b x+7)=15 x^{2}+c x+14$
2. $a+b=8$

To find the possible values of $c$, I will factor the expression inside the parentheses:

$(a x+2)(b x+7)=(ax+2)(bx+7)=a x b + 2 b x + 7 a + 7 b$

Now, I can equate the expression to $15 x^{2}+c x+14$:

$a x b + 2 b x + 7 a + 7 b = 15 x^{2} + c x + 14$

Simplifying the equation, I get:

$a b + 2 b + 7 a + 7 b = 15 x^{2} + c x + 14$

$a + 2 b + 7 a + 7 b = 15 x^{2} + c x + 14$

$9 a + 14 b = 15 x^{2} + c x + 14$

$c = 15 x^{2} - 14 b - 9 a$

Now, I need to find the possible values of $a$ and $b$ such that $c$ takes on the values $3$ and $5$.

Solution:

Let $a = 2$ and $b = 3$. Then, $a + 2 = 8$, which gives $a = 6$. Substituting these values into the equation for $c$, I get:

$c = 15 x^{2} - 14 (6) - 9 (2) = 15 x^{2} - 84$

So, the possible values of $c$ are $3$ and $5$.

Action: Answer("B")
