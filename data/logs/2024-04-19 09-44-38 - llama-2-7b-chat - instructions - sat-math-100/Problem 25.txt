## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

## Assistant 2:
  Thought: 
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I am now reflecting on my solution and the correct answer.

Equations given in the problem:
$$\begin{aligned}y & =x^{2} \\2 y+6 & =2(x+3)\end{aligned}$$

Step 1: Substitute the expression for $y$ from the first equation into the second equation.
$$2 y+6 = 2(x+3)$$

Step 2: Simplify and solve for $y$.
$$2y + 6 = 2x + 6$$

$$y = x + 3$$

Step 3: Identify the value of $x y$.
$$x y = x + 3$$

Step 4: Choose the answer that matches the calculated value.
The correct answer is (B) $x y = 2$.

Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
