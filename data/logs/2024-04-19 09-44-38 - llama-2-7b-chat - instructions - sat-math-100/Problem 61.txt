## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Context: \begin{center}.\begin{tabular}{|l|c|}.\hline.\multicolumn{1}{|c|}{Planet} & Acceleration due to gravity $\left(\frac{\mathrm{m}}{\mathrm{sec}^{2}}\right)$ \\.\hline\hline.Mercury & 3.6 \\.\hline.Venus & 8.9 \\.\hline.Earth & 9.8 \\.\hline.Mars & 3.8 \\.\hline.Jupiter & 26.0 \\.\hline.Saturn & 11.1 \\.\hline.Uranus & 10.7 \\.\hline.Neptune & 14.1 \\.\hline.\end{tabular}.\end{center}.The chart above shows approximations of the acceleration due to gravity in meters per.second squared $\left(\frac{\mathrm{m}}{\sec ^{2}}\right)$ for the eight planets in our solar system. The weight of an object on a given planet can be found by using the formula $W=m g$, where $W$ is the weight of the object measured in newtons, $m$ is the mass of the object measured in kilograms, and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity on the planet measured in $\frac{m}{\sec ^{2}}$
Question: What is the weight, in newtons, of an object on Mercury with a mass of 90 kilograms?
Choices:
  A: 25
  B: 86
  C: 101
  D: 324

## Assistant 2:
  Reflection:

I previously answered this question incorrectly as I misunderstood the formula for calculating the weight of an object on a planet. I realized that the formula should be $W = m \times g$, where $W$ is the weight of the object in newtons, $m$ is the mass of the object in kilograms, and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity on the planet in $\frac{m}{\sec ^{2}}$.

To calculate the weight of an object on Mercury with a mass of 90 kilograms, we can use the acceleration due to gravity on Mercury, which is 3.6 $\frac{m}{\sec ^{2}}$. Therefore, the weight of the object on Mercury would be:

W = m \times g = 90 \times 3.6 = 324 newtons

So, the correct answer is (D) 324 newtons.
