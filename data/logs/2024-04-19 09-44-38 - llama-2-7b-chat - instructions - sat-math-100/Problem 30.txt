Context: $$.\begin{aligned}.& S(P)=\frac{1}{2} P+40 \\.& D(P)=220-P.\end{aligned}.$$.The quantity of a product supplied and the quantity of the product demanded in an economic market are functions of the price of the product. The functions above are the estimated supply and demand functions for a certain product. The function $S(P)$ gives the quantity of the product supplied to the market when the price is $P$ dollars, and the function $D(P)$ gives the quantity of the product demanded by the market when the price is $P$ dollars.
Question: How will the quantity of the product supplied to the market change if the price of the product is increased by $\$ 10$ ?

## Assistant 2:
  Thought: 
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand that the quantity of the product supplied will increase by 10 units if the price of the product is increased by $10$.

Action: Answer("C")

Reflection:
I made a mistake in my previous answer by selecting option A, which states that the quantity supplied will decrease by 5 units. This is incorrect, as the increase in price will lead to an increase in the quantity supplied. I reflected on my mistake and realized that the correct answer is option C, which states that the quantity supplied will increase by 10 units.
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
