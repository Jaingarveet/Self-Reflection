## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:

1. Identify the like terms of the two polynomials.
2. Add the like terms by combining them.
3. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.
4. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
5. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
## Assistant 2:
  Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand the mistake. The correct approach is to identify the like terms of the two polynomials and add them together.

Like terms are terms that have the same variable and exponent. In this case, the like terms of the two polynomials are:

$3x^2 - 5x + 2$
$5x^2 - 2x - 6$

To add these like terms, we combine them:

$3x^2 - 5x + 2 + 5x^2 - 2x - 6$

= $8x^2 - 7x - 4$

Therefore, the sum of the two polynomials is $8x^2 - 7x - 4$.
