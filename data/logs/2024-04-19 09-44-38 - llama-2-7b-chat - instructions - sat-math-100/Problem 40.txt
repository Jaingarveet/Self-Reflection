## Assistant 2:
  Topic: Math
Question: If $20-x=15$, what is the value of $3 x ?$

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand now that my mistake was in not properly isolating the variable $x$.

To solve this problem, we can use the equation $20 - x = 15$. We can add $x$ to both sides of the equation to get $x = 35$.

Therefore, the value of $3 x$ is $3 x = 3 x \times 35 = 105$.

So, the correct answer is (D) $35$.
