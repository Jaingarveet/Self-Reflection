## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Question: $$g(x)=a x^{2}+24$$For the function $g$ defined above, $a$ is a constant and $g(4)=8$. What is the value of $g(-4)$ ?

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I realized that I made a mistake in my calculation. Here is my self-reflection:

1. Identify the function $g(x)$ and its formula: The function $g(x)$ is a quadratic function with a formula of $g(x)=a x^{2}+24$.
2. Plug in -4 into the function $g(x)$: When I plug in -4 into the function $g(x)$, I get $g(-4)=a (-4)^{2}+24$.
3. Simplify the expression to find the value of $g(-4)$: Simplifying the expression, I get $g(-4)=-a 16+24=0$.
4. Choose the correct answer from the options provided: The correct answer is (B) $0$.

Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
