## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

## Assistant 2:
  Thought:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I realize that I made a mistake in my calculation. I need to reevaluate the problem and use the correct conversion factors to find the number of 1-milligram doses in one 2-decagram container.

Action:
I will start by converting 1 decagram to grams, using the conversion factor of 10 grams per decagram.

1 decagram = 10 grams

Next, I will convert 1,000 milligrams to grams, using the conversion factor of 1,000 milligrams per gram.

1,000 milligrams = 1 gram

Now, I will divide the number of grams in one 2-decagram container (20 grams) by the number of grams in one decagram (10 grams) to find the number of decagrams in one 2-decagram container.

20 grams / 10 grams per decagram = 2 decagrams

Finally, I will divide the number of milligrams in one dose (1 milligram) by the number of grams in one decagram (10 grams) to find the number of milligrams in one decagram.

1 milligram / 10 grams per decagram = 0.1 milligrams per decagram

Now, I can use the conversion factor of 10 milligrams per decagram to find the number of 1-milligram doses in one 2-decagram container.

2 decagrams x 10 milligrams per decagram = 20 milligrams

Therefore, there are 20 milligrams in one 2-decagram container.

Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
