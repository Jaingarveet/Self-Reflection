## Assistant 2:
  Thought: 
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand that I need to use the information given in the problem to find the number of students in the class.
Action: Let's analyze the problem again.

We know that Mr. Kohl has a beaker containing $n$ milliliters of solution and that he gives each student 3 milliliters of solution. This means that he will have 3n milliliters of solution left over after giving each student 3 milliliters.

We also know that he needs 21 milliliters to give each student 4 milliliters of solution. This means that he will have 3n - 21 milliliters of solution left over after giving each student 4 milliliters.

From this information, we can set up the equation:
3n - 21 = 5

Solving for n, we get:
n = 23

Action: Answer("C")

Reflection:
I reflected on my previous answer and realized that I made a mistake in my calculation. I hope this answer is correct.
