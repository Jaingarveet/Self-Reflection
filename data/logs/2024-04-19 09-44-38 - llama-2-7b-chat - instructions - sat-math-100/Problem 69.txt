Question: Alan drives an average of 100 miles each week. His car can travel an average of 25 miles per gallon of gasoline. Alan would like to reduce his weekly expenditure on gasoline by $\$ 5$. Assuming gasoline costs $\$ 4$ per gallon, which equation can Alan use to determine how many fewer average miles, $m$, he should drive each week?
Choices:
  A: $\frac{25}{4} m=95$
  B: $\frac{25}{4} m=5$
  C: $\frac{4}{25} m=95$
  D: $\frac{4}{25} m=5$

Question: Alan drives an average of 100 miles each week. His car can travel an average of 25 miles per gallon of gasoline. Alan would like to reduce his weekly expenditure on gasoline by $\$ 5$. Assuming gasoline costs $\$ 4$ per gallon, which equation can Alan use to determine how many fewer average miles, $m$, he should drive each week?

Reflection:

1. Problem and Goal: The problem is to determine the number of fewer miles, $m$, Alan should drive each week to reduce his weekly expenditure on gasoline by $\$ 5$. The goal is to find the correct equation to solve this problem.
2. Equation: The equation that represents the problem is:

$$\frac{25}{4} m = 95$$

This equation can be derived by using the information provided in the question:

* Alan drives an average of 100 miles each week.
* His car can travel an average of 25 miles per gallon of gasoline.
* Gasoline costs $\$ 4$ per gallon.

3. Solution: To solve the equation, we can divide both sides by $\frac{4}{25}$:

$$m = \frac{95}{4/25} = 95$$

4. Double-check: To ensure accuracy, we can plug in the value of $m$ into the original equation:

$$\frac{25}{4} m = 95$$

Substituting $m = 95$, we get:

$$\frac{25}{4} \times 95 = 95$$

Which is true.

5. Answer: Therefore, the answer is (B) $\frac{25}{4} m = 5$.
