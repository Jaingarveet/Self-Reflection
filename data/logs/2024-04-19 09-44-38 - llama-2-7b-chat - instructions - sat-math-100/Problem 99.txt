## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

## Assistant 2:
  Topic: Math
Question: $$f(x)=\frac{x+3}{2}$$For the function $f$ defined above, what is the value of $f(-1)$ ?

Reflection:

I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand the mistake. The correct formula for the function $f(x)$ is $\frac{x+3}{2}$. To find the value of $f(-1)$, we need to plug in the value $-1$ into the formula:

$$f(-1) = \frac{-1+3}{2} = \frac{-4}{2} = -2$$

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) $-2$.

Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
