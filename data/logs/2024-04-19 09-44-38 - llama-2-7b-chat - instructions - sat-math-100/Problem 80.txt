# Model: llama-2-7b-chat | Agent: instructions | Exam: sat-math-100 | Problem 80 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:

Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: $$\begin{aligned}& k x-3 y=4 \\& 4 x-5 y=7\end{aligned}$$In the system of equations above, $k$ is a constant and $x$ and $y$ are variables. For what value of $k$ will the system of equations have no solution?
Choices:
  A: $\frac{12}{5}$
  B: $\frac{16}{7}$
  C: $-\frac{16}{7}$
  D: $-\frac{12}{5}$
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.

## Assistant 2:
  Thought: I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I am now reflecting on my solution and the correct answer.

Action: I will use my self-reflection to help me answer the question.

Self-Reflection:

* I incorrectly solved for $k$ in the first equation, resulting in a value that is not a solution to the system of equations.
* I realized that the correct solution is $k = -\frac{12}{5}$, which leads to a system of equations that has no solution.

Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
