Question: The volume of right circular cylinder A is 22 cubic centimeters. What is the volume, in cubic centimeters, of a right circular cylinder with twice the radius and half the height of cylinder A?

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand the mistake. The formula for the volume of a right circular cylinder is:

V = πr^2h

Where r is the radius of the cylinder and h is its height.

To apply the formula to the problem, we need to know the radius and height of the first cylinder. The problem states that the volume of the first cylinder is 22 cubic centimeters, so we can use this information to calculate the radius and height of the second cylinder.

The radius of the second cylinder is twice the radius of the first cylinder, which is:

r2 = 2r1 = 2 x 5 = 10

The height of the second cylinder is half the height of the first cylinder, which is:

h2 = h1 / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5

Now, we can use the formula to calculate the volume of the second cylinder:

V = πr2h = π(10)5 = 50π

To double-check our calculations, we can plug in the values we have found into the formula:

π(10)5 = 50π

Which simplifies to:

50π = 50 x 3.14 = 157

Therefore, the volume of the second cylinder is 157 cubic centimeters.
