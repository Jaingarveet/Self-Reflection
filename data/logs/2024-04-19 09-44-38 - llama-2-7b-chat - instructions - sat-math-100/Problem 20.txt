## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Assistant 2:
  Thought: 
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand that the intersection point of the system of equations is not at the point $(0,0)$.
I will use the method of substitution to solve the system of equations.

First, I will solve the first equation for $x$:

$$2.4x - 1.5y = 0.3$$

$$x = \frac{0.3}{2.4}$$

$$x = \frac{0.013}{2.4}$$

$$x = -0.054$$

Now, I will substitute the value of $x$ into the second equation:

$$1.6x + 0.5y = -1.3$$

$$1.6(-0.054) + 0.5y = -1.3$$

$$-0.8 + 0.5y = -1.3$$

$$0.5y = -0.83$$

$$y = -0.83/0.5 = -1.66$$

Now, I know that the intersection point of the system of equations is at $(-0.5, -1.66)$.

Action: Answer("B")
