## Assistant 2:
  Thought: I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I need to reflect on my solution and the correct answer.

Self-Reflection:

I made the mistake of solving for $h$ in terms of $a$ instead of $a$ in terms of $h$. I realized that the model is actually a proportion, and we need to solve for $a$ in terms of $h$.
