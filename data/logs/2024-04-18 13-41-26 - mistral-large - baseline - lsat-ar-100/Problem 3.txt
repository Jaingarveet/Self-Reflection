Topic: Law
Context: An administrator must assign parking spaces to six new employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young. Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
Question: If Robertson is assigned parking space #3, then which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Souza is assigned parking space #4.
  B: Togowa is assigned parking space #2.
  C: Vaughn is assigned parking space #5.
  D: Xu is assigned parking space #6.
  E: Young is assigned parking space #2.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Since Robertson is assigned parking space #3, Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than #3, which means Young can only be assigned parking space #4, #5, or #6.
Since Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, Souza cannot be assigned parking space #6.
Since Togowa must be assigned a lower-numbered parking space than Young, Togowa can only be assigned parking space #1 or #2.
Since Robertson is already assigned parking space #3, Togowa cannot be assigned parking space #3.
Therefore, Togowa must be assigned parking space #2.
Action: Answer("B")
