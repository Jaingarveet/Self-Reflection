Context: A government needs to assign new ambassadors to Venezuela, Yemen, and Zambia. The candidates for these ambassadorships are Jaramillo, Kayne, Landon, Novetzke, and Ong. One ambassador will be assigned to each country, and no ambassador will be assigned to more than one country. The assignment of the ambassadors must meet the following constraints: Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships. If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne. If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen. If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
Question: If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then the other two ambassadors assigned could be
Choices:
  A: Jaramillo and Landon
  B: Jaramillo and Novetzke
  C: Kayne and Landon
  D: Kayne and Novetzke
  E: Landon and Novetzke
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne cannot be assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
Since Landon can only be assigned to Zambia, the remaining options for Yemen are Jaramillo, Kayne, and Novetzke.
If Jaramillo is assigned to Yemen, then Kayne must also be assigned, but this is not possible since Kayne cannot be assigned to Yemen.
Therefore, the only remaining options for Yemen are Kayne and Novetzke.
Since Kayne cannot be assigned to Yemen, Novetzke must be assigned to Yemen.
This leaves Jaramillo and Landon as the remaining options for Zambia.
Since Landon can only be assigned to Zambia, Jaramillo cannot be assigned to any ambassadorship.
Therefore, the other two ambassadors assigned are Landon and Novetzke.
Action: Answer("E")
## Result:
Agent Answer: E
Correct Answer: E
Score: 1
