Context: At a concert, exactly eight compositions—F, H, L, O, P, R, S, and T—are to be performed exactly once each, consecutively and one composition at a time. The order of their performance must satisfy the following conditions: T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R. At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F. O is performed either first or fifth. The eighth composition performed is either L or H. P is performed at some time before S. At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
Question: P CANNOT be performed
Choices:
  A: second
  B: third
  C: fourth
  D: sixth
  E: seventh
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
According to the conditions, P must be performed before S, and at least one composition must be performed between O and S or between S and O.
If P is performed second, then S cannot be performed first, and O cannot be performed first or fifth, which violates the condition that O must be performed either first or fifth.
If P is performed third, then S cannot be performed first or second, and O cannot be performed first, which violates the condition that O must be performed either first or fifth.
If P is performed fourth, then S cannot be performed first, second, or third, and O cannot be performed first, which violates the condition that O must be performed either first or fifth.
If P is performed sixth, then S cannot be performed first, second, third, fourth, or fifth, which violates the condition that S must be performed at some time after P.
If P is performed seventh, then S must be performed eighth, which violates the condition that the eighth composition performed is either L or H.
Therefore, P cannot be performed sixth.
Action: Answer("E")
