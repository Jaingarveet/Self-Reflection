## User 2:
Topic: Law
Context: An administrator must assign parking spaces to six new employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young. Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
Question: If Young is assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Togowa is assigned parking space #1.
  B: Young is assigned parking space #2.
  C: Robertson is assigned parking space #3.
  D: Souza is assigned parking space #3.
  E: Vaughn is assigned parking space #4.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The question states that Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa and Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Additionally, Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young and can only be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.

If Young is assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, then Souza must be assigned a lower-numbered parking space than Young. Since Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young, Robertson cannot be assigned parking space #1 or #2. Therefore, Robertson must be assigned parking space #3 or #4.

Since Togowa must be assigned a lower-numbered parking space than Young, Togowa cannot be assigned parking space #5 or #6. Therefore, Togowa must be assigned parking space #1 or #2.

Action: Answer("A")

Explanation:
If Young is assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, then Souza must be assigned a lower-numbered parking space than Young. Since Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young, Robertson cannot be assigned parking space #1 or #2. Therefore, Robertson must be assigned parking space #3 or #4. Since Togowa must be assigned a lower-numbered parking space than Young, Togowa cannot be assigned parking space #5 or #6. Therefore, Togowa must be assigned parking space #1 or #2. Since Togowa can be assigned parking space #1, answer choice "A" could be true.
