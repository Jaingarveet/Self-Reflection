Context: A panel of five scientists will be formed. The panelists will be selected from among three botanists—F, G, and H—three chemists—K, L, and M—and three zoologists—P, Q, and R. Selection is governed by the following conditions: The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types. If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. F and K cannot both be selected. K and M cannot both be selected. If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
Question: If both G and H are among the scientists selected, then the panel must include either
Choices:
  A: F or else K
  B: F or else M
  C: K or else M
  D: M or else Q
  E: P or else Q
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
If both G and H are selected, then there are two botanists on the panel. According to the conditions, if more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. Therefore, either P or Q cannot be on the panel.
The conditions also state that if M is selected, both P and R must be selected. However, since P or Q cannot be on the panel, M cannot be selected.
The conditions also state that F and K cannot both be selected, and K and M cannot both be selected. Since M cannot be selected, K can be selected.
Action: Answer("A")
