Topic: Law
Context: An administrator must assign parking spaces to six new employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young. Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
Question: For how many of the six new employees is the assignment of a parking space limited to one of only two possible spaces?
Choices:
  A: none
  B: two
  C: three
  D: four
  E: five
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let's analyze the rules given:

1. Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
2. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
3. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
4. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.

From rule 4, we know that Robertson can only be assigned one of the four lower-numbered spaces. Since Robertson must have a higher-numbered space than Young, Young can only be assigned one of the three remaining lower-numbered spaces (#1, #2, or #3).

Now, since Young must have a higher-numbered space than Togowa, Togowa can only be assigned one of the two remaining lower-numbered spaces (#1 or #2).

Action: Answer("B")

Explanation:
Togowa is limited to two possible spaces (#1 or #2), and Young is limited to two possible spaces (#2 or #3) after considering Togowa's limitation. Therefore, two employees have their parking space assignment limited to only two possible spaces.
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
