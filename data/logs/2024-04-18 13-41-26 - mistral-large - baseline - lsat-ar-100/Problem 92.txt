Topic: Law
Context: A software company employs exactly seven sales representatives—Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall—to work in its three sales zones—Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3. Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Question: Quinn CANNOT work in the same sales zone as which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: Kim
  B: Mahr
  C: Stuckey
  D: Tiao
  E: Udall
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
From the conditions given, we know that Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. We also know that Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. Since there are only seven sales representatives and there are more of them working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, Zone 3 must have at least three representatives.

If Parra and Quinn work in Zone 3, then Stuckey and Udall cannot work in Zone 3 because they work in the same zone as each other. Therefore, Stuckey and Udall must work in Zone 1 or Zone 2. However, since there are more representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, Stuckey and Udall cannot work in Zone 2. Therefore, they must work in Zone 1.

If Parra and Quinn work in Zone 1, then Stuckey and Udall cannot work in Zone 1 because they work in the same zone as each other. Therefore, Stuckey and Udall must work in Zone 2 or Zone 3. However, since there are more representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, Stuckey and Udall cannot work in Zone 2. Therefore, they must work in Zone 3.

In either case, Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Stuckey.
