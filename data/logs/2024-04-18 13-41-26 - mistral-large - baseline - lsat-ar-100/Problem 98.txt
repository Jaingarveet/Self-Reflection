Context: A realtor will show a prospective buyer seven houses—J, K, L, M, N, 0, and P—during a single day. The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning; the third, fourth, and fifth houses to be shown will be shown in the afternoon; the sixth and seventh houses to be shown will be shown in the evening. The houses will be shown according to the following rules: J must be shown in the evening. K cannot be shown in the morning. L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
Question: Which one of the following could be true?

  C: P is shown at some time after J is shown.

  E: Both N and P are shown at some time after K is
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning, but J must be shown in the evening, so J cannot be the first or second house.
K cannot be shown in the morning, so K cannot be the first or second house either.
L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown, so L cannot be the first house.
Therefore, the first two houses must be chosen from L, M, N, O, and P.
Since J must be shown in the evening, it must be either the sixth or seventh house.
If J is the sixth house, then K, L, M, N, and O must be shown before it, but this is not possible since L must be shown after K and before M.
Therefore, J must be the seventh house, and K, L, M, N, O, and P must be shown before it.
Since L must be shown after K and before M, K cannot be the last house shown before J, so it must be one of the first five houses.
Therefore, K could be shown at some time after J is shown if it is the fifth house shown.
