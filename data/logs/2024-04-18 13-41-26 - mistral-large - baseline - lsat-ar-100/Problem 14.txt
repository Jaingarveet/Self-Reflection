Context: At a concert, exactly eight compositions—F, H, L, O, P, R, S, and T—are to be performed exactly once each, consecutively and one composition at a time. The order of their performance must satisfy the following conditions: T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R. At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F. O is performed either first or fifth. The eighth composition performed is either L or H. P is performed at some time before S. At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
Question: If T is performed fifth and F is performed sixth, then S must be performed either
Choices:
  A: fourth or seventh
  B: third or sixth
  C: third or fourth
  D: second or seventh
  E: first or fourth
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Since T is performed fifth and F is performed sixth, the condition that T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R is satisfied.
Since at least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F, R cannot be performed seventh or eighth.
Since O is performed either first or fifth, and T is performed fifth, O must be performed first.
Since P is performed at some time before S, and O is performed first, S cannot be performed second.
Since at least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O, S cannot be performed first or eighth.
Since the eighth composition performed is either L or H, S cannot be performed eighth.
Therefore, S must be performed either fourth or seventh.
Action: Answer("A")
