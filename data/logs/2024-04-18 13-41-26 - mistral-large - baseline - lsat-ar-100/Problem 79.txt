Context: A loading dock consists of exactly six bays numbered 1 through 6 consecutively from one side of the dock to the other. Each bay is holding a different one of exactly six types of cargoâ€”fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles. The following apply: The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock. The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles. The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel. The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.

Choices:
  A: Bay 2 is holding fuel.
  B: Bay 4 is holding produce.
  C: Bay 4 is holding textiles.
  D: Bay 5 is holding grain.
  E: Bay 5 is holding machinery.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The bay holding produce is next to the bay holding livestock, and the bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles. Therefore, the bay holding produce cannot be in Bay 1.
The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock, so the bay holding grain cannot be in Bay 1 or Bay 2.
The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel, so the bay holding fuel cannot be in Bay 6.
The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce, so the bay holding textiles cannot be in Bay 1 or Bay 6.
The bay holding produce is next to the bay holding livestock, so the bay holding produce cannot be in Bay 6.
The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce, so the bay holding textiles cannot be in Bay 5.
The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock, so the bay holding grain cannot be in Bay 4.
The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel, so the bay holding fuel cannot be in Bay 5.
The bay holding produce is next to the bay holding livestock, so the bay holding produce cannot be in Bay 3.
The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce, so the bay holding textiles cannot be in Bay 3.
The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel, so the bay holding fuel cannot be in Bay 4.
The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock, so the bay holding grain cannot be in Bay 3.
The bay holding produce is next to the bay holding livestock, so the bay holding produce cannot be in Bay 2.
The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce, so the bay holding textiles cannot be in Bay 2.
The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel, so the bay holding fuel cannot be in Bay 3.
The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock, so the bay holding grain cannot be in Bay 2.
The bay holding produce is next to the bay holding livestock, so the bay holding produce cannot be in Bay 1.
The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce, so the bay holding textiles cannot be in Bay 1.
The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel, so the bay holding fuel cannot be in Bay 2.
The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock, so the bay holding grain cannot be in Bay 1.
Therefore, the only possible arrangement is:
Bay 1: Fuel
Bay 2: Textiles
Bay 3: Livestock
Bay 4: Produce
Bay 5: Grain
Bay 6: Machinery
Action: Answer("C")
