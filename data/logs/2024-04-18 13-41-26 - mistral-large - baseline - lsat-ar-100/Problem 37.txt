Context: At a concert, exactly eight compositions—F, H, L, O, P, R, S, and T—are to be performed exactly once each, consecutively and one composition at a time. The order of their performance must satisfy the following conditions: T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R. At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F. O is performed either first or fifth. The eighth composition performed is either L or H. P is performed at some time before S. At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
Question: If S is performed fourth, which one of the following could be an accurate list of the compositions performed first, second, and third, respectively?
Choices:
  A: F, H, P
  B: H, P. L
  C: O, P, R
  D: O, P, T
  E: P, R, T
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
If S is performed fourth, then O cannot be performed first or fifth, so O must be performed either second or third.
If O is performed second, then P cannot be performed first, so P must be performed third. But this would mean that no composition is performed after O and before S, which violates the given condition.
Therefore, O must be performed third.
If O is performed third, then P must be performed either first or second.
If P is performed first, then R cannot be performed second, so R must be performed third. But this would mean that T cannot be performed immediately before F or immediately after R, which violates the given condition.
Therefore, P must be performed second.
If P is performed second, then R cannot be performed first, so R must be performed third. But this would mean that T cannot be performed immediately before F or immediately after R, which violates the given condition.
Therefore, R cannot be performed third.
If R is not performed third, then T must be performed third.
If T is performed third, then F must be performed either first or second.
If F is performed first, then H cannot be performed second, so H must be performed eighth. But this would mean that L must be performed second, which violates the given condition that at least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
Therefore, F must be performed second.
If F is performed second, then H cannot be performed first, so H must be performed eighth.
If H is performed eighth, then L must be performed first.
Therefore, the accurate list of the compositions performed first, second, and third, respectively, is L, F, T.
Action: Answer("D")
