Context: A shopping center has exactly seven spaces—space 1 through space 7—arranged in a straight row. Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
Question: Which one of the following could be the order of the businesses in spaces 1 through 7 respectively?
Choices:
  A: pharmacy, optometrist, shoe store, restaurant, veterinarian, toy store, restaurant
  B: pharmacy, veterinarian, optometrist, shoe store, restaurant, toy store, restaurant
  C: restaurant, shoe store, veterinarian, pharmacy, optometrist, toy store, restaurant
  D: restaurant, toy store, optometrist, restaurant, veterinarian, shoe store, pharmacy
  E: restaurant, optometrist, toy store, restaurant, shoe store, veterinarian, pharmacy
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The pharmacy must be at one end of the row, so it can only be in space 1 or 7.
One of the restaurants must be at the other end of the row, so it can only be in space 1 or 7, but not the same space as the pharmacy.
The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, so they cannot be in adjacent spaces.
The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, so it cannot be in space 1 if the optometrist or veterinarian is not in space 2, and it cannot be in space 7 if the optometrist or veterinarian is not in space 6.
The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so they cannot be in adjacent spaces.

Let's evaluate each choice:
A: pharmacy, optometrist, shoe store, restaurant, veterinarian, toy store, restaurant - This choice satisfies all the constraints.
B: pharmacy, veterinarian, optometrist, shoe store, restaurant, toy store, restaurant - This choice violates the constraint that the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
C: restaurant, shoe store, veterinarian, pharmacy, optometrist, toy store, restaurant - This choice violates the constraint that the pharmacy must be at one end of the row.
D: restaurant, toy store, optometrist, restaurant, veterinarian, shoe store, pharmacy - This choice violates the constraint that the pharmacy must be at one end of the row.
E: restaurant, optometrist, toy store, restaurant, shoe store, veterinarian, pharmacy - This choice violates the constraint that the pharmacy must be at one end of the row.
