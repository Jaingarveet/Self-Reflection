Context: Exactly eight books—F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O—are placed on a bookcase with exactly three shelves—the top shelf, the middle shelf, and the bottom shelf. At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.
Question: Which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: O is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf M is placed on.
  B: K is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf G is placed on.
  C: I is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf F is placed on.
  D: G is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf O is placed on.
  E: F is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf L is placed on.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Since more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, the bottom shelf must have at least 3 books, and the top shelf must have at most 2 books.
Since I is placed on the middle shelf, it cannot be on the same shelf as F and M. Therefore, F and M must be on either the top or bottom shelf.
Since K is placed on a higher shelf than F, K cannot be on the bottom shelf. Therefore, K must be on either the top or middle shelf.
Since O is placed on a higher shelf than L, O cannot be on the bottom shelf. Therefore, O must be on either the top or middle shelf.
Since F is placed on the same shelf as M, they cannot be on the middle shelf with I. Therefore, F and M must be on either the top or bottom shelf.
Since the bottom shelf must have at least 3 books, and F and M are already on the bottom shelf, there is only room for one more book on the bottom shelf. Therefore, either G, H, or L must be on the bottom shelf with F and M.
Since O is placed on a higher shelf than L, L cannot be on the top shelf. Therefore, L must be on either the bottom or middle shelf.
Since K is placed on a higher shelf than F, and F is on the bottom shelf, K must be on either the top or middle shelf.
Since O is placed on a higher shelf than L, and L is on the bottom shelf, O must be on either the top or middle shelf.
Since G, H, and O cannot all be on the top shelf, and O must be on either the top or middle shelf, G and H must be on different shelves.
Since G and H must be on different shelves, and G cannot be on the top shelf with O, G must be on either the bottom or middle shelf.
Since G must be on either the bottom or middle shelf, and there is only room for one more book on the bottom shelf, G must be on the middle shelf.
Since G is on the middle shelf, H must be on the top shelf.
Since H is on the top shelf, and O must be on either the top or middle shelf, O must be on the middle shelf.
Since O is on the middle shelf, K must be on the top shelf.
Since K is on the top shelf, and F is on the bottom shelf, F and M must be on the bottom shelf.
Since F and M are on the bottom shelf, and there is only room for one more book on the bottom shelf, L must be on the middle shelf.
Therefore, the arrangement of the books must be as follows:
Top shelf: H, K
Middle shelf: G, I, L, O
Bottom shelf: F, M, and one of G, H, or L

Action: Answer("A") (O is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf M is placed on.)
