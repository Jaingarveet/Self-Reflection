## Get Reflection:
 Explanation:
You are correct that the number of students in the class is 21. However, your reasoning for arriving at that answer is not correct. Here's why:

You said that if Mr. Kohl gives each student 3 milliliters of solution, he will have 5 milliliters left over. So, the total amount of solution he has is 5 milliliters + (n-3) milliliters, where n is the number of students.

But that's not the correct equation. The equation should be:

Total amount of solution = 5 milliliters + (n-3) milliliters

So, if Mr. Kohl wants to give each student 4 milliliters of solution, he will need an additional 21 milliliters. Therefore, the total amount of solution he needs is:

Total amount of solution = 5 milliliters + (n-3) milliliters + 21 milliliters = 26 milliliters

Since he has 5 milliliters left over after giving 3 milliliters to each student, he must have had a total of 26 milliliters - 5 milliliters = 21 milliliters of solution to start with.

So, the number of students in the class is indeed 21.

I hope this clears up any confusion. Thank you for sharing your thought process!
