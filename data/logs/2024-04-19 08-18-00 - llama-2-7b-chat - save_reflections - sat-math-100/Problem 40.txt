 Explanation:
I made a mistake in my reasoning and calculation. I incorrectly solved the equation $20-x=15$ and arrived at the wrong answer.

Error Keywords:

* Misunderstanding the equation
* Incorrect calculation
* Failure to check work

Solution:
The equation $20-x=15$ can be solved by subtracting $x$ from both sides of the equation:

$20 - x = 15$
