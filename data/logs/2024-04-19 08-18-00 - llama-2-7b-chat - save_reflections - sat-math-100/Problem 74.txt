## Get Reflection:
  Explanation:

You are correct that the expression $\frac{1}{\frac{1}{x+2}+\frac{1}{x+3}}$ can be simplified using the formula for the reciprocal of a fraction. However, the simplified expression you arrived at, $\frac{2x+5}{x^{2}+5x+6}$, is not the correct answer.

The correct answer is (B): $\frac{x^{2}+5x+6}{2x+5}$.

Here's how you can arrive at the correct answer:

Using the formula for the reciprocal of a fraction, we can write:

$$\frac{1}{\frac{1}{x+2}+\frac{1}{x+3}} = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{x+2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\frac{1}{x+3}} = \frac{x+2}{x+3} \cdot \frac{x+3}{x+2}$$

Now, we can simplify the expression by combining the like terms:

$$\frac{x+2}{x+3} \cdot \frac{x+3}{x+2} = \frac{x^{2}+5x+6}{2x+5}$$

Therefore, the correct answer is (B): $\frac{x^{2}+5x+6}{2x+5}$.

Advice:

* When simplifying expressions, always use the appropriate formulas and techniques to arrive at the simplified form.
* When dealing with fractions, use the formula for the reciprocal of a fraction to simplify the expression.
* Always check your work by verifying that the simplified expression is equivalent to the original expression.
