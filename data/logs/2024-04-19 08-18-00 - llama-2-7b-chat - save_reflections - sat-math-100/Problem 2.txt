## Get Reflection:
  My apologies, thank you for pointing that out! Here is the corrected response:

Topic: Math
Question: $$\left(x^{2} y-3 y^{2}+5 x y^{2}\right)-\left(-x^{2} y+3 x y^{2}-3 y^{2}\right)$$Which of the following is equivalent to the expression above?
Choices:
  A: $4 x^{2} y^{2}$
  B: $8 x y^{2}-6 y^{2}$
  C: $2 x^{2} y+2 x y^{2}$
  D: $2 x^{2} y+8 x y^{2}-6 y^{2}$

Thought: The expression given is a quadratic equation in the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$. To find the equivalent expression, we need to factor the quadratic expression.

Action: Factor the expression as $a = 4$, $b = -3$, and $c = 5$.

Answer: The equivalent expression is $4x^2 y^2$. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) $2 x^{2} y+2 x y^{2}$.
