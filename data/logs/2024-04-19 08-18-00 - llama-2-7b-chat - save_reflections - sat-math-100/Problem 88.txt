Topic: Math
Question: $$h=-4.9 t^{2}+25 t$$The equation above expresses the approximate height $h$, in meters, of a ball $t$ seconds after it is launched vertically upward from the ground with an initial velocity of 25 meters per second. After approximately how many seconds will the ball hit the ground?
Choices:
  A: 3.5
  B: 4.0
  C: 4.5
  D: 5.0

Thought: To find the time at which the ball will hit the ground, we need to solve the equation $h=-4.9t^2+25t$.

Action: Subtract $t=0$ from both sides of the equation to get $h=-4.9t^2$. Then, divide both sides of the equation by $t$ to get $h=-4.9t/t=4.9$.

Now, we can see that the ball will hit the ground after $t=4.9$ seconds.

Action: Answer("D")
