## Get Reflection:
  Explanation:

The problem asks us to find the probability that a person who recalled at least one dream belonged to Group Y. To do this, we need to use the total number of dreams recalled by each group.

From the table, we can see that Group X recalled 36 dreams, and Group Y recalled 125 dreams. So, the total number of dreams recalled is 161 (36 + 125).

Now, let's find the number of dreams recalled by Group Y alone:

Group Y recalled 68 dreams.

So, the probability that a person who recalled at least one dream belonged to Group Y is:

$$\frac{68}{161}$$

This is the correct answer, so we should choose option (B) on the multiple-choice question.

Error Keywords:

* Total number of dreams recalled
* Number of dreams recalled by Group Y alone
* Probability of belonging to Group Y

Advice:

* Always read the question carefully and understand what is being asked.
* Use the information provided in the table to find the correct answer.
* Use the formula for probability to calculate the probability of belonging to Group Y.
* Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
* Remember to choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
