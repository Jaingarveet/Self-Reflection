## Get Reflection:
  Thank you for providing the reflection and the correct answer. Here's the updated response:

Explanation:
I understand now that the function $h(x) = 2^x$ means that $h(x)$ is equal to $2$ raised to the power of $x$. To find $h(5)-h(3)$, I evaluated $h(5)$ and $h(3)$ and then subtracted their values:

$h(5) = 2^5 = 32$

$h(3) = 2^3 = 8$

$h(5) - h(3) = 32 - 8 = 24$

Action: Answer("C")

I hope this updated response meets your requirements. Please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns.
