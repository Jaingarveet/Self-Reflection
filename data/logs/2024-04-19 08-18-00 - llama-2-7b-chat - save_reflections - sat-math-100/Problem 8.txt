## Get Reflection:
 Explanation:
You are correct that the original price of the laptop computer in terms of $p$ is:

Original price = $p / $0.88
= $p / (0.88)
= B: $\frac{p}{0.88}$

However, the correct answer is (D): $\frac{p}{(0.8)(1.08)}$.

Here's why:

The problem states that the total amount Alma paid to the cashier is $p$, including an 8% sales tax on the discounted price. The discounted price is given as $0.80p$, which means the original price of the laptop computer was:

Original price = $0.80p / 0.80
= $p / (0.80)
= D: $\frac{p}{(0.8)(1.08)}$

So, the correct answer is (D): $\frac{p}{(0.8)(1.08)}$.

I apologize for the mistake in my previous response. Thank you for pointing it out!
