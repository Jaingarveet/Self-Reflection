## Get Reflection:
  Explanation:
I correctly answered the question by choosing option D, which represents the correct answer of 20,000 1-milligram doses in one 2-decagram container.

Here's how I arrived at this answer:

1. We know that 1 decagram = 10 grams, so 2 decagrams = 20 grams.
2. We also know that 1,000 milligrams = 1 gram, so 2,000 milligrams = 2 grams.
3. Therefore, 2 decagrams of medicine = 20 grams = 0.002 kilograms.
4. Since 1 kilogram = 1,000,000 milligrams, we can convert 0.002 kilograms to milligrams by dividing by 1,000,000: 0.002 kg = 2,000,000 mg.
5. Finally, since 1 milligram = 1/1,000 gram, we can convert 2,000,000 milligrams to 1-milligram doses by dividing by 1,000: 2,000,000 mg = 2,000,000 / 1,000 = 2,000 1-milligram doses.

Therefore, the correct answer is option D: 20,000 1-milligram doses in one 2-decagram container.
