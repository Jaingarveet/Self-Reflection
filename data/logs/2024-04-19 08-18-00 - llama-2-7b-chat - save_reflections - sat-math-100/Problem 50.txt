# Model: llama-2-7b-chat | Task: save_reflection | Exam: sat-math-100 | Problem 50 of 100
## Get Reflection:
  Great, let's break down the solution step by step:

1. From the table, we can see that there are 18 left-handed students and 122 right-handed students in the school.
2. We are asked to find the probability that a right-handed student selected at random is female.
3. Let's use the information given in the problem to find the number of female right-handed students:

Female right-handed students = 122 - 18 = 104
4. Now, we can find the probability of a right-handed student being female:

Probability of a right-handed student being female = Number of female right-handed students / Total number of right-handed students
= 104 / 122
= 0.86
5. So, the closest answer is (B): 0.357.

Action: Answer("B")

Great, let's review the steps and key points:

* Identified the information given in the problem: number of left-handed and right-handed students by gender.
* Used the information to find the number of female right-handed students.
* Calculated the probability of a right-handed student being female.
* Compared the calculated probability to the choices given in the question.
* Chose the closest answer: (B): 0.357.

By following these steps and using the information given in the problem, we can solve the problem accurately. Remember to always read the question carefully, identify the relevant information, and use logical reasoning to find the solution.
