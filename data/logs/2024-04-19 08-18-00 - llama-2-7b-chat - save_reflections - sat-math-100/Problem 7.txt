## Get Reflection:
  Explanation:

To find the sum of $(7+3i) + (-8+9i)$, we need to first simplify the expressions inside the parentheses.

$7+3i = 7 + 3(i/\sqrt{-1}) = 7 + 3i\sqrt{-1}$

$(-8+9i) = (-8 - 9i)/\sqrt{-1} = (-8 - 9i)\sqrt{-1}$

Now, we can add the two expressions:

$= 7 + 3i\sqrt{-1} + (-8 - 9i)\sqrt{-1}$

$= 7 + 3i\sqrt{-1} - 8\sqrt{-1} - 9i\sqrt{-1}$

$= 7 + 3i\sqrt{-1} - 17\sqrt{-1}$

As you can see, the correct answer is option A: $-1+12i$.
