## Get Reflection:
 Explanation:
You are correct, the answer is indeed C. My apologies for the mistake in my previous response.

To explain why the answer is C, let's go through the steps again:

1. The area of the rectangle before the alterations is 100 square units.
2. The length of the rectangle is increased by 10%, so the new length is:
New length = Old length x 1.10 = 1.10 x Old length
3. The width of the rectangle is decreased by $p$%, so the new width is:
New width = Old width x (1 - $p$/100) = Old width x (1 - $p$/100)
4. The area of the rectangle after the alterations is:
New area = Length x Width = New length x New width
= (1.10 x Old length) x (Old width x (1 - $p$/100))
5. We are given that the area after the alterations is 88 square units, so we can set up the equation:
1.10 x Old area x (1 - $p$/100) = 88
6. Solving for $p$, we get:
$p$ = (88 / 1.10) - (Old area / Old length)
= (88 / 1.10) - (100 / Old length)
= 6.67%

Therefore, the value of $p$ that will give us an area of 88 square units after the alterations is 6.67%.

I hope this clears up any confusion, and thank you for pointing out the mistake in my previous response.
