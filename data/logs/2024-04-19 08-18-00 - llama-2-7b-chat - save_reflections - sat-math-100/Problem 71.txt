## Get Reflection:
  Explanation:

The correct answer is (C) 0.45.

To find the probability that a tablet user answered "Always," given that they did not answer "Never," we can use the conditional probability formula:

P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B)

where:

* P(A) is the probability of answering "Always"
* P(B) is the probability of not answering "Never"
* P(A ∩ B) is the probability of answering "Always" and not answering "Never"

From the table, we can see that:

* P(A) = 0.30 (from the last column)
* P(B) = 0.69 (from the first column)
* P(A ∩ B) = 0.30 x 0.69 = 0.207

So, the probability that a tablet user answered "Always," given that they did not answer "Never," is:

P(Always|Never) = P(A|B) = 0.207

The correct answer is (C) 0.45.

Advice:

* When dealing with conditional probability problems, make sure to use the correct formula and to isolate the probability of the event of interest.
* Always check your calculations to ensure that they are correct.
* In this problem, it was important to use the information that the probability of not answering "Never" was 0.69 to find the probability of answering "Always" given that the user did not answer "Never".
