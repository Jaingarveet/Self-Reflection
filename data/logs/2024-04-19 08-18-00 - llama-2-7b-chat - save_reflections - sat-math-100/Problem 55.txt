## Get Reflection:
 Explanation:

The equation $y = - (x - 3)^2 + a$ is a parabola, and we need to determine the minimum or maximum value of the parabola. To do this, we find the stationary points of the function, which are the points where the derivative of the function is equal to zero.

The derivative of the function is:

$$\frac{dy}{dx} = -4x + 2a$$

Solving for $x$, we get:

$$x = -4a/3$$

Now, we need to determine the minimum or maximum value of the parabola. If the stationary point is a minimum, then the value of $y$ is a minimum, and if it's a maximum, then the value of $y$ is a maximum. In this case, the stationary point is a minimum, so the minimum value of the parabola is:

$$y = - (x - 3)^2 + a = - (x - 3)^2 \times min(a)$$

Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("A: Its minimum occurs at $(-3, a)$")

Correct Answer: D

Advice:

* Always identify the equation of the parabola and determine its stationary points.
* Use the derivative of the function to find the stationary points.
* Determine the minimum or maximum value of the parabola by finding the minimum or maximum value of the function.
* Always check your calculations to ensure that you have found the correct minimum or maximum value of the parabola.
* Remember that the minimum or maximum value of the parabola is the value of $y$ that corresponds to the minimum or maximum value of the function.
