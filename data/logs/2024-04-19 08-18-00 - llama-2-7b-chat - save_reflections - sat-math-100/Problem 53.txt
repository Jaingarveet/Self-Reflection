## Get Reflection:
 Explanation:
I made a mistake in my reasoning and answered incorrectly.

The correct answer is (D) $(14,2)$.

Here's why:

The line passes through the origin, so one of the points must be the origin. The slope of the line is $\frac{1}{7}$, which means that for every $1$ unit of $x$, the line moves $7$ units to the right.

So, if the line passes through the origin, it must also pass through the point $(14,2)$, since $14$ units to the right of the origin is $2$ units above the origin.

Error Keywords:

* Misunderstanding the slope of the line
* Ignoring the fact that the line passes through the origin
Solution:

The line passes through the origin and has a slope of $\frac{1}{7}$.

One of the points on the line is $(14,2)$.

Instructions:

1. Identify the line that passes through the origin and has a slope of $\frac{1}{7}$.
2. Determine which point on the line passes through the origin.
3. Use the slope of the line to find the other point on the line.
4. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
Advice:

* Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
* Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
* Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
* Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
* Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
* Remember that the slope of a line is a ratio of the vertical change to the horizontal change, so it tells you how much the line moves for every $1$ unit of horizontal movement.
