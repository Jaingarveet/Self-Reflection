## Get Reflection:
 Explanation:
I made a mistake in my answer by selecting option B, which is not the correct sum of the two polynomials.

The correct answer is option A, $8 x^{2}-7 x-4$.

Here's why:

When adding the like terms of the two polynomials, we need to combine the identical terms, which are the terms that have the same degree (or power) and the same variable. In this case, the like terms are $x^2$ and $x^2$.

So, we can add the two $x^2$ terms to get:

$3 x^{2}-5 x+2 + 5 x^{2}-2 x-6 = 8 x^{2}-7 x-4$

Therefore, the correct answer is option A, $8 x^{2}-7 x-4$.

Error Keywords:

* Like terms
* Degree (or power)
* Variable

Instructions:

1. Identify the like terms of the two polynomials.
2. Add the like terms by combining them.
3. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.
4. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
5. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.

Advice:

* Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
* Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
* Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
* Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
* Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
* Remember that like terms are terms that have the same degree (or power) and the same variable.
