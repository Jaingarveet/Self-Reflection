## Get Reflection:
  Explanation:

The correct answer is (C) $x-4$.

Here's why:

1. Constant term: $f(0) = 3$.
2. Degree of the polynomial: The degree of the polynomial is 1, since the highest power of $x$ is 1.
3. Factors of the polynomial: A polynomial of degree 1 can be factored as $x - r$, where $r$ is a constant.

Using these steps, we can determine that the factor of $f(x)$ must be $x - 4$.

The table provided shows that $f(2) = 1$ and $f(4) = 0$, which matches the factor $x - 4$.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) $x-4$.

Advice:

* Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
