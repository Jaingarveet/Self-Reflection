  Great, let's solve this problem!

We are given that Keith modeled the growth of a tree population by estimating the number of pollen grains per square centimeter that were deposited each year within layers of a lake's sediment. The number of pollen grains per square centimeter is given by $P(t)$, where $t$ is the number of years after the first year the grains were deposited.

We are also given that the number of pollen grains per square centimeter increased by $1\%$ each year after the first year.

So, we can write the function $P(t)$ as:

$$P(t) = 310 + 310 \times 1.01^t$$

Now, we have to choose the correct function from the options given.

Option A: $P(t)=310^{t}$

This function does not match the given information. The number of pollen grains per square centimeter does not increase exponentially with time.

Option B: $P(t)=310^{1.01 t}$

This function matches the given information. The number of pollen grains per square centimeter increases by $1\%$ each year after the first year.

Option C: $P(t)=310(0.99)^{t}$

This function does not match the given information. The number of pollen grains per square centimeter does not decrease exponentially with time.

Option D: $P(t)=310(1.01)^{t}$

This function matches the given information. The number of pollen grains per square centimeter increases by $1\%$ each year after the first year.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

Action: Answer("B")
