Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and after reviewing the problem, my solution, and the correct answer, I realize that I made a mistake. Here is my reflection:

I mistakenly assumed that the statement "No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day" meant that each kind of cookie had its own exclusive day of production. However, the statement actually means that no two batches of the same kind of cookie can be made on the same day, regardless of the day of the week.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) At least two batches of cookies are made on Monday. Since at least one batch of each kind of cookie is made on Monday, and there are three kinds of cookies, it follows that at least two batches of cookies are made on Monday.

Action: Answer("C")
