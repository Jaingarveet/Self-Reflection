## Assistant 2:
  Topic: Law
Question: If Jackson is scheduled to testify on Wednesday, which one of the following must be true of the schedule?

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand the mistake. Here is my reflection on the problem, my solution, and the correct answer:

Problem:
The schedule must meet the following conditions: Franco does not testify on the same day that Garcia testifies. Iturbe testifies on Wednesday. Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday. Hong does not testify on Monday. At least one witness testifies on Monday.

Solution:
I mistakenly chose option A, which states that Franco is scheduled to testify on Monday. However, since Franco does not testify on the same day as Garcia, Franco cannot testify on Monday. Therefore, option A is incorrect.

Correct Answer:
The correct answer is option C, which states that exactly one witness is scheduled to testify on Monday. Since Hong does not testify on Monday, and at least one witness must testify on Monday, exactly one witness must testify on Monday.
