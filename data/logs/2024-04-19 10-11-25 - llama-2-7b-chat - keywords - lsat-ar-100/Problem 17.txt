  Thought:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand the mistake. Let me re-evaluate the problem and find the correct answer.

The given conditions are:

1. Greyhounds are featured on day 1.
2. No breed is featured on any two consecutive days.
3. Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.
4. Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.

From condition 1, we know that Greyhounds are featured on day 1.
From condition 2, we know that no breed is featured on any two consecutive days.
From condition 3, we know that Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.
From condition 4, we know that Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.

Now, let's analyze the possible pairs of days that can feature the same breed of kitten and the same breed of puppy:

A: day 1 and day 3 - This pair cannot feature both the same breed of kitten and the same breed of puppy, as Himalayans are featured on day 3 but not on day 1. [REDACTED]
B: day 2 and day 6 - This pair cannot feature both the same breed of kitten and the same breed of puppy, as Himalayans are featured on day 6 but not on day 2. [REDACTED]
C: day 3 and day 5 - This pair cannot feature both the same breed of kitten and the same breed of puppy, as Himalayans are featured on day 5 but not on day 3. [REDACTED]
D: day 4 and day 6 - This pair cannot feature both the same breed of kitten and the same breed of puppy, as Himalayans are featured on day 6 but not on day 4. [REDACTED]
E: day 5 and day 7 - This pair cannot feature both the same breed of kitten and the same breed of puppy, as Himalayans are not featured on day 7. [REDACTED]

Therefore, the correct answer is (A): day 1 and day 3.
