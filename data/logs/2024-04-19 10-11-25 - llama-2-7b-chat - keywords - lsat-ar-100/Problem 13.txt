## Assistant 2:
  Topic: Law
Question: If Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong, which one of the following must be true of the schedule?

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand the mistake. Here's my reflection on the problem, my solution, and the correct answer:

Problem:
The schedule must meet the following conditions: Franco does not testify on the same day as Garcia, Iturbe testifies on Wednesday, exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday, Hong does not testify on Monday, and at least one witness testifies on Monday.

Solution:
I mistakenly assumed that Franco could testify on Wednesday, which violates the condition that Franco does not testify on the same day as Garcia. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) Garcia is scheduled to testify on Monday.

Correct Answer: (B) Garcia is scheduled to testify on Monday.

Explanation:
The schedule must meet the conditions given in the problem. Since Franco does not testify on the same day as Garcia, Garcia must testify on Monday. Additionally, since Iturbe testifies on Wednesday, exactly two witnesses must testify on Tuesday, and Hong does not testify on Monday, Garcia's testimony on Monday is the only option. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) Garcia is scheduled to testify on Monday.
