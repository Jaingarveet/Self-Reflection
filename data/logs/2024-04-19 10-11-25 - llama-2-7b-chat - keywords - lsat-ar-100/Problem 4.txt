## Assistant 2:
  Thought: 
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand the constraints given in the problem.

Action: Review the problem and my previous answer.

Reflection:
I see that I mistakenly assigned Kevin to lead a session on Wednesday, which is not possible since Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions on the same day, and Wednesday is not the same day as Thursday or Friday.

To solve the problem, I will assign Lan to lead a Thursday session, as she cannot lead a session on Wednesday.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) Olivia.

Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: E
Score: 0
