I previously answered this question incorrectly, and upon reflection, I realize that I misinterpreted the problem. I thought the order of the bays was from one end of the dock to the other, but it is actually from one side of the dock to the other.
Action: Answer("C")
Explanation:
The bay holding livestock is bay 3, as it has a higher number than the bay holding textiles (bay 6).

Reflection:
I should have paid closer attention to the problem statement and the numbering of the bays. My mistake in interpreting the problem led me to choose the incorrect answer. I will make sure to be more careful in the future.
