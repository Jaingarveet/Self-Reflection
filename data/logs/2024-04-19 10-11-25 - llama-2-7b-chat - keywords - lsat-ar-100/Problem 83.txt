## Assistant 2:
  Thought: 
I previously answered this question by assuming that Julio and Kevin both lead morning sessions, which led to an incorrect conclusion. I realized my mistake and reflected on the problem to identify the correct solution.

Action: Answer("D")

Reflection:
To solve this problem, I analyzed the constraints given in the question:

1. Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
2. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
3. Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
4. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.

From these constraints, I deduced that if Julio and Kevin both lead morning sessions, then Olivia's session must meet on a later day than Julio's session. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) Olivia's session meets Friday morning.

I made a mistake in my initial answer by not considering the constraint that Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's. I should have realized that if Julio and Kevin both lead morning sessions, then Olivia's session would meet on a later day, which is (D) Friday morning.

I hope this reflection helps me to accurately answer the question this time.
