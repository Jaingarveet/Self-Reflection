Question: Alan drives an average of 100 miles each week. His car can travel an average of 25 miles per gallon of gasoline. Alan would like to reduce his weekly expenditure on gasoline by $\$ 5$. Assuming gasoline costs $\$ 4$ per gallon, which equation can Alan use to determine how many fewer average miles, $m$, he should drive each week?
Choices:
  A: $\frac{25}{4} m=95$
  B: $\frac{25}{4} m=5$
  C: $\frac{4}{25} m=95$
  D: $\frac{4}{25} m=5$

## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Alan wants to reduce his weekly expenditure on gasoline by $5. Since gasoline costs $4 per gallon, this means he wants to use 5/4 = 1.25 gallons less gasoline each week. Since his car can travel 25 miles per gallon, this means he wants to drive 1.25 * 25 = 31.25 miles less each week. So, he needs to find the number of miles, m, such that 4/25 * m = 31.25. Therefore, the correct equation is 4/25 * m = 5.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
