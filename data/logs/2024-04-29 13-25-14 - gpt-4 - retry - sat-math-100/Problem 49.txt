## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The equation is a rational equation, and it can be solved by cross-multiplication. 
Cross-multiplication gives us: 
24x^2 + 25x - 47 = -8x - 3(ax - 2) - 53
Solving this equation gives us: 
24x^2 + 25x - 47 = -8x - 3ax + 6 - 53
Simplifying the equation gives us: 
24x^2 + 33x + 47 = -3ax
Setting the coefficients equal to each other gives us: 
24 = -3a
33 = 0
47 = 0
Solving for a gives us: 
a = -24/3 = -8
However, -8 is not one of the options. This means that I made a mistake in my calculations. Let's try again.
The equation is a rational equation, and it can be solved by cross-multiplication. 
Cross-multiplication gives us: 
24x^2 + 25x - 47 = -8x(ax - 2) - 3
Solving this equation gives us: 
24x^2 + 25x - 47 = -8ax^2 + 16x - 3
Setting the coefficients equal to each other gives us: 
24 = -8a
25 = 16
-47 = -3
Solving for a gives us: 
a = 24/-8 = -3
So, the correct answer is -3.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
