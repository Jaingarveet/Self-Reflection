## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The equation $(a x+2)(b x+7)=15 x^{2}+c x+14$ can be expanded to $abx^2 + (7a+2b)x + 14 = 15x^2 + cx + 14$. 
Since the equation holds for all values of x, the coefficients on the left must equal the coefficients on the right. 
So, $ab = 15$ and $7a+2b = c$. 
We also know that $a+b = 8$. 
We can solve these equations to find the possible values of c. 
If we solve $ab = 15$ and $a+b = 8$ for a and b, we get two pairs of solutions: (a,b) = (3,5) or (5,3). 
Substituting these into the equation $7a+2b = c$ gives c = 21 or 31. 
Action: Answer("D")
