## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) We are given the equation $3x - y = 12$
2) We want to find the value of $\frac{8^x}{2^y}$
3) Let's rewrite 8 and 2 in terms of the same base:
   
   $8 = 2^3$
   
   So $\frac{8^x}{2^y} = \frac{(2^3)^x}{2^y} = \frac{2^{3x}}{2^y} = 2^{3x-y}$
4) From the given equation in step 1, we know that $3x - y = 12$
5) Substituting this into the expression from step 3:
   $2^{3x-y} = 2^{12}$
Therefore, the value of $\frac{8^x}{2^y}$ is $2^{12}$.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
