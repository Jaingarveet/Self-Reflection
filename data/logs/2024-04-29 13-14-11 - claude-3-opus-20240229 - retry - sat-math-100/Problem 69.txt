Question: Alan drives an average of 100 miles each week. His car can travel an average of 25 miles per gallon of gasoline. Alan would like to reduce his weekly expenditure on gasoline by $\$ 5$. Assuming gasoline costs $\$ 4$ per gallon, which equation can Alan use to determine how many fewer average miles, $m$, he should drive each week?
Choices:
  A: $\frac{25}{4} m=95$
  B: $\frac{25}{4} m=5$
  C: $\frac{4}{25} m=95$
  D: $\frac{4}{25} m=5$

## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) Alan currently drives 100 miles per week on average. His car gets 25 miles per gallon.
2) To calculate his current weekly gas cost:
   Gallons used per week = 100 miles ÷ 25 miles/gallon = 4 gallons
   Cost per week = 4 gallons × $4/gallon = $16
3) Alan wants to reduce his weekly gas cost by $5. So his new weekly cost should be:
   New cost per week = $16 - $5 = $11
4) Let's say the reduced number of miles driven per week is m. We can set up an equation:
   New cost = (miles driven ÷ miles per gallon) × cost per gallon
   $11 = (m ÷ 25) × $4
5) Simplify:
   $11 = (4m ÷ 25)
   25 × $11 = 4m
   $275 = 4m
   m = $275 ÷ 4
   m = 68.75 miles
6) The equation that matches this setup is:
   (4 ÷ 25) × m = 5
   Rearranging: (4 ÷ 25)m = 5
Therefore, the correct answer is D: $\frac{4}{25} m=5$
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
