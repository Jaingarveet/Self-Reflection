## User 2:
Topic: Logic
Context: Right and wrong and whether they violate the rules are two things.There may be regulations that prohibit things that are not wrong in themselves, such as laws in certain countries that prohibit criticism of the government; there may also be regulations that require things that are inherently wrong, such as laws that require apartheid in public places.And, like evaluating behavior, we can also evaluate some of the prescribed right and wrong.
Question: Which of the following does not weaken, but supports the argument in the question stem?
Choices:
  A: If we do not follow some pre-existing regulations or standards, how can we judge right and wrong?
  B: "People are doing, heaven is watching." Failure to act in accordance with ethical regulations will incur punishment from heaven.
  C: Behind the judgment of right and wrong, you can always find the rules or standards on which people judge.
  D: The basis for judgment of right and wrong lies in pushing oneself and one's moral conscience.It is common and universal; however, the moral regulations on how to act for people vary from person to person and from place to place.

Explanation:
I misinterpreted the relationship between the argument and the options. 
I focused too narrowly on the connection between rules and judgments, neglecting the broader context of moral relativity and individual conscience.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The argument in the question stem discusses the relationship between right and wrong and the rules that govern them. It highlights that while there may be discrepancies between what is legally prohibited or required and what is morally right or wrong, there is often a connection between judgments of right and wrong and underlying rules or standards.

Option C directly supports this argument by stating that behind judgments of right and wrong, there are always rules or standards that people use to make those judgments. This reinforces the idea that rules and standards play a significant role in shaping our moral judgments.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

C: Behind the judgment of right and wrong, you can always find the rules or standards on which people judge.

My previous mistake was focusing too narrowly on the idea that rules and judgments are separate entities, neglecting the interplay between them and the broader context of moral relativity and individual conscience.

Action: Answer("C")
