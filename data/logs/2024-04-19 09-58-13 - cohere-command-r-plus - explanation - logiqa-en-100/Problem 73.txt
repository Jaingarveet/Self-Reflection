Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I misinterpreted condition (2) to mean that K must always be in the middle position, but this condition is only valid if K is chosen to play. 
I overlooked the possibility that K might not be selected at all, which would render this condition irrelevant. 
Additionally, I incorrectly assumed that N and Q could not be in Team 1 due to conditions (1) and (6), but these conditions pertain specifically to their positions on Team 2.
## Assistant 2:
Reflection: I understand that G must be in the front position if they are chosen to play. With G in the front of Team 1, condition (4) ensures that N must be in Team 1 as well, occupying either the middle or back position. Condition (3) places L in Team 1 as well. This leaves only one remaining spot in Team 1, which can be filled by either Q or K, as there are no conditions restricting their placement in this scenario. Therefore, the correct answer is [CHOICE].
Action: Answer("C")
