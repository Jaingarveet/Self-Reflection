## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The percentages given for physics and math students don't overlap, meaning no student takes both. So, 48% of the students take either physics or math. 
To find the least possible number of students, we need a number slightly greater than 501 that is divisible by 48 (or where 48% represents a whole number).
Action: Answer("C") 
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: E
Score: 0
