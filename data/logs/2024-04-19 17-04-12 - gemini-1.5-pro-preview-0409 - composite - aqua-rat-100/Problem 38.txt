## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The total number of small cubes is 125.
The number of cubes with 0 faces painted (inner cubes) is calculated as (5-2)^3 = 27.
The number of cubes with 1 face painted (center cubes on each face) is calculated as 6 * (5-2)^2 = 54.
The number of cubes with 2 faces painted (cubes on the edges) is calculated as 12 * (5-2) = 36.
The number of cubes with 3 faces painted (corner cubes) is 8.
Therefore, the number of cubes with at least one face painted is 27 + 54 + 36 + 8 = 125.
So, the number of cubes with no faces painted is 125 (total cubes) - 125 (painted cubes) = 0.
Action: Answer("A")
