## Assistant 2:
Thought:
I will analyze the ratios of falafel quantities in different bread types.
* 6 pitas = 2 rolls
* 3 rolls = 5 baguettes
I need to find the equivalent of 2 baguettes in pitas.
Combining the ratios:
* 6 pitas = 2 rolls = (2/3) * 5 baguettes = 10/3 baguettes
Therefore, 1 baguette = (3/10) * 6 pitas = 9/5 pitas
So, 2 baguettes = 2 * (9/5) pitas = 18/5 pitas
Action: Answer("E")
