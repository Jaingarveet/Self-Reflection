## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The amount of zinc in alloy X is 40 * (6/15) = 16 grams.
The amount of zinc in alloy Y is 60 * (7/18) = 70/3 grams.
The total amount of zinc in alloy Z is 16 + 70/3 = 118/3 grams.
The amount of copper in alloy X is 40 * (9/15) = 24 grams.
The amount of copper in alloy Y is 60 * (11/18) = 110/3 grams.
The total amount of copper in alloy Z is 24 + 110/3 = 182/3 grams.
The ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z is (118/3) / (182/3) = 59/91.
Action: Answer("D") 
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: B
