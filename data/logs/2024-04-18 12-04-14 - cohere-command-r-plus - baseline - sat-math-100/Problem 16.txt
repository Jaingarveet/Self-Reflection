## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: The line $y=k x+4$, where $k$ is a constant, is graphed in the $x y$-plane. If the line contains the point $(c, d)$, where $c \neq 0$ and $d \neq 0$, what is the slope of the line in terms of $c$ and $d$ ?
Choices:
  A: $\frac{d-4}{c}$
  B: $\frac{c-4}{d}$
  C: $\frac{4-d}{c}$
  D: $\frac{4-c}{d}$
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The slope of a line is given by the formula $y-y_1=mx$ or $y=mx+b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the $y$-intercept.
Comparing the equation of the line with the standard form, we can identify that $k$ is the slope ($m$) and 4 is the $y$-intercept ($b$).

Now, we know that the point $(c, d)$ also lies on this line. We can use the slope formula to find the value of $k$ in terms of $c$ and $d$.

$y - y_1 = mx$
$d - 4 = kc$
$k = \frac{d - 4}{c}$

So, the slope of the line is $\frac{d-4}{c}$.
Action: Answer("A")
