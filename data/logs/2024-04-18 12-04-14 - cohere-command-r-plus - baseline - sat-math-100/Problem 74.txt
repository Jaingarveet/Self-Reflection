## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: If $x>3$, which of the following is equivalent to $\frac{1}{\frac{1}{x+2}+\frac{1}{x+3}}$ ?
Choices:
  A: $\frac{2 x+5}{x^{2}+5 x+6}$
  B: $\frac{x^{2}+5 x+6}{2 x+5}$
  C: $2 x+5$
  D: $x^{2}+5 x+6$
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
First, we can rationalize the denominator of the fraction by multiplying both the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator:
$\frac{1}{\frac{1}{x+2}+\frac{1}{x+3}} \cdot \frac{(x+2)(x+3)}{(x+2)(x+3)} = \frac{(x+2)(x+3)}{(x+2)+(x+3)} = \frac{(x+2)(x+3)}{2 x+5}$.

Then, we multiply the numerator and denominator by $2x+5$:
$\frac{(x+2)(x+3)}{2 x+5} \cdot \frac{2x+5}{2x+5} = \frac{(x+2)(x+3)(2x+5)}{(2x+5)^2}$.

Simplifying the numerator, we get:
$(x+2)(x+3)(2x+5) = 2x^3 + 13x^2 + 26x + 30$.

Simplifying the denominator, we get:
$(2x+5)^2 = 4x^2 + 20x + 25$.

So, the simplified fraction is:
$\frac{2x^3 + 13x^2 + 26x + 30}{4x^2 + 20x + 25}$.

This matches the numerator of choice A, $\frac{2x+5}{x^2+5x+6}$.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
