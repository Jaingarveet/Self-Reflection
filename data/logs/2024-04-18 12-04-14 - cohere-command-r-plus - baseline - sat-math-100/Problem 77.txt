# Model: cohere-command-r-plus | Agent: baseline | Exam: sat-math-100 | Problem 77 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:
Topic: Geography
Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: \begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}\hlineList A & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 \\\hlineList B & 2 & 3 & 3 & 4 & 4 & 5 \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}The table above shows two lists of numbers. Which of the following is a true statement comparing list $\mathrm{A}$ and list B ?
Choices:
  A: The means are the same, and the standard deviations are different.
  B: The means are the same, and the standard deviations are the same.
  C: The means are different, and the standard deviations are different.
  D: The means are different, and the standard deviations are the same.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The mean of list A is $(1+2+3+4+5+6)/6 = 3$
The mean of list B is $(2+3+3+4+4+5)/6 = 3.5$

The standard deviation of list A is $\sigma_A = \sqrt{\frac{(1-3)^2 + (2-3)^2 + (3-3)^2 + (4-3)^2 + (5-3)^2 + (6-3)^2}{6}} \approx 2.08$
The standard deviation of list B is $\sigma_B = \sqrt{\frac{(2-3)^2 + (3-3)^2 + (3-3)^2 + (4-3)^2 + (4-3)^2 + (5-3)^2}{6}} \approx 0.58$

Therefore, the means are different, and the standard deviations are different.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
