Question: Mr. Kohl has a beaker containing $n$ milliliters of solution to distribute to the students in his chemistry class. If he gives each student 3 milliliters of solution, he will have 5 milliliters left over. In order to give each student 4 milliliters of solution, he will need an additional 21 milliliters. How many students are in the class?
Choices:
  A: 16
  B: 21
  C: 23
  D: 26
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
3x + 5 = n (where x is the number of students)
4x + 5 = n + 21

Subtract the first equation from the second to get:
x = 16

So, there are 16 students in the class.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
