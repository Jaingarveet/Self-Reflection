Question: A television with a price of $\$ 300$ is to be purchased with an initial payment of $\$ 60$ and weekly payments of $\$ 30$. Which of the following equations can be used to find the number of weekly payments, $w$, required to complete the purchase, assuming there are no taxes or fees?
Choices:
  A: $300=30 w-60$
  B: $300=30 w$
  C: $300=30 w+60$
  D: $300=60 w-30$
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The total cost of the television ($300) is the sum of the initial payment ($60) and the weekly payments ($30$) multiplied by the number of weeks ($w$).

$300 = 60 + 30w$

Simplifying the equation:
$240 = 30w$

And then dividing by $30$:
$w = 8$

So, the number of weekly payments required to complete the purchase is 8.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: C
