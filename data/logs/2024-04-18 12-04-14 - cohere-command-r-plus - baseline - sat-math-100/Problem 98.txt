# Model: cohere-command-r-plus | Agent: baseline | Exam: sat-math-100 | Problem 98 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:
Topic: Geography
Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: $$\begin{array}{r}3 x+4 y=-23 \\2 y-x=-19\end{array}$$What is the solution $(x, y)$ to the system of equations above?
Choices:
  A: $(-5,-2)$
  B: $(3,-8)$
  C: $(4,-6)$
  D: $(9,-6)$
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
We can solve this system of equations using elimination. First, let's multiply the first equation by 2 and the second equation by 4 to get rid of the fractions:
$\begin{array}{r}
6x + 8y = -46 \\
8y - 4x = -76
\end{array}$

Now, add the two equations together:
$6x + 8y + 8y - 4x = -46 - 76$
This simplifies to:
$14y = -122$

Dividing by 14, we get:
$y = -\frac{122}{14} = -\frac{61}{7}$

Now that we have the value of $y$, we can plug it into either equation to solve for $x$. Let's use the first equation:
$3x + 4y = -23$
$3x + 4\left(-\frac{61}{7}\right) = -23$
$3x - \frac{244}{7} = -23$

Now, add 244/7 to both sides and multiply by 7/3:
$3x = -23 + \frac{244}{7}$
$3x = \frac{-161 + 244}{7}$
$3x = \frac{83}{7}$
$x = \frac{83}{21}$

So, the solution to the system of equations is $(x, y) = \left(\frac{83}{21}, -\frac{61}{7}\right)$. 

This can be written as a fraction, but it doesn't match any of the provided options. We can write it as a decimal approximation:
$x \approx 3.952$, $y \approx -8.714$

Choice D is the closest to this approximation.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
