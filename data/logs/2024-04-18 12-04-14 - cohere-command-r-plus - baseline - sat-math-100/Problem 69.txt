## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.

Question: Alan drives an average of 100 miles each week. His car can travel an average of 25 miles per gallon of gasoline. Alan would like to reduce his weekly expenditure on gasoline by $\$ 5$. Assuming gasoline costs $\$ 4$ per gallon, which equation can Alan use to determine how many fewer average miles, $m$, he should drive each week?
Choices:
  A: $\frac{25}{4} m=95$
  B: $\frac{25}{4} m=5$
  C: $\frac{4}{25} m=95$
  D: $\frac{4}{25} m=5$
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Alan wants to save $\$5$ on gasoline, and gasoline costs $\$4$ per gallon. 
So, he wants to buy $5/4 = 1.25$ fewer gallons of gasoline.
Currently, he buys enough gasoline to drive 100 miles, which means he currently buys $100 / 25 = 4$ gallons of gasoline.
So, he now wants to buy $4 - 1.25 = 2.75$ gallons of gasoline.
This amount will allow him to drive $2.75 \times 25 = 68.75$ miles, or $100 - 68.75 = 31.25$ fewer miles.
Thus, $31.25$ fewer miles will cost $\$5$ less for gasoline, giving us the equation $25m / 4 = 5$, where $m$ is the number of miles.
Action: Answer("B")
