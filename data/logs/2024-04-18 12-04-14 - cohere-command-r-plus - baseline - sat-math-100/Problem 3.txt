## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: If $\frac{3}{5} w=\frac{4}{3}$, what is the value of $w ?$
Choices:
  A: $\frac{9}{20}$
  B: $\frac{4}{5}$
  C: $\frac{5}{4}$
  D: $\frac{20}{9}$
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
We are given $\frac{3}{5} w=\frac{4}{3}$.
To solve for $w$, we multiply both sides of the equation by $\frac{5}{3}$:
$$w = \frac{20}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{4} = \frac{5}{6}.$$
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
