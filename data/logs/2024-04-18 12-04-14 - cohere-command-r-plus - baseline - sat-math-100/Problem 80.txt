## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:

Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: $$\begin{aligned}& k x-3 y=4 \\& 4 x-5 y=7\end{aligned}$$In the system of equations above, $k$ is a constant and $x$ and $y$ are variables. For what value of $k$ will the system of equations have no solution?
Choices:
  A: $\frac{12}{5}$
  B: $\frac{16}{7}$
  C: $-\frac{16}{7}$
  D: $-\frac{12}{5}$
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
To find the value of $k$ for which the system has no solution, we can solve the equations using elimination or substitution.

Eliminating $y$ by multiplying the first equation by 5 and the second equation by 3 and then subtracting:
$$
\begin{aligned}
(k x-3 y) \times 5 &= 4 \times 5 \\
5 k x-15 y &= 20
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
(4 x-5 y) \times 3 &= 7 \times 3 \\
12 x-15 y &= 21
\end{aligned}
$$

Subtracting the two equations:
$$
\begin{aligned}
5 k x-12 x &= 20-21 \\
5 k x-12 x &= -1
\end{aligned}
$$

Simplifying:
$$
\begin{aligned}
(5 k-12) x &= -1 \\
5 k-12 &= \frac{-1}{x}
\end{aligned}
$$

This equation must be true for any value of $x$, so we set the coefficient of $x$ equal to zero:
$$
5 k-12 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad k = \frac{12}{5}
$$

Action: Answer("A")
