Question: Shipping Charges\begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}\hline$\begin{array}{c}\text { Merchandise weight } \\ \text { (pounds) }\end{array}$ & $\begin{array}{c}\text { Shipping } \\ \text { charge }\end{array}$ \\\hline5 & $\$ 16.94$ \\\hline10 & $\$ 21.89$ \\\hline20 & $\$ 31.79$ \\\hline40 & $\$ 51.59$ \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}The table above shows shipping charges for an online retailer that sells sporting goods. There is a linear relationship between the shipping charge and the weight of the merchandise. Which function can be used to determine the total shipping charge $f(x)$, in dollars, for an order with a merchandise weight of $x$ pounds?
Choices:
  A: $f(x)=0.99 x$
  B: $f(x)=0.99 x+11.99$
  C: $f(x)=3.39 x$
  D: $f(x)=3.39 x+16.94$
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The table shows a linear relationship between merchandise weight and shipping charge.

To find the function, we can use the information given for two data points:

When $x = 5$ pounds, $f(x) = \$16.94$
When $x = 10$ pounds, $f(x) = \$21.89$

We can now set up a system of equations:
$f(5) = 0.99 \cdot 5 + b = 16.94$
$f(10) = 0.99 \cdot 10 + b = 21.89$

Solving for $b$, we get $b = \$11.99$. 

So, the function is $f(x) = 0.99x + 11.99$.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
