## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: For a polynomial $p(x)$, the value of $p(3)$ is -2 .Which of the following must be true about $p(x)$ ?
Choices:
  A: $x-5$ is a factor of $p(x)$.
  B: $x-2$ is a factor of $p(x)$.
  C: $x+2$ is a factor of $p(x)$.
  D: The remainder when $p(x)$ is divided by $x-3$ is -2 .
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Given $p(3) = -2$, we can plug in $x = 3$ to each answer choice to see which one equals -2 when $x = 3$.

Plugging into choice A, we get $3 - 5 = -2$.

Therefore, choice A is correct.

Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
