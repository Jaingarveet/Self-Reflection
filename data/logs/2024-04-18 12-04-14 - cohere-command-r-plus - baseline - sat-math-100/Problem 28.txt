Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: $$\frac{x^{2}-1}{x-1}=-2$$What are all values of $x$ that satisfy the equation above?
Choices:
  A: -3
  B: 0
  C: 1
  D: -3 and -1
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
$$\frac{x^{2}-1}{x-1}=-2$$

First, multiply both sides by $(x-1)$ to get
$$x^2 - 1 = -2(x-1)$$

Then, expand and simplify to get
$$x^2 - 1 = -2x + 2$$
$$x^2 + 2x - 3 = 0$$

We can factor the quadratic to get
$$(x+3)(x-1) = 0$$

Solving for $x$, we find $x = -3$ or $x = 1$.
Action: Answer("A,C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
