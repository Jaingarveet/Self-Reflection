Question: A book was on sale for $40 \%$ off its original price. If the sale price of the book was $\$ 18.00$, what was the original price of the book? (Assume there is no sales tax.)
Choices:
  A: $\$ 7.20$
  B: $\$ 10.80$
  C: $\$ 30.00$
  D: $\$ 45.00$
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Given the sale price $S = \$18.00$ and the discount $D = 40\%$, we can calculate the original price $O$ using the equation:
$O = S \div (1 - D/100)$.
Plugging in the values, we get:
$O = 18.00 \div (1 - 0.40) = \$30.00$.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
