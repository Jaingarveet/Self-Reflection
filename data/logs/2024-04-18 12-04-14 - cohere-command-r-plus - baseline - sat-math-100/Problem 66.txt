## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: In the $x y$-plane, the graph of the function $f(x)=x^{2}+5 x+4$ has two $x$-intercepts. What is the distance between the $x$-intercepts?
Choices:
  A: 1
  B: 2
  C: 3
  D: 4
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The function $f(x) = x^2 + 5x + 4$ is a quadratic function. The $x$-intercepts occur when $f(x) = 0$, which gives the quadratic equation $x^2 + 5x + 4 = 0$.

Using the quadratic formula ($x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$) to solve for the roots, we find:

\[
x = \frac{-5 \pm \sqrt{5^2 - 4(1)(4)}}{2} = \frac{-5 \pm 3}{2}.
\]

So, the $x$-intercepts are at $x = \frac{-5 + 3}{2} = -1$ and $x = \frac{-5 - 3}{2} = -4$.

The distance between these two points is $|{-1} - ({-4})| = 3$.

Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
