# Model: cohere-command-r-plus | Agent: baseline | Exam: sat-math-100 | Problem 43 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: $$\frac{2}{3}(9 x-6)-4=9 x-6$$Based on the equation above, what is the value of $3 x-2$ ?
Choices:
  A: -4
  B: $-\frac{4}{5}$
  C: $-\frac{2}{3}$
  D: 4
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
First, isolate the term with the variable by subtracting $9x - 6$ from both sides:
$$\frac{2}{3}(9x - 6) - 4 = 0$$

Then, multiply both sides by $\frac{3}{2}$ to get rid of the fraction:
$$\frac{3}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{3}(9x - 6) - \frac{3}{2} \cdot 4 = \frac{3}{2} \cdot 0$$
Simplifying gives:
$$3(9x - 6) - 6 = 0$$

Now, distribute the $3$ on the left side:
$$27x - 18 - 6 = 0$$
$$27x - 24 = 0$$

Finally, isolate $x$ by adding $24$ to both sides:
$$27x = 24$$
$$x = \frac{24}{27} = \frac{8}{9}$$

Plugging this value into the expression $3x - 2$, we get:
$$3 \left(\frac{8}{9}\right) - 2$$
which simplifies to:
$$\frac{24}{9} - 2 = \frac{8}{3} - 2 = -\frac{4}{3}$$

So, the value of $3x - 2$ is $-\frac{4}{3}$.
Action: Answer("B")
