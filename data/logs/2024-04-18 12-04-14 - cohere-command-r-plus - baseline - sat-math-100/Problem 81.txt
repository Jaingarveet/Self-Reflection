Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: If $a^{2}+b^{2}=z$ and $a b=y$, which of the following is equivalent to $4 z+8 y$ ?
Choices:
  A: $(a+2 b)^{2}$
  B: $(2 a+2 b)^{2}$
  C: $(4 a+4 b)^{2}$
  D: $(4 a+8 b)^{2}$
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Expanding the choices gives:
A: $a^2 + 4ab + 4b^2$
B: $4a^2 + 4ab + 4b^2$
C: $16a^2 + 16ab + 16b^2$
D: $16a^2 + 64ab + 64b^2$

Substituting the values of $a^2 + b^2$ and $ab$ gives:
A: $z + 4y$
B: $4z + 4y$
C: $16z + 16y$
D: $16z + 64y$

Matching the coefficient of $z$ and $y$ gives the correct answer of $16z + 64y$, which is choice D.

Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
