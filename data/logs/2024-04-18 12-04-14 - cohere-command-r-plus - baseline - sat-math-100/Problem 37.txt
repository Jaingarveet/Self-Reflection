## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: The volume of right circular cylinder A is 22 cubic centimeters. What is the volume, in cubic centimeters, of a right circular cylinder with twice the radius and half the height of cylinder A?
Choices:
  A: 11
  B: 22
  C: 44
  D: 66
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The volume of a cylinder is given by the formula: V = π * r^2 * h

Given that the volume of cylinder A is 22 cm^3, we can substitute this value into the formula:
22 = π * r^1^2 * h^1

Now, for cylinder B (with twice the radius and half the height):
r^2 = (2 * r^1)^2 = 4 * r^1^2
h^2 = h^1 / 2

Substitute these values into the formula for cylinder B:
V_B = π * (4 * r^1^2) * (h^1 / 2)

Simplify:
V_B = 2 * π * r^1^2 * h^1

Substitute the value of V_A:
V_B = 2 * 22
V_B = 44
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
