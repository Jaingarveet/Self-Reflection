## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:
Topic: Geography
Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: A line in the $x y$-plane passes through the origin and has a slope of $\frac{1}{7}$. Which of the following points lies on the line?
Choices:
  A: $(0,7)$
  B: $(1,7)$
  C: $(7,7)$
  D: $(14,2)$
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The line passes through the origin (0,0), and we are given the slope (rise/run) as $\frac{1}{7}$.
We can use the point-slope formula to find another point on the line:
$y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$
Plugging in $m = \frac{1}{7}$ and $(x_1, y_1) = (0,0)$, we get:
$y = \frac{1}{7}x$
Testing the choices:
- A: (0,7): $y$ does not equal $\frac{1}{7}x$
- B: (1,7): $y$ does not equal $\frac{1}{7}x$
- C: (7,7): $y$ equals $\frac{1}{7}x$
- D: (14,2): $y$ does not equal $\frac{1}{7}x$

Therefore, choice C is the correct answer.

Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
