## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: $$\sqrt{k+2}-x=0$$In the equation above, $k$ is a constant. If $x=9$, what is the value of $k$ ?
Choices:
  A: 1
  B: 7
  C: 16
  D: 79
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Given that $x = 9$, we can substitute this into the equation to get:
$$\sqrt{k+2}-9=0$$

Now, isolate the square root by adding 9 to both sides:
$$\sqrt{k+2}=9$$

Square both sides to eliminate the square root:
$$k + 2 = 81$$

Subtract 2 from both sides to solve for $k$:
$$k = 79$$

Therefore, the value of $k$ is 79.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
