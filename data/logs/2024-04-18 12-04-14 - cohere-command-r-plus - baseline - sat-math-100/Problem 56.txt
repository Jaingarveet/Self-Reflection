The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: $$g(x)=a x^{2}+24$$For the function $g$ defined above, $a$ is a constant and $g(4)=8$. What is the value of $g(-4)$ ?
Choices:
  A: 8
  B: 0
  C: -1
  D: -8
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
We are given that $g(4)=8$. This can be written as $a \cdot 4^2 + 24 = 8$.
Solving for $a$, we get $a=\frac{8-24}{4^2}=\frac{-16}{16}=-1$.

Therefore, $g(x)=-x^2+24$.
Evaluating $g(-4)$, we get $g(-4)=-(-4)^2+24=-16+24=8$.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
