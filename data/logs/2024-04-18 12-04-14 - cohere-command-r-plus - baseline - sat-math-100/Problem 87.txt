Question: In the $x y$-plane, the parabola with equation $y=(x-11)^{2}$ intersects the line with equation $y=25$ at two points, $A$ and $B$. What is the length of $\overline{A B}$ ?
Choices:
  A: 10
  B: 12
  C: 14
  D: 16
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The parabola and the line intersect at two points, which means they have two coordinates in common.

The equation of the parabola is $y = (x-11)^2$ and the line is $y = 25$. Setting these equal to each other gives:
$(x-11)^2 = 25$
$(x-11)^2 = 5^2$
$x-11 = 5$ or $x-11 = -5$
$x = 16$ or $x = 6$

These $x$-values can be used to find the $y$-coordinates:
When $x = 16$, $y = (16-11)^2 = 25$, and
when $x = 6$, $y = (6-11)^2 = 25$.

So, the two points of intersection are $(16,25)$ and $(6,25)$.

To find the length of the line segment joining these points, we can use the distance formula:
$\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2 + (y_2-y_1)^2}$
$= \sqrt{(16-6)^2 + (25-25)^2}$
$= \sqrt{100} = 10$

Therefore, the length of $\overline{AB} = 10$ units.
