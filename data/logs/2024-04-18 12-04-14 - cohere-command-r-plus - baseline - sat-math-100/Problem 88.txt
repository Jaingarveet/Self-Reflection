Question: $$h=-4.9 t^{2}+25 t$$The equation above expresses the approximate height $h$, in meters, of a ball $t$ seconds after it is launched vertically upward from the ground with an initial velocity of 25 meters per second. After approximately how many seconds will the ball hit the ground?
Choices:
  A: 3.5
  B: 4.0
  C: 4.5
  D: 5.0
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The ball is launched upwards with an initial velocity of 25 m/s, and its height is given by the equation $h=-4.9t^2 + 25t$. To find out when it hits the ground (i.e., when its height is zero), we need to solve for $t$ when $h=0$.

Setting $h=0$, we get:
$0=-4.9t^2 + 25t$

To solve for $t$, we can use the quadratic formula:
$t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$

Plugging in the values:
$t = \frac{-25 \pm \sqrt{25^2 - 4 \cdot -4.9 \cdot 0}}{2 \cdot -4.9}$
$t \approx 3.53$ or $t \approx 1.47$ seconds

Since we're interested in the time it takes for the ball to hit the ground, we ignore the negative value and approximate the answer to the nearest tenth:
$t \approx 3.5$ seconds

Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
