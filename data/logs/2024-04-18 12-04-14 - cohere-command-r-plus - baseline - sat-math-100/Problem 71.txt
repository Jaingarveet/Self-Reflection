Question: Survey Results\begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|l|c|}\hlineAnswer & Percent \\\hlineNever & $31.3 \%$ \\\hlineRarely & $24.3 \%$ \\\hlineOften & $13.5 \%$ \\\hlineAlways & $30.9 \%$ \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}The table above shows the results of a survey in which tablet users were asked how often they would watch video advertisements in order to access streaming content for free. Based on the table, which of the following is closest to the probability that a tablet user answered "Always," given that the tablet user did not answer "Never"?
Choices:
  A: 0.31
  B: 0.38
  C: 0.45

## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The probability of a user answering "Always" is 30.9%, and the probability of not answering "Never" is 100% - 31.3% = 68.7%.
The required probability is (30.9/100) / (68.7/100) = 0.45.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
