Topic: Math
Context: $$.\begin{aligned}.& S(P)=\frac{1}{2} P+40 \\.& D(P)=220-P.\end{aligned}.$$.The quantity of a product supplied and the quantity of the product demanded in an economic market are functions of the price of the product. The functions above are the estimated supply and demand functions for a certain product. The function $S(P)$ gives the quantity of the product supplied to the market when the price is $P$ dollars, and the function $D(P)$ gives the quantity of the product demanded by the market when the price is $P$ dollars.
Question: How will the quantity of the product supplied to the market change if the price of the product is increased by $\$ 10$ ?
Choices:
  A: The quantity supplied will decrease by 5 units.
  B: The quantity supplied will increase by 5 units.
  C: The quantity supplied will increase by 10 units.
  D: The quantity supplied will increase by 50 units.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The supply function is given as: $S(P) = \frac{1}{2}P + 40$.
If the price increases by $10$, the new price is $P + 10$.
The new quantity supplied is: $S(P + 10) = \frac{1}{2}(P + 10) + 40$.
This results in an increase of $5$ units compared to the original supply quantity.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
