## System:
You are an expert in Logic.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:
Topic: Geography
Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Logic
Context: A laboratory has three types of robots, A.B, and C.Type A can recognize colors, type B can recognize shapes, and type C can neither recognize colors nor shapes.The laboratory experimented with robots 1 and 2 with red balls, blue balls, red squares, and blue squares, and ordered them to pick up the red balls, but number 1 picked up the red squares, and number 2 picked up the blue balls.
Question: Based on the above experiment, which of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Both No.1 and No.2 are type C.
  B: Only one of No.1 and No.2 is C type.
  C: No.1 is type A and No.2 is type B.
  D: No.1 is not Type B and No.2 is not Type A.
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and identify the key information.
2. Consider all possible explanations for each robot's behavior.
3. Eliminate robot types that are inconsistent with each robot's behavior.
4. Don't jump to conclusions; consider all possibilities before deciding.
5. Choose the answer that logically follows from the given information.
## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. Robot 1 picked up the red squares instead of the red balls. This means it can recognize color (red) but not shape. So Robot 1 must be Type A.
2. Robot 2 picked up the blue balls instead of the red balls. This means it can recognize shape (balls) but not color. So Robot 2 must be Type B.
3. We can eliminate choices A and B, because we know Robot 1 is Type A and Robot 2 is Type B, so they cannot both be Type C, nor can only one of them be Type C.
4. Choice C directly matches our deductions - Robot 1 is Type A and Robot 2 is Type B. 
5. Choice D is the opposite of what we deduced. We determined Robot 1 is Type A (not B) and Robot 2 is Type B (not A).
Therefore, the answer that logically follows from the given information is C: No.1 is type A and No.2 is type B.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
