You are an expert in Logic.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.

Topic: Logic
Context: Xiao Chen? At present, part of the orbit of Comet 1996D3 is far from the sun, but recently it can be found to emit flickering light through the solar telescope.In the past, people never observed such flashes of comets far away from the sun, so this flicker must be an unusual scene.Xiao Wang? Normally people don't observe comets far away from the sun.The 1996D3 comet flicker light discovered this time was obtained by continuous and careful tracking observation.
Question: Which of the following most accurately summarizes the method Xiao Wang used to refute Xiao Chen's views?
Choices:
  A: Point out that the key concepts used by Xiao Chen are ambiguous.
  B: pointed out that Xiao Chen's argument is clearly lacking in persuasion.
  C: pointed out that Xiao Chen's arguments contradict themselves.
  D: Disagree with Xiao Chen's conclusion, and put forward another explanation for Xiao Chen's argument.E.Agree with Xiao Chen's conclusion, but put forward another explanation for Xiao Chen's argument.
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully, focusing on exactly what is being asked.
2. Identify the key claims and conclusions made by each person. 
3. Analyze how the second person is responding to the first person's argument.
4. Determine if the response is addressing the content of the argument or the method/logic of the argument.
5. Select the answer choice that best describes the method of refutation used, not the content of the refutation.
## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1. Xiao Chen's key claim is that the flickering light from Comet 1996D3 far from the sun must be an unusual occurrence, since people have never observed such flickers from distant comets before.
2. Xiao Wang responds by pointing out that people normally don't observe comets far from the sun at all. The flickering light was only discovered through continuous and careful tracking observations this time.
3. Xiao Wang is not directly disagreeing with Xiao Chen's conclusion that the flicker is unusual. Rather, he is offering an alternative explanation for why it hasn't been observed before - because people don't normally look for or observe distant comets carefully.
4. This is addressing the logic behind Xiao Chen's argument. Xiao Chen assumed the flicker must be unusual since it hasn't been seen before. But Xiao Wang suggests the reason it hasn't been seen is due to a lack of observation, not necessarily because it is unusual.
5. Therefore, the best description of Xiao Wang's refutation is:
Action: Answer("D")
Xiao Wang disagrees with Xiao Chen's conclusion and puts forward another explanation for Xiao Chen's argument - that the flicker hasn't been seen before because distant comets aren't normally observed carefully, not necessarily because the flicker itself is unusual.
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
