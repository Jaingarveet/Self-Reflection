## System:
You are an expert in Logic.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## User 2:
Topic: Logic
Context: The Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge, built in 1968, has a clear height of 24 meters in the Fengshui area.Theoretically, it can pass a maximum of 3,000 tons of ships.Today, with the rapid economic development, it has become a building that “cuts the waist” of the Yangtze River waterway and hinders the passage of giant ships.A bridge expert asserted that the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge must be demolished and rebuilt in order to dredge the golden waterways of the Yangtze River completely.
Question: If any of the following is true, can you raise the most doubts about this expert's point of view?
Choices:
  A: Due to the inability of large ships to pass through the Nanjing Bridge, a large number of exported goods in the middle and upper reaches of the Yangtze River can only be taken by road or railway.
  B: 99% of international ships entering the Yangtze River are moored at ports below the Nanjing Bridge, and dozens of foreign trade terminals above Nanjing rarely have large external ships berthed.
  C: It is not enough to dismantle only the Nanjing Bridge.The Yangtze River Bridge, which was built in Wuhu, Tongling, Anqing and other places, has a clear height of 24 meters.
  D: Shipbuilding technology is highly developed, and 8000-ton ships designed for adapting to the passage of the Yangtze River abroad have passed through Nanjing to Wuhan.
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Read the question and expert's claim carefully.
2. For each answer choice, determine if it supports, opposes, or is irrelevant to the expert's view.
3. Look for choices that provide direct evidence contradicting a key part of the expert's assertion.
4. Avoid choices that seem relevant but don't actually disprove the main claim.
5. Avoid focusing only on choices that confirm your initial thoughts.
6. Select the choice that most strongly calls the expert's conclusion into question.
## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
The expert's main assertion is that the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge must be demolished and rebuilt in order to allow giant ships to pass through and fully open up the Yangtze River waterways.
Looking at each choice:
A) This supports the expert's view by indicating the bridge is preventing large ships from passing through, forcing alternate transport. It does not raise doubts.
B) This suggests that 99% of large international ships don't go past Nanjing anyway, with ports rarely having large ships above the bridge. If true, it calls into question the need to demolish the bridge for giant ships. 
C) This is somewhat relevant in suggesting other bridges would also need demolishing, but doesn't directly oppose the main assertion about the Nanjing bridge.
D) This indicates some large 8000-ton ships have been able to pass through the bridge to reach Wuhan. If such giant ships can already get through, it raises doubts about demolishing the bridge to enable their passage.
Reflecting on it, B and D provide the strongest evidence against the expert's claim, by suggesting either:
1) Giant international ships rarely go that far up the Yangtze anyway (B), or 
2) Some giant ships can already pass through the bridge (D)
Between the two, B seems to more directly contradict the core premise that the bridge must be demolished and rebuilt to enable giant ship passage. Just because a few 8000-ton ships have made it through (D) doesn't necessarily mean the bridge is generally suitable for regular giant ship traffic.
Therefore, B raises the most doubts by suggesting there may not actually be a strong need for giant ships to regularly pass through that point.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
