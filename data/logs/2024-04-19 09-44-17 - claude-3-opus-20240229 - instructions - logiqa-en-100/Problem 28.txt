## System:
You are an expert in Logic.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Context: A provincial Go team coach selects 4 of the 7 players from E, F, G, H, J, K and M to participate in the professional league.The selection must meet the following conditions? E or F has one person to participate, but not both .One of J or K will participate, but not both.If J participates, then G participates.Unless F participates, M does not participate.
Question: Which two of the following players will be selected by the coach to make the four-person team the only choice?
Choices:
  A: F and H
  C: G and M
  B: G and J
  D: H and M
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Carefully read the problem and note down all the constraints.
2. Consider the implications of each constraint.
3. Look for combinations of players that, if selected, would uniquely determine the rest of the team.
4. Systematically go through each answer choice, testing if it leads to a unique team composition.
5. Select the answer choice that leads to a unique team composition.
## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. Constraints:
   - E or F, but not both
   - J or K, but not both 
   - If J, then G
   - If not F, then not M
2. Implications:
   - If we select E, we can't select F, and vice versa
   - If we select J, we must select G, and can't select K
   - If we don't select F, we can't select M
3. Looking for combinations that uniquely determine the team:
   - If we select G and J, that forces us to not select K (because of J) and not select F (because M isn't selected). So the team would have to be E, G, J, and either H or M.
4. Checking each answer choice:
   A) F and H - This allows E, G, J, K or M to be the other two. Not unique.
   B) G and J - As discussed above, this forces the team to be E, G, J, and H or M. Two possibilities, so not fully unique.
   C) G and M - This allows E or F, and J or K to be the other two. Not unique.
   D) H and M - This forces F to be selected (because of M), which means E can't be. So the team would have to be F, H, M, and either J or K. Two possibilities, so not fully unique.
5. None of the answer choices lead to a unique team composition. The correct answer must be "None of the above".
Action: Answer("[REDACTED]")
## Result:
Agent Answer: [
Correct Answer: D
