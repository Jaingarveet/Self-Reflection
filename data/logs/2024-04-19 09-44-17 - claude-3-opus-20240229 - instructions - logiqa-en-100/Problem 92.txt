## System:
You are an expert in Logic.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Logic
Context: The football game in the "Master Cup 2003 China Robot Competition" is in progress.Three professors predicted the final result? Professor Zhao said? "The champion is not the Tsinghua University team nor the Zhejiang University team." Professor Qian said ? "The champion is not the Tsinghua University team, but the University of Science and Technology of China." Professor Sun said? "The champion is not the China University of Science and Technology team, but the Tsinghua University team.The results of the competition showed that only one of them judged both, one 'S judgment is one-to-one wrong, the other one is wrong.
Question: According to the above situation, we know that the winner is
Choices:
  A: Tsinghua University Team
  B: China University of Science and Technology Team
  C: Zhejiang University Team
  D: Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Carefully read and understand each professor's statement.
2. Consider the implications of each statement being true.
3. Identify the constraints given in the problem (one fully correct, one half correct, one fully incorrect).
4. Systematically consider each possibility of a professor being fully correct.
5. For each possibility, check if the other professors' accuracy is consistent with the constraints.
6. Eliminate possibilities that lead to contradictions or violate constraints.
7. The remaining possibility that satisfies all constraints is the correct answer.
## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. Professor Zhao says the champion is neither Tsinghua nor Zhejiang. 
2. Professor Qian says it's not Tsinghua, but is USTC.
3. Professor Sun says it's not USTC, but is Tsinghua.
We're told that exactly one professor is fully correct, one is half correct, and one is fully incorrect.
Let's consider each possibility of a professor being fully correct:
1. If Zhao is correct, then Qian and Sun must both be wrong (they both name a team Zhao excludes). But the problem states one of them is half right. Contradiction. So Zhao can't be the fully correct one.
2. If Qian is correct, then the champion is USTC. This makes Zhao half correct (got one team right) and Sun fully incorrect. This is consistent with the problem constraints.
3. If Sun is correct, then Qian must be fully wrong. But Zhao would also be fully wrong (he excludes Tsinghua). This contradicts the one fully correct, one half correct constraint. So Sun can't be the fully correct one.
The only possibility that fits the constraints is Qian being fully correct. Therefore, the champion must be the University of Science and Technology of China team.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
