## System:
You are an expert in Logic.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")

Topic: Logic
Context: Since 1993, sand and dust storms have frequently occurred in the Inner Mongolia region of our country, causing major economic losses.Some people think that sand and dust storms are caused by grassland degradation and desertification caused by climate drought.They are natural disasters, so they are inevitable.
Question: If the following items are true, can the above opinions be questioned, except?
Choices:
  A: In the 1950s, grass in Xilin Gol grassland in Inner Mongolia was as tall as a horse's belly, and now grass can't even cover mice.
  B: Opposite the degraded grasslands of Hulunbeier and Xilinguole in Inner Mongolia, the grasslands of Mongolian grassland are about 1 meter high.
  C: On the almost uninhabited border line of 10 kilometers wide between China and Mongolia, grass still maintains the height of the 1950s.
  D: The increase in dust storms is mainly due to human factors such as overloaded grazing and predatory management of grasslands.
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Read the given opinion carefully and identify its key points.
2. Analyze each choice individually to determine its relationship to the opinion.
3. Consider whether each choice supports, questions, or is neutral to the opinion.
4. Identify the choice that does not allow the opinion to be questioned, i.e., the choice that supports the opinion.
5. Double-check your reasoning for each choice to ensure accuracy.
6. Select the choice that is the exception, i.e., the one that does not question the opinion.
## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
The key points of the given opinion are:
1) Sand and dust storms in Inner Mongolia are caused by grassland degradation and desertification 
2) This is due to climate drought
3) They are natural disasters and inevitable
Now let's analyze each choice:
A: Grass height in Xilin Gol has decreased dramatically from the 1950s to now. This suggests human factors beyond just climate are causing grassland degradation, questioning the opinion. 
B: Grasslands across the border in Mongolia are much healthier than in Inner Mongolia. This suggests factors other than climate, likely human-caused, are responsible for the degradation on the China side. This questions the opinion.
C: Even in an uninhabited border area, grass maintains its 1950s height. This strongly suggests that when human interference is removed, the grasslands remain healthy despite any climate factors. This questions the opinion that the degradation is climate-caused and inevitable.
D: This choice directly states that human factors like overgrazing are mainly responsible for the increase in dust storms. This questions the opinion that the storms are natural, climate-caused and inevitable.
Reflecting on the choices, A, B and C all provide evidence that human factors, not just climate, are responsible for the grassland degradation. D states this outright. 
Therefore, the choice that does not allow the stated opinion to be questioned is:
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
