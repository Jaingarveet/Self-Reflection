## System:
You are an expert in Logic.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Logic
Context: There must be an outside world, because if there is something outside me that can shine or reflect, shining the light into my eyes, which gives me a visual experience, I ca nâ€™t see the buildings, the crowds and the stars these things.And, not only have visual experience like me, but others also have such visual experience; book knowledge also tells us repeatedly that there is an outside world outside of us.
Question: Which of the following does not constitute doubt or rebuttal to the above argument?
Choices:
  A: To use sensory evidence to explain the existence of the external world requires presupposing the existence of the external world in the mind.
  B: How do you prove that others have similar visual experience to you?
  C: Since the visual experience is reliable, Mirage is not a so-called illusion, but a real existence.
  D: If there is no external world and natural science knowledge is not a true reflection of it, then why does natural science achieve such great success in practice?
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully to understand what is being asked.
2. Read through the original argument to grasp its main points and reasoning.
3. Consider each answer choice in turn.
4. For each choice, ask: Does this pose a challenge, doubt, or rebuttal to the original argument? Or does it support the argument?
5. Eliminate the choices that do express doubts or rebuttals.
6. The remaining choice should be the one that does not challenge the argument.
7. Double check that your selected answer fits the question asked.
## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
The original argument makes two main claims:
1) There is an external world, as evidenced by our visual experiences of things like buildings, crowds, stars etc. 
2) Others have similar visual experiences, and books also tell us there is an external world.
Now let's consider each answer choice:
A: This challenges the argument by pointing out that using sensory evidence to prove the external world is circular reasoning - it presupposes what it's trying to prove. So this is a doubt/rebuttal.
B: This questions how we can know others have similar experiences to us. It expresses skepticism about one of the premises of the argument. So this is also a doubt.
C: This choice agrees with and supports the original argument. It says that since visual experience is reliable, things like mirages are real, not illusions. This fits with the argument's claim that our senses give us evidence of a real external world. So this is not a rebuttal.
D: This poses a challenge to the argument. It asks, if there is no external world, how do we explain the success of science? It's suggesting the argument leads to a problematic conclusion. So this expresses doubt.
Looking back at the question, it asked which choice does NOT constitute a doubt or rebuttal. 
The only choice that supports rather than challenges the original argument is C.
Therefore, C is the best answer.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
