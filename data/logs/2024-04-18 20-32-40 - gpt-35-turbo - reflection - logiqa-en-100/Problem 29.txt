## System:
You are an expert in Logic.
You have incorrectly answered the following multiple-choice question.
Your task is to reflect on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
You will then use this information help you answer the same question in the future.
First, explain why you answered the question incorrectly.
Second, list the keywords that describe the type of your errors from most general to most specific. 
Third, solve the problem again, step-by-step, based on your knowledge of the correct answer.
Fourth, create a list of detailed instructions to help you correctly solve this problem in the future.
Finally, create a list of general advice to help you solve similar types of problems in the future.  
Be concise in your response; however, capture all of the essential information.  
For guidance, I will provide you with a single generic example problem and reflection (below).

Topic: Geography and Math
Question: What is the product of the number of letters contained in the name of the city where Iowa State University is located multiplied by the number of letters contained in the name of the state?
Choices:
    A: 16
    B: 20
    C: 24
    D: 32
Thought:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
ISU is located in the state of Iowa.
Action: Answer("D")
---
Correct Answer: A
## Assistant 1:
Explanation:
I miscalculated the product of the number of letters in the city and state names. 
The gap in my knowledge was not in geography but in basic arithmetic. 
I knew the correct city and state but made a calculation error.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Arithmetic error
 - Multiplication error
Solution:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
Iowa State University is located in the state of Iowa.
The city name "Ames" contains 4 letters.
The state name "Iowa" contains 4 letters.
The product of 4*4 is 16.
Instructions:
1. Identify the city where the university is located.
2. Identify the state where the university is located.
3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.
4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.
5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.
6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.
7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them.

Topic: Logic
Context: If I debate with you, can we distinguish between true and false? You and I do nâ€™t know, and everyone else has prejudices.Who can we judge? Please judge with someone who shares your opinion.Since he has the same opinion as you, how can he judge? Please judge by someone who has the same opinion as me.Since he has the same opinion as me, how can he judge? Please judge with people who have different opinions from you and me.Since he has different opinions from you and me, how can he judge? Therefore, "invincible".
Question: Which of the following most accurately describes the shortcomings of the above argument?
Choices:
  A: The above argument seriously ignores the implementation standards and logical standards beyond the debaters and commentators.
  B: The above argument has a logical error of "confused concept".
  C: The reasons in the above argument are untrue and inconsistent with each other.
  D: The above argument is guilty of a "mis-problem" logical error.

Thought:
The argument presents a scenario where it is impossible to judge between true and false due to biases and lack of knowledge. It then asks how judgment can be made, but the options presented are flawed. The argument concludes that the scenario is "invincible". 
Action: Answer("D")

Correct Answer: A
## Assistant 2:
Response:
Explanation:
I incorrectly identified the type of logical error in the argument. The argument is not guilty of a "mis-problem" logical error, but rather it ignores the implementation standards and logical standards beyond the debaters and commentators. 
Error Keywords:
 - Misidentification of logical error
 - Mis-problem error
 - Ignoring implementation standards
 - Ignoring logical standards
Solution:
The argument presents a scenario where it is impossible to judge between true and false due to biases and lack of knowledge. It then asks how judgment can be made, but the options presented are flawed. The argument concludes that the scenario is "invincible". 
The argument is guilty of ignoring the implementation standards and logical standards beyond the debaters and commentators. It assumes that the only way to judge is through debate and commentary, which is not necessarily true. 
Instructions:
1. Read the argument carefully and identify the main points.
2. Identify the logical error in the argument.
3. Evaluate each option carefully and choose the most accurate one.
4. Double-check your answer to ensure accuracy.
Advice:
 - Always read the argument carefully and identify the main points.
 - Always evaluate each option carefully before choosing an answer.
 - Always double-check your answer to ensure accuracy.
 - Remember that logical errors can take many forms, so be familiar with different types of logical errors. 
 - Remember that logical errors can be subtle, so pay attention to the details of the argument.
