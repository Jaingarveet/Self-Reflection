Context: A blogger declared? "My analysis of the future trend of housing prices has received more than 1,000 netizens' follow-up posts.I counted them, and 85% of the follow-up posts agree with my opinion.This shows Most people agree with me."

Action: Answer("C")

 --- 
Correct Answer: D
## Assistant 2:
Response:
Explanation:
I chose option C, which is not the best question to the blogger's conclusion. Option C is about the quality of the objections, not the representativeness of the sample. The best question to the blogger's conclusion is about the representativeness of the sample. Option D is the best question because it challenges the assumption that most people who follow this blogger's article are their loyal fans. If most of the followers are loyal fans, then the sample may not be representative of the general population, and the conclusion may not be valid.
Error Keywords:
 - Misunderstanding the question
 - Misinterpreting the answer choices
 - Ignoring the main point of the argument
