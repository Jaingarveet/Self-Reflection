## System:
You are an expert in Logic.
You have incorrectly answered the following multiple-choice question.
Your task is to reflect on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
You will then use this information help you answer the same question in the future.
First, explain why you answered the question incorrectly.
Second, list the keywords that describe the type of your errors from most general to most specific. 
Third, solve the problem again, step-by-step, based on your knowledge of the correct answer.
Fourth, create a list of detailed instructions to help you correctly solve this problem in the future.
Finally, create a list of general advice to help you solve similar types of problems in the future.  
Be concise in your response; however, capture all of the essential information.  
For guidance, I will provide you with a single generic example problem and reflection (below).

Topic: Geography and Math
Question: What is the product of the number of letters contained in the name of the city where Iowa State University is located multiplied by the number of letters contained in the name of the state?
Choices:
    A: 16
    B: 20
    C: 24
    D: 32
Thought:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
ISU is located in the state of Iowa.
Action: Answer("D")
---
Correct Answer: A
## Assistant 1:
Explanation:
I miscalculated the product of the number of letters in the city and state names. 
The gap in my knowledge was not in geography but in basic arithmetic. 
I knew the correct city and state but made a calculation error.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Arithmetic error
 - Multiplication error
Solution:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
Iowa State University is located in the state of Iowa.
The city name "Ames" contains 4 letters.
The state name "Iowa" contains 4 letters.
The product of 4*4 is 16.
Instructions:
1. Identify the city where the university is located.
2. Identify the state where the university is located.
3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.
4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.
5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.
6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.
7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them.

Topic: Logic
Context: There are five volcanic islands E, F, G, H, and I in the east coast of a country.They are arranged in a straight line from north to south, and they are found? (1) F is adjacent to H and is on the north side of H.(2) I and E are adjacent.(3) G is somewhere in the north of F.
Question: If it is found that G is the northernmost island, how many possible arrangements are there for this group of islands?
Choices:
  A: 2
  B: 3
  C: 4
  D: 5

Thought:
If G is the northernmost island, then it must be at the top of the line. 
From (1), F is adjacent to H and is on the north side of H, so F and H must be in the south of the line.
From (3), G is somewhere in the north of F, so G must be adjacent to F and in the north of F.
From (2), I and E are adjacent, so they must be in the middle of the line.
Therefore, the only possible arrangement is G-F-H-E-I.
Action: Answer("A")

 --- 
Correct Answer: C
## Assistant 2:
Response:
Explanation:
My mistake was that I did not consider all possible arrangements of the islands. 
I assumed that G must be at the top of the line, but it could also be second from the top. 
Error Keywords:
 - Assumption error
 - Limited thinking
 - Failure to consider all possibilities
Solution:
If G is the northernmost island, it could be either at the top of the line or second from the top. 
Case 1: G is at the top of the line
From (1), F is adjacent to H and is on the north side of H, so F and H must be in the south of the line.
From (3), G is somewhere in the north of F, so G must be adjacent to F and in the north of F.
From (2), I and E are adjacent, so they must be in the middle of the line.
Therefore, the only possible arrangement is G-F-H-E-I.
Case 2: G is second from the top of the line
From (1), F is adjacent to H and is on the north side of H, so F and H must be in the south of the line.
From (3), G is somewhere in the north of F, so G must be adjacent to F and in the north of F.
From (2), I and E are adjacent, so they must be in the middle of the line.
Therefore, the possible arrangement is F-G-H-E-I.
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and understand the problem.
2. Consider all possible arrangements of the given conditions.
3. Think through each subproblem step-by-step.
4. Double-check your calculations and final answer.
5. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always consider all possible arrangements of the given conditions.
 - Never assume anything that is not explicitly stated in the problem.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that there may be more than one correct answer to a problem.
