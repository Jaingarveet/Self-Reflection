## System:
You are an expert in Logic.
You have incorrectly answered the following multiple-choice question.
Your task is to reflect on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
You will then use this information help you answer the same question in the future.
First, explain why you answered the question incorrectly.
Second, list the keywords that describe the type of your errors from most general to most specific. 
Third, solve the problem again, step-by-step, based on your knowledge of the correct answer.
Fourth, create a list of detailed instructions to help you correctly solve this problem in the future.
Finally, create a list of general advice to help you solve similar types of problems in the future.  
Be concise in your response; however, capture all of the essential information.  
For guidance, I will provide you with a single generic example problem and reflection (below).

Topic: Geography and Math
Question: What is the product of the number of letters contained in the name of the city where Iowa State University is located multiplied by the number of letters contained in the name of the state?
Choices:
    A: 16
    B: 20
    C: 24
    D: 32
Thought:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
ISU is located in the state of Iowa.
Action: Answer("D")
---
Correct Answer: A
## Assistant 1:
Explanation:
I miscalculated the product of the number of letters in the city and state names. 
The gap in my knowledge was not in geography but in basic arithmetic. 
I knew the correct city and state but made a calculation error.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Arithmetic error
 - Multiplication error
Solution:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
Iowa State University is located in the state of Iowa.
The city name "Ames" contains 4 letters.
The state name "Iowa" contains 4 letters.
The product of 4*4 is 16.
Instructions:
1. Identify the city where the university is located.
2. Identify the state where the university is located.
3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.
4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.
5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.
6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.
7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them.

Topic: Logic
Context: In a study, 51 middle school student volunteers were divided into a test group and a control group to receive the same mathematics training.During the five-day training, the researchers used a technique called transcranial random noise stimulation to lightly shock the areas of the brains of 25 test group members that were considered to be related to computing power.The subsequent test results showed that the mathematics ability of the test group members was significantly higher than that of the control group members.To their surprise, the effect of this ability improvement can last at least half a year.The researchers therefore believe that micro-shocks in the brain can improve the brain's computing power.
Question: Which of the following, if true, best supports the above researchers â€™views?
Choices:
  A: This non-invasive stimulus is inexpensive and will not cause any pain to the human body
  B: After a slight electric shock to the brain, the blood flow between the neurons in the brain is significantly enhanced, but it returns to normal after multiple stimulations
  C: Before the experiment, the mathematics scores of the two groups of students were almost the same
  D: Subjects with microshocks in the brain are more concerned about their behavior, and their concentration is more focused during the test

Thought:
The question asks for the choice that best supports the researchers' views.
The researchers believe that micro-shocks in the brain can improve the brain's computing power.
Action: Answer("B") 
Explanation: 
Choice B supports the researchers' views by providing additional information that after a slight electric shock to the brain, the blood flow between the neurons in the brain is significantly enhanced, which can improve the brain's computing power.

Correct Answer: C
## Assistant 2:
Response:
Explanation:
I misinterpreted the question and did not pay attention to the keyword "best." 
I chose an answer that provides additional information but does not directly support the researchers' views. 
Error Keywords:
 - Misinterpretation
 - Lack of attention to detail
 - Incorrect reasoning
Solution:
The researchers believe that micro-shocks in the brain can improve the brain's computing power.
The question asks for the choice that best supports the researchers' views.
Choice C supports the researchers' views by providing additional information that the mathematics scores of the two groups of students were almost the same before the experiment. This information supports the idea that the improvement in the test group's mathematics ability was due to the micro-shocks in the brain and not due to any pre-existing differences between the two groups.
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and understand what is being asked.
2. Pay attention to the keywords in the question, such as "best."
3. Identify the main idea or argument being presented.
4. Evaluate each answer choice and determine which one best supports the main idea or argument.
5. Choose the answer that directly supports the main idea or argument.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand what is being asked.
 - Pay attention to the keywords in the question, such as "best," "least," "not," etc.
 - Identify the main idea or argument being presented.
 - Evaluate each answer choice and determine which one best supports the main idea or argument.
 - Choose the answer that directly supports the main idea or argument.
 - Be careful not to choose an answer that provides additional information but does not directly support the main idea or argument.
