You are an expert in Logic.
You have incorrectly answered the following multiple-choice question.
Your task is to reflect on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
You will then use this information help you answer the same question in the future.
First, explain why you answered the question incorrectly.
Second, list the keywords that describe the type of your errors from most general to most specific. 
Third, solve the problem again, step-by-step, based on your knowledge of the correct answer.
Fourth, create a list of detailed instructions to help you correctly solve this problem in the future.
Finally, create a list of general advice to help you solve similar types of problems in the future.  
Be concise in your response; however, capture all of the essential information.  
For guidance, I will provide you with a single generic example problem and reflection (below).

Topic: Geography and Math
Question: What is the product of the number of letters contained in the name of the city where Iowa State University is located multiplied by the number of letters contained in the name of the state?
Choices:
    A: 16
    B: 20
    C: 24
    D: 32
Thought:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
ISU is located in the state of Iowa.
Action: Answer("D")
---
Correct Answer: A
## Assistant 1:
Explanation:
I miscalculated the product of the number of letters in the city and state names. 
The gap in my knowledge was not in geography but in basic arithmetic. 
I knew the correct city and state but made a calculation error.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Arithmetic error
 - Multiplication error
Solution:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
Iowa State University is located in the state of Iowa.
The city name "Ames" contains 4 letters.
The state name "Iowa" contains 4 letters.
The product of 4*4 is 16.
Instructions:
1. Identify the city where the university is located.
2. Identify the state where the university is located.
3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.
4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.
5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.
6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.
7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them.

Topic: Logic
Context: Aptripa Cave is located near the bay of Dilos in the Peninsula of Maina, and is as large as four football fields.This cave dates back to the Neolithic Age, but was not accidentally discovered by a man walking a dog until the 1950s.After decades of scientific research work, archaeologists excavated tools, pottery, obsidian, silver and copper utensils from the cave, and thus believed that hundreds of people had lived in the cave.
Question: Which of the following, if true, can best refute the above argument?
Choices:
  A: The cave inspired the description of hell in Greek mythology
  B: The cave is actually an ancient cemetery and funeral venue
  C: There is no prehistoric village in Europe that has been found earlier than the cave
  D: The entrance to the cave collapsed 5000 years ago

Thought:
The argument states that hundreds of people had lived in the cave, but we need to find a statement that contradicts this claim.
Option A is irrelevant to the argument.
Option B is a possible alternative explanation, but it does not necessarily refute the argument.
Option C supports the argument.
Option D does not necessarily refute the argument.
Action: Answer("D")

 --- 
Correct Answer: B
## Assistant 2:
Response:
Explanation:
I chose option D, which does not necessarily refute the argument. The argument states that hundreds of people had lived in the cave, but option D only states that the entrance to the cave collapsed 5000 years ago. This does not necessarily mean that people did not live in the cave before the entrance collapsed. Option B, on the other hand, provides an alternative explanation that contradicts the argument. If the cave is actually an ancient cemetery and funeral venue, then it is less likely that hundreds of people had lived in the cave. 
Error Keywords:
 - Misunderstanding the question
 - Incorrectly evaluating answer choices
 - Insufficiently analyzing answer choices
Solution:
The argument states that hundreds of people had lived in the cave, but we need to find a statement that contradicts this claim. Option B provides an alternative explanation that contradicts the argument. If the cave is actually an ancient cemetery and funeral venue, then it is less likely that hundreds of people had lived in the cave. 
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and understand the problem.
2. Analyze each answer choice carefully.
3. Evaluate each answer choice against the question and the argument.
4. Choose the answer choice that best refutes the argument.
5. Double-check your answer to ensure accuracy.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Analyze each answer choice carefully.
 - Evaluate each answer choice against the question and the argument.
 - Choose the answer choice that best refutes the argument.
 - Double-check your answer to ensure accuracy.
 - Remember that the correct answer is the one that best refutes the argument, not necessarily the one that is true.
