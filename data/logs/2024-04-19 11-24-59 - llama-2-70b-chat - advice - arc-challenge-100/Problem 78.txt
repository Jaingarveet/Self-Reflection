Reflection:
Previously, I selected answer choice A, "It is made of cells," as I thought that was the primary reason why the skin is considered an organ. However, that was incorrect.
The correct answer is B, "It acts as a barrier." The skin acts as a barrier between the external environment and the body's internal organs, protecting the body from external damage and maintaining homeostasis.
I should have focused more on the key words in the question stem, such as "barrier," and eliminated answer choices that were not related to the question.
I will review the definition of an organ and its components, and practice identifying different types of questions and their appropriate answers to improve my performance.

Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
