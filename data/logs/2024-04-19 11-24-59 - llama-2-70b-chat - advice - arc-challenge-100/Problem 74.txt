## System:
You are an expert in Science.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## User 2:
Topic: Science
Question: Elisa was classifying types of energy as either potential or kinetic. Which is a type of potential energy?
Choices:
  A: sound energy
  B: radiant energy
  C: thermal energy
  D: chemical energy
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Advice:

* Always review and understand the concepts before answering a question.
* Be careful when distinguishing between similar terms, such as thermal and [REDACTED].

Question: Elisa was classifying types of energy as either potential or kinetic. Which is a type of potential energy?
Choices:
  A: sound energy
  B: radiant energy
  C: thermal energy
  D: chemical energy
Reflection:
Previously, I incorrectly answered this question as C: thermal energy.
However, upon reflection, I realized that thermal energy is actually a form of kinetic energy, not potential energy.
The correct answer is D: chemical energy, as it is a form of potential energy that is stored in the bonds of atoms and molecules.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
