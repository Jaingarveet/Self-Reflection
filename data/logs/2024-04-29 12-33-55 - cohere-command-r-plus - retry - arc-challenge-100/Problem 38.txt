## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
To find the lowest mass, we need to calculate the mass of each option using the given densities.

For 2m^3 of bricks:
Mass = Density x Volume = 2000 kg/m^3 x 2 m^3 = 4000 kg

For 4m^3 of bricks:
Mass = Density x Volume = 2000 kg/m^3 x 4 m^3 = 8000 kg

For 6000m^3 of air:
Mass = Density x Volume = 1 kg/m^3 x 6000 m^3 = 6000 kg

For 10,000m^3 of air:
Mass = Density x Volume = 1 kg/m^3 x 10,000 m^3 = 10,000 kg

Comparing the calculated masses, we find that 6000 m^3 of air has the lowest mass.

Therefore, the correct answer is C: 6000 m^3 of air.
Action: Answer("C")
