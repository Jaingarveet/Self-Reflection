## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
From the conditions, we know that F must be in the production department. H and Y must be in the same department. If X is in sales, then W is in production. F and G cannot be in the same department. Therefore, G cannot be in the production department. This leaves only the sales and public relations departments for G. If G is in sales, then X cannot be in sales because that would force W into production, which already has F, G, and one other person (either H and Y together or I). Therefore, G and X cannot both be in the sales department.
Action: Answer("B")
