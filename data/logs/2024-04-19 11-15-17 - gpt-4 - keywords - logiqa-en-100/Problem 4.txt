## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Given that J is the fourth speaker, this means J speaks after lunch. 
From the conditions, we know that G must speak before lunch, so G is either the first, second, or third speaker. 
F must speak in the first or third place, so F cannot be the second speaker. 
M and N have only one speaker between them, so if M or N is the third speaker, the other must be the first or fifth speaker. But since F is the first or third speaker, M and N cannot be the third speaker. 
Therefore, the third speaker must be either G or L.
Action: Answer("B")
