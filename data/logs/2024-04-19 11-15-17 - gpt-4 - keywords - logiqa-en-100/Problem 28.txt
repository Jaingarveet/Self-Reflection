## System:
You are an expert in Logic.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The conditions are:
1. Either E or F, but not both.
2. Either J or K, but not both.
3. If J participates, then G participates.
4. Unless F participates, M does not participate.
Let's analyze the choices:
A: F and H - If F is selected, E cannot be selected. This leaves us with F, H and two more players to be selected. We can select J (or K) and G (or M if F is selected). So, this is a possible team.
B: G and J - If J is selected, G must be selected. This leaves us with G, J and two more players to be selected. We can select E (or F) and K (or M if F is selected). So, this is a possible team.
C: G and M - If M is selected, F must be selected. But if F is selected, E cannot be selected. This leaves us with F, G, M and one more player to be selected. We can select J (or K). So, this is a possible team.
D: H and M - If M is selected, F must be selected. But if F is selected, E cannot be selected. This leaves us with F, H, M and one more player to be selected. We can select J (or K). So, this is a possible team.
The question asks for the only choice, but all four choices can form a valid team. Therefore, the question seems to be flawed.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: D
