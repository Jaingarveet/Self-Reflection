Explanation:
I used the correct formula but made a calculation error. 
The gap in my knowledge was not in the formula but in basic arithmetic. 
I correctly identified that the combined speed of the two cars is[REDACTED]5 mph (12 mph +[REDACTED]3 mph), but I made a mistake in calculating the time it would take for them to meet.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The combined speed of the two cars is 25 mph (12 mph + 13 mph).
To find the time it takes for them to meet, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed.
Let's call the time it takes for them to meet "t".
The total distance they need to cover is 50 miles.
The equation we can use is: 50 = (12 + 13)t (since they are moving towards each other, we can add their speeds)
Simplifying the equation, we get: t = 50 / 25 = 2
Action: Answer("E")
