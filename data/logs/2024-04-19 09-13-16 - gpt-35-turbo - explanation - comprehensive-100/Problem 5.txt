Explanation:
I correctly set up the equation to solve for the number of members in the club, but I made an error in simplifying the equation. 
The gap in my knowledge was in simplifying quadratic equations. 
I made a mistake in expanding the brackets and simplifying the quadratic equation.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let the number of members in the club be n.
The youngest member is 7 years old.
The sum of the ages of all the members is 250.
The common difference is 3 months, which is 1/4 of a year.
The sum of the ages of all the members can be expressed as the sum of an arithmetic series.
The formula for the sum of an arithmetic series is Sn = n/2(2a + (n-1)d), where a is the first term, d is the common difference, and n is the number of terms.
We can express the ages of the members in years.
The first term is 7 years old.
The common difference is 1/4 years.
The sum of the ages of all the members is 250 years.
We can set up the equation: 250 = n/2(2(7) + (n-1)(1/4)).
Simplifying the equation, we get 2n + 12 - n + 1/2 = 500/1.
Simplifying further, we get n = 26.
Action: Answer("D")
