Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
My mistake was in assuming that F, [REDACTED], K, L, M, and O must be placed on the middle and bottom shelves if G is placed on the top shelf. However, the problem only states that at least two books are placed on each shelf, not that all books are placed on the middle and bottom shelves.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
If G is placed on the top shelf, then F, [REDACTED], K, L, M, and O must be placed on the middle and bottom shelves.
I is placed on the middle shelf, so it cannot be placed on the top or bottom shelf.
Therefore, H must be placed on the top shelf.
If H is on the top shelf, then I and L must be on the middle shelf.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
