Explanation:
I correctly calculated the speed of the space shuttle and the distance it covers in 5 seconds. However, I made an error in calculating the length of the space shuttle. I added the distance covered in 5 seconds to the distance traveled in 40 seconds instead of adding it to the length of the space shuttle.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The space shuttle travels 700m in 40 seconds, so its speed is 700/40 = 17.5 m/s.
In 5 seconds, the space shuttle covers a distance of 17.5 x 5 = 87.5 m.
Let the length of the space shuttle be x.
Then, the total distance covered by the space shuttle in 45 seconds is x + 87.5.
The total distance covered by the space shuttle in 45 seconds is also the product of its speed and time, which is 17.5 x 45 = 787.5.
Therefore, x + 87.5 = 787.5.
Thus, x = 700.
