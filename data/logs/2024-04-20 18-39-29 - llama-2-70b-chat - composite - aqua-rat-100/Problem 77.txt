## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: The sum of the 5 consecutive two digit odd numbers when divided by 10 becomes a perfect square, which of the following can be one of these 5 numbers?
Choices:
  A: 47
  B: 91
  C: 41
  D: 67
  E: 44
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question by identifying the wrong number as a perfect square.
The correct answer is [REDACTED], which is a perfect square (7^2).
I made a mistake in my calculation and identified 111 as a perfect square, when in fact it is not.
Error Keywords:
- Calculation error
- Square root error
- Perfect square error

Solution:
[REDACTED] consecutive sequence of 5 odd numbers: [REDACTED], [REDACTED], 89, 111, 133
When divided by 10: 4.7, 6.7, 8.9, 11.1, 13.3
Square root of 4.7= 2.1, 6.7= 2.6, 8.9= 3.1, 11.1= 3.3, 13.3= 3.6
Only one of the given numbers is a perfect square, which is [REDACTED].

Instructions:
1. Identify the consecutive sequence of 5 odd numbers.
2. Divide each number by 10.
3. Calculate the square root of each result.
4. Identify the number that is a perfect square.
5. Choose the corresponding answer.

Advice:
- Always double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
- Make sure you understand the concept of perfect squares and how to identify them.
- Be careful when comparing numbers and identifying which one is a perfect square.
- Take your time and work through each step of the problem carefully.
- Remember that a perfect square is a number that can be expressed as the square of an integer, for example, [REDACTED] = 7^2.
