## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: Points A, B, C, D lie in this order on the circumference of a circle. Minor arc AC is 160°, and minor arc BD is 150°. If B bisects minor arc AC, then what is the measure of minor arc AD?
Choices:
  A: 80°
  B: 130°
  C: 140°
  D: 160°
  E: 220°
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I made a mistake in my reasoning. I correctly identified that [REDACTED] bisects minor arc A[REDACTED], but I incorrectly concluded that the measure of minor arc A[REDACTED] is [REDACTED].

Error Keywords:

* Reasoning error
* Misapplication of concept
* Incorrect conclusion

Solution:
Points [REDACTED], [REDACTED], [REDACTED], [REDACTED] lie in this order on the circumference of a circle. Minor arc A[REDACTED] is [REDACTED], and minor arc B[REDACTED] is 150°. Since [REDACTED] bisects minor arc A[REDACTED], the measure of minor arc B[REDACTED] is half of [REDACTED], which is [REDACTED]. Therefore, the measure of minor arc A[REDACTED] is [REDACTED] - [REDACTED] = [REDACTED].

Instructions:

1. Identify the fact that [REDACTED] bisects minor arc A[REDACTED].
2. Recognize that the measure of minor arc B[REDACTED] is half of [REDACTED].
3. Calculate the measure of minor arc A[REDACTED] by subtracting the measure of minor arc B[REDACTED] from [REDACTED].
4. Choose the answer that matches the calculated measure of minor arc A[REDACTED].

Advice:

* Always carefully analyze the given information and identify the relevant facts.
* Apply the concepts and formulas appropriately.
* Double-check your calculations and conclusions.
* Consider all the given choices and eliminate any obviously incorrect options.
* Practice similar problems to improve your problem-solving skills.
