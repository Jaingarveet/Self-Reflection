Explanation:
I made a mistake in my calculation. I misunderstood the question and set up the equation incorrectly. I also made a mistake in my simplification of the equation.

Error Keywords:

* Misunderstanding of the question
* Incorrect equation setup
* Simplification mistake

Solution:
Let's re-read the question carefully. The question states that the same number of boys and girls joined the group during the membership drive. This means that the number of boys who joined the group is equal to the number of girls who joined the group.

Let's assume that the number of boys who joined the group is x and the number of girls who joined the group is also x.

We know that the total number of boys in the group is 64 + x, and the total number of girls in the group is 40 + x.

Since the ratio of boys to girls is 4:3, we can set up the equation:
(64 + x) / (40 + x) = 4/3

Simplifying the equation, we get:
x = 120

Now, we can find the value of x:
x = 120/4
x = 30

So, the number of boys who joined the group is 30, and the number of girls who joined the group is also 30.

Now, we can find the total number of members in the group:
Total members = 64 + 30 + 40 + 30 = [REDACTED]

The correct answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED].

Instructions:

1. Read the question carefully and understand the problem.
2. Set up the correct equation based on the given information.
3. Simplify the equation correctly.
4. Solve for the value of the variable.
5. Use the value of the variable to find the total number of members in the group.
6. Choose the correct answer.

Advice:

* Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
* Always set up the correct equation based on the given information.
* Always simplify the equation correctly.
* Always solve for the value of the variable.
* Always use the value of the variable to find the total number of members in the group.
* Always choose the correct answer.

In this case, I made a mistake in setting up the equation and simplifying it. I also misunderstood the question. Therefore, it's important to read the question carefully and understand it before starting to solve it. Additionally, it's important to double-check your work and make sure that your answer makes sense in the context of the problem.
