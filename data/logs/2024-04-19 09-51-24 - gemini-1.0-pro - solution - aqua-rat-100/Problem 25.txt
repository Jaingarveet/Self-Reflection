Question: A car is being driven, in a straight line and at a uniform speed, towards the base of a vertical tower. The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower?
Choices:
  A: 5(√3 + 1)
  B: 6(√3 + √2)
  C: 7(√3 – 1)
  D: 8(√3 – 2)
  E: None of these

**Previous Incorrect Answer:** C: 7(√3 – 1)
**Reasoning for Incorrect Answer:** I incorrectly calculated the distance traveled by the car during the 10 minutes. I assumed that the car traveled a distance equal to the height of the tower, which was not the case.
**Correct Answer:** B: 6(√3 + √2)
**Reasoning for Correct Answer:**
1. **Calculate the distance traveled by the car:**
    - The angle of elevation changed from 45° to 60°, which means the car traveled a distance equal to the height of the tower multiplied by the tangent of the difference in angles:
    ```
    distance = height * tan(60° - 45°) = height * tan(15°)
    ```
2. **Calculate the time it takes for the car to travel the remaining distance:**
    - The car is traveling at a uniform speed, so the time it takes to travel a distance is proportional to the distance.
    - The car traveled a distance of `height * tan(15°)` in 10 minutes, so it will take the same amount of time to travel a distance of `height * (1 - tan(15°))`:
    ```
    time = 10 minutes * (height * (1 - tan(15°))) / (height * tan(15°)) = 10 minutes * (1 - tan(15°)) / tan(15°)
    ```
3. **Simplify the expression:**
    ```
    time = 10 minutes * (1 - tan(15°)) / tan(15°) = 10 minutes * (1 - √3 + 1) / (√3 - 1) = 10 minutes * (2 - √3) / (√3 - 1)
    ```
    ```
    time = 10 minutes * (2 - √3) * (√3 + 1) / (√3 - 1) * (√3 + 1) = 10 minutes * (5 - √3) / 2 = 5(5 - √3) minutes
    ```
    ```
    time = 5(5 - √3) minutes = 5(√3 + √2) minutes
    ```
Therefore, the correct answer is B: 6(√3 + √2).
**Action:** Answer("B")
