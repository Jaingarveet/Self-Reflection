Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
Ball [REDACTED] makes 1 full rotation in 26/2 = 13 minutes.
Ball [REDACTED] makes 1 full rotation in 35/5 = 7 minutes.
The LCM of 13 and 7 is 91.
Therefore, they will be at the same starting point again after 91 minutes.
