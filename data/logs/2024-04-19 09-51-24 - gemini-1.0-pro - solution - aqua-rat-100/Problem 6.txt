Self-reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly because I did not consider the fact that Mr. Brown had already painted a house before going on vacation. This means that Mr. Black and Mr. Blue only need to paint 2 houses instead of 3.
I will now use this information to answer the question correctly.
Action: Answer("A")
