Solution:
The sum of the 5 consecutive two-digit odd numbers when divided by 10 becomes a perfect square.
We need to find a two-digit odd number that is part of a set of 5 consecutive odd numbers whose sum, when divided by 10, results in a perfect square.
Let's start with option [REDACTED]: [REDACTED].
[REDACTED] is an odd number.
The next four consecutive odd numbers are 43, 45, [REDACTED], and 49.
The sum of these five numbers is 225.
225 divided by 10 is 22.5, which is not a perfect square.
Therefore, option [REDACTED] is not the correct answer.
We can repeat this process for the remaining options.
Only option [REDACTED], [REDACTED], satisfies the condition.
The sum of the five consecutive odd numbers starting from [REDACTED] is 335.
335 divided by 10 is 33.5, which is a perfect square (the square root of 33.5 is 5.78).
Therefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED].
