Solution:
## Assistant 2:
The area of the paper is 20*20 = 400 cm^2.
The area of each semi circle is (1/2)*pi*r^2 = (1/2)*pi*(10)^2 = 50pi cm^2.
The area of the two semi circles is 50pi + 50pi = 100pi cm^2.
The area of the remaining paper is 400 - 100pi cm^2.
The value of pi is approximately 3.14.
The area of the remaining paper is approximately 400 - 314 = 86 cm^2.
Action: Answer("C")
