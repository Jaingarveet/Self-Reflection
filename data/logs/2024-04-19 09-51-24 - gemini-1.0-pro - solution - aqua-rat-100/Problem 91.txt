Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
1. Identify the starting point of [REDACTED].
2. Identify the direction and distance of each movement.
3. Calculate the net movement in each direction (north-south and east-west).
4. Use the Pythagorean theorem to calculate the total distance from the starting point.
```
Net movement north: [REDACTED] north - [REDACTED] south = 0km
Net movement east: [REDACTED] east - [REDACTED] west = [REDACTED]
Total distance: sqrt(0^2 + 3^2) = [REDACTED]
```
