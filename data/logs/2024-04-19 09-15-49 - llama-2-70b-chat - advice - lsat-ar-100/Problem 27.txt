## Assistant 2:
  Sure, I'll do my best to answer the question based on the information provided.

From the given information, we know that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Therefore, the list of students who review Tamerlane must include both Kramer and O'Neill.

We also know that Lopez does not review any play that Jiang reviews. Therefore, if Jiang reviews Tamerlane, Lopez cannot be on the list.

Furthermore, we know that exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other. Therefore, the list of students who review Tamerlane must have exactly two members.

With these conditions in mind, let's consider each of the choices:

A: Jiang, Kramer - This choice includes Jiang, who may not review Tamerlane, and excludes O'Neill, who definitely reviews Tamerlane. Therefore, this choice is incorrect.

B: Kramer, O'Neill - This choice includes both Kramer and O'Neill, which is consistent with the given information. However, it does not include Lopez, who may also review Tamerlane. Therefore, this choice is incomplete.

C: Kramer, Lopez, O'Neill - This choice includes Kramer and O'Neill, which is consistent with the given information. It also includes Lopez, who may review Tamerlane. However, this choice violates the condition that exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other, since three students are listed. Therefore, this choice is incorrect.

D: Kramer, Megregian, O'Neill - This choice includes Kramer and O'Neill, which is consistent with the given information. It also includes Megregian, who may review Tamerlane. However, this choice violates the condition that Lopez does not review any play that Jiang reviews, since Jiang may review Tamerlane and Megregian may review Sunset. Therefore, this choice is incorrect.

E: Lopez, Megregian, O'Neill - This choice includes Lopez and O'Neill, which is consistent with the given information. It also includes Megregian, who may review Tamerlane. However, this choice violates the condition that exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other, since three students are listed. Therefore, this choice is incorrect.

Based on the above analysis, the only accurate and complete list of students who review Tamerlane is:

B: Kramer, O'Neill

Therefore, the answer is B.
