## Assistant 2:
  I apologize for my previous mistake. Let's analyze the problem again carefully.
The problem states that Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4. Therefore, for Robertson, the assignment of a parking space is limited to one of four possible spaces.
Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa, and Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Therefore, for Young and Xu, the assignment of a parking space is limited to one of two possible spaces each.
For Togowa and Souza, the assignment of a parking space is not limited to only two possible spaces, as they can be assigned any of the remaining parking spaces.
Vaughn is not subject to any specific rule, so the assignment of a parking space is not limited for Vaughn.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: D
