## Assistant 2:
  My previous answer was incorrect because I misunderstood the information given and didn't consider all possible scenarios.
I made a table to help visualize the information given and the possible scenarios:

| Day | Batch 1 | Batch 2 | Batch 3 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Monday | Oatmeal |  |  |
| Tuesday |  | Peanut butter |  |
| Wednesday |  |  | Peanut butter |
| Thursday | Sugar |  |  |
| Friday |  |  | Oatmeal |

From the table, we can see that the first batch of sugar cookies cannot be made on Monday (choice A is incorrect).
The first batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Tuesday (choice B is incorrect).
The third batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Friday (choice C is incorrect).
The first batch of peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Wednesday (choice D is incorrect).
The second batch of peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Tuesday (choice E is incorrect).

Therefore, the correct answer is none of the above.
Action: Answer("E")
## Result:
Agent Answer: E
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
