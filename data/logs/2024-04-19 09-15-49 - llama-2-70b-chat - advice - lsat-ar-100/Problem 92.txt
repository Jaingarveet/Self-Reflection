## Assistant 2:
  My previous answer was incorrect because I made an incorrect assumption not stated in the conditions. I assumed that each sales zone had an equal number of sales representatives, which led me to incorrectly conclude that Quinn could not work in the same sales zone as Tiao.

Let's carefully decompose the problem into multiple simple steps:

Step 1: Identify the sales representatives and their respective sales zones.

* Parra or Tiao (but not both) work in Zone 1.
* Tiao or Udall (but not both) work in Zone 2.
* Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
* Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.

Step 2: Determine the number of sales representatives in each sales zone.

* Zone 1: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) = 1 sales representative.
* Zone 2: Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) = 1 sales representative.
* Zone 3: The remaining sales representatives (Kim, Mahr, Stuckey, and Quinn) = 4 sales representatives.

Step 3: Determine which sales representatives cannot work in the same sales zone as Quinn.

* Tiao (because Tiao works in Zone 1, and Quinn cannot work in Zone 1)
* Udall (because Udall works in Zone 2, and Quinn cannot work in Zone 2)

Step 4: Eliminate the impossible choices.

* A: Kim (Kim works in Zone 3, and Quinn can work in Zone 3)
* B: Mahr (Mahr works in Zone 3, and Quinn can work in Zone 3)
* C: Stuckey (Stuckey works in Zone 3, and Quinn can work in Zone 3)
* D: Tiao (Tiao works in Zone 1, and Quinn cannot work in Zone 1)
* E: Udall (Udall works in Zone 2, and Quinn cannot work in Zone 2)

Step 5: Select the correct answer.

Action: Answer("D")

The correct answer is D: Tiao. Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Tiao because Tiao works in Zone 1, and Quinn cannot work in Zone 1.
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
