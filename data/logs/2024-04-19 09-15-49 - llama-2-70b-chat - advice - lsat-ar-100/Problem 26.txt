## Assistant 2:
  I apologize for my previous mistake. Let's analyze the problem carefully.
The third solo is a traditional piece, so Wayne or Zara must perform a traditional piece in the third solo. Exactly two traditional pieces are performed consecutively, so the fourth solo must be a modern piece.
Since the pianist who performs the second solo does not perform the fifth solo, Wayne must perform the second solo, and Zara must perform the fifth solo.
No traditional piece is performed until Wayne performs at least one modern piece, so Wayne must perform a modern piece in the first or second solo. If Wayne performs a modern piece in the first solo, then Zara must perform a traditional piece in the second solo. In this scenario, Wayne would perform a traditional piece in the third solo, and Zara would perform a modern piece in the fifth solo.
However, if Wayne performs a modern piece in the second solo, then Zara must perform a traditional piece in the first solo. In this scenario, Wayne would still perform a traditional piece in the third solo, but Zara would perform a modern piece in the fourth solo instead of the fifth solo.
Therefore, the minimum number of solos in which Wayne performs a traditional piece is two.
Action: Answer("C")
