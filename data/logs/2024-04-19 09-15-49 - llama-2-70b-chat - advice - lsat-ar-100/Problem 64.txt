## Assistant 2:
  Sure, I'll do my best to answer the question.

Here's my reflection on the problem:

When I first encountered this question, I mistakenly assumed that the given conditions were sufficient to determine the sales representatives' zones. I incorrectly chose answer B, thinking that Mahr must work in Zone 1.

However, upon further review, I realized that the given conditions do not provide enough information to determine the sales representatives' zones. In particular, we cannot infer the zone of Mahr or Stuckey based on the given conditions.

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) Stuckey works in Zone 2, as this statement is not ruled out by the given conditions.

Now, let me explain why the other choices are incorrect:

A. Kim works in Zone 2: This statement is inconsistent with the given conditions. If Kim works in Zone 2, then Tiao or Udall must work in Zone 1, but we know that Parra or Tiao (but not both) work in Zone 1. Hence, this choice is eliminated.

B. Mahr works in Zone 1: As I mentioned earlier, I incorrectly chose this option the first time. However, we cannot determine Mahr's zone based on the given conditions.

C. Parra works in Zone 3: This statement is inconsistent with the given conditions. If Parra works in Zone 3, then Quinn must work in Zone 2, but we know that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Hence, this choice is eliminated.

E. Tiao works in Zone 1: This statement is inconsistent with the given conditions. If Tiao works in Zone 1, then Parra cannot work in Zone 1, which contradicts the given conditions. Hence, this choice is eliminated.

In summary, the correct answer is (D) Stuckey works in Zone 2, as it is not ruled out by the given conditions.
