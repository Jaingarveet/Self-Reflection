Context: A chemistry class has six lab sessions scheduled over three days—Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday—one session heing held each morning and one each afternoon. Each session will be led by a different lab assistant—Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, or Rebecca. The assignment of lab assistants to sessions is constrained as follows: Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day. Nessa must lead an afternoon session. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.

  B: Lan's session meets Thursday afternoon.
  C: Nessa's session meets Friday afternoon.
  D: Olivia's session meets Thursday morning.

## Assistant 2:
  I apologize for my previous mistake. Let's analyze the problem carefully.
The question states that Julio and Kevin both lead morning sessions. Therefore, Julio's session must meet on Wednesday or Thursday morning, and Kevin's session must meet on Wednesday or Thursday morning as well.
Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day, so Lan's session must meet on a different day than Olivia's session.
Nessa's session must meet in the afternoon, and since Julio's session meets on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's, Nessa's session cannot meet on Wednesday afternoon. Therefore, Nessa's session must meet on Thursday or Friday afternoon.
Now, let's evaluate the answer choices:

A: Lan's session meets Wednesday morning.
Since Lan's session cannot meet on the same day as Olivia's session, this choice is not possible.

B: Lan's session meets Thursday afternoon.
This choice is possible, as Lan's session can meet on Thursday afternoon while Olivia's session meets on Thursday morning.

C: Nessa's session meets Friday afternoon.
This choice is possible, as Nessa's session can meet on Friday afternoon while Olivia's session meets on Thursday morning.

D: Olivia's session meets Thursday morning.
This choice is possible, as Olivia's session can meet on Thursday morning while Lan's session meets on Thursday afternoon.

E: Olivia's session meets Friday morning.
This choice is not possible, as Nessa's session must meet on an afternoon, and Olivia's session cannot meet on the same day as Nessa's session.

Therefore, the correct answer is E: Olivia's session meets Friday morning.

Action: Answer("E")
