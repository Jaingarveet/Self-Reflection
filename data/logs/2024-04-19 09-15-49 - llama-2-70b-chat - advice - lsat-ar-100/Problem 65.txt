Context: A panel of five scientists will be formed. The panelists will be selected from among three botanists—F, G, and H—three chemists—K, L, and M—and three zoologists—P, Q, and R. Selection is governed by the following conditions: The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types. If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. F and K cannot both be selected. K and M cannot both be selected. If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
Question: If M is the only chemist selected for the panel, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: F and G are both selected.
  B: G and H are both selected.
  C: H and P are both selected.
  D: F, G, and H are all selected.
  E: P, Q, and R are all selected.

## Assistant 2:
  My previous answer was incorrect because I made a mistake in my reasoning. I incorrectly assumed that if M is the only chemist selected, then F and G must be selected. However, that is not necessarily true since the conditions state that if more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.

Therefore, the correct answer is C: H and P are both selected. If M is the only chemist selected, then the panel must include at least one botanist and one zoologist. H is the only botanist left, and P must be selected as the zoologist.

Action: Answer("C")
