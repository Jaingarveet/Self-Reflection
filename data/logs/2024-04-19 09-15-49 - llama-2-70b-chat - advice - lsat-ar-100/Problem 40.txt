Context: A shopping center has exactly seven spaces—space 1 through space 7—arranged in a straight row. Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.

## Assistant 2:
  My previous answer was incorrect because I made an error in my diagram. I placed the optometrist next to the pharmacy, which is incorrect.

Let's start by placing the pharmacy in space 1, as it must be at one end of the row.
Next, we must place the two restaurants. We cannot place them next to each other, so we'll place one in space 3 and the other in space 6.
Now, we must place the optometrist. It must be next to either the pharmacy or the veterinarian. Let's place the optometrist in space 2, next to the pharmacy.
We cannot place the toy store next to the veterinarian, so we'll place it in space 5.
Finally, we must place the shoe store. Since it's in space 2, we'll place it there.

The correct answer is C: A restaurant is in space 3.

Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
