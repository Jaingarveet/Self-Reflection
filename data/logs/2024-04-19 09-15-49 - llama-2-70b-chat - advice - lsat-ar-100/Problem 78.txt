## Assistant 2:
  Sure, I'll do my best to answer the question using my previous reflection and the given choices.

From my previous reflection, I know that Nina's report cannot be on Wednesday, as it would violate the condition that Helen and Irving must both give reports on the next day. Therefore, Choice E (Robert gives a report on Wednesday) can be eliminated.

Furthermore, I also know that if Nina gives a report, it must be on Monday or Tuesday. Therefore, Choice B (Nina gives a report on Monday) and Choice C (Nina gives a report on Tuesday) are both possible.

However, I also know that George must give a report on Tuesday, and neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. Therefore, Choice D (Olivia gives a report on Monday) can be eliminated.

Finally, I know that Helen and Irving must both give reports on the next day if Nina gives a report on Monday. Therefore, Choice A (Helen gives a report on Wednesday) can be eliminated.

Based on my reflection and the given choices, the only possible answer is Choice B (Nina gives a report on Monday).

Action: Answer("B")
## Result:

Correct Answer: A
