## Assistant 2:
## Reflection on Previous Attempt:
In my previous attempt, I incorrectly chose option A. This was due to a misinterpretation of the relationship between the statements. I focused on the success of Canadian films at international festivals and assumed it implied the reverse was also true. However, the context only establishes that **some prize-winning films at Lac Nichoutec also won at international festivals**, not that all or most did.
## Applying Learnings:
Considering the context and my previous error, I should focus on statements that directly relate to the given information and avoid assumptions about the reverse relationship.
## Analysis of Choices:
* **A:** This reverses the given relationship and is not necessarily true. 
* **B:** This makes an assumption about the proportion of Canadian films shown at Lac Nichoutec, which is not supported by the context.
* **C:** This directly aligns with the given information. If some films from Lac Nichoutec won at international festivals, then some prize-winners at international festivals must be Canadian.
* **D & E:** These options discuss films that did not win at both types of festivals, which is not relevant to the given information about films that did win at both.
## Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the only statement that must be true is that some of the films that won prizes at international film festivals this year were Canadian films.
**Action: Answer("C")** 
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
