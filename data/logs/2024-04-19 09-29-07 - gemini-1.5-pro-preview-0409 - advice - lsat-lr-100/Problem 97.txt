## User 2:
Topic: Law
Context: Editorial: Cell-phone usage on buses and trains is annoying to other passengers. This suggests that recent proposals to allow use of cell phones on airplanes are ill-advised. Cell-phone use would be far more upsetting on airplanes than it is on buses and trains. Airline passengers are usually packed in tightly. And if airline passengers are offended by the cell-phone excesses of their seatmates, they often cannot move to another seat.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes the role played in the editorial's argument by the statement that cell-phone use would be far more upsetting on airplanes than it is on buses and trains?
Choices:
  A: It is the main conclusion of the argument.
  B: It is a claim that the argument tries to rebut.
  C: It is a premise that indirectly supports the main conclusion of the argument by supporting a premise for that conclusion.
  D: It is a conclusion for which support is provided and that itself is used in turn to directly support the argument's main conclusion.
  E: It provides background information that plays no role in the reasoning in the argument.

## Assistant 2:
## Reflection on Previous Attempt:
In my previous attempt, I incorrectly identified the role of the statement as the main conclusion (A). However, the main conclusion is that proposals to allow cell phone use on airplanes are ill-advised. The statement about cell phone use being more upsetting on airplanes serves as a supporting argument for this main conclusion.
## Analysis of the Statement's Role:
The statement directly supports the idea that cell phone use on airplanes would be problematic. This, in turn, supports the main conclusion that allowing cell phone use on airplanes is a bad idea. Therefore, the statement acts as a premise that directly supports the main conclusion by providing a reason why cell phone use on airplanes would be undesirable.
