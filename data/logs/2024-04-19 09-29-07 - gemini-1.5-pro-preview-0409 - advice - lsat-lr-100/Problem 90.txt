## System:
You are an expert in Law.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")

Context: Science journalist: Brown dwarfs are celestial objects with more mass than planets but less mass than stars. They are identified by their mass and whether or not lithium is present in their atmospheres. Stars at least as massive as the Sun have lithium remaining in their atmospheres because the mixing of elements in their internal nuclear furnaces is incomplete. Stars with less mass than the Sun have no lithium because the element has been fully mixed into their nuclear furnaces and consumed. A brown dwarf does not have a fully functional nuclear furnace and so its lithium cannot be consumed.
Question: Which one of the following is most strongly supported by the science journalist's statements?
Choices:
  A: Any celestial object without lithium in its atmosphere is a star with less mass than the Sun.
  B: Any celestial object with lithium in its atmosphere has a nuclear furnace that has incompletely mixed the object's elements.
  C: No celestial object that has no lithium in its atmosphere is a brown dwarf.
  D: No celestial object with lithium in its atmosphere has less mass than the Sun.
  E: No celestial object less massive than a brown dwarf has lithium in its atmosphere.

## Assistant 2:
## Reflection on Previous Attempt:
In my previous attempt, I likely focused too much on the presence of lithium as a defining characteristic and failed to consider the full context of mass and nuclear fusion processes. This led me to an inaccurate conclusion.
## Analysis:
*   Brown dwarfs have more mass than planets but less mass than stars.
*   Brown dwarfs have lithium because they lack a fully functional nuclear furnace.
*   Stars with less mass than the Sun lack lithium due to complete mixing and consumption in their nuclear furnaces.
*   Stars at least as massive as the Sun retain lithium due to incomplete mixing.
## Reasoning:
*   **A is incorrect:**  Objects with less mass than brown dwarfs (e.g., planets) could also lack lithium.
*   **B is incorrect:**  Brown dwarfs have lithium but lack a fully functional nuclear furnace.
*   **C is incorrect:**  Planets could lack lithium and not be brown dwarfs.
*   **D is incorrect:**  Stars more massive than the Sun can have lithium.
*   **E is the most strongly supported:**  Objects less massive than brown dwarfs (e.g., planets) lack the mass necessary for even the limited fusion processes that occur in brown dwarfs, thus they cannot have lithium.
Action: Answer("E")
