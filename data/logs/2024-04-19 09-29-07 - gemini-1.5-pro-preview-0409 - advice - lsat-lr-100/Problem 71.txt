## Assistant 2:
## Reflection on Previous Attempt:
**Error Analysis:**
In my previous attempt, I incorrectly chose option A. This was due to a misinterpretation of the curator's statement. I focused on the fact that the museum store sells prints of all works in the permanent collection, but I failed to consider the additional information about prints of works not in the collection, like Hopper's Nighthawks.
**Understanding the Problem:**
The question asks us to identify a statement that MUST be true based on the curator's information. This means the statement has to be true in all possible scenarios, without any exceptions.
**Correct Answer and Reasoning:**
The correct answer is **B: Every print that is sold in the museum store is a copy of a twentieth-century work.** 
* We know the museum only displays twentieth-century works.
* The museum store sells prints of works displayed in the museum (permanent collection or on loan) and some works not displayed (like Nighthawks).
* Therefore, all prints sold must be of twentieth-century works, regardless of their display status.
**Lessons Learned:**
* Pay close attention to all parts of the information provided.
* Focus on identifying statements that are true in all possible scenarios, not just some.
* Avoid making assumptions or jumping to conclusions.
**Applying the Learning:**
Using this reflection, I can confidently answer the current question by carefully analyzing each option and choosing the one that is guaranteed to be true based on the given information. 
Action: Answer("B")
