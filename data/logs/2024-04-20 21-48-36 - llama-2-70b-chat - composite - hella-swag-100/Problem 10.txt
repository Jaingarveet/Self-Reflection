Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to be patient with your dog [title] Be consistent. [step] Losing patience with your dog can cause them to be confused. Your dog may not know what you want or how you will react if they do something.
Choices:
  A: If you are busy with work and are away from home, time will slip away from your dog and ruin their routine. [substeps] Not knowing what you want or how you will react may cause them to have a hard time adjusting to being patient.

  C: By being consistently patient, you help keep your dog from getting confused. [substeps] For example, if you are patient one day while doing something with them, but then yell and get frustrated the next day, the dog will be confused and not know how to act.
  D: Make sure your dog knows what you want before you begin. [substeps] Give your dog patience to follow you.
