Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
The correct answer is [REDACTED]. The text is providing instructions on how to clean a dryer drum, and the previous step mentioned unplugging the dryer to prevent accidents. Therefore, the next step would naturally be to ensure that the dryer is properly unplugged. Option [REDACTED] provides the necessary steps to ensure that the dryer is safely unplugged, which aligns with the context of the instructions.

Option [REDACTED] does not relate to unplugging the dryer and instead jumps to removing an inside fitting, which is not the next logical step.

Option [REDACTED] mentions static behind the agitator coils, but this is not relevant to unplugging the dryer.

Option [REDACTED] provides an incorrect location for the plug, which is not helpful in unplugging the dryer.

Therefore, the best answer is [REDACTED].
