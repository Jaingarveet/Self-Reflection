Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?

Choices:
  A: Lightly tap her shoulder or shoulder to gently gesture that you're interested. As soon as she notices, she has trouble fighting off the teasing.
  B: Carry on with this action until she responds with either pushing you away and telling her to leave her be, or she joins in on the fun. Either way, do this in a style that shows you're only clowning around and want her to participate-she'll hopefully get the gist and engage.
  C: Touch her shoulder and tell her that you desire to capture her attention. You could say, " i know you've been thinking we've been talking about this, but let's get your mind on the night ".
  D: Initiate the fight by turning on your lights. Walk up to her and strike her on the arm you want her to exit the room.
