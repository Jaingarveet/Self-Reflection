Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to decorate white bedding [title] Pick bedding with stitching patterns for additional texture. [step] White bedding can be a little boring if you don't add other color or texture for visual interest. Interesting stitching patterns, such as white embroidery, can introduce some much-needed texture to your bed.
Choices:
  A: You'll also add a touch of variety with the pillows and blankets. [substeps] The regular colors include merino blue and red pillows, and white linens can create a striking contrast with the exact color of your headboard.
  B: [substeps] For example, if you have a white blanket or comforter, pick one that has a stitched pattern in white. The pattern could be as simple as wavy lines, but it could be more complicated, too-anything from roses to stars or leaves.
  C: Solid color bedding is the best choice because it shows color and texture in the room without leaving bulk. [title] Add a lamp on a shelf next to your bed to add texture.
  D: Don't feel like you have to opt for a constant patterned pattern or pattern. You can choose a white color of bedding you like or sit down and start making columns about how you intend to use your linens.

Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
The text discusses the importance of adding texture to white bedding. Option [REDACTED] provides a coherent and relevant continuation of the text by suggesting that a white blanket or comforter with a stitched pattern can add texture to the bed. It also offers a specific example of a pattern, such as wavy lines, roses, stars, or leaves, which can add visual interest to the bedding.

Option [REDACTED] mentions pillows and blankets, but it does not directly relate to the topic of adding texture to white bedding. Option [REDACTED] suggests solid color bedding, which may not provide the same level of texture as patterned bedding. Option [REDACTED] is not a coherent completion of the text, as it mentions a constant patterned pattern or making columns about using linens, which is not related to the topic of adding texture to white bedding.

Therefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED].
