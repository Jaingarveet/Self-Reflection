Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to set a table [title] Put down the placemat. [step] Put a placemat in front of each of the chairs you've set up for your guests. [substeps] For a true formal dinner setting, you should have enough matching placemats for all of the guests, and the placemats should also match the tablecloth.
Choices:
  A: [title] Place more cloth napkins around the table. [step] Depending on your guests' tastes and how formal the event is, and what your menu calls for, you may need more napkins to help hold the tablecloth together.
  B: [title] Place the napkin on the left side of the placemat. [step] Fold the napkin in halves or fourths, depending on the napkin.
  C: You should also have enough placemats that are about 2 feet (0.91 m) off the ground. [title] Set the tablecloth right next to the chairs.
  D: For a fancier dinner setting, you may want to ask for some placemats that have even more flair. These include boutonnieres, bold colored napkins and other embellishments.

Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
The given text discusses setting a table, specifically mentioning placemats and tablecloths. The next logical step would be to place the napkin on the placemat, which is option [REDACTED].

Option [REDACTED] is not related to the context and seems out of place.
Option [REDACTED] is not relevant to the current step of setting the table and seems to be a random statement.
Option [REDACTED] may be a good idea for a fancier dinner setting, but it does not follow logically from the previous steps.

Therefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED]: Place the napkin on the left side of the placemat.
