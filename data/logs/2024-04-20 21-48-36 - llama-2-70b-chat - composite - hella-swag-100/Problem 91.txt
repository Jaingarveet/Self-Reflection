  I apologize for my previous mistake. After reflecting on the problem, I realize that my answer was incorrect. The correct answer is A: put an accessory on the woman's lower lip.

I made a mistake in my previous answer by not carefully reading the text and considering the context of the situation. I should have focused on the information provided in the text and not been distracted by irrelevant information.
