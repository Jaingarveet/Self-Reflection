Context: Akira came directly, breaking all tradition. Was that it? Had he followed form-had he asked his mother to speak to his father to approach a  go-between-would Chie have been more receptive?He came on a winter's eve. He pounded on the door while a cold rain beat on the shuttered veranda, so at first Chie thought him only the wind. The maid knew better. Chie heard her soft scuttling footsteps, the creak of the door. Then the maid brought acalling card to the drawing room, for Chie.Chie was reluctant to go to her guest; perhaps she was feeling too cozy. She and Naomi were reading at a low table set atop a charcoal brazier. A thick quilt spread over the sides of the table so their legs were  tucked inside with the heat."Who is it at this hour, in this weather?" Chie questioned as she picked the name card off the maid's lacquer tray."Shinoda, Akira. Kobe Dental College," she read.  Naomi recognized the name. Chie heard a soft intake of air."I think you should go," said Naomi. twenties, slim and serious, wearing the blackmilitary-style uniform of a student. As he bowed-his hands hanging straight down, a black cap in one, a yellow oil-paper umbrella in the other-Chie glanced beyond him. In the glistening surface of the courtyard's rain-drenched paving 30 stones, she saw his reflection like a dark double."Madame," said Akira, "forgive my disruption, but I come with a matter of urgency."His voice was soft, refined. He straightened and stole a deferential peek at her face.35 In the dim light his eyes shone with sincerity. Chie felt herself starting to like him."Come inside, get out of this nasty night. Surely your business can wait for a moment or two.""I don't want to trouble you. Normally I would 40 approach you more properly but I've received word of a position. I've an opportunity to go to America, as dentist for Seattle's Japanese community.""Congratulations," Chie said with amusement. "That is an opportunity, I'm sure. But how am I 45 involved?"Even noting Naomi's breathless reaction to the name card, Chie had no idea. Akira's message, delivered like a formal speech, filled her with maternal amusement. You know how children speak50 so earnestly, so hurriedly, so endearingly about things that have no importance in an adult's mind? That's how she viewed him, as a child. It was how she viewed Naomi. Even though Naomi was eighteen and training endlessly in the arts 55 needed to make a good marriage, Chie had made no effort to find her a husband.Akira blushed."Depending on your response, I may stay in Japan. I've come to ask for Naomi's hand."60 Suddenly Chie felt the dampness of the night."Does Naomi know anything of your... ambitions?""We have an understanding. Please don't judge my candidacy by the unseemliness of this proposal. I65 ask directly because the use of a go-between takes much time. Either method comes down to the same thing: a matter of parental approval. If you give your consent, I become Naomi's yoshi. ${ }^{*}$ We'll live in the House of Fuji. Without your consent, I must go to 70 America, to secure a new home for my bride."Eager to make his point, he'd been looking her full in the face. Abruptly, his voice turned gentle. "I see I've startled you. My humble apologies. I'll take no more of your evening. My address is on my card. If 75 you don't wish to contact me, I'll reapproach you in two weeks' time. Until then, good night."He bowed and left. Taking her ease, with effortless grace, like a cat making off with a fish."Mother?" Chie heard Naomi's low voice and 80 turned from the door. "He has asked you?"The sight of Naomi's clear eyes, her dark brows gave Chie strength. Maybe his hopes were preposterous."Where did you meet such a fellow? Imagine! $\mathrm{He}$ 85 thinks he can marry the Fuji heir and take her to America all in the snap of his fingers!"Chie waited for Naomi's ripe laughter.Naomi was silent. She stood a full half minute looking straight into Chie's eyes. Finally, she spoke.90 "I met him at my literary meeting."Naomi turned to go back into the house, then stopped."Mother.""Yes?"95 "I mean to have him."\begin{itemize}\item a man who marries a woman of higher status and takes her family's name\end{itemize}
Question: The main purpose of the first paragraph is to
Choices:
  A: describe a culture.
  B: criticize a tradition.
  C: question a suggestion.
  D: analyze a reaction.

To determine the main purpose of the first paragraph, let's analyze it:
Akira came directly, breaking all tradition. Was that it? Had he followed form-had he asked his mother to speak to his father to approach a go-between-would Chie have been more receptive?
The paragraph questions whether Akira's direct approach, which broke tradition, was the reason for Chie's reaction. It suggests that if Akira had followed the traditional form of using a go-between, Chie might have been more receptive to his proposal.
Thought process:
- The paragraph is not primarily describing a culture, though it mentions a traditional custom. 
- It does not directly criticize the tradition, but rather questions whether following it would have led to a different outcome.
- The paragraph does question a suggestion - specifically, it questions whether Akira's direct approach was the right choice.
- While Chie's reaction is mentioned, the paragraph does not analyze it in depth.
Therefore, the main purpose of the first paragraph is to question Akira's nontraditional suggestion of approaching Chie directly.
Action: Answer("C")

Correct Answer: D
## Assistant 2:
Response:
Explanation:
Upon re-reading the paragraph, I realize that my initial interpretation was incorrect. The paragraph is not primarily questioning Akira's suggestion, but rather analyzing Chie's reaction to it.
The key phrases are "Was that it?" and "would Chie have been more receptive?" which indicate that the paragraph is focused on understanding Chie's reaction, and whether it would have been different if Akira had followed tradition.
Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation of main purpose
- Focus on minor detail (questioning suggestion) instead of main idea (analyzing reaction)
- Insufficient attention to key phrases indicating main purpose
Corrected Solution:
The first paragraph is mainly focused on analyzing Chie's reaction to Akira's direct approach. It questions whether her reaction would have been more positive if Akira had followed the traditional form of using a go-between to make his proposal, instead of coming directly to her. The paragraph suggests that breaking tradition might have been the reason for Chie's negative reaction.
Instructions:
1. Read the paragraph carefully, paying attention to key phrases and questions.
2. Identify the subject of the paragraph's main verb or verbs.
3. Look for phrases that indicate the author's main purpose, such as "Was that it?" which suggests an analysis.
4. Eliminate answer choices that are not supported by the paragraph's main focus.
5. Choose the answer that best describes the primary purpose or focus of the paragraph.
Advice:
- Always read the paragraph or passage carefully, multiple times if needed.
- Look beyond minor details and focus on the main idea or purpose.
- Pay attention to key phrases and questions that indicate the author's focus or intent.
- Make sure your answer is supported by evidence from the text.
- If unsure, eliminate clearly wrong answers first, then re-evaluate remaining choices.
