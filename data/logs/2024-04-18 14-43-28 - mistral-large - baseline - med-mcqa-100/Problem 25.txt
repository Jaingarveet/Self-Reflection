Question: A 5-day-old term male neonate presents with delayed passage of meconium, abdominal distension and bilious vomiting. Barium enema and intestinal biopsy findings are shown below. What is the diagnosis?
Choices:
  A: Congenital aganglionic megacolon
  B: Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis
  C: Cystic fibrosis
  D: Intestinal malrotation
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The symptoms described in the question, including delayed passage of meconium, abdominal distension, and bilious vomiting, are consistent with a bowel obstruction in a neonate.
Barium enema and intestinal biopsy findings are provided, which are important for the diagnosis.
A barium enema would show a narrowed segment of the colon with a transition zone in congenital aganglionic megacolon (Hirschsprung's disease), while an intestinal biopsy would show the absence of ganglion cells in the submucosal and myenteric plexuses.
Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis typically presents with non-bilious, projectile vomiting, and a palpable "olive-like" mass in the epigastric region.
Cystic fibrosis can present with meconium ileus, but this is usually diagnosed prenatally or at birth, and the symptoms described are not typical.
Intestinal malrotation can present with bilious vomiting, but this is usually associated with midgut volvulus, which is a surgical emergency, and the barium enema findings would be different.
Action: Answer("A")
