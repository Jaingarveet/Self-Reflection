Question: Which one of the following is NOT a feature of Kaagener's syndrome -
Choices:
  A: Bronchiectasis
  B: Ciliary dyskinesia
  C: Pancreatic insufficiency
  D: Situs inversus
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Kartagener's syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the triad of bronchiectasis, sinusitis, and situs inversus (mirror-image arrangement of the major organs). It is caused by dysfunctional cilia, which are small hair-like structures that line the respiratory tract and help move mucus and debris out of the lungs.
Ciliary dyskinesia is a hallmark feature of Kartagener's syndrome, as the dysfunctional cilia are unable to effectively clear mucus from the lungs, leading to chronic respiratory infections and bronchiectasis.
Pancreatic insufficiency is not a feature of Kartagener's syndrome.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
