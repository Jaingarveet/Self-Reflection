Question: A patient underwent lateral skull base surgery few months back and has presented with complaints of recurrent aspirations. There is no change in voice of the patient. Which of the following nerve is most likely injured during surgery?
Choices:
  A: Vagus nerve
  B: Glossopharyngeal nerve
  C: SLN nerve
  D: RLN nerve
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Recurrent aspirations can be caused by dysphagia, which is a difficulty in swallowing. The vagus nerve (cranial nerve X) is responsible for the motor function of the soft palate, pharynx, and larynx, and it also provides sensory information from these areas. Injury to the vagus nerve can cause dysphagia and aspiration.

The glossopharyngeal nerve (cranial nerve IX) is responsible for the sensation of the posterior third of the tongue, the pharynx, and the middle ear, and it also controls the stylopharyngeus muscle, which helps elevate the larynx during swallowing. Injury to the glossopharyngeal nerve can cause dysphagia, but it is less likely to cause aspiration.

The SLN nerve (superior laryngeal nerve) is a branch of the vagus nerve that provides sensory information from the larynx and motor function to the cricothyroid muscle, which helps control the pitch of the voice. Injury to the SLN nerve can cause hoarseness or a change in voice, but it is less likely to cause aspiration.

The RLN nerve (recurrent laryngeal nerve) is a branch of the vagus nerve that provides motor function to all the muscles of the larynx except the cricothyroid muscle. Injury to the RLN nerve can cause hoarseness or a change in voice, but it is less likely to cause aspiration.

Since the patient has no change in voice, it is unlikely that the SLN or RLN nerve is injured. Therefore, the most likely nerve to be injured during surgery is the vagus nerve.
