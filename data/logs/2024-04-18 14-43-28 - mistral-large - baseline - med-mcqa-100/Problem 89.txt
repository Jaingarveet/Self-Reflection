Question: In Spondylolisthesis, which of the following is NOT useful investigation?
Choices:
  A: Anteroposterior X-ray
  B: Lateral view X-ray
  C: CT
  D: MRI
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Spondylolisthesis is a condition in which one vertebra slips forward over the one below it.
Anteroposterior and lateral view X-rays are useful for diagnosing spondylolisthesis and assessing the degree of slippage.
CT scans can provide more detailed images of the vertebrae and can help identify any bony abnormalities.
MRI scans can provide detailed images of the soft tissues, including the spinal cord and nerves, and can help identify any compression or damage to these structures.
However, none of the choices listed is NOT useful in investigating spondylolisthesis.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")

Note: I apologize for the mistake in my previous response. The correct answer is "None of the Above" since all the choices listed are useful investigations for spondylolisthesis.
## Result:
Agent Answer: N
