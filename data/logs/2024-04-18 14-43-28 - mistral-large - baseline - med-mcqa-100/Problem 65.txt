## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Post-radiation skin lesions like desquamation are typically treated with topical treatments to promote healing and prevent infection.
Petroleum jellies are commonly used to keep the skin moist and prevent further irritation.
Observation alone is not sufficient treatment for desquamation.
Surgery is not typically used for desquamation.
Antibiotic coverage may be used if there is an infection present, but it is not the primary treatment for desquamation.
