## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Necrosis is a type of cell death that occurs due to external factors such as injury, infection, or toxins. It is characterized by the loss of cell membrane integrity, leading to the release of cellular contents into the surrounding tissue.
The primary cause of necrosis is not calcium efflux, fat deposition, or water imbibition. Instead, it is due to enzymatic digestion of the cell by its own lysosomal enzymes or by external enzymes released from damaged cells.
