Choices:
  A: Open fontanelles
  B: Inexpensive
  C: Children more co-operative
  D: Better resolution
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Time sector scanning is a technique used in ultrasound imaging where the transducer is kept stationary and only a small sector of the image is updated in real-time. This technique is preferred for neonates because their fontanelles are still open, allowing for better penetration of the ultrasound waves and improved visualization of the brain.
