Question: Which of the following ovarian tumor is most prone to undergo torsion during pregnancy :
Choices:
  A: Serous cystadenoma
  B: Mucinous cystadenoma
  C: Dermoid cyst
  D: Theca lutein cyst
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Ovarian tumors that are most prone to undergo torsion during pregnancy are typically small, mobile, and have a long pedicle.
Dermoid cysts are often large and have a thick capsule, making them less likely to undergo torsion.
Serous and mucinous cystadenomas are typically benign and slow-growing, and are not particularly prone to torsion.
Theca lutein cysts are associated with high levels of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), which is produced during pregnancy, and are therefore more likely to occur during pregnancy. They are also typically small and mobile, making them more prone to torsion.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
