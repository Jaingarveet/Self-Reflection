Question: X-ray feature of pyloric stenosis is â€“
Choices:
  A: Single bubble appearance
  B: Double bubble appearance
  C: Triple bubble appearance
  D: Multiple air fluid levels
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Pyloric stenosis is a condition where the pylorus, the opening between the stomach and the small intestine, becomes narrowed or blocked.
The classic X-ray feature of pyloric stenosis is a "string sign" or "double-track sign," which is caused by the thickened pyloric muscle.
However, this is not an option in the given choices.
The "single bubble appearance" is a feature of duodenal atresia, not pyloric stenosis.
The "double bubble appearance" is a feature of duodenal atresia or duodenal stenosis, not pyloric stenosis.
The "triple bubble appearance" is a feature of jejunal atresia, not pyloric stenosis.
The "multiple air fluid levels" are a feature of small bowel obstruction, not pyloric stenosis.
Therefore, none of the given choices is the correct answer.
However, since I must select one of the available choices, I will choose the closest one, which is "B: Double bubble appearance."
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
