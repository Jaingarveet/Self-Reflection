## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Spring catarrh is a seasonal allergic reaction characterized by symptoms such as sneezing, runny nose, and itchy eyes. It is caused by an overreaction of the immune system to environmental allergens such as pollen.
The four types of hypersensitivity reactions are:

* Type I: immediate hypersensitivity, mediated by IgE antibodies and mast cells/basophils (e.g., anaphylaxis, allergic rhinitis)
* Type II: cytotoxic hypersensitivity, mediated by IgG or IgM antibodies and complement (e.g., hemolytic anemia, Goodpasture's disease)
* Type III: immune complex-mediated hypersensitivity, mediated by antigen-antibody complexes and complement (e.g., serum sickness, Arthus reaction)
* Type IV: delayed-type hypersensitivity, mediated by T cells (e.g., contact dermatitis, tuberculin reaction)

Spring catarrh is a type I hypersensitivity reaction.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
