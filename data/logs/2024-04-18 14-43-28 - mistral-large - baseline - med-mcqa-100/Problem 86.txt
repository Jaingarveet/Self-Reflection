Question: A young male presents with abdominal pain. CT scan shows heterogenous necrotizing mass at left renal hilum. His AFP or hCG levels are elevated. The MOST likely diagnosis is:
Choices:
  A: Lymphoma
  B: Transitional cell carcinoma
  C: Metastatic melanoma
  D: Metastatic germ cell tumour
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The patient's presentation of abdominal pain, a heterogenous necrotizing mass at the left renal hilum, and elevated AFP or hCG levels suggest a malignancy.
Lymphoma typically presents with lymphadenopathy and B symptoms (fever, night sweats, weight loss).
Transitional cell carcinoma typically presents with hematuria and is more common in older adults.
Metastatic melanoma typically presents with skin lesions and is less likely to present with a renal mass.
Metastatic germ cell tumors can present with a renal mass and elevated AFP or hCG levels, which is consistent with the patient's presentation.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
