## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The third solo must be a traditional piece, and exactly two traditional pieces must be performed consecutively. Therefore, the fourth solo cannot be a traditional piece if the third solo is a traditional piece. Also, no traditional piece is performed until Wayne performs at least one modern piece. Therefore, Wayne must perform the first or second solo. If Wayne performs the first solo, then the second solo cannot be a traditional piece. If Wayne performs the second solo, then the first solo must be a modern piece. If the fourth solo is a traditional piece, then Zara must perform a modern piece in the fifth solo. Therefore, the solos that are traditional pieces could be the third and fifth solos. 
Action: Answer("D")
