## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Assistant 2:
Thought:
If the line passes through the origin, then the coordinates of both points must satisfy the equation of the line. 
The equation of the line passing through $(2,k)$ and $(k,32)$ is $y-k=\frac{32-k}{k-2}(x-2)$.
If the line passes through the origin, then $(0,0)$ must satisfy the equation of the line.
Substituting $(0,0)$ into the equation of the line gives $-k=-\frac{k-32}{2}$.
Solving for $k$ gives $k=16$.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
