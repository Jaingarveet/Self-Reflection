## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let the number of members in the club be n.
The first term of the A.P. is 7 years.
The sum of the ages of all the members is 250.
The common difference is 3 months, which is 1/4 years.
The sum of the ages of all the members can be expressed as the sum of an A.P.
The formula for the sum of an A.P. is Sn = n/2[2a + (n-1)d], where Sn is the sum of the first n terms, a is the first term, and d is the common difference.
We need to convert the ages to years to use the formula.
Action: 
The age of the youngest member is 7 years.
The sum of the ages of all the members is 250.
The common difference is 1/4 years.
The sum of the ages of all the members can be expressed as the sum of an A.P.
250 = n/2[2(7) + (n-1)(1/4)]
Simplifying the equation:
500 = n[14 + (n-1)(1/4)]
500 = 14n + (n^2 - n)/4
Multiplying both sides by 4:
2000 = 56n + n^2 - n
Rearranging the equation:
n^2 + 55n - 2000 = 0
Using the quadratic formula:
n = (-55 ± sqrt(55^2 + 4(1)(2000))) / 2(1)
n = (-55 ± sqrt(3125)) / 2
n = (-55 ± 5*sqrt(125)) / 2
n = (-55 ± 25sqrt(5)) / 2
Since n must be a positive integer, we take the positive value:
n = (-55 + 25sqrt(5)) / 2
n ≈ 18.09
The number of members in the club is approximately 18.
