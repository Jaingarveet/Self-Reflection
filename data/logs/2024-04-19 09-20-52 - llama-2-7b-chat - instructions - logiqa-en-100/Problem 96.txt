Context: Based on the following questions? Most people think that advertisers do whatever they can to attract customers.But advertisers are not always like this.Recently, in order to expand sales, a family magazine called "Bay" was renamed "Inferno", which mainly published violent and pornographic content.As a result, some perennial advertisers from the original "Bay" magazine refused to renew the contract and turned to other publications.This shows that these advertisers not only consider economic benefits, but also take into account their ethical responsibilities.
Question: If the following item is true, can the argument be strengthened most?
Choices:
  A: The cost and selling price of "Inferno" are lower than that of "Harbour".
  B: The above advertisers who refused to renew their contracts have not affected the benefits after switching to other publications.
  C: Readers of family magazines are generally not interested in violent and pornographic content.

## Assistant 2:
  Thought: Upon further reflection, I realize that the correct answer is (C) Readers of family magazines are generally not interested in violent and pornographic content.

The argument being strengthened is that the advertisers' decision to refuse to renew their contracts with the renamed magazine "Inferno" is not solely based on economic benefits, but also on their ethical responsibilities. The fact that readers of family magazines are not interested in violent and pornographic content supports this argument.

Previously, I answered the question incorrectly by selecting (B) The above advertisers who refused to renew their contracts have not affected the benefits after switching to other publications. However, upon further reflection, I realize that this answer does not strengthen the argument as it does not take into account the readers' preferences and interests.

[REDACTED]
