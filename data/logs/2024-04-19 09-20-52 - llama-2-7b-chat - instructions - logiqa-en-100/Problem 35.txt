## Assistant 2:
  Thought:
I previously answered this question by assuming that if Zhang was hired by Tianxuan, then Wang must have been hired by Tianxuan. However, this leads to a logical contradiction as the statement "If Zhang was hired by Tianxuan, then Wang was hired by Tianxuan" implies that both Zhang and Wang were hired by Tianxuan, which is not possible since only one of them can be hired by that unit.

Action: Answer("D")

Reflection:
I realized that the correct answer is D: Only Wang was hired by Tianxuan. This is because the statement "If Zhang was hired by Tianxuan, then Wang was hired by Tianxuan" is false, as Zhang was not hired by Tianxuan. Therefore, the only possible answer is that only Wang was hired by Tianxuan.
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
