## Assistant 2:
  Thought: I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I need to reevaluate the problem to find the correct solution.

Let's analyze the requirements given in the problem:

1. Guo Yanran and Tang Xiaohua are not selected at the same time.
2. Peng Youwen and Song Kaiwen are not selected at the same time.
3. Qiu Zhijie and Tang Xiaohua are not selected at the same time.

Now, let's consider the options:

A) Tang Xiaohua - Since Guo Yanran and Tang Xiaohua are not selected at the same time, it means that Tang Xiaohua cannot be selected with Guo Yanran. Therefore, the answer is B: Peng Youwen.

Reflection: I made a mistake in my previous answer. I should have considered the requirements more carefully. Thank you for providing the opportunity to reflect and improve my thinking.

Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
