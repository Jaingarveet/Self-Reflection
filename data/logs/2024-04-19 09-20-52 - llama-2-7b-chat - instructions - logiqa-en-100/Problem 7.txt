## Assistant 2:
  Thought: 
I previously answered choice A, but upon further reflection, I realize that it is not the correct explanation. The statement suggests that even small amounts of the chemical can poison mammals, including seals, but some people have not been poisoned after eating the same fish. This contradicts choice A, as the fish should have been affected by the chemical if it is toxic to mammals.

Action: Answer("B")

Reflection:
I realized that choice B is the most helpful explanation for the contradictions in the statement. According to choice B, toxic chemicals gather in the parts of the fish that seals eat but people don't. This means that the fish may contain high levels of the chemical in the parts that seals consume, which could explain why seals died after eating the fish, but people who do not eat the fish or its products are not affected.
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
