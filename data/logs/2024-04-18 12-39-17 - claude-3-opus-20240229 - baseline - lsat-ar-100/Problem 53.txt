Context: A realtor will show a prospective buyer seven houses—J, K, L, M, N, 0, and P—during a single day. The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning; the third, fourth, and fifth houses to be shown will be shown in the afternoon; the sixth and seventh houses to be shown will be shown in the evening. The houses will be shown according to the following rules: J must be shown in the evening. K cannot be shown in the morning. L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
Question: Which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: K is shown in the evening.
  B: L is shown in the afternoon.
  C: L is shown in the evening.
  D: M is shown in the morning.
  E: M is shown in the afternoon.
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. J must be shown in the evening. This means J is either the 6th or 7th house shown.
2. K cannot be shown in the morning. So K must be shown in either the afternoon or evening.
3. L must be shown after K and before M. 
4. If K is shown in the afternoon (3rd, 4th, or 5th), then L must also be shown in the afternoon, after K. M would then be shown in the evening.
5. If K is shown in the evening (6th or 7th, but not the same as J), then L cannot be shown before K. M would then be shown in either the morning or afternoon.
6. In both scenarios, L is always shown in the afternoon. This is the only consistent fact across all possible orderings given the rules.
Therefore, the answer that must be true is:
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
