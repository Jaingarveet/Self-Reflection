The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Law
Context: Exactly five witnesses—Franco, Garcia, Hong, Iturbe, and Jackson—are to be scheduled to testify at a hearing that is to take exactly three days of one week—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Each witness testifies on exactly one day of the hearing. The schedule must meet the following conditions: Franco does not testify on the same day that Garcia testifies. Iturbe testifies on Wednesday. Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday. Hong does not testify on Monday. At least one witness testifies on Monday.
Question: If Jackson is scheduled to testify on Wednesday, which one of the following must be true of the schedule?
Choices:
  A: Franco is scheduled to testify on Monday.
  B: Garcia is scheduled to testify on Monday.
  C: Exactly one witness is scheduled to testify on Monday.
  D: Exactly two witnesses are scheduled to testify on Monday.
  E: Garcia is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong.
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. Iturbe and Jackson are scheduled to testify on Wednesday. This leaves Franco, Garcia, and Hong to be scheduled on Monday and Tuesday.
2. Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday. This means that either Franco and Garcia testify on Tuesday (and Hong on Monday), or Franco and Hong testify on Tuesday (and Garcia on Monday), or Garcia and Hong testify on Tuesday (and Franco on Monday).
3. However, we know that Franco and Garcia cannot testify on the same day. This eliminates the possibility of both of them testifying on Tuesday.
4. We also know that Hong does not testify on Monday. This eliminates the possibility of Hong testifying on Monday and Franco and Garcia testifying on Tuesday.
5. The only remaining possibility is that Garcia testifies on Monday, while Franco and Hong testify on Tuesday.
6. Since Garcia must testify on Monday, and we know at least one witness testifies on Monday, it must be true that exactly one witness (Garcia) is scheduled to testify on Monday.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
