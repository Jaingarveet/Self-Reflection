Context: On the first day of a two-day study for a cycling magazine, four riders—Reynaldo, Seamus, Theresa, and Yuki—will each test one of four bicycles—F, G, H, and J. Each rider will then test a different one of the bicycles on the second day. Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day. The assignment of riders to bicycles is subject to the following conditions: Reynaldo cannot test F. Yuki cannot test J. Theresa must be one of the testers for H. The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
Question: If Theresa tests G on the second day, then which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Reynaldo tests H on the first day.
  B: Reynaldo tests J on the first day.
  C: Theresa tests H on the second day.
  D: Theresa tests J on the first day.
  E: Yuki tests H on the second day.
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. Reynaldo cannot test F, and Yuki cannot test J. 
2. Theresa must test H on one of the days.
3. The bicycle Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
Now, let's consider the scenario where Theresa tests G on the second day:
4. If Theresa tests G on the second day, she must test H on the first day (given condition 2).
5. Yuki cannot test J, so he must test either F, G, or H on the first day.
6. The bicycle Yuki tests on the first day will be tested by Seamus on the second day (given condition 3).
7. Seamus cannot test H on the second day because Theresa is testing H on the first day.
8. Therefore, Yuki must test either F or G on the first day, and Seamus will test the same bicycle on the second day.
9. Reynaldo will test the remaining bicycle (J) on the first day.
Therefore, if Theresa tests G on the second day, Reynaldo must test J on the first day.
