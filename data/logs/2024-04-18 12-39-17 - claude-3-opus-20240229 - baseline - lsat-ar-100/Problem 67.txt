Context: A bakery makes exactly three kinds of cookieâ€”oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar. Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day. The following conditions apply: No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
Question: If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Exactly three batches of cookies are made on Tuesday.
  B: Exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday.
  C: At least two batches of cookies are made on Monday.
  D: At least two batches of cookies are made on Thursday.
  E: Fewer batches of cookies are made on Monday than on Tuesday.
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. We know that no cookies are made on Wednesday.
2. At least one batch is made on Monday.
3. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday. This means one of the other two batches of sugar cookies must be made on Monday or Tuesday, and the other on Friday.
4. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. This could be Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, or Friday.
5. If no cookies are made on Wednesday, and at least one batch is made on Monday, then the remaining 8 batches must be distributed across Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday.
6. Since the second sugar batch is on Thursday, and no two batches of the same kind are made on the same day, there must be at least one other type of cookie batch made on Thursday.
Therefore, the correct answer is D: At least two batches of cookies are made on Thursday.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
