## User 2:
Topic: Law
Context: Of the eight students—George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert—in a seminar, exactly six will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
Question: If Helen, Kyle, and Lenore, not necessarily in that order, give the three morning reports, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Helen gives a report on Monday.
  B: Irving gives a report on Monday.
  C: Irving gives a report on Wednesday.
  D: Kyle gives a report on Tuesday.
  E: Kyle gives a report on Wednesday.
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. We know that Helen, Kyle, and Lenore give the three morning reports.
2. George can only report on Tuesday, so he must give the afternoon report on Tuesday.
3. Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports, so they must give morning reports (if they report at all).
4. If Nina reports, then Helen and Irving must report the next day, unless Nina reports on Wednesday.
5. Since Helen gives a morning report, Nina cannot report on Tuesday or Wednesday (as that would require Helen to report the next day, which is impossible).
6. So, Nina must report on Monday afternoon, if at all.
7. This means that Helen and Irving must report on Tuesday. But George is already reporting on Tuesday afternoon, so Irving must report on Tuesday morning.
8. The only remaining slot for Helen is Monday morning.
Therefore, Helen must give a report on Monday morning.
Action: Answer("A")
