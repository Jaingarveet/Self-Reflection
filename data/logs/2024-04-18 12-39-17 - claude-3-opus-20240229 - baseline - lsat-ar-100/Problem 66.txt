## User 2:
Topic: Law
Context: An editor will edit seven articles, one at a time. Three of the articles—G, H, and J—cover finance; three other articles—Q, R, and S—cover nutrition; and the remaining article, Y, covers wildlife. The order in which the articles are edited is subject to the following conditions: Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other. S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third. S must be earlier than Y. J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
Question: The order in which the articles are edited is fully determined if which one of the following is true?
Choices:
  A: H is fourth.
  B: H is sixth.
  C: R is fourth.
  D: R is seventh.
  E: Y is fifth.
## Assistant 2:
To determine which choice fully determines the order, let's consider each option and see if it leads to a unique order.
A: If H is fourth, then G and J must be 1st and 3rd in some order (to satisfy the finance articles alternating with other topics). This leaves positions 2, 5, 6, and 7 for Q, R, S, and Y. S must be before Y, but their exact positions are not fixed. So A does not fully determine the order.
B: If H is sixth, then G and J must be 2nd and 4th (to alternate topics). J must be earlier than G, so J is 2nd and G is 4th. S must be earlier than Y, and the only spot left for S before 6th is 1st. This puts Y in 3rd, Q in 5th, and R in 7th. So B fully determines a unique order: S, J, Y, G, Q, H, R.
C and D: If R is 4th or 7th, there are still multiple possibilities for the positions of the other nutrition articles Q and S, as well as Y. So C and D do not fully determine the order.
E: If Y is 5th, S must be 1st or 3rd. But this leaves multiple options for arranging the other articles. So E does not fully determine the order.
Action: Answer("B")
