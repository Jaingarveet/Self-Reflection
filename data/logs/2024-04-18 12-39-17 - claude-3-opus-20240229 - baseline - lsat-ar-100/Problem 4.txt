Context: A chemistry class has six lab sessions scheduled over three days—Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday—one session heing held each morning and one each afternoon. Each session will be led by a different lab assistant—Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, or Rebecca. The assignment of lab assistants to sessions is constrained as follows: Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day. Nessa must lead an afternoon session. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
Question: If Lan does not lead a Wednesday session, then which one of the following lab assistants must lead a Thursday session?
Choices:
  A: Rebecca
  B: Olivia
  C: Nessa
  D: Kevin
  E: Julio
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions on the same day.
2. If Lan does not lead a Wednesday session, then she must lead either a Thursday or Friday session.
3. If Lan leads a Thursday or Friday session, then Olivia must lead a Wednesday session (because they can't be on the same day).
4. Julio's session must be earlier in the week than Olivia's.
5. Since Olivia is on Wednesday, Julio must lead a Wednesday morning session (the only option earlier than Olivia's Wednesday afternoon session).
6. Nessa must lead an afternoon session, so she leads the Wednesday afternoon session.
7. Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions on the same day. Since Wednesday is fully booked, they must lead the Thursday sessions.
Therefore, if Lan does not lead a Wednesday session, then Kevin must lead a Thursday session.
Action: Answer("D")
