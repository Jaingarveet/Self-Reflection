Context: At a concert, exactly eight compositions—F, H, L, O, P, R, S, and T—are to be performed exactly once each, consecutively and one composition at a time. The order of their performance must satisfy the following conditions: T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R. At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F. O is performed either first or fifth. The eighth composition performed is either L or H. P is performed at some time before S. At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
Question: If O is performed immediately after T, then F must be performed either
Choices:
  A: first or second
  B: second or third
  C: fourth or sixth
  D: fourth or seventh
  E: sixth or seventh
## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. We know that T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.
2. We're told that O is performed immediately after T. This means T cannot be immediately after R (because O is after T). Therefore, T must be immediately before F.
3. We also know that at least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F. Since T is immediately before F, this means at least two compositions must be performed after R and before F.
4. O is performed either first or fifth. Since O is immediately after T, and T is immediately before F, O cannot be first. Therefore, O must be fifth.
5. The eighth composition performed is either L or H. This doesn't directly affect the position of F.
6. P is performed at some time before S. This also doesn't directly affect the position of F.
7. At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O. Since O is fifth, this means at least one composition is performed after O and before S.
8. Putting this all together: O is fifth, T is fourth (immediately before F), and at least two compositions are after R and before F. The only positions left for F are sixth and seventh.
