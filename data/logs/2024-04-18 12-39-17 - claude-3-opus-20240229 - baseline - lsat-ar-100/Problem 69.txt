Context: At a concert, exactly eight compositions—F, H, L, O, P, R, S, and T—are to be performed exactly once each, consecutively and one composition at a time. The order of their performance must satisfy the following conditions: T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R. At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F. O is performed either first or fifth. The eighth composition performed is either L or H. P is performed at some time before S. At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
Question: If P is performed third and S is performed sixth, the composition performed fifth must be either
Choices:
  A: F or H
  B: F or O
  C: F or T
  D: H or L
  E: O or R
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. P is performed third and S is performed sixth. This means there are two compositions performed between P and S.
2. O must be performed either first or fifth. Since P is performed third, O must be performed fifth.
3. T must be performed either immediately before F or immediately after R. 
4. At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
5. The eighth composition performed is either L or H.
6. Putting this together, we have:
   - O is performed fifth
   - P is performed third
   - S is performed sixth
   - T is either immediately before F or immediately after R
   - L or H is performed eighth
7. Since O is performed fifth, the composition performed fifth must be O.
Action: Answer("B")
