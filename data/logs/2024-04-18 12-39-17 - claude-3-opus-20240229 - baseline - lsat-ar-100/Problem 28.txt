Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Context: A panel of five scientists will be formed. The panelists will be selected from among three botanists—F, G, and H—three chemists—K, L, and M—and three zoologists—P, Q, and R. Selection is governed by the following conditions: The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types. If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. F and K cannot both be selected. K and M cannot both be selected. If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
Question: If four of the scientists selected are F, L, Q, and R, which one of the following must be the fifth scientist selected?
Choices:
  A: G
  B: H
  C: K
  D: M
  E: P
## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. We know that the panel must include at least one scientist of each type. F is a botanist, L is a chemist, and both Q and R are zoologists. So this condition is satisfied.
2. Since F (a botanist) is selected, at most one zoologist can be selected. This condition is also satisfied as Q and R are the only zoologists selected.
3. K is not selected, so the condition that F and K cannot both be selected is satisfied.
4. M is not selected, so the conditions that K and M cannot both be selected and that if M is selected, both P and R must be selected, are not applicable.
5. Now, we need to determine the fifth scientist. We already have a botanist (F), a chemist (L), and two zoologists (Q and R). 
6. The only condition that could affect the fifth selection is that if more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist can be selected. But we already have two zoologists, so we cannot select another botanist.
7. Therefore, the fifth scientist must be a chemist, and the only remaining chemist is H.
Action: Answer("H")
## Result:
Agent Answer: H
Correct Answer: E
