Topic: Law
Context: For the school paper, five students—Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, Megregian, and O'Neill—each review one or more of exactly three plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation, but do not review any other plays. The following conditions must apply: Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
Question: Which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Jiang reviews more of the plays than Lopez does.
  B: Megregian reviews more of the plays than Jiang does.
  C: Megregian reviews more of the plays than O'Neill does.
  D: O'Neill reviews more of the plays than Jiang does.
  E: O'Neill reviews more of the plays than Kramer does.
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. Kramer and Lopez each review fewer plays than Megregian. This means Megregian reviews at least 2 plays.
2. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. This means the plays Jiang reviews are different from those reviewed by Lopez and Megregian.
3. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. This is the only definite information we have about which specific play is reviewed by whom.
4. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other. Given point 3, these two students must be Kramer and O'Neill.
Now, let's look at the answer choices:
A. We don't know how many plays Jiang and Lopez review, so this is not necessarily true.
B. We don't know how many plays Jiang reviews, so this is not necessarily true.
C. Megregian reviews at least 2 plays, but we don't know how many O'Neill reviews, so this is not necessarily true.
D. We don't know how many plays Jiang and O'Neill review, so this is not necessarily true.
E. Kramer and O'Neill review the same plays (at least Tamerlane), so this must be true.
Action: Answer("E")
## Result:
Agent Answer: E
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
