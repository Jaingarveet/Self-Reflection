Context: The organizer of a reading club will select at least five and at most six works from a group of nine works. The group consists of three French novels, three Russian novels, two French plays, and one Russian play. The organizer's selection of works must conform to the following requirements: No more than four French works are selected. At least three but no more than four novels are selected. At least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected. If both French plays are selected, then the Russian play is not selected.
Question: Which one of the following could be the organizer's selection of works?

  C: two French novels, two Russian novels, two French plays
  D: three French novels, one Russian novel, two French plays

Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The selection must have at least 5 and at most 6 works.
2. No more than 4 French works can be selected.
3. At least 3 but no more than 4 novels must be selected.
4. The number of French novels must be greater than or equal to the number of Russian novels.
5. If both French plays are selected, the Russian play cannot be selected.
Now, let's evaluate each choice:
A: This selection has 5 works, no more than 4 French works, 3 novels, and equal numbers of French and Russian novels. It also includes both plays, which is allowed. This could be a valid selection.
B: This selection has 6 works, but it includes both French plays and the Russian play, which violates requirement 5. This cannot be a valid selection.
C: This selection has 6 works, no more than 4 French works, 4 novels, and equal numbers of French and Russian novels. This could be a valid selection.
D: This selection has 6 works, but it includes 5 French works, which violates requirement 2. This cannot be a valid selection.
E: This selection has 6 works, 4 French works, 5 novels, and more French novels than Russian novels. This could be a valid selection.
Among the given choices, A, C, and E could be valid selections.
