Context: A realtor will show a prospective buyer seven houses—J, K, L, M, N, 0, and P—during a single day. The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning; the third, fourth, and fifth houses to be shown will be shown in the afternoon; the sixth and seventh houses to be shown will be shown in the evening. The houses will be shown according to the following rules: J must be shown in the evening. K cannot be shown in the morning. L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
Question: Which one of the following is a pair of houses that CANNOT be shown consecutively in either order?
Choices:
  A: J, K
  B: J, M
  C: J, O
  D: J, P
  E: M, P
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. J must be shown in the evening. This means J will be either the 6th or 7th house shown.
2. K cannot be shown in the morning. So K must be shown in either the afternoon or evening.
3. L must be shown after K and before M. This means the order of these three houses must be K, L, M.
4. Now, let's look at each answer choice:
   A: J, K - This is possible. J can be shown 6th or 7th, and K can be shown 3rd, 4th, or 5th.
   B: J, M - This is possible. J can be shown 6th or 7th, and M can be shown 4th or 5th.
   C: J, O - This is possible. J can be shown 6th, and O can be shown 7th (or vice versa).
   D: J, P - This is possible. Same reasoning as J, O.
   E: M, P - This is NOT possible. M must be shown in the afternoon (3rd, 4th, or 5th), while P must be shown in either the morning (1st or 2nd) or evening (6th or 7th). They cannot be consecutive.
Therefore, the correct answer is E: M, P cannot be shown consecutively.
Action: Answer("E")
