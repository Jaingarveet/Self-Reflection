Context: At a concert, exactly eight compositions—F, H, L, O, P, R, S, and T—are to be performed exactly once each, consecutively and one composition at a time. The order of their performance must satisfy the following conditions: T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R. At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F. O is performed either first or fifth. The eighth composition performed is either L or H. P is performed at some time before S. At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
Question: If T is performed fifth and F is performed sixth, then S must be performed either
Choices:
  A: fourth or seventh
  B: third or sixth
  C: third or fourth
  D: second or seventh
  E: first or fourth
## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. We know that T is performed fifth and F is performed sixth. This satisfies the condition that T is performed immediately before F.
2. Since T and F are performed fifth and sixth respectively, the condition "At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F" implies that R must be performed either first, second, third, or eighth.
3. O must be performed either first or fifth according to the conditions. Since T is already occupying the fifth position, O must be performed first.
4. The eighth composition performed is either L or H. This leaves the second, third, fourth, and seventh positions for the remaining compositions P, R, and S.
5. P must be performed before S. And there must be at least one composition either after O and before S, or after S and before O. 
6. If R is performed second, then P could be third and S could be fourth or seventh. This satisfies all conditions.
7. If R is performed third, then P could be second and S could be fourth or seventh. This also satisfies all conditions.
8. If R is performed eighth, then P could be second and S could be fourth, or P could be fourth and S could be seventh. Both these scenarios satisfy all conditions.
Therefore, considering all the possibilities, S must be performed either second, fourth, or seventh.
Action: Answer("D")
