Context: A chemistry class has six lab sessions scheduled over three days—Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday—one session heing held each morning and one each afternoon. Each session will be led by a different lab assistant—Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, or Rebecca. The assignment of lab assistants to sessions is constrained as follows: Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day. Nessa must lead an afternoon session. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
Question: Which one of the following could he an accurate assignment of lab assistants to morning and afternoon sessions, respectively, on the three days?
Choices:
  A: Wednesday: Rebecca, Kevin Thursday: Julio, Lan Friday: Nessa, Olivia
  B: Wednesday: Olivia, Nessa Thursday: Julio, Lan Friday: Kevin, Rebecca
  C: Wednesday: Lan, Kevin Thursday: Rebecca, Julio Friday: Olivia, Nessa
  D: Wednesday: Kevin, Rebecca Thursday: Julio, Nessa Friday: Olivia, Lan
  E: Wednesday: Julio, Lan Thursday: Olivia, Nessa Friday: Rebecca, Kevin
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions on the same day. This eliminates choices B and E.
2. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions on the same day. This eliminates choice A.
3. Nessa must lead an afternoon session. This is satisfied by both remaining choices, C and D.
4. Julio's session must be on an earlier day than Olivia's. In choice C, Julio leads on Thursday and Olivia on Friday, satisfying this condition. However, in choice D, Julio leads on Thursday but Olivia leads on Friday, violating this condition.
Therefore, the only choice that satisfies all the constraints is choice C.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: E
Score: 0
