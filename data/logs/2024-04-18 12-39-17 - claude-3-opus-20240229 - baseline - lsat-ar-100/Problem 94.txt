Context: A shopping center has exactly seven spaces—space 1 through space 7—arranged in a straight row. Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
Question: If the veterinarian is in space 5, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: The optometrist is in space 2.
  B: The pharmacy is in space 7.
  C: A restaurant is in space 4.
  D: The shoe store is in space 6.
  E: The toy store is in space 3.
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The pharmacy must be at one end (space 1 or 7), and a restaurant at the other end.
2. The veterinarian is in space 5. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. Since the pharmacy is at one end, it must be in space 7, next to the veterinarian in space 5.
3. A restaurant must be at the other end, in space 1.
4. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. With one restaurant in space 1, the other restaurant cannot be in spaces 2, 3, or 4. It must be in space 6.
5. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian. It cannot be in space 4 or 6. 
6. Looking at the choices:
   A. We don't know where the optometrist is.
   B. Correct. The pharmacy must be in space 7.
   C. A restaurant must be in space 6, not 4.
   D. We don't know where the shoe store is.
   E. We don't know where the toy store is.
Therefore, the correct answer is B.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
