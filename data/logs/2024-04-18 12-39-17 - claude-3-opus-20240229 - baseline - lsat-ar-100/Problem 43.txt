Topic: Law
Context: An editor will edit seven articles, one at a time. Three of the articles—G, H, and J—cover finance; three other articles—Q, R, and S—cover nutrition; and the remaining article, Y, covers wildlife. The order in which the articles are edited is subject to the following conditions: Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other. S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third. S must be earlier than Y. J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
Question: If Y is fourth, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: J is second.
  B: J is third
  C: Q is first.
  D: Q is third
  E: R is seventh.
## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. We know that Y (wildlife) is fourth. This means the articles in positions 3 and 5 cannot be about wildlife.
2. S must be earlier than Y. So S must be in position 1, 2, or 3.
3. If S is in position 3, then Q cannot be third (as per the condition). So if S is third, Q must be first or second.
4. If S is in position 1 or 2, then Q can be in position 3.
5. J (finance) must be earlier than G (finance), and G must be earlier than R (nutrition). So the order of these three articles must be J, G, R.
6. If Q is third, then S must be first or second (as per condition 2). In this case, J, G, R must occupy positions 5, 6, 7 in that order.
7. If Q is first, then S can be second or third. But if S is third, then J, G, R must occupy positions 5, 6, 7, which violates the condition that consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic.
Therefore, if Y is fourth, Q must be third, and R must be seventh.
Action: Answer("E")
