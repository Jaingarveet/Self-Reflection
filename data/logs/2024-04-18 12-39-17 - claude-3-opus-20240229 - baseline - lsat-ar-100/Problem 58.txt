Context: A loading dock consists of exactly six bays numbered 1 through 6 consecutively from one side of the dock to the other. Each bay is holding a different one of exactly six types of cargoâ€”fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles. The following apply: The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock. The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles. The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel. The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
Question: Which one of the following CANNOT be the type of cargo held in bay 4?
Choices:
  A: grain
  B: livestock
  C: machinery
  D: produce
  E: textiles
## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. We know that the bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock, and the bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
2. This means that the order of these three types of cargo, from lowest bay number to highest, is: textiles, livestock, grain.
3. We also know that the bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel, and that the bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
4. Since textiles must be in one of the first three bays (in order for livestock and grain to have higher numbers), and textiles is next to produce, the only possible arrangements for these two are:
   - Textiles in bay 1, produce in bay 2
   - Textiles in bay 2, produce in bay 1
   - Textiles in bay 2, produce in bay 3
   - Textiles in bay 3, produce in bay 2
5. In all of these arrangements, produce is in bay 1, 2, or 3. Therefore, produce cannot be in bay 4.
6. The question asks which type of cargo CANNOT be in bay 4, and based on the information given, produce is the only type that definitively cannot be in bay 4.
