Topic: Law
Context: A software company employs exactly seven sales representatives—Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall—to work in its three sales zones—Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3. Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Question: Which one of the following could be an accurate matching of the sales representatives to the sales zones in which they work?
Choices:
  A: Zone 1: Kim, Parra Zone 2: Stuckey, Udall Zone 3: Mahr, Quinn, Tiao
  B: Zone 1: Kim, Tiao Zone 2: Stuckey, Udall Zone 3: Mahr, Parra, Quinn
  C: Zone 1: Parra, Quinn Zone 2: Kim, Udall Zone 3: Mahr, Stuckey, Tiao
  D: Zone 1: Stuckey, Udall Zone 2: Kim, Tiao Zone 3: Mahr, Parra, Quinn
  E: Zone 1: Tiao Zone 2: Kim, Parra, Quinn Zone 3: Stuckey, Udall
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. This means if Parra is in Zone 1, Tiao must be in Zone 2 or 3, and vice versa.
2. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. This means if Tiao is in Zone 2, Udall must be in Zone 1 or 3, and vice versa.
3. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. So they must be together in whichever zone they are assigned.
4. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. So they must be together in whichever zone they are assigned.
5. There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. This means Zone 3 must have at least 3 people.
Now, let's look at the choices:
A: This violates condition 3 as Parra and Quinn are in different zones.
B: This satisfies all conditions. Parra and Quinn are together in Zone 3, Stuckey and Udall are together in Zone 2, Tiao is in Zone 1 so Parra is not, Udall is in Zone 2 so Tiao is not, and Zone 3 has more people than Zone 2.
C: This violates condition 2 as both Tiao and Udall are in Zone 3.
D: This violates condition 1 as both Parra and Tiao are in Zone 3.
E: This violates condition 4 as Stuckey and Udall are in different zones.
Therefore, the correct answer is B.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
