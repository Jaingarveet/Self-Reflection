Context: During a recital, two pianists—Wayne and Zara—will perform solos. There will be five solos altogether, performed one immediately after another. Each solo will be either a modern piece or a traditional piece. The choice of pianist and type of piece for the solos must conform to the following conditions: The third solo is a traditional piece. Exactly two of the traditional pieces are performed consecutively. In the fourth solo, either Wayne performs a traditional piece or Zara performs a modern piece. The pianist who performs the second solo does not perform the fifth solo. No traditional piece is performed until Wayne performs at least one modem piece.
Question: What is the minimum number of solos in which Wayne performs a traditional piece?
Choices:
  A: zero
  B: one
  C: two
  D: three
  E: four
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The third solo is a traditional piece. This could be performed by either Wayne or Zara.
2. Exactly two of the traditional pieces are performed consecutively. This means that either the second and third solos are traditional, or the third and fourth solos are traditional.
3. In the fourth solo, either Wayne performs a traditional piece or Zara performs a modern piece. This means that if the third and fourth solos are traditional, then Wayne must perform the fourth solo.
4. The pianist who performs the second solo does not perform the fifth solo. This doesn't directly affect the number of traditional pieces Wayne performs.
5. No traditional piece is performed until Wayne performs at least one modern piece. This is a key condition. It means that Wayne must perform a modern piece in either the first or second solo.
6. If Wayne performs a modern piece in the first solo, he could then perform traditional pieces in the third and fourth solos, satisfying all conditions. In this case, he would perform two traditional pieces.
7. If Wayne performs a modern piece in the second solo, he could then perform a traditional piece in the fourth solo, satisfying all conditions. In this case, he would perform one traditional piece.
Therefore, the minimum number of solos in which Wayne performs a traditional piece is one.
