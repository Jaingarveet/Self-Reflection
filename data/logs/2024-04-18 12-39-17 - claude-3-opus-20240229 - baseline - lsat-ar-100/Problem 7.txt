## User 2:
Topic: Law
Context: Exactly five witnesses—Franco, Garcia, Hong, Iturbe, and Jackson—are to be scheduled to testify at a hearing that is to take exactly three days of one week—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Each witness testifies on exactly one day of the hearing. The schedule must meet the following conditions: Franco does not testify on the same day that Garcia testifies. Iturbe testifies on Wednesday. Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday. Hong does not testify on Monday. At least one witness testifies on Monday.
Question: If Jackson is the only witness scheduled to testify on Monday, which one of the following must be true of the schedule?
Choices:
  A: Franco is scheduled to testify on Wednesday.
  B: Hong is scheduled to testify on Tuesday.
  C: Garcia is scheduled to testify on Tuesday.
  D: Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong.
  E: Garcia is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong.
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. We know that Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
2. Jackson is the only witness scheduled to testify on Monday.
3. This means that the remaining three witnesses (Franco, Garcia, and Hong) must all testify on Tuesday to satisfy the condition that exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
4. We also know that Franco and Garcia cannot testify on the same day.
5. Therefore, it's impossible for all three remaining witnesses to testify on Tuesday while satisfying all the conditions.
In conclusion, the question presents an impossible scenario. If Jackson is the only witness on Monday, there's no way to schedule the other witnesses to meet all the given conditions.
Since we must select one of the given choices, let's look at them:
A, B, C, and D cannot be inferred from the information given and the impossible scenario.
E is the only choice that must be true, because if Franco, Garcia, and Hong all testify on Tuesday (the impossible scenario), then Garcia would testify on the same day as Hong.
Action: Answer("E")
## Result:
Agent Answer: E
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
