Context: A realtor will show a prospective buyer seven houses—J, K, L, M, N, 0, and P—during a single day. The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning; the third, fourth, and fifth houses to be shown will be shown in the afternoon; the sixth and seventh houses to be shown will be shown in the evening. The houses will be shown according to the following rules: J must be shown in the evening. K cannot be shown in the morning. L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
Question: Which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: K is shown at some time after J is shown.
  B: L is shown at some time after J is shown.
  C: P is shown at some time after J is shown.
  D: Both N and O are shown at some time after M is
  E: Both N and P are shown at some time after K is
## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. J must be shown in the evening. This means J will be either the 6th or 7th house shown.
2. K cannot be shown in the morning. So K must be shown in either the afternoon or evening.
3. L must be shown after K and before M. This means the order of these three houses must be K, then L, then M.
4. Now, let's look at each choice:
   A: K is shown at some time after J is shown. This is not possible because J is in the evening and K cannot be in the morning, so K must be before J.
   B: L is shown at some time after J is shown. This is not possible because L must be before M, and M must be before J (since J is in the evening).
   C: P is shown at some time after J is shown. This could be true. If J is the 6th house, P could be the 7th.
   D: Both N and O are shown at some time after M is shown. This is not possible because there are only two slots after M (the evening slots), and one of those must be J.
   E: Both N and P are shown at some time after K is shown. This is not possible because L and M must be between K and any houses shown in the evening.
Therefore, the only choice that could be true is C.
Action: Answer("C")
