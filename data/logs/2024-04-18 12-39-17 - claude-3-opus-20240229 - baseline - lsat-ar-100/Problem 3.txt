Context: An administrator must assign parking spaces to six new employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young. Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
Question: If Robertson is assigned parking space #3, then which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Souza is assigned parking space #4.
  B: Togowa is assigned parking space #2.
  C: Vaughn is assigned parking space #5.
  D: Xu is assigned parking space #6.
  E: Young is assigned parking space #2.
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. Robertson is assigned parking space #3.
2. Young must be assigned a lower-numbered parking space than Robertson. So Young can only be assigned #1 or #2.
3. Togowa must be assigned a lower-numbered parking space than Young. Since Young is in #1 or #2, Togowa must be in the remaining one of those two.
4. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. The remaining spaces are #4, #5, and #6. Souza could be in #4 or #5, and Xu would be in a higher number.
5. The only definite assignment we can make based on the given information is that Xu must be in parking space #6. This is because Xu must be higher than Souza, and #6 is the only remaining higher space than both #4 and #5 where Souza could be.
Therefore, the correct answer is D: Xu is assigned parking space #6.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: E
