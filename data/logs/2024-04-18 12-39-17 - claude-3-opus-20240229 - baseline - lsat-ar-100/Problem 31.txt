Context: A bakery makes exactly three kinds of cookieâ€”oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar. Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day. The following conditions apply: No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
Question: Which one of the following could be a complete and accurate list of the days on which the batches of each kind of cookie are made?
Choices:
  A: oatmeal: Monday, Wednesday, Thursday peanut butter: Wednesday, Thursday, Friday sugar: Monday, Thursday, Friday
  B: oatmeal: Monday, Tuesday, Thursday peanut butter: Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday sugar: Monday, Wednesday, Thursday
  C: oatmeal: Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday peanut butter: Wednesday, Thursday, Friday sugar: Tuesday, Thursday, Friday
  D: oatmeal: Monday, Tuesday, Thursday peanut butter: Monday, Wednesday, Thursday sugar: Monday, Thursday, Friday
  E: oatmeal: Monday, Thursday, Friday peanut butter: Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday sugar: Monday, Thursday, Friday
## Assistant 2:
Let's go through the conditions one by one:
1. No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. This eliminates choice D, as it has two batches of oatmeal cookies made on Monday.
2. At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday. All remaining choices satisfy this condition.
3. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. This eliminates choice A, as the second batch of oatmeal cookies (Wednesday) is not made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies (Wednesday).
4. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday. All remaining choices (B, C, and E) satisfy this condition.
Now, let's check the remaining choices:
Choice B: This satisfies all conditions. The second batch of oatmeal cookies (Tuesday) is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies (Tuesday).
Choice C: This violates the condition that the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. Here, the second batch of oatmeal cookies (Wednesday) is not made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies (Wednesday).
Choice E: This violates the condition that no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. Here, two batches of sugar cookies are made on Monday.
Therefore, the correct answer is choice B.
Action: Answer("B")
