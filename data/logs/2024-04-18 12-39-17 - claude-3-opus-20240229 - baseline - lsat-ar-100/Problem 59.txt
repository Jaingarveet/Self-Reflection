Context: At a concert, exactly eight compositions—F, H, L, O, P, R, S, and T—are to be performed exactly once each, consecutively and one composition at a time. The order of their performance must satisfy the following conditions: T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R. At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F. O is performed either first or fifth. The eighth composition performed is either L or H. P is performed at some time before S. At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
Question: P CANNOT be performed
Choices:
  A: second
  B: third
  C: fourth
  D: sixth
  E: seventh
## Assistant 2:
To determine in which position P cannot be performed, let's consider each choice and the given conditions:
1. O is performed either first or fifth.
2. T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.
3. At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
4. The eighth composition performed is either L or H.
5. P is performed at some time before S.
6. At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
Choice A: P cannot be performed second.
- If O is first, P could be second, followed by compositions between O and S.
- If O is fifth, P could be second, as it's before S.
Choice B: P cannot be performed third.
- Similar to Choice A, P could be third in both cases of O's position.
Choice C: P cannot be performed fourth.
- If O is first, P could be fourth, with two compositions between O and S.
- If O is fifth, P could be fourth, as it's before S.
Choice D: P cannot be performed sixth.
- If O is first, P could be sixth, with S being seventh or eighth.
- However, if O is fifth, P cannot be sixth. There must be at least one composition between O and S, and the eighth must be L or H. If P is sixth and S seventh, there's no room for a composition between O and S.
Choice E: P cannot be performed seventh.
- If O is first, P could be seventh, with S being eighth.
- If O is fifth, P could be seventh, with S being sixth.
Therefore, the only position P cannot be performed in is sixth.
Action: Answer("D")
