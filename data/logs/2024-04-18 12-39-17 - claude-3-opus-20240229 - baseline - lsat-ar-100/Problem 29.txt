Topic: Law
Context: Exactly eight books—F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O—are placed on a bookcase with exactly three shelves—the top shelf, the middle shelf, and the bottom shelf. At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.
Question: If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: F and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  B: G and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  C: H and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  D: I and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  E: K and O are placed on the same shelf as each other.
## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. We know that I is on the middle shelf.
2. L is placed on a shelf higher than H. This means L must be on the top shelf, and H must be on the bottom shelf.
3. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. Since L is on the top shelf, O must also be on the top shelf.
4. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. F is on the same shelf as M. So K must be on a higher shelf than both F and M.
5. More books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. We know L and O are on the top shelf. So the bottom shelf must have at least 3 books.
6. H is on the bottom shelf. F and M are on the same shelf, which must be the bottom shelf to satisfy the condition of having more books than the top shelf.
7. This leaves G and K. K must be on the middle shelf with I, as it's on a higher shelf than F and M.
8. G is the only book left and must go on the bottom shelf.
Therefore, G and H are placed on the same shelf (the bottom shelf).
Action: Answer("B")
