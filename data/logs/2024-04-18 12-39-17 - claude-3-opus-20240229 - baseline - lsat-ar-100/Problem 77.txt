Topic: Law
Context: An administrator must assign parking spaces to six new employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young. Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
Question: For how many of the six new employees is the assignment of a parking space limited to one of only two possible spaces?
Choices:
  A: none
  B: two
  C: three
  D: four
  E: five
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4. This means Robertson cannot be assigned #5 or #6.
2. Young must be assigned a lower-numbered parking space than Robertson. Since Robertson can only be assigned #1, #2, #3, or #4, Young must be assigned #1, #2, or #3.
3. Togowa must be assigned a lower-numbered parking space than Young. Since Young can only be assigned #1, #2, or #3, Togowa must be assigned #1 or #2.
4. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. This doesn't limit Xu or Souza to specific spaces yet.
5. Looking at the employees individually:
   - Robertson: must be assigned #1, #2, #3, or #4
   - Souza: no specific limitation
   - Togowa: must be assigned #1 or #2
   - Vaughn: no specific limitation
   - Xu: no specific limitation
   - Young: must be assigned #1, #2, or #3
6. Counting the employees with specific limitations:
   - Togowa is limited to two possible spaces (#1 or #2)
   - Young is limited to three possible spaces (#1, #2, or #3)
   - Robertson is limited to four possible spaces (#1, #2, #3, or #4)
   - The other three employees have no specific limitations
Therefore, three employees (Togowa, Young, and Robertson) have their assignment limited to specific spaces.
