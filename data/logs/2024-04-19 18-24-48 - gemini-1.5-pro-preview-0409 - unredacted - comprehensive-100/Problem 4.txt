## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")

Topic: Math
Question: At its maximum speed, a space shuttle can travel 700m high in 40 seconds. It will also take 5 seconds to pass a point. What then is the length of the space shuttle?
Choices:
  A: 50 m
  B: 75 m
  C: 100 m
  D: 125 m
  E: 150 m
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
My error was in rounding the calculated length of the space shuttle to the nearest available option. Instead of rounding, I should have recognized that the calculated speed was the vertical speed, not the horizontal speed. 
Error Keywords:
 - Conceptual error
 - Physics error
 - Speed and velocity error
 - Rounding error
Solution:
The given information describes the vertical motion of the space shuttle, not its horizontal motion. 
Therefore, the given speed is the vertical speed, not the horizontal speed.
The length of the space shuttle is related to its horizontal speed, not its vertical speed.
Since we don't have information about the horizontal speed, we cannot determine the length of the space shuttle.
Instructions:
1. Identify the type of motion described in the problem (vertical or horizontal).
2. Determine if the given information is relevant to the motion that determines the length of the object.
3. If the information is not directly relevant, consider if there is a way to relate the given information to the desired information.
4. If there is no way to relate the information, recognize that the problem cannot be solved with the given information.
Advice:
 - Always pay attention to the type of motion described in the problem (e.g., vertical, horizontal, circular).
 - Clearly distinguish between different types of speed (e.g., vertical speed, horizontal speed, average speed).
 - Recognize that not all problems can be solved with the given information.
 - If a problem cannot be solved, explain why and identify the missing information.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The problem describes the vertical motion of the space shuttle, but we need information about its horizontal motion to determine its length. 
We don't have any information about the horizontal speed, so we cannot find the length.
