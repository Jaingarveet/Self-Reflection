## System:
You are an expert in Logic.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.

## User 2:
Topic: Logic
Context: When a team travels to Tibet, in addition to Lhasa, there are 6 cities or scenic spots to choose from? City E, City F, Lake G, Mountain H, Mountain I, Lake J Taking into account factors such as time, funding, plateau environment, and physical condition of the personnel, (1) at least one of Lake G and Lake J should be visited.(2) If you don't go to E city or F city, you can't go to G lake.(3) If you don't go to E city, you can't go to H mountain.(4) Only when I cross the I peak can I reach Lake J.
Question: If this team does not go to I Peak due to climate reasons, which of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: The group went to E city and J lake
  B: The group went to city E instead of city F
  C: The group went to visit G Lake and H Mountain
  D: The group went to F city and G lake tour
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:** My error stemmed from misinterpreting the implications of condition (2) and overlooking the cascading effects of not visiting I Peak. I incorrectly assumed visiting Lake G necessitates visiting both City E and Mountain H, leading to the wrong conclusion.
**Error Keywords:**
*   Misinterpretation 
*   Logical reasoning error
*   Conditional statement misunderstanding
## Step-by-Step Solution
1.  **Cannot visit J Lake:** Due to climate, the team cannot cross I Peak, making J Lake inaccessible (condition 4).
2.  **Must visit G Lake:** Since J Lake is off-limits, they must visit G Lake to fulfill condition (1) - visiting at least one of the lakes.
3.  **Must visit E or F City:** To visit G Lake, condition (2) dictates visiting either E city or F city.
4.  **Cannot visit H Mountain:** As they cannot visit I Peak, condition (3) implies they cannot visit H Mountain, as it requires visiting E city.
5.  **Therefore, they must visit F city and G Lake:** Since H Mountain is inaccessible, the only remaining valid option fulfilling conditions (1) and (2) is visiting F city and G Lake.
## Instructions for Future Similar Problems
1.  **Carefully analyze each condition:** Pay close attention to the relationships and dependencies between conditions.
2.  **Consider all possibilities:** Explore different scenarios based on the given conditions and constraints.
3.  **Eliminate invalid options:** Use the process of elimination to rule out options that contradict the conditions.
4.  **Focus on cascading effects:** Understand how one condition can influence others and lead to specific outcomes.
5.  **Double-check your reasoning:** Ensure your conclusions logically follow from the given information and conditions.
## General Advice for Logic Problems
*   **Break down complex problems:** Divide the problem into smaller, manageable parts to analyze each piece individually.
*   **Identify keywords and relationships:** Pay attention to keywords like "must," "cannot," "either/or," etc., and understand how they connect different elements.
*   **Draw diagrams or use visual aids:** Visual representations can help clarify relationships and dependencies between conditions.
*   **Practice with similar problems:** The more you practice, the better you become at recognizing patterns and applying logical reasoning.
*   **Review your mistakes:** Learn from your errors and understand why you made them to avoid similar mistakes in the future.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Since the team cannot go to I Peak, they cannot go to J Lake (condition 4).
Therefore, they must go to G Lake to satisfy condition (1).
To go to G Lake, they must go to either E city or F city (condition 2).
However, since they cannot go to I Peak, they cannot go to H Mountain (condition 3), which means they cannot go to E city.
Therefore, they must go to F city and G Lake.
