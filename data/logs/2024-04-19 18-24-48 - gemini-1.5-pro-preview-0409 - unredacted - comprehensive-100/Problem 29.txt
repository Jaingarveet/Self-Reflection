Topic: Law
Context: The organizer of a reading club will select at least five and at most six works from a group of nine works. The group consists of three French novels, three Russian novels, two French plays, and one Russian play. The organizer's selection of works must conform to the following requirements: No more than four French works are selected. At least three but no more than four novels are selected. At least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected. If both French plays are selected, then the Russian play is not selected.
Question: Any one of the following could be true about the organizer's selections of works EXCEPT:
Choices:
  A: No Russian novels and exactly one play are selected.
  B: Exactly one Russian novel and both French plays are selected.
  C: Exactly two French novels and the Russian play are selected.

Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:**
I incorrectly analyzed option A, assuming that selecting two French plays would automatically exclude the Russian play, which is only true if *both* French plays are selected. This oversight led me to believe option A was a possible selection when it actually violated the "at least three novels" requirement.
**Error Keywords:**
*   Misinterpretation 
*   Rule misapplication
*   Logical error
## Step-by-Step Solution
1. **Analyze Option A:** 
    *   This option implies selecting 2 French novels and 2 French plays to reach 4 French works (the maximum allowed).
    *   With only one play remaining, it must be the Russian play.
    *   This leaves us with 2 novels and 3 plays, violating the "at least 3 novels" requirement.
    *   Therefore, option A is NOT possible.
2. **Verify other options:** Briefly check that options B, C, D, and E can indeed be achieved under the given constraints.
## Instructions for Future Problem Solving
1. **Carefully read each rule and constraint:** Pay close attention to keywords like "at least," "at most," and conditional statements ("if...then").
2. **Analyze each option systematically:** Consider the implications of each option on the number of French/Russian works, novels/plays, and how they align with the rules.
3. **Double-check conditional rules:** Ensure you are applying them correctly and not assuming implications that are not explicitly stated.
4. **Consider extreme scenarios:** Check options that push the boundaries of the constraints (e.g., maximum French works, minimum novels) to ensure they still comply with the rules.
## General Advice for Similar Problems
*   **Break down complex problems:** Divide the problem into smaller parts and analyze each part individually.
*   **Focus on keywords:** Pay attention to specific wording and conditions in the problem statement.
*   **Eliminate options:** If you can definitively prove an option is impossible, eliminate it and focus on the remaining choices.
*   **Work with examples:** Try creating examples that fit the given constraints to better understand the possibilities. 
*   **Review and learn from mistakes:** Analyze your incorrect answers to understand the reasoning errors and avoid them in the future.
