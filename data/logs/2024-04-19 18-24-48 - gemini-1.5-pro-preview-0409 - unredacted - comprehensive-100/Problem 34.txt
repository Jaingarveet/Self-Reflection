## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:**
My error stemmed from focusing on the change in commute time rather than the affordability of housing as the core issue. I incorrectly assumed the argument hinged on the current commute times, neglecting the financial aspect of housing affordability near Ocean View.
**Error Keywords:**
*   Misinterpretation of argument
*   Focus on irrelevant detail
*   Neglecting key information 
*   Assumption identification error
## Step-by-Step Solution
1. **Identify the Conclusion:** Most Acme employees will have a commute of more than 30 minutes after the move to Ocean View.
2. **Analyze the Reasoning:** This conclusion is based on the premise that most employees cannot afford housing near Ocean View.
3. **Identify the Assumption:** For the conclusion to be true, we must assume that the lack of affordable housing will directly translate to longer commutes. This implies that employees won't receive a significant pay raise to compensate for the higher cost of living near Ocean View. 
4. **Match with Answer Choice:** This reasoning aligns with answer choice E: "Acme's move to Ocean View will not be accompanied by a significant pay raise for Acme employees."
## Instructions for Future Problem Solving
1. **Carefully analyze the argument's structure:** Identify the conclusion and the premises supporting it.
2. **Focus on the core issue:**  Don't get distracted by secondary details. 
3. **Identify the gap in reasoning:** Determine what must be assumed for the conclusion to be true based on the premises.
4. **Consider all answer choices:** Eliminate options that are irrelevant or don't address the identified gap.
5. **Choose the answer that bridges the gap:** Select the option that makes the conclusion logically follow from the premises.
## General Advice for Similar Problems
* **Read actively and critically:** Pay attention to the relationships between premises and conclusions.
* **Question assumptions:** Don't take information for granted; consider what must be true for the argument to hold.
* **Practice identifying assumptions:** Regularly work on similar problems to improve your skill in recognizing unstated assumptions.
* **Consider alternative explanations:** Explore different ways to interpret the argument and its implications. 
* **Develop a systematic approach:** Follow a structured process to analyze arguments and identify assumptions.
