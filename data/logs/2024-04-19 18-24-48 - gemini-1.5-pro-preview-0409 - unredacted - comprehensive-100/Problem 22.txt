You are an expert in Law.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Law
Context: Of the eight students—George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert—in a seminar, exactly six will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
Question: If George, Nina, and Robert give reports and they do so on different days from one another, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Helen gives a report on Wednesday.
  B: Nina gives a report on Monday.
  C: Nina gives a report on Tuesday.
  D: Olivia gives a report on Monday.
  E: Robert gives a report on Wednesday.
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:** My error stemmed from a misinterpretation of the constraint regarding Nina's presentation. I incorrectly assumed that if Nina presented on Monday, both Helen and Irving were obligated to present the next day (Tuesday), which led to a scheduling conflict with George's mandatory Tuesday presentation.
**Error Keywords:**
*   Misinterpretation
*   Constraint violation 
*   Logical reasoning error
## Step-by-Step Solution
1. **George on Tuesday:** As per the initial condition, George must present on Tuesday. This leaves Monday and Wednesday for Nina and Robert.
2. **Nina cannot present on Wednesday:** The constraint states that if Nina presents, Helen and Irving must present the next day. Since there's no "next day" for Wednesday, Nina cannot present on Wednesday.
3. **Nina on Monday:**  With Wednesday ruled out, Nina must present on Monday. This leaves Wednesday for Robert.
4. **Helen or Irving on Tuesday or Wednesday:**  The constraint regarding Nina presenting implies that either Helen or Irving (or both) must present on Tuesday or Wednesday. 
5. **Possibility of Helen on Wednesday:** Since one spot on Wednesday is filled by Robert, the remaining spot can be filled by Helen, fulfilling the constraint related to Nina's Monday presentation.
Therefore, **Helen giving a report on Wednesday (Option A) is a possibility.**
## Instructions for Future Problem Solving
1. **Carefully analyze each constraint:** Pay close attention to the specific conditions and limitations imposed by each constraint.
2. **Consider all possible scenarios:** Don't jump to conclusions based on initial assumptions. Explore different possibilities and their implications.
3. **Visualize the schedule:** Create a visual representation of the schedule (e.g., a table) to track the assignments and identify potential conflicts or solutions.
4. **Review the constraints after each step:** Ensure that each decision made adheres to all the given constraints.
5. **Double-check the final solution:** Verify that the final schedule satisfies all conditions and constraints without any contradictions.
## General Advice for Similar Problems
*   **Break down complex problems:** Divide the problem into smaller, manageable parts to analyze each aspect effectively.
*   **Identify key information:** Focus on the essential details and constraints that directly impact the solution.
*   **Use logical reasoning:** Apply logical deductions and inferences to connect the given information and reach valid conclusions.
*   **Consider alternative perspectives:** Explore different viewpoints and possibilities to avoid overlooking potential solutions.
*   **Practice and learn from mistakes:** Regularly engage in solving similar problems to enhance your understanding and refine your problem-solving skills.
