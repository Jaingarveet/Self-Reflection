Topic: Law
Context: Economics professor: Marty's Pizza and Checkers Pizza are the two major pizza parlors in our town. Marty's sold coupon books including coupons good for one large plain pizza at any local pizza parlor, at Marty's expense. But Checkers refused to accept these coupons, even though they were redeemed by all other local pizza parlors. Accepting them would have cost Checkers nothing and would have satisfied those of its potential customers who had purchased the coupon books. This shows that Checkers's motive in refusing to accept the coupons was simply to hurt Marty's Pizza.
Question: Which one of the following, if assumed, enables the economics professor's conclusion to be properly drawn?
Choices:
  A: Any company that refuses to accept coupons issued by a competitor when doing so would satisfy some of the company's potential customers is motivated solely by the desire to hurt that competitor.
  B: Any company that wishes to hurt a competitor by refusing to accept coupons issued by that competitor will refuse to accept them even when accepting them would cost nothing and would satisfy its potential customers.
  C: At least one company has refused to accept coupons issued by its major local competitor simply in order to hurt that competitor, even though those coupons were accepted by all other local competitors.
  D: Any company that accepts its major competitor's coupons helps its competitor by doing so, even if it also satisfies its own actual or potential customers.
  E: If accepting coupons issued by a competitor would not enable a company to satisfy its actual or potential customers, then that company's refusal to accept the coupons is motivated by the desire to satisfy customers.

Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:** I focused on finding an assumption that directly linked refusing coupons with the intent to harm, overlooking the broader context of the professor's conclusion. The correct answer should encompass the specific conditions mentioned (costless acceptance, satisfying customers) and generalize to similar situations.
**Error Keywords:**
*   Misinterpretation of argument structure
*   Overlooking key details
*   Focusing on a single element instead of the whole context
## Step-by-Step Solution
1. **Identify the Conclusion:** The professor concludes that Checkers' motive for refusing the coupons was to hurt Marty's Pizza.
2. **Analyze the Context:** The context includes:
    *   Checkers and Marty's are major competitors.
    *   Accepting the coupons would have cost Checkers nothing.
    *   Accepting the coupons would have satisfied Checkers' potential customers.
    *   All other local pizza parlors accepted the coupons.
3. **Evaluate Options Based on Context:**
    *   **Option A** generalizes the situation by stating that any company refusing costless and customer-satisfying coupons from a competitor is motivated by the desire to hurt that competitor. This aligns with the professor's conclusion and the specific context. 
    *   **Option B** describes a company wanting to harm a competitor but doesn't necessarily link it to the specific action of refusing coupons in the given context.
    *   **Options C, D, and E** either introduce irrelevant information or don't align with the professor's conclusion and the context.
## Instructions for Future Similar Problems
1. **Identify the conclusion and the evidence supporting it.**
2. **Analyze the context and any specific conditions mentioned.**
3. **Look for an assumption that generalizes the situation and connects the evidence to the conclusion, considering the context and conditions.**
4. **Eliminate options that introduce irrelevant information, contradict the context, or don't support the conclusion.**
## General Advice
*   **Pay close attention to the specific details and context of the argument.**
*   **Focus on the logical connection between the evidence, assumption, and conclusion.**
*   **Consider alternative explanations and eliminate options that don't align with the argument's structure.**
*   **Practice analyzing arguments and identifying assumptions to improve your reasoning skills.**
