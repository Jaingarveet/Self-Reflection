## System:
You are an expert in Medicine.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")

Question: Which of the following drains directly into inferior vena cava?
Choices:
  A: Superior mesenteric vein
  B: Inferior mesenteric vein
  C: Right suprarenal vein
  D: Renal vein
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:** My knowledge of the venous drainage system was incomplete, leading me to overlook the direct connection between the right suprarenal vein and the inferior vena cava. I incorrectly assumed all suprarenal veins drained via the renal veins.
**Error Keywords:**
*   Knowledge gap
*   Anatomy misconception
*   Venous drainage error
## Step-by-Step Solution
1.  **Recall the function of the inferior vena cava:** It collects deoxygenated blood from the lower body and returns it to the heart.
2.  **Consider the options:**
    *   Superior and inferior mesenteric veins are part of the hepatic portal system, not directly connected to the inferior vena cava.
    *   Renal veins do drain directly into the inferior vena cava.
    *   **Right suprarenal vein:** This vein drains the right adrenal gland and, unlike the left, directly connects to the inferior vena cava. 
3.  **Choose the correct option:** Based on the above, the right suprarenal vein (C) is the correct answer. 
## Instructions for Future Problem Solving
1.  **Review the anatomy of the venous system**, paying close attention to the connections between major veins and their tributaries.
2.  **Specifically focus on the drainage patterns of the adrenal glands**, noting the difference between the right and left suprarenal veins.
3.  **When encountering questions about venous drainage, systematically eliminate options** based on your knowledge of the circulatory system.
4.  **If unsure, consider the anatomical location and function of the structures involved** to make an educated guess.
## General Advice for Similar Problems
*   **Continuously update and refine your knowledge base** in medicine and anatomy.
*   **Pay attention to exceptions and variations** within anatomical systems.
*   **Develop a systematic approach to problem-solving** that involves elimination and logical reasoning.
*   **Use anatomical and physiological principles to guide your reasoning** when faced with uncertainty. 
*   **Practice applying your knowledge to different scenarios** to reinforce understanding.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Based on my reflection, I now understand that the right suprarenal vein directly drains into the inferior vena cava, unlike the left suprarenal vein. 
Action: Answer("C") 
## Result:
