Topic: Law
Context: The Internet makes possible the instaotaoeous transmission and retrieval of digital text. It is widely assumed that this capacity will lead to the displacement of printed books by digitized books that are read mainly on computer screens or handheld electronic devices. But it is more likely, I believe, that most digital files of books will be prioted and bound on demand at point of sale by machines that can quickly and inexpensively make single copies that are indistinguishable from books made in fiIctories. Once most books have been digitized, aoyone with access to the Internet will be able to purchase printed books from a practieally limitless digital catalog that includes even those books that, under traditional publishing assumptions, would have been desigoated "out of print." Also, the digital publication of a book online involves no pbysical inventory', thereby eliminating the costs of warehousing, shipping books to wholesalers and to retail stores, displaying pbysieal books in retail stores, and returning unsold books to publishers. This would make digital publishing much less expensive than traditional publishing. Given the economic efficiency and convenience for customers of this new digital model of publishing, it is likely to eventually supplant or at least rival traditional publishingalthough it will be some time before a catalog of printable digitized books becomes large enough to jusillY investment in book prioting machines at numerous regional sites. Moreover, the elimination of whole categories of expensemeans that under the digital publishing model,authors would be responsible for a greater proportion of the value of the final product and would therefore, according to literal)' agents, be entitled to a larger share of the proceeds. Currently a large percentage of publishers' revenue is absorbed by the costs of printing, selling, and distributing pbysical books, costs that are irrelevant to digital publication. LiteraI)' agents marketing new manuscripts could thus be expected to demand a significantly bigger slice of revenue for their authors than has been traditional. But large, established publishing houses, which are heavily invested in the infrastructure of traditional publishing, initially will be reluctant to accede. So the opportunity to bid for new manuscripts will go first to upstart digital-publishing firms unfettered by traditional practices or infrastructure. Under this competitive pressure, traditional publishers will have to reduee their redundant functions in order to accommodate higher royalty payments to authors or else they will lose their authors. Such adjustments are typical of the interval between a departing economic model and its successor and may help explain the caution with which today's publishing conglomerates are approaching the digital future.

## Assistant 2:
  Reflection:

Upon further reflection, I realize that the correct answer is (C) The demands of literary agents will be the impetus for completing the transition to the new digital model.

The passage suggests that literary agents will play a crucial role in the transition to the new digital model. The author notes that literary agents marketing new manuscripts will demand a significantly bigger slice of revenue for their authors, which will put pressure on traditional publishers to accommodate higher royalty payments. This implies that the demands of literary agents will be a driving force in the transition to the new digital model.

In contrast, options (A) and (B) are not supported by the passage. Option (A) is unlikely, as the passage suggests that changing literary tastes of consumers will not be the main cause of the transition. Option (B) is also unlikely, as the passage does not mention the ease of keeping books "in print" as a primary factor in the transition.

Option (D) is also not supported by the passage, as the development of innovative marketing strategies is not mentioned as a factor in the transition to the new digital model.

Option (E) is not relevant to the passage, as it does not mention anything about familiarity with new ways of storing information being a factor in the transition to the new digital model.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) The demands of literary agents will be the impetus for completing the transition to the new digital model.
