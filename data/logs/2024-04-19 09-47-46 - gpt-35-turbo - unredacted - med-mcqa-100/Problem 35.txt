Explanation:
I misinterpreted the chest X-ray findings and did not consider all the possible diagnoses. 
The gap in my knowledge was in the interpretation of chest X-rays in neonates and the differential diagnosis of heart failure in neonates. 
The correct answer is D: TGA (Transposition of Great Arteries). 
Instructions:
1. Look for signs of heart failure in the neonate.
2. Examine the chest X-ray for cardiomegaly and pulmonary vascular markings.
3. Consider the differential diagnosis of heart failure in neonates.
4. Eliminate diagnoses that do not fit the clinical picture or chest X-ray findings.
5. Choose the most probable diagnosis based on the clinical picture and chest X-ray findings.
Advice:
 - Always consider the differential diagnosis of heart failure in neonates.
 - Always interpret chest X-rays in neonates carefully.
 - Remember that different heart defects can present with similar symptoms.
 - Always consider the clinical picture in addition to imaging findings.
 - Never rush to a diagnosis without considering all the possibilities.
