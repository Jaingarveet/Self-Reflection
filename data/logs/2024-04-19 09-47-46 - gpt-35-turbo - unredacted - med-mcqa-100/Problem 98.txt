Explanation:
I incorrectly answered this question by choosing option B, "Double bubble appearance." The correct answer is A, "Single bubble appearance." Pyloric stenosis is a condition where the opening between the stomach and small intestine becomes narrowed. This narrowing can cause a buildup of gas and fluid in the stomach, leading to a characteristic "single bubble" appearance on an X-ray. The "double bubble" appearance is associated with duodenal atresia, a different condition that affects the small intestine.
