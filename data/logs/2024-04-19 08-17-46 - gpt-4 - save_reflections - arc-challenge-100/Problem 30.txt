Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misunderstood the term "sublimation". I thought sublimation only referred to the process where a solid turns directly into a gas, without passing through the liquid phase. However, sublimation can also refer to the reverse process, where a gas turns directly into a solid, which is also known as deposition. In the context of the question, frost is formed when water vapor (a gas) turns directly into ice (a solid), which is a form of sublimation.
Error Keywords:
- Misunderstanding
- Sublimation
- Deposition
- Phase transition
Solution:
When moist air comes in contact with a cold surface in the winter, the water vapor in the air turns directly into a solid (ice), forming frost. This process is a form of sublimation, where a substance transitions from a gas to a solid without passing through the liquid phase. Therefore, the correct answer is B: It has sublimated.
Instructions:
1. Understand the question and what is being asked.
2. Recall the process of frost formation, which involves water vapor turning directly into ice.
3. Recognize that this process is a form of sublimation, where a substance transitions from a gas to a solid without passing through the liquid phase.
4. Choose the answer that correctly describes this process.
Advice:
- Always read the question carefully and make sure you understand what is being asked.
- Review and understand the different phase transitions, including sublimation and deposition.
- Remember that sublimation can refer to both the process where a solid turns directly into a gas and the process where a gas turns directly into a solid.
- Don't rush your answer. Take your time to think through the question and your understanding of the concepts involved.
