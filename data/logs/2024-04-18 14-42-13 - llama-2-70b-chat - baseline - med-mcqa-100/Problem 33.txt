## System:
You are an expert in Medicine.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: In Cicatricial pemphigoid, which antigen is bound by IgG on the epidermal side of the salt split skin technique?
Choices:
  A: XVII collagen
  B: Epiligrin
  C: Laminin 5
  D: BP antigen 1 & 2
## Assistant 2:
  Thought:
Cicatricial pemphigoid is an autoimmune bullous disease that targets the basement membrane zone.
The salt split skin technique is a diagnostic tool used to identify the presence of autoantibodies in the patient's serum.
In this technique, the patient's skin is split with a salt solution, and the resulting blister fluid is tested for the presence of autoantibodies.
The autoantibodies in the blister fluid will bind to the corresponding antigens on the epidermal side of the split skin.
Action: Answer("B") Epiligrin.
Epiligrin, also known as BP180, is a protein component of the basement membrane zone that is targeted by autoantibodies in patients with cicatricial pemphigoid.
It is the most common antigen targeted by IgG autoantibodies in patients with cicatricial pemphigoid.
Therefore, in the salt split skin technique, IgG autoantibodies in the patient's serum will bind to epiligrin on the epidermal side of the split skin, confirming the diagnosis of cicatricial pemphigoid.
The other choices, XVII collagen (A), Laminin 5 (C), and BP antigen 1 & 2 (D), are not the primary antigens targeted by autoantibodies in cicatricial pemphigoid.
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
