## Assistant 2:
  Thought: 
Islet cell transplantation for diabetes mellitus involves transplanting islet cells from a donor pancreas into a recipient with type 1 diabetes. The transplanted cells can produce insulin, regulating the recipient's blood sugar levels. The transplantation site should provide adequate blood supply and minimize the risk of immune rejection.
Action: Answer("C") 

The correct answer is "C: Liver". Islet cells are typically transplanted into the liver, which provides a suitable environment for their survival and function. The liver's blood supply and proximity to the pancreas, where the islet cells originate, make it an ideal site for islet cell transplantation.
