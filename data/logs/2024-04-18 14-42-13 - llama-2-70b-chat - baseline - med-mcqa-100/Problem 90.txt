Question: At 34 weeks multigravida with previous 2 normal delivery has an unstable lie with the present pregnancy. It can be due to:
Choices:
  A: Oligohydramnios
  B: Placenta pre
  C: Pelvic tumor
  D: Uterine anomalies
## Assistant 2:
  Thought: 
An unstable lie in a multigravida patient with previous normal deliveries at 34 weeks of gestation could be due to several factors. However, the most likely cause is:

Option D: Uterine anomalies.

Uterine anomalies, such as a unicornuate uterus or a bicornuate uterus, can cause an unstable lie and may not have been detected previously. The patient's history of previous normal deliveries reduces the likelihood of the other options: oligohydramnios (A), placenta previa (B), and pelvic tumor (C).

Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
