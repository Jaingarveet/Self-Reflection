Topic: Law
Context: A maintenance company that takes service requests from three clients—Image, Solide, and Truvest—plans to set targets for its average service response times. Service targets will be set at 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day. Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail. The six targets are set according to the following conditions: None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
Question: If none of the clients has a website target of 2 days, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Image's website target is shorter than Solide's.
  B: Solide's website target is shorter than Image's.
  C: Solide's voicemail target is shorter than Truvest's.
  D: Truvest's website target is shorter than Image's.
  E: Truvest's voicemail target is shorter than Solide's.
## Assistant 2:
  Answer: "C"

Explanation:
Given that none of the clients has a website target of 2 days, we can deduce the following:

* Image's website target is 1 day (since it cannot be longer than its voicemail target, which is 2 days).
* Solide's website target is 1 day (since it cannot be longer than Truvest's website target, which is 2 days).
* Truvest's website target is 2 days (since it is the only client that can have a website target of 2 days).

Now, let's evaluate the choices:

A: Image's website target is shorter than Solide's. - False. Both Image and Solide have a website target of 1 day.

B: Solide's website target is shorter than Image's. - False. Both Image and Solide have a website target of 1 day.

C: Solide's voicemail target is shorter than Truvest's. - True. Solide's voicemail target is 1 day, while Truvest's voicemail target is 2 days.

D: Truvest's website target is shorter than Image's. - False. Truvest's website target is 2 days, while Image's website target is 1 day.

E: Truvest's voicemail target is shorter than Solide's. - False. Truvest's voicemail target is 2 days, while Solide's voicemail target is 1 day.

Therefore, the correct answer is "C: Solide's voicemail target is shorter than Truvest's."
