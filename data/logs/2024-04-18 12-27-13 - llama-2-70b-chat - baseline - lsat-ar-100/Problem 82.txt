Topic: Law
Context: A software company employs exactly seven sales representatives—Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall—to work in its three sales zones—Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3. Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Question: Which one of the following could be an accurate matching of the sales representatives to the sales zones in which they work?
Choices:
  A: Zone 1: Kim, Parra Zone 2: Stuckey, Udall Zone 3: Mahr, Quinn, Tiao
  B: Zone 1: Kim, Tiao Zone 2: Stuckey, Udall Zone 3: Mahr, Parra, Quinn
  C: Zone 1: Parra, Quinn Zone 2: Kim, Udall Zone 3: Mahr, Stuckey, Tiao
  D: Zone 1: Stuckey, Udall Zone 2: Kim, Tiao Zone 3: Mahr, Parra, Quinn
  E: Zone 1: Tiao Zone 2: Kim, Parra, Quinn Zone 3: Stuckey, Udall
## Assistant 2:
  Answer: C

Explanation:
The question provides us with five conditions that must be met when matching the sales representatives to the sales zones. Let's break down each condition and see how they can be satisfied:

1. Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
2. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
3. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
4. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
5. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

Now, let's evaluate each choice to see which one satisfies all the conditions:

A: Zone 1: Kim, Parra Zone 2: Stuckey, Udall Zone 3: Mahr, Quinn, Tiao
This choice violates condition 1, as both Parra and Tiao are assigned to Zone 1.

B: Zone 1: Kim, Tiao Zone 2: Stuckey, Udall Zone 3: Mahr, Parra, Quinn
This choice violates condition 2, as both Tiao and Udall are assigned to Zone 2.

C: Zone 1: Parra, Quinn Zone 2: Kim, Udall Zone 3: Mahr, Stuckey, Tiao
This choice satisfies all the conditions. Parra or Tiao (but not both) work in Zone 1. Tiao or Udall (but not both) work in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work together in Zone 1. Stuckey and Udall work together in Zone 2. There are more representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

D: Zone 1: Stuckey, Udall Zone 2: Kim, Tiao Zone 3: Mahr, Parra, Quinn
This choice violates condition 3, as Parra and Quinn are not working together in the same sales zone.

E: Zone 1: Tiao Zone 2: Kim, Parra, Quinn Zone 3: Stuckey, Udall
This choice violates condition 4, as Stuckey and Udall are not working together in the same sales zone.

Therefore, the correct answer is C.
