## User 2:
Topic: Law
Context: Of the eight students—George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert—in a seminar, exactly six will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
Question: If Helen, Kyle, and Lenore, not necessarily in that order, give the three morning reports, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Helen gives a report on Monday.
  B: Irving gives a report on Monday.
  C: Irving gives a report on Wednesday.
  D: Kyle gives a report on Tuesday.
  E: Kyle gives a report on Wednesday.
## Assistant 2:
  Thought: 
Let's break this down step by step:
* Exactly six students will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
* Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
* Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report.
* Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
* If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.

Now, let's consider the given options:

A: Helen gives a report on Monday.
Since George can only give a report on Tuesday, Helen cannot give a report on Monday. Therefore, this option is incorrect.

B: Irving gives a report on Monday.
As mentioned above, George can only give a report on Tuesday. Therefore, Irving cannot give a report on Monday. Hence, this option is incorrect.

C: Irving gives a report on Wednesday.
This option is possible. If Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Wednesday. Therefore, this option is correct.

D: Kyle gives a report on Tuesday.
Since George can only give a report on Tuesday, Kyle cannot give a report on Tuesday. Therefore, this option is incorrect.

E: Kyle gives a report on Wednesday.
This option is possible. If Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then Kyle can give a report on Wednesday. Therefore, this option is correct.

Action: Answer("C") and Answer("E")

Therefore, the correct answer is:
C: Irving gives a report on Wednesday.
E: Kyle gives a report on Wednesday.
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
