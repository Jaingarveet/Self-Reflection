Topic: Law
Context: Of the eight students—George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert—in a seminar, exactly six will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
Question: If Kyle gives the afternoon report on Tuesday, and Helen gives the afternoon report on Wednesday, which one of the following could be the list of the students who give the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively?
Choices:
  A: Irving, Lenore, and Nina
  B: Lenore, George, and Irving
  C: Nina, Irving, and Lenore
  D: Robert, George, and Irving
  E: Robert, Irving, and Lenore
## Assistant 2:
  Thought: 
Given that Kyle gives the afternoon report on Tuesday and Helen gives the afternoon report on Wednesday, we can deduce the following:
* Monday morning report: Since Tuesday is the only day George can give a report, George must give the morning report on Monday.
* Tuesday morning report: As Olivia cannot give an afternoon report, she must give the morning report on Tuesday.
* Wednesday morning report: Since Nina cannot give a report on Wednesday afternoon (as Helen and Irving must give reports that day), Nina must give the morning report on Wednesday.

Therefore, the list of students giving morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, is:

Monday: George
Tuesday: Olivia
Wednesday: Nina

Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
