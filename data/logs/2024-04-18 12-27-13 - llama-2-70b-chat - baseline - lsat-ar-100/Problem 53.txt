Context: A realtor will show a prospective buyer seven houses—J, K, L, M, N, 0, and P—during a single day. The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning; the third, fourth, and fifth houses to be shown will be shown in the afternoon; the sixth and seventh houses to be shown will be shown in the evening. The houses will be shown according to the following rules: J must be shown in the evening. K cannot be shown in the morning. L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
Question: Which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: K is shown in the evening.
  B: L is shown in the afternoon.
  C: L is shown in the evening.
  D: M is shown in the morning.
  E: M is shown in the afternoon.
## Assistant 2:
  Thought: 
The given information can be summarized as follows:

* J must be shown in the evening.
* K cannot be shown in the morning.
* L must be shown after K and before M.

From the information above, we can deduce the following:

* K cannot be shown in the morning, so it must be shown in the afternoon or evening.
* L must be shown after K, so L must be shown in the afternoon or evening.
* M must be shown before L, so M must be shown in the morning or afternoon.

With these deductions, we can eliminate choices D and E, as M cannot be shown in the morning or afternoon.

Between choices A, B, and C, we know that J must be shown in the evening, and L must be shown after K and before M. Therefore, the only possible sequence that satisfies all the rules is:

* Morning: K, L
* Afternoon: M, N
* Evening: J, P

Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
