Context: For the school paper, five students—Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, Megregian, and O'Neill—each review one or more of exactly three plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation, but do not review any other plays. The following conditions must apply: Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
Question: If Jiang does not review Tamerlane, then which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Jiang reviews Sunset.
  B: Lopez reviews Undulation.
  C: Megregian reviews Sunset.
  D: Megregian reviews Tamerlane.
  E: O'Neill reviews Undulation.
## Assistant 2:
  Thought: 
Let's break this down step by step:
* Kramer and Lopez each review fewer plays than Megregian.
* Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
* Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
* Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.

If Jiang does not review Tamerlane, then:

* Jiang can only review Sunset or Undulation.
* Since Lopez does not review Tamerlane, Lopez must review Undulation.
* Megregian cannot review Tamerlane, as Kramer and O'Neill already review it.
* Megregian must review Sunset, as it's the only play left.
* O'Neill cannot review Sunset, as Kramer already reviews it.
* O'Neill must review Undulation, as it's the only play left.

Action: Answer("E")
