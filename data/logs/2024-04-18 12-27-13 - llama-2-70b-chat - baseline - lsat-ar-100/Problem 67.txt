Context: A bakery makes exactly three kinds of cookieâ€”oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar. Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day. The following conditions apply: No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
Question: If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Exactly three batches of cookies are made on Tuesday.
  B: Exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday.
  C: At least two batches of cookies are made on Monday.
  D: At least two batches of cookies are made on Thursday.
  E: Fewer batches of cookies are made on Monday than on Tuesday.
## Assistant 2:
  Thought: 
Given that no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, we can infer that the three batches of cookies made on Monday, Thursday, and Friday will be different kinds of cookies.

We know that the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. Therefore, if the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Monday, the second batch of oatmeal cookies will be made on Tuesday.

We also know that the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday. Therefore, if the first batch of sugar cookies is made on Monday, the second batch will be made on Thursday, leaving Tuesday and Friday for the remaining batches.

Given these conditions, we can conclude that exactly three batches of cookies are made on Tuesday.

Action: Answer("A")
