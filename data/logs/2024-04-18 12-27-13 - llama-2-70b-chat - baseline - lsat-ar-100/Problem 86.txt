Context: A loading dock consists of exactly six bays numbered 1 through 6 consecutively from one side of the dock to the other. Each bay is holding a different one of exactly six types of cargoâ€”fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles. The following apply: The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock. The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles. The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel. The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
Question: If bay 4 is holding produce, then for exactly how many of the six bays is the type of cargo that bay is holding completely determined?
Choices:
  A: two
  B: three
  C: four
  D: five
  E: six
## Assistant 2:
  Thought: 
Given that bay 4 is holding produce, we can deduce the following:
* Bay 3 must be holding textiles since it is next to bay 4 and has a lower number.
* Bay 5 must be holding fuel since it has a lower number than bay 4 and cannot hold textiles or produce.
* Bay 6 must be holding machinery since it is the only type of cargo left and must be in one of the last two bays.
* Bay 1 must be holding grain since it has a higher number than bay 3 (holding textiles) and cannot hold livestock.
* Bay 2 must be holding livestock since it has a higher number than bay 1 (holding grain) and cannot hold machinery or produce.
