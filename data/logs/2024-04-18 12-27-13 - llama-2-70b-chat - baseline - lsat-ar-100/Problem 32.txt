Topic: Law
Context: A maintenance company that takes service requests from three clients—Image, Solide, and Truvest—plans to set targets for its average service response times. Service targets will be set at 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day. Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail. The six targets are set according to the following conditions: None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
Question: If none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days, then each of the following must be true EXCEPT:
Choices:
  A: Image's website target is 1 day.
  B: Solide's website target is 2 days.
  C: Solide's voicemail target is 2 days.
  D: Truvest's website target is 2 days.
  E: Truvest's voicemail target is 2 days.
## Assistant 2:
  Answer: "E"

Explanation:
If none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days, then Solide's voicemail target must be 2 days (since it's shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets). Also, Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target. Therefore, Solide's website target must be 1 day, and Truvest's website target must be 2 days. Image's website target cannot be 1 day since it's longer than Solide's website target. Therefore, Image's website target must be 2 days.

Given these conditions, the only option that cannot be true is E: Truvest's voicemail target is 2 days. Truvest's voicemail target must be 1 day since it's shorter than its website target (2 days). Therefore, option E is the correct answer.
