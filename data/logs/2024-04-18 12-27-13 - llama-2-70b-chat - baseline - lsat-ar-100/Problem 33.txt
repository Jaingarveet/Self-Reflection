## User 2:
Topic: Law
Context: The organizer of a reading club will select at least five and at most six works from a group of nine works. The group consists of three French novels, three Russian novels, two French plays, and one Russian play. The organizer's selection of works must conform to the following requirements: No more than four French works are selected. At least three but no more than four novels are selected. At least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected. If both French plays are selected, then the Russian play is not selected.
Question: Any one of the following could be true about the organizer's selections of works EXCEPT:
Choices:
  A: No Russian novels and exactly one play are selected.
  B: Exactly one Russian novel and both French plays are selected.
  C: Exactly two French novels and the Russian play are selected.
  D: Exactly two French novels and exactly two plays are selected.
  E: Exactly two Russian novels and exactly one play are selected.
## Assistant 2:
  Answer: "E"

Explanation:
The statement "Exactly two Russian novels and exactly one play are selected" violates the rule that states that at least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected. If two Russian novels are selected, then only one French novel can be selected, which breaches the rule.

Therefore, option E is the correct answer.
