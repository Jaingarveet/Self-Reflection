Topic: Law
Context: Exactly eight books—F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O—are placed on a bookcase with exactly three shelves—the top shelf, the middle shelf, and the bottom shelf. At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.
Question: Which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: O is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf M is placed on.
  B: K is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf G is placed on.
  C: I is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf F is placed on.
  D: G is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf O is placed on.
  E: F is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf L is placed on.
## Assistant 2:
  Thought: 
The given information can be summarized as follows:
* F is on the same shelf as M.
* I is on the middle shelf.
* K is on a higher shelf than F.
* O is on a higher shelf than L.

From the conditions, we know that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. Therefore, the bottom shelf must have at least three books, and the top shelf must have at most two books.

We also know that K is on a higher shelf than F, so K must be on the top shelf, and F must be on the middle shelf.

Since O is on a higher shelf than L, O must be on the top shelf, and L must be on the bottom shelf.

Now, we can analyze the choices:

A: O is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf M is placed on.
This is false. Since F is on the same shelf as M, and O is on a higher shelf than F, O must be on a higher shelf than M.

B: K is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf G is placed on.
This is true. We know that K is on the top shelf, and G is not on the top shelf, so this condition must be true.

C: I is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf F is placed on.
This is false. Since I is on the middle shelf, and F is on the middle shelf, this condition must be false.

D: G is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf O is placed on.
This is false. We know that G is not on the top shelf, and O is on the top shelf, so this condition must be false.

E: F is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf L is placed on.
This is true. Since F is on the middle shelf, and L is on the bottom shelf, this condition must be true.

Therefore, the answer is E: F is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf L is placed on.

Action: Answer("E")
