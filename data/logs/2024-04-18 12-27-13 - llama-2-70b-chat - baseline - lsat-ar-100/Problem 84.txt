## User 2:
Topic: Law
Context: Exactly eight books—F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O—are placed on a bookcase with exactly three shelves—the top shelf, the middle shelf, and the bottom shelf. At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.
Question: Which one of the following could be a complete and accurate list of the books placed on the bottom shelf?
Choices:
  A: F, M
  B: F, H, M
  C: G, H, K
  D: F, G, M, O
  E: G, H, L, M
## Assistant 2:
  Thought: 
The bottom shelf must have more books than the top shelf, so it cannot be empty. Since F is placed on the same shelf as M, and M must be on the bottom shelf, F must also be on the bottom shelf. G and H must also be on the bottom shelf because more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. K must be placed on a higher shelf than F, so it cannot be on the bottom shelf. O must be placed on a higher shelf than L, so L must be on the bottom shelf. Therefore, the only possible combination of books on the bottom shelf is G, H, L, and M.
Action: Answer("E")
