Topic: Law
Context: Of the eight students—George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert—in a seminar, exactly six will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
Question: Which one of the following could be the schedule of the students' reports?
Choices:
  A: Mon. morning: Helen; Mon. afternoon: Robert Tues. morning: Olivia; Tues. afternoon: Irving Wed. morning: Lenore; Wed. afternoon: Kyle
  B: Mon. morning: Irving; Mon. afternoon: Olivia Tues. morning: Helen; Tues. afternoon: Kyle Wed. morning: Nina; Wed. afternoon: Lenore
  C: Mon. morning: Lenore; Mon. afternoon: Helen Tues. morning: George; Tues. afternoon: Kyle Wed. morning: Robert; Wed. afternoon: Irving
  D: Mon. morning: Nina; Mon. afternoon: Helen Tues. morning: Robert; Tues. afternoon: Irving Wed. morning: Olivia; Wed. afternoon: Lenore
  E: Mon. morning: Olivia; Mon. afternoon: Nina Tues. morning: Irving; Tues. afternoon: Helen Wed. morning: Kyle; Wed. afternoon: George
## Assistant 2:
  Answer: B

Explanation:
This question is a classic example of a "scheduling problem" often encountered in logic and law. We can use a methodical approach to determine the correct answer.

From the given conditions, we know that:

* Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report.
* Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
* If Nina gives a report, then on the next day, Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.

Let's analyze each choice:

A: Mon. morning: Helen; Mon. afternoon: Robert Tues. morning: Olivia; Tues. afternoon: Irving Wed. morning: Lenore; Wed. afternoon: Kyle
This schedule violates the condition that George can only give a report on Tuesday. Therefore, this choice is incorrect.

B: Mon. morning: Irving; Mon. afternoon: Olivia Tues. morning: Helen; Tues. afternoon: Kyle Wed. morning: Nina; Wed. afternoon: Lenore
This schedule meets all the given conditions. George gives a report on Tuesday morning, and Helen and Irving give reports on Wednesday morning and afternoon, respectively, which satisfies the condition that if Nina gives a report, Helen and Irving must both give reports on the next day. Therefore, this choice is correct.

C: Mon. morning: Lenore; Mon. afternoon: Helen Tues. morning: George; Tues. afternoon: Kyle Wed. morning: Robert; Wed. afternoon: Irving
This schedule violates the condition that George can only give a report on Tuesday. Therefore, this choice is incorrect.

D: Mon. morning: Nina; Mon. afternoon: Helen Tues. morning: Robert; Tues. afternoon: Irving Wed. morning: Olivia; Wed. afternoon: Lenore
This schedule violates the condition that neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. Therefore, this choice is incorrect.

E: Mon. morning: Olivia; Mon. afternoon: Nina Tues. morning: Irving; Tues. afternoon: Helen Wed. morning: Kyle; Wed. afternoon: George
This schedule violates the condition that if Nina gives a report, Helen and Irving must both give reports on the next day. Therefore, this choice is incorrect.

Therefore, the correct answer is B.
