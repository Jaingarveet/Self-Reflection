## Assistant 2:
  Thought: 
If the optometrist is next to the shoe store, the businesses immediately on either side of this pair must be the pharmacy and a restaurant. The pharmacy must be at one end of the row, and one of the restaurants must be at the other end. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, so the restaurant next to the optometrist must be the one that is not next to the pharmacy. Therefore, the businesses immediately on either side of the optometrist and shoe store pair must be the pharmacy and a restaurant.
