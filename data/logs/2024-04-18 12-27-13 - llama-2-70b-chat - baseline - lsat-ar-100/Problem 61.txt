Context: A government needs to assign new ambassadors to Venezuela, Yemen, and Zambia. The candidates for these ambassadorships are Jaramillo, Kayne, Landon, Novetzke, and Ong. One ambassador will be assigned to each country, and no ambassador will be assigned to more than one country. The assignment of the ambassadors must meet the following constraints: Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships. If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne. If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen. If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
Question: Which one of the following CANNOT be true?
Choices:
  A: Jaramillo is assigned as ambassador to Zambia.
  B: Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Zambia.
  C: Novetzke is assigned as ambassador to Zambia.
  D: Landon is not assigned to an ambassadorship.
  E: Ong is not assigned to an ambassadorship.
## Assistant 2:
  Answer: "D"

Explanation:
If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia. Therefore, Landon cannot be unassigned to an ambassadorship. So, option D cannot be true.

Here's a breakdown of the other options:

A: Jaramillo is assigned as ambassador to Zambia.
If Jaramillo is assigned to Zambia, then Kayne must be assigned to one of the other two countries. This is possible, so this option is not necessarily false.

B: Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Zambia.
As mentioned above, if Kayne is assigned to Zambia, Jaramillo must be assigned to one of the other two countries. This is possible, so this option is not necessarily false.

C: Novetzke is assigned as ambassador to Zambia.
If Novetzke is assigned to Zambia, then Kayne or Jaramillo must be assigned to one of the other two countries. This is possible, so this option is not necessarily false.

E: Ong is not assigned to an ambassadorship.
If Ong is not assigned to an ambassadorship, then either Kayne or Novetzke must be assigned to one of the other two countries. This is possible, so this option is not necessarily false.
## Result:
