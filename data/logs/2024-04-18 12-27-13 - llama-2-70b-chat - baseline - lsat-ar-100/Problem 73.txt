Topic: Law
Context: For the school paper, five students—Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, Megregian, and O'Neill—each review one or more of exactly three plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation, but do not review any other plays. The following conditions must apply: Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
Question: If exactly three of the students review Undulation, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Megregian does not review Undulation.
  B: O'Neill does not review Undulation.
  C: Jiang reviews Undulation.
  D: Lopez reviews Tamerlane.
  E: O'Neill reviews Sunset.
## Assistant 2:
  Thought: 
Let's consider the given information:
* Kramer and Lopez each review fewer plays than Megregian.
* Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
* Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
* Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.

If exactly three students review Undulation, then we can list the students who review Undulation as U1, U2, and U3.

From the given information, we know that:
* U1 cannot be Megregian, as Megregian reviews more plays than Kramer and Lopez.
* U1 cannot be O'Neill, as O'Neill reviews Tamerlane.
* U2 cannot be Lopez, as Lopez does not review Undulation.
* U3 cannot be Jiang, as Jiang reviews a different play than Kramer and O'Neill.

Therefore, the only possible combination of students who review Undulation is {Kramer, O'Neill, Megregian}.

Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: E
Score: 0
