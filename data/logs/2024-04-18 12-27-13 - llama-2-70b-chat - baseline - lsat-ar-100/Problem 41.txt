Context: On the first day of a two-day study for a cycling magazine, four riders—Reynaldo, Seamus, Theresa, and Yuki—will each test one of four bicycles—F, G, H, and J. Each rider will then test a different one of the bicycles on the second day. Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day. The assignment of riders to bicycles is subject to the following conditions: Reynaldo cannot test F. Yuki cannot test J. Theresa must be one of the testers for H. The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
Question: If Theresa tests G on the second day, then which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Reynaldo tests H on the first day.
  B: Reynaldo tests J on the first day.
  C: Theresa tests H on the second day.
  D: Theresa tests J on the first day.
  E: Yuki tests H on the second day.
## Assistant 2:
  Answer: C

Theresa tests G on the second day, so she cannot test H on the second day. 
Since Theresa must test H, she must test it on the first day. 
Therefore, the statement "Theresa tests H on the first day" is true.

The given information states that Yuki cannot test J, so Yuki must test F or G on the first day. 
Since Theresa tests G on the second day, Yuki must test F on the first day. 
So, the statement "Yuki tests F on the first day" is true.

The given information also states that the bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day. 
Therefore, Seamus must test F on the second day.

The given information states that Reynaldo cannot test F, so Reynaldo must test G or J on the first day. 
Since Theresa tests G on the second day, Reynaldo must test J on the first day. 
So, the statement "Reynaldo tests J on the first day" is true.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
Action: Answer("C")
