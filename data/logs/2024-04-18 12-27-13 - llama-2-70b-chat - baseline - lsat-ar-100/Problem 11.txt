Context: During a recital, two pianists—Wayne and Zara—will perform solos. There will be five solos altogether, performed one immediately after another. Each solo will be either a modern piece or a traditional piece. The choice of pianist and type of piece for the solos must conform to the following conditions: The third solo is a traditional piece. Exactly two of the traditional pieces are performed consecutively. In the fourth solo, either Wayne performs a traditional piece or Zara performs a modern piece. The pianist who performs the second solo does not perform the fifth solo. No traditional piece is performed until Wayne performs at least one modem piece.
Question: Which one of the following could be all of the solos that are traditional pieces?
Choices:
  A: the first, third, and fourth
  B: the second, third, and fourth
  C: the third and fourth
  D: the third and fifth
  E: the fourth and fifth

The question asks us to determine which of the given options could be all of the traditional pieces performed during the recital. We must analyze the conditions given in the question and use a process of elimination to arrive at the answer.

Let's break down the conditions:

1. The third solo is a traditional piece.
2. Exactly two of the traditional pieces are performed consecutively.
3. In the fourth solo, either Wayne performs a traditional piece or Zara performs a modern piece.
4. The pianist who performs the second solo does not perform the fifth solo.
5. No traditional piece is performed until Wayne performs at least one modern piece.

From condition 1, we know that the third solo is traditional. Let's call it T3.

From condition 2, we know that two traditional pieces are performed consecutively. So, either the second solo is traditional (T2) and the third solo is traditional (T3), or the fourth solo is traditional (T4) and the fifth solo is traditional (T5).

From condition 3, we know that either Wayne performs a traditional piece in the fourth solo or Zara performs a modern piece. If Wayne performs a traditional piece in the fourth solo, then it must be T4. If Zara performs a modern piece in the fourth solo, then the fifth solo must be traditional (T5).

From condition 4, we know that the pianist who performs the second solo does not perform the fifth solo. So, if T2 is performed in the second solo, then the fifth solo cannot be traditional (T5).

From condition 5, we know that no traditional piece is performed until Wayne performs at least one modern piece. This means that if T2 is performed in the second solo, then Wayne must perform a modern piece in the first solo (M1). If T3 is performed in the third solo, then Wayne must perform a modern piece in the fourth solo (M4).

Now, let's analyze the options:

A: The first, third, and fourth solos are traditional pieces. This option violates condition 2, as only two traditional pieces are performed consecutively.

B: The second, third, and fourth solos are traditional pieces. This option violates condition 4, as the pianist who performs the second solo (Wayne) performs a traditional piece in the fourth solo.

C: The third and fourth solos are traditional pieces. This option satisfies all the conditions, as the third solo is traditional (T3), and either the fourth solo is traditional (T4) or the fifth solo is traditional (T5).

D: The third and fifth solos are traditional pieces. This option violates condition 5, as no traditional piece is performed until Wayne performs at least one modern piece.

E: The fourth and fifth solos are traditional pieces. This option violates condition 3, as Zara performs a modern piece in the fourth solo.

Therefore, the answer is C: The third and fourth solos are traditional pieces.
