Context: A bakery makes exactly three kinds of cookieâ€”oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar. Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day. The following conditions apply: No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
Question: If the number of batches made on Friday is exactly one, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: The first batch of sugar cookies is made on Monday.
  B: The first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Tuesday.
  C: The third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Friday.
  D: The first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Wednesday.
  E: The second batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday.
## Assistant 2:
  Thought: 
The question states that exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week, and no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. Therefore, we can conclude that each day of the week is used to make a batch of a different kind of cookie.

The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. Therefore, the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on a day before the second batch of oatmeal cookies.

The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday. Therefore, the first batch of sugar cookies is made on a day before Thursday.

The number of batches made on Friday is exactly one. Therefore, the third batch of one of the three kinds of cookies must be made on Friday.

Now, let's consider each choice:

A: The first batch of sugar cookies is made on Monday.
This is not possible, as the first batch of sugar cookies is made on a day before Thursday, and Monday is not a day before Thursday.

B: The first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Tuesday.
This is possible, as Tuesday is a day after Monday, and the first batch of oatmeal cookies could be made on Tuesday.

C: The third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Friday.
This is not possible, as the third batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Friday, as there is only one batch made on Friday, and it must be a different kind of cookie.

D: The first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Wednesday.
This is not possible, as the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on a day before the second batch of oatmeal cookies, and Wednesday is not a day before the second batch of oatmeal cookies.

E: The second batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday.
This is possible, as Tuesday is a day after Monday, and the second batch of peanut butter cookies could be made on Tuesday.

Therefore, the answer is E: The second batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday.
Action: Answer("E")
