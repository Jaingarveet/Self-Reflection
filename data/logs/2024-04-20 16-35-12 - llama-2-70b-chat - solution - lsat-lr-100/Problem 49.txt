Topic: Law
Context: A smoker trying to quit is more likely to succeed if his or her doctor greatly exaggerates the dangers of smoking. Similar strategies can be used to break other habits. But since such strategies involve deception, individuals cannot easily adopt them unless a doctor or some other third party provides the warning.
Question: Which one of the following is an assumption on which the argument depends?
Choices:
  A: People tend to believe whatever doctors tell them.
  B: Most of the techniques that help people quit smoking can also help people break other habits.
  C: The more the relevant danger is exaggerated, the more likely one is to break one's habit.
  D: People generally do not find it easy to deceive themselves.
  E: A doctor is justified in deceiving a patient whenever doing so is likely to make the patient healthier.

## Assistant 2:
  My previous answer was incorrect because I misunderstood the question. I thought the answer was referring to the best strategy to help someone quit smoking, rather than identifying the assumption on which the argument depends.

The correct answer is C: The more the relevant danger is exaggerated, the more likely one is to break one's habit.

The argument assumes that exaggerating the dangers of smoking will motivate the smoker to quit. The argument also assumes that this strategy can be applied to break other habits. Therefore, option C is the best answer.

Option A is not the assumption on which the argument depends. While it may be true that people tend to believe what doctors tell them, the argument does not rely on this assumption.

Option B is also not the assumption on which the argument depends. Although some techniques that help people quit smoking may also help people break other habits, this is not the main point of the argument.

Option D is incorrect because the argument relies on the idea that people can be deceived into breaking their habits. If people generally did not find it easy to deceive themselves, the argument would not work.

Option E is not relevant to the argument. While a doctor may be justified in deceiving a patient in certain circumstances, this is not the main point of the argument.

Therefore, the correct answer is C: The more the relevant danger is exaggerated, the more likely one is to break one's habit.
