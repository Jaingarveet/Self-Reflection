Topic: Law
Context: In his book, published in 1892, Grey used the same metaphor that Jordan used in her book, which was published in 1885. The metaphor is so unusual that there is little chance that two different people independently created it. Therefore, it is highly likely that Grey read Jordan's book.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the argument?
Choices:
  A: A text that was probably known to both Jordan and Grey was published in 1860 and also contained the same unusual metaphor.
  B: The passage in Grey's book that employs the unusual metaphor expresses an idea that bears little relation to any ideas expressed in Jordan's book.
  C: Both Grey's book and Jordan's book were written for the same audience.
  D: Jordan used the same metaphor in a work that she wrote in 1894 and published in 1895.
  E: According to most scholars, Grey was generally a more inventive writer than Jordan and developed many original metaphors.

Answer: B

Explanation:
The correct answer is B. The passage in Grey's book that employs the unusual metaphor expresses an idea that bears little relation to any ideas expressed in Jordan's book. This weakens the argument that Grey read Jordan's book, as it suggests that Grey may have independently come up with the metaphor to express a different idea.

In my previous answer, I incorrectly chose A. Upon reflection, I realized that choice A does not necessarily weaken the argument, as it is possible that both Jordan and Grey obtained the metaphor from the same source, which would still suggest that Grey was influenced by Jordan's work. Choice B, on the other hand, directly challenges the idea that Grey was influenced by Jordan's work, as it suggests that Grey used the metaphor for a different purpose. Therefore, B is the correct answer.
