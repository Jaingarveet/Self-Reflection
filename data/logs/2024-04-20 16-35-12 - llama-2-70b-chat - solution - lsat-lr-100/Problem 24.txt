The reasoning in this choice is similar to the argument provided in the question. Both arguments use a negative premise to conclude that a certain group of people does not have a particular characteristic. In the argument provided, the premise is that only a minority of those who engage in political action do so out of a sense of social justice. The conclusion is that some people who have a sense of social justice do not engage in political action.

In choice (A), the premise is that most scholars are not motivated by a desire to win prestigious academic prizes. The conclusion is that some of those who want to win prestigious academic prizes are not scholars.
