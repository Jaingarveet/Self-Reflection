Topic: Law
Context: A diet whose protein comes from fish is much healthier than one whose protein comes from red meat. Yet if everyone were to adopt this healthier diet, most of the marine species on which it is based would become extinct, making it impossible. Hence, we should not recommend the universal adoption of such a diet.
Question: The reasoning in which one of the following arguments most closely resembles that in the argument above?
Choices:
  A: Some studies have provided evidence that taking a vitamin E supplement every day reduces one's risk of heart attack. However, it has not been conclusively established that vitamin E supplements are safe for all people. So we should not recommend that everyone take vitamin E supplements every day.
  B: Governments are within their rights to tax tobacco heavily and spend this tax revenue on education. If these taxes become too high, however, people might smoke less, thereby reducing the funding thus generated for education. So such taxes might eventually have to be supplemented by other sources of revenue.
  C: A consumer is better off when limiting purchases to what he or she truly needs and saving or investing any remaining income. If everyone did this, however, the economy would be thrown into a severe recession, thereby making saving and investing impossible for most people. So we should not recommend this spending pattern to everyone.
  D: If legislators spent less time campaigning, they would have more time to do the jobs for which they were elected. But if they did not spend so much time campaigning, they probably would not get reelected. So it is not surprising that legislators spend so much time campaigning.
  E: If we restrict land development in wilderness areas, we help preserve many of the species that now inhabit these areas. But we also thereby reduce the proliferation of the admittedly smaller number of species, such as deer, that flourish in developed areas. So it is not always clear which areas should be designated as wilderness areas.

  Sure, I'll be happy to help!

The central idea of the argument is that a diet rich in fish protein is healthier, but its universal adoption would lead to the extinction of marine species, making it impossible.

Now, let's analyze the choices:

A: The argument focuses on the potential risks associated with vitamin E supplements, and it suggests that they should not be recommended for everyone until proven safe. This choice does not resemble the original argument because it does not address the potential consequences of universal adoption.

B: This argument acknowledges that taxing tobacco can fund education, but if taxes become too high, people might smoke less, reducing the revenue generated. This choice resembles the original argument in that it considers the potential consequences of universal adoption (everyone quitting smoking) and recognizes that a balance is needed. However, it does not directly address the health impacts of smoking.

C: This argument suggests that consumers should limit purchases to necessities, save, or invest their remaining income. However, if everyone did this, it could cause a recession, making saving and investing impossible. This choice resembles the original argument in that it considers the potential economic consequences of universal adoption.

D: This argument recognizes that legislators spend a lot of time campaigning, which takes away from their elected duties. However, if they didn't campaign as much, they might not get reelected. This choice does not resemble the original argument, as it does not address the potential consequences of universal adoption.

E: This argument acknowledges that restricting land development in wilderness areas can help preserve species, but it also recognizes that developed areas can support different species. This choice resembles the original argument in that it considers the potential consequences of universal adoption (designating all areas as wilderness) and recognizes the need for balance.

Based on my analysis, the answer that most closely resembles the reasoning in the argument is:

Action: Answer("B")
