Context: In 1963, a young macaque monkey was observed venturing into a hot spring to retrieve food which had fallen in. Soon, other macaques began to enter the spring, and over a few years this behavior was adopted by the entire troop. Prior to 1963, no macaques had ever been observed in the hot spring; by 1990, the troop was regularly spending time there during the winters. Thus, these macaques are able to adopt and pass on new patterns of social behavior, and are not complete captives of their genetic heritage.
Question: Which one of the following is an assumption required by the argument above?
Choices:
  A: Mutations in the genetic heritage of a certain variety of macaques can occur over a time span as short as a few years or decades.
  B: New patterns of behavior that emerge in macaque populations over the course of a few years or decades are not necessarily genetically predetermined.
  C: Only when behaviors become typical among an animal population can we conclude that a genetic alteration has occurred in that variety or species.
  D: The social behaviors of macaques are completely independent of their genetic heritage.
  E: The macaques' new pattern of behavior will persist over several generations.

## Assistant 2:
  My apologize for my previous response. After reflecting on the question, I realize that my answer was incorrect. The correct answer is (B) New patterns of behavior that emerge in macaque populations over the course of a few years or decades are not necessarily genetically predetermined.

The argument states that the macaques are able to adopt and pass on new patterns of social behavior, and are not complete captives of their genetic heritage. This implies that the new behavior of entering the hot spring is not genetically predetermined, but rather learned and passed on through social interaction. Therefore, option (B) is the best answer.

I mistakenly chose option (E) The macaques' new pattern of behavior will persist over several generations. While this may be true, it is not directly related to the argument's claim that the macaques are not complete captives of their genetic heritage.

I hope this corrected answer better addresses the question.
