Topic: Law
Context: People who are allergic to cats are actually allergic to certain proteins found in the animals' skin secretions and saliva; which particular proteins are responsible, however, varies from allergy sufferer to allergy sufferer. Since all cats shed skin and spread saliva around their environment, there is no such thing as a cat incapable of provoking allergic reactions, although it is common for a given cat to cause an allergic reaction in some-but not all-people who are allergic to cats.
Question: Which one of the following statements is most strongly supported by the information above?
Choices:
  A: Any particular individual will be allergic to some breeds of cat but not to others.
  B: No cat is capable of causing an allergic reaction in all types of allergy sufferers.
  C: Not all cats are identical with respect to the proteins contained in their skin secretions and saliva.
  D: The allergic reactions of some people who are allergic to cats are more intense than the allergic reactions of other allergy sufferers.
  E: There is no way to predict whether a given cat will produce an allergic reaction in a particular allergy sufferer.

## Assistant 2:
  My apologies for my previous mistake. After reflecting on the problem, I realize that my initial answer was incorrect. The correct answer is E: There is no way to predict whether a given cat will produce an allergic reaction in a particular allergy sufferer.

The passage states that "there is no such thing as a cat incapable of provoking allergic reactions" and that "not all cats are identical with respect to the proteins contained in their skin secretions and saliva." This means that all cats have the potential to cause allergic reactions in any allergy sufferer, and that the specific proteins responsible for the allergy can vary from cat to cat. Therefore, it is not possible to predict whether a particular cat will cause an allergic reaction in a specific allergy sufferer.

My previous answer, A: Any particular individual will be allergic to some breeds of cat but not to others, is not supported by the information in the passage. The passage does not mention breeds of cats or suggest that certain breeds are more likely to cause allergic reactions than others.

I hope this corrected answer is helpful. Please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns.
