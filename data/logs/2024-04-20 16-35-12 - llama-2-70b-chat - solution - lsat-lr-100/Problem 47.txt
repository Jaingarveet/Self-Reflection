Topic: Law
Context: Carl is clearly an incompetent detective. He has solved a smaller percentage of the cases assigned to him in the last 3 years—only 1 out of 25—than any other detective on the police force.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument above?
Choices:
  A: Because the police chief regards Carl as the most capable detective, she assigns him only the most difficult cases, ones that others have failed to solve.
  B: Before he became a detective, Carl was a neighborhood police officer and was highly respected by the residents of the neighborhood he patrolled.
  C: Detectives on the police force on which Carl serves are provided with extensive resources, including the use of a large computer database, to help them solve crimes.
  D: Carl was previously a detective in a police department in another city, and in the 4 years he spent there, he solved only 1 out of 30 crimes.
  E: Many of the officers in the police department in which Carl serves were hired or promoted within the last 5 years.

## Assistant 2:
  My apologize for my previous response. After reflecting on the problem, I realize that my answer was incorrect. The correct answer is choice A: Because the police chief regards Carl as the most capable detective, she assigns him only the most difficult cases, ones that others have failed to solve.

This answer choice weakens the argument that Carl is an incompetent detective because it suggests that the low percentage of cases he has solved may be due to the fact that he is being given the most challenging cases that others have been unable to solve. This casts doubt on the assumption that Carl's low success rate is due to his incompetence, and instead suggests that he may be facing particularly difficult challenges in his cases.

The other answer choices do not weaken the argument in the same way. Choice B, for example, may actually strengthen the argument against Carl by suggesting that he was not effective in his previous role as a neighborhood police officer. Choice C does not address the issue of Carl's low success rate, and choice D provides additional evidence that Carl has a history of low success rates, which supports the argument that he is incompetent. Choice E is not relevant to the argument.

Therefore, the correct answer is choice A.
