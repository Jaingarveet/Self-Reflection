Topic: Law
Context: Until 1985 all commercial airlines completely replenished the cabin air in planes in flight once every 30 minutes. Since then the rate has been once every hour. The less frequently cabin air is replenished in a plane in flight, the higher the level of carbon dioxide in that plane and the easier it is for airborne illnesses to be spread.
Question: Which one of the following is most strongly supported by the information above?
Choices:
  A: In 1985 there was a loosening of regulations concerning cabin air in commercial airline flights.
  B: People who fly today are more likely to contract airborne illnesses than were people who flew prior to 1985.
  C: Low levels of carbon dioxide in cabin air make it impossible for airborne illnesses to spread.
  D: In 1980 the rate at which the cabin air was replenished in commercial airliners was sufficient to protect passengers from the effects of carbon dioxide buildup.
  E: In 1980 the level of carbon dioxide in the cabin air on a two-hour commercial airline flight was lower than it is today on a similar flight.

## Assistant 2:
  My apologies for my previous mistake. Let's analyze the choices again:

A: In 1985 there was a loosening of regulations concerning cabin air in commercial airline flights.
The passage states that the rate of cabin air replenishment has decreased since 1985, which suggests a tightening, not loosening, of regulations. Therefore, this choice is incorrect.

B: People who fly today are more likely to contract airborne illnesses than were people who flew prior to 1985.
The passage mentions that the decrease in cabin air replenishment rate has made it easier for airborne illnesses to spread, but it does not directly state that people who fly today are more likely to contract illnesses than people who flew prior to 1985. This choice is not strongly supported by the information provided.

C: Low levels of carbon dioxide in cabin air make it impossible for airborne illnesses to spread.
The passage states that lower levels of carbon dioxide in cabin air make it easier for airborne illnesses to spread. Therefore, this choice is incorrect.

D: In 1980 the rate at which the cabin air was replenished in commercial airliners was sufficient to protect passengers from the effects of carbon dioxide buildup.
The passage does not provide information about the rate of cabin air replenishment in 1980, so we cannot assume that it was sufficient to protect passengers. Therefore, this choice is not supported by the information provided.

E: In 1980 the level of carbon dioxide in the cabin air on a two-hour commercial airline flight was lower than it is today on a similar flight.
The passage states that the level of carbon dioxide in cabin air increases as the rate of cabin air replenishment decreases. Therefore, if the rate of cabin air replenishment was higher in 1980 than it is today, then the level of carbon dioxide in cabin air would be lower. This choice is supported by the information provided.
