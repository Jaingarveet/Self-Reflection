## Assistant 2:
  My apologies for my previous mistake. I'll re-evaluate the question, considering my previous errors.

The given statements are:

1. Only Canadian films are shown at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival.
2. Most of the films that won prizes at that festival also won prizes at international film festivals.

From statement 1, we know that all films shown at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival are Canadian.
From statement 2, we know that most of the films that won prizes at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival also won prizes at international film festivals.

Now, let's evaluate the choices:

A: This year, most of the Canadian films that were shown at international film festivals won prizes at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival.

This statement is partially true, as we know that most of the films that won prizes at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival also won prizes at international film festivals. However, we cannot conclude that most of the Canadian films shown at international film festivals won prizes at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival, as there might be other Canadian films shown at international festivals that did not win prizes at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival.

B: Most of the Canadian Films produced this year were shown at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival.

This statement is false. We know that only Canadian films are shown at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival, but we cannot assume that most of the Canadian films produced this year were shown at the festival. There might be other Canadian films produced this year that were not shown at the festival.

C: Some of the films that won prizes at international film festivals this year were Canadian films.

This statement is true, as we know that most of the films that won prizes at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival also won prizes at international film festivals.

D: This year, not every film that won a prize at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival was also shown at an international film festival.

This statement is true, as we know that some films that won prizes at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival might not have been shown at international film festivals.

E: This year, at least one Film that won a prize at an international Film festival was not shown at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival.

This statement is true, as we know that not every film that won a prize at an international film festival was shown at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival.

Now, considering my previous mistakes and the given information, the correct answer must be choice C: Some of the films that won prizes at international film festivals this year were Canadian films.

Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
