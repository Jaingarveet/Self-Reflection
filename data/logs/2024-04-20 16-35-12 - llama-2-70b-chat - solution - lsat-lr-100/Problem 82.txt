Topic: Law
Context: Patricia: During Japan's Tokugawa period, martial arts experts known as ninjas were trained for the purposes of espionage and assassination. Yet at that time there was actually very little ninja activity in Japan, and most Japanese did not fear ninjas. Tamara: That is not true. Many wealthy Japanese during the Tokugawa period had their houses constructed with intentionally squeaky floors so that they would receive warning if a ninja were in the house.
Question: Of the following, which one, if true, is the strongest counter Patricia can make to Tamara's objection?
Choices:
  A: Many poor Japanese during the Tokugawa period also had houses constructed with intentionally squeaky floors.
  B: As part of their secret training, ninjas learned to walk on squeaky floors without making a sound.
  C: The wealthy made up a small portion of Japan's population during the Tokugawa period.
  D: The fighting prowess of ninjas was exaggerated to mythic proportions in the years following the Tokngawa period.
  E: There were very few ninjas at any time other than during the Tokugawa period.

## Assistant 2:
  Sure, I'll be happy to help. Here's my answer:

Action: Answer("B")

Reflection:
Previously, I incorrectly answered this question, selecting choice A.
Upon reflection, I realized that choice A does not directly address Tamara's objection that wealthy Japanese had houses constructed with intentionally squeaky floors.
Choice B, on the other hand, directly counters Tamara's objection by suggesting that ninjas were trained to walk on squeaky floors without making a sound.
Therefore, the strongest counter Patricia can make to Tamara's objection is choice B.

Is there anything else I can help you with?
