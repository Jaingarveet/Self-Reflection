Context: A significant amount of the acquisition budget of a typical university library is spent on subscriptions to scholarly journals. Over the last several years, the average subscription rate a library pays for such a journal has increased dramatically, even though the costs of publishing a scholarly journal have remained fairly constant Obviously, then, in most cases publishing a scholarly journal must be much more profitable now than it was several years ago.

Choices:
  A: Many university libraries have begun to charge higher and higher fines for overdue books and periodicals as a way of passing on increased journal subscription costs to library users.
  B: A university library's acquisition budget usually represents only a small fraction of its total operating budget.
  C: Publishing a scholarly journal is an expensive enterprise, and publishers of such journals cannot survive financially if they consistently lose money.

Solution:

1. Identify the conclusion of the argument: Publishing a scholarly journal must be much more profitable now than it was several years ago.
2. Identify the premises of the argument:
	* The average subscription rate for scholarly journals has increased dramatically.
	* The costs of publishing a scholarly journal have remained fairly constant.
3. Identify the weakening factor: Choice [REDACTED] states that most subscribers to scholarly journals are individuals, and the subscription rates for individuals have generally remained unchanged for the past several years.
4. Explain how the weakening factor affects the argument: The increase in subscription rates is not due to an increase in demand from individuals, but rather from an increase in the number of libraries subscribing to the journals. Therefore, the increase in subscription rates does not necessarily indicate an increase in profitability for the publishers.
5. Conclude that choice [REDACTED] weakens the argument.
