Context: Journalist: A manufacturers' trade group that has long kept its membership list secret inadvertently sent me a document listing hundreds of manufacturing companies. A representative of the trade group later confirmed that every company listed in the document does indeed belong to the trade group. Because Bruch Industries is not listed on the document, it is evidently not a member of the trade group.
Question: The journalist's reasoning in the argument is flawed in that the journalist
Choices:
  A: gives no reason to think that Bruch Industries would want to belong to the trade group
  B: does not present any evidence that the document names every member of the trade group
  C: does not explain how it is that the trade group could have inadvertently sent out a secret document

  I apologize for my previous mistake. Let's try again.

Context: Journalist: A manufacturers' trade group that has long kept its membership list secret inadvertently sent me a document listing hundreds of manufacturing companies. A representative of the trade group later confirmed that every company listed in the document does indeed belong to the trade group. Because Bruch Industries is not listed on the document, it is evidently not a member of the trade group.
Question: The journalist's reasoning in the argument is flawed in that the journalist
Choices:
  A: gives no reason to think that Bruch Industries would want to belong to the trade group
  B: does not present any evidence that the document names every member of the trade group
  C: does not explain how it is that the trade group could have inadvertently sent out a secret document
  D: presents no reason why Bruch Industries would not want its membership in the trade group to be known
  E: takes for granted the accuracy of a statement by a representative who had a reason to withhold information
Reflection:
1. Identify the assumption made by the journalist.
The journalist assumes that if Bruch Industries were a member of the trade group, its name would be listed on the document.
2. Determine whether the assumption is supported by evidence.
The assumption is not supported by evidence. The journalist has not provided any reason to believe that Bruch Industries would want to belong to the trade group or that the document lists all members of the trade group.
3. Consider alternative explanations for the information provided.
One alternative explanation is that Bruch Industries is not a member of the trade group, but the journalist has not considered other possibilities, such as the document being an incomplete list of members or a list of only certain members.
4. Evaluate the conclusion based on the available information.
The conclusion that Bruch Industries is not a member of the trade group is not supported by the available information. The journalist has not provided sufficient evidence to support the conclusion.
