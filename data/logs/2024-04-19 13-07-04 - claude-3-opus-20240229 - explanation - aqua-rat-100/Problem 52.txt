Question: X and Y are two alloys which were made by mixing zinc and copper in the ratio 6:9 and 7:11, respectively. If 40 grams of alloy X and 60 grams of alloy Y are melted and mixed to form alloy Z, what is the ratio of zinc and copper in the alloy Z ?
Choices:
  A: 69:91
  B: 59:91
  C: 59:90
  D: 59:91

Explanation:
I correctly calculated the amounts of zinc and copper in alloys X and Y, and the total amounts of zinc and copper in the resulting alloy Z. However, I made an error in simplifying the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z. I incorrectly simplified 39.33 : 60.67 to 59 : 91, but the correct simplification is 59 : 91.
## Assistant 2:
You're right, I made an error in simplifying the ratio last time. Let me solve this problem again, being more careful with the ratio simplification at the end.
Given:
- Alloy X: zinc and copper in the ratio 6:9
- Alloy Y: zinc and copper in the ratio 7:11
- 40 grams of alloy X and 60 grams of alloy Y are melted and mixed to form alloy Z
Step 1: Calculate the amount of zinc and copper in 40 grams of alloy X.
Zinc in X = (6/15) × 40 = 16 grams
Copper in X = (9/15) × 40 = 24 grams
Step 2: Calculate the amount of zinc and copper in 60 grams of alloy Y.
Zinc in Y = (7/18) × 60 = 23.33 grams
Copper in Y = (11/18) × 60 = 36.67 grams
Step 3: Calculate the total amount of zinc and copper in alloy Z.
Total zinc in Z = 16 + 23.33 = 39.33 grams
Total copper in Z = 24 + 36.67 = 60.67 grams
Step 4: Simplify the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z.
Ratio of zinc to copper in Z = 39.33 : 60.67
Simplifying this ratio, we get 59 : 91.
Therefore, the correct answer is B: 59:91.
Action: Answer("B")
