## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Explanation:
I made an error in my calculation of the upper bound for x. When I substituted n=72 into the expression, I miscalculated 4*√72, which should be approximately 33.9, not 34. This small error propagated through my calculation, leading me to incorrectly conclude that the upper bound for x was 63.64, when in fact it should have been slightly lower.
## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's approach this step-by-step, keeping in mind the error I made previously with the upper bound calculation.
1) The expression for x is: x = (n^2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16) / (n + 4√n + 4)
2) We're told that 36 ≤ n ≤ 72. Let's find the lower and upper bounds for x.
3) For the lower bound, substitute n = 36:
   x = (36^2 + 2√36(36 + 4) + 16) / (36 + 4√36 + 4)
     = (1296 + 480 + 16) / (36 + 24 + 4)
     = 1792 / 64
     = 28
4) For the upper bound, substitute n = 72 (and this time, calculate 4√72 carefully):
   x = (72^2 + 2√72(72 + 4) + 16) / (72 + 4√72 + 4)
     = (5184 + 2√72*76 + 16) / (72 + 4√72 + 4)
     = (5184 + 1292.82... + 16) / (72 + 33.94... + 4)  [Note: 4√72 ≈ 33.94, not 34]
     = 6492.82... / 109.94...
     ≈ 59.08
5) So the bounds are: 28 < x < 59.08 (approximately)
Looking at the choices, the one that best matches this range is:
D: 28 < x < 60
Therefore, the correct answer is D.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
