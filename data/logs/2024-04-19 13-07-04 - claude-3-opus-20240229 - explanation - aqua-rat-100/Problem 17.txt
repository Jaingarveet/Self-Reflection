Explanation:
I made an error in my calculation of the minimum selling price per unit. I correctly set up the problem and followed the right steps, but I made a small arithmetic mistake in the final step that led me to select the wrong answer choice.
## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step to make sure we get the right answer this time:
1) The company produces 420 components per month. Over a year that is:
   420 * 12 = 5040 components per year
2) The production cost is $110 per component. So the total yearly production cost is: 
   5040 * $110 = $554,400
3) They want a minimum yearly profit of $626,400. 
   So the total revenue must be at least:
   Minimum Revenue = Production Cost + Minimum Profit
                    = $554,400 + $626,400 
                    = $1,180,800
4) To get the minimum price per component, divide the minimum revenue by total yearly units:
   Minimum Price = Minimum Revenue / Yearly Units
                 = $1,180,800 / 5040
                 = $234.28571...
   
5) Rounding up to the nearest integer gives a minimum price of $235 per component.
6) Looking at the answer choices, $240 is the smallest value that is greater than or equal to $235.
Therefore, the minimum selling price per component that guarantees the desired yearly profit is $240.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
