## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: Points A, B, C, D lie in this order on the circumference of a circle. Minor arc AC is 160°, and minor arc BD is 150°. If B bisects minor arc AC, then what is the measure of minor arc AD?
Choices:
  A: 80°
  B: 130°
  C: 140°
  D: 160°
  E: 220°
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I made an error in my reasoning about the position of point [REDACTED] on the circle relative to points [REDACTED] and [REDACTED]. I incorrectly assumed that [REDACTED] was on the major arc A[REDACTED], leading me to calculate an incorrect measure for minor arc A[REDACTED].
## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step using the information provided:
1. Points A, B, C, D lie in order on the circumference of the circle.
2. Minor arc AC is 160°. Since B bisects minor arc AC, that means:
   - Minor arc AB = 160° / 2 = 80°
   - Minor arc BC = 160° / 2 = 80°
3. Minor arc BD is 150°. 
4. From the reflection, I know I previously made an error assuming D was on the major arc AC. So D must actually be on the minor arc AC.
5. To find the measure of minor arc AD, I can subtract minor arc BD from the full circle (360°):
   - Minor arc AD = 360° - 150° = 210°
However, 210° is not one of the answer choices. The closest is 220°.
Let me double check my work...
Aha! I made a small error. Minor arc AD should be:
- Minor arc AD = minor arc AB + minor arc BD
- Minor arc AD = 80° + 150° = 230°
230° is not one of the answer choices either. But based on the information given, it is the correct measure of minor arc AD.
Since I must select one of the given choices, I'll choose the closest answer.
Action: Answer("E")
## Result:
Agent Answer: E
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
