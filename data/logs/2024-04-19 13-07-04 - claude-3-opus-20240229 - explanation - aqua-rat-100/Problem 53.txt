Explanation:
I made an error in my calculations when solving the system of equations. Specifically, I made a mistake in step 4 when substituting the value of x from Equation 2 into Equation 1. This led me to incorrectly calculate the amount of money Sajal has, which in turn caused me to select the wrong answer.
## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's approach this step-by-step to find the correct answer.
Given:
- If Arjun gives $30 to Sajal, Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun.
- If Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal.
Let's define variables:
Let x = Arjun's money
Let y = Sajal's money
From the given conditions, we can form two equations:
Equation 1: y + 30 = 2(x - 30)
Equation 2: x + 10 = 3(y - 10)
Now, let's solve the equations:
Equation 1:
y + 30 = 2(x - 30)
y + 30 = 2x - 60
y = 2x - 90
Equation 2:
x + 10 = 3(y - 10)
x + 10 = 3y - 30
x = 3y - 40
Substitute x from Equation 2 into Equation 1:
y = 2(3y - 40) - 90
y = 6y - 80 - 90
y = 6y - 170
5y = 170
y = 34
Substitute y = 34 into Equation 2:
x = 3(34) - 40
x = 102 - 40
x = 62
Therefore, Arjun has $62 and Sajal has $34.
Action: Answer("E")
## Result:
Agent Answer: E
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
