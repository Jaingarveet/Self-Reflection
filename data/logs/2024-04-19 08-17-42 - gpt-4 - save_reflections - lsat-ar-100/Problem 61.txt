# Model: gpt-4 | Task: save_reflection | Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Problem 61 of 100
## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misunderstood the constraints. I focused on the relationship between Jaramillo and Kayne, and overlooked the fact that Landon can only be assigned to Zambia. This means that no other candidate can be assigned to Zambia, making option C the correct answer.
Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation
- Overlooking information
- Logical reasoning error
Solution:
Given the constraints, we know that:
- Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
- If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne.
- If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
- If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
From these constraints, we can deduce that:
- Landon is the only candidate who can be assigned to Zambia.
Therefore, the statement that cannot be true is:
- Novetzke is assigned as ambassador to Zambia. Because Landon is the only candidate who can be assigned to Zambia.
Instructions:
1. Read the question and constraints carefully.
2. Understand the relationships and conditions between the candidates and the ambassadorships.
3. Identify the constraints that are absolute and cannot be changed.
4. Use these constraints to eliminate options that cannot be true.
5. Choose the answer that is impossible based on the constraints.
Advice:
- Always read the question and constraints carefully.
- Understand the relationships and conditions between the elements.
- Identify the constraints that are absolute and cannot be changed.
- Use these constraints to eliminate options that cannot be true.
- Double-check your understanding of the constraints and your final answer.
