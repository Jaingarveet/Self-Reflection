# Model: gpt-4 | Task: save_reflection | Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Problem 72 of 100
## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misunderstood the constraints. I assumed that the pharmacy and the veterinarian had to be next to the optometrist and shoe store pair, but the constraints only state that the pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, not both. 
Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation
- Logical reasoning error
- Constraint misunderstanding
Solution:
Given the constraints, if the optometrist is next to the shoe store, the pharmacy must be on one side of this pair (since the pharmacy must be next to the optometrist). The other side cannot be a restaurant because the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. It also cannot be the veterinarian because the pharmacy is already next to the optometrist. Therefore, the other side of the pair must be the toy store. 
Instructions:
1. Understand the constraints of the problem.
2. Identify the businesses that must be next to the optometrist and shoe store pair based on the constraints.
3. Eliminate the businesses that cannot be next to the pair based on the constraints.
4. Choose the answer that includes the remaining businesses.
Advice:
- Always read the question and constraints carefully.
- Break down the problem and understand each part before attempting to solve it.
- Use logical reasoning to eliminate incorrect choices.
- Double-check your understanding of the constraints and your solution before finalizing your answer.
