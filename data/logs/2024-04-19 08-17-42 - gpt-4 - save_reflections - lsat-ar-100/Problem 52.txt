# Model: gpt-4 | Task: save_reflection | Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Problem 52 of 100
## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I overlooked the condition that Franco and Garcia cannot testify on the same day. I focused on the condition that Hong cannot testify on Monday and concluded that Franco and Garcia must both testify on Monday. However, I failed to consider the restriction on Franco and Garcia.
Error Keywords:
- Overlooking conditions
- Logical reasoning error
- Scheduling problem
Solution:
Given that Iturbe and Jackson are both testifying on Wednesday, and exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday, that leaves only one day, Monday, for the remaining three witnesses: Franco, Garcia, and Hong. Since Hong cannot testify on Monday, either Franco or Garcia must testify on Monday, but not both, because they cannot testify on the same day. Therefore, exactly one witness must testify on Monday.
Instructions:
1. Identify the conditions given in the problem.
2. Identify the day each witness is scheduled to testify.
3. Consider the restrictions on when each witness can testify.
4. Determine the number of witnesses that can testify on each day based on the conditions.
5. Choose the answer that must be true based on your analysis.
Advice:
- Always read the question carefully and understand the conditions.
- Always consider all conditions in the problem.
- Always think through each condition step-by-step.
- Never skip any conditions; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
- Always double-check your reasoning and final answer.
- Remember that in scheduling problems, the conditions often restrict the possible arrangements.
