# Model: gpt-4 | Task: save_reflection | Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Problem 86 of 100
## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I failed to consider all the constraints provided in the problem. I overlooked the fact that the bay holding textiles must be next to the bay holding produce, which would further limit the possible positions for the livestock and textiles.
Error Keywords:
- Comprehension error
- Logical reasoning error
- Constraint application error
Solution:
Given that bay 4 is holding produce, and the bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel, then fuel must be in one of the bays numbered 1, 2, or 3. 
The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce, so textiles must be in bay 3 or bay 5. However, since the bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles, textiles cannot be in bay 5. Therefore, textiles must be in bay 3.
Since textiles are in bay 3, livestock must be in bay 5. 
The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock, so grain must be in bay 6. 
So, the cargo for bays 3 (textiles), 4 (produce), 5 (livestock), and 6 (grain) are completely determined.
Instructions:
1. Understand the constraints provided in the problem.
2. Apply the constraints to the given situation.
3. Consider all possible positions for each type of cargo.
4. Eliminate positions that do not meet the constraints.
5. Determine the number of bays for which the type of cargo is completely determined.
Advice:
- Always read the question carefully and understand the constraints.
- Apply logical reasoning to solve the problem.
- Consider all possible scenarios before making a decision.
- Double-check your answer to ensure accuracy.
- Practice more problems to improve your logical reasoning skills.
