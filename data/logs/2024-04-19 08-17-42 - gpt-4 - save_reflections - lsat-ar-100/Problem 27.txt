## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I misunderstood the condition that Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. I interpreted it as Megregian cannot review the same play as Kramer and O'Neill, which is incorrect. The condition only implies that Megregian reviews more plays, not necessarily different ones.
Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation
- Condition misunderstanding
- Logical reasoning error
Solution:
From the conditions, Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. So, any option that does not include both Kramer and O'Neill is incorrect, eliminating option A. 
Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Since Jiang is not mentioned as reviewing Tamerlane, this does not eliminate any options. 
Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. This does not mean Megregian cannot review Tamerlane. It only means she reviews more plays. So, options D and E are possible. 
Since exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other, and Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, this means that no other student can review Tamerlane, eliminating option C. 
Therefore, the correct answer is D.
Instructions:
1. Understand the conditions given in the problem.
2. Interpret the conditions correctly and apply them to the options.
3. Eliminate options that do not meet the conditions.
4. Be careful not to misinterpret conditions.
5. Choose the answer that meets all conditions.
Advice:
- Always read the conditions carefully and understand them.
- Break down complex conditions into simpler ones.
- Be careful not to misinterpret conditions.
- Apply conditions to each option and eliminate those that do not meet them.
- Double-check your understanding of the conditions and your application of them to the options.
