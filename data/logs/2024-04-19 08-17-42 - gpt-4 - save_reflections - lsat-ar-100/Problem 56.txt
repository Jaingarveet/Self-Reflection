## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misunderstood the conditions. I assumed that Tiao could not be in Zone 1 or Zone 2, which led me to place Tiao in Zone 3. However, the conditions only state that Tiao cannot be in the same zone as Parra or Udall, not that Tiao cannot be in Zone 1 or Zone 2.
Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation
- Logical reasoning error
- Condition misunderstanding
Solution:
Given the conditions, Parra and Quinn work in the same zone, and Stuckey and Udall work in the same zone. Since either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, and either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2, it means that Parra and Udall cannot be in the same zone. Therefore, Parra and Quinn must be in Zone 1, and Stuckey and Udall must be in Zone 2. Since there are more representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, and more in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, it means that Zone 1 has at least 3 representatives, Zone 2 has 2, and Zone 3 has at least 2 but less than 3, so it also has 2 representatives. The remaining representatives are Kim, Mahr, and Tiao. Since Tiao cannot be in the same zone as Parra, Tiao could be in Zone 3, which makes option E: "Udall works in Zone 3" a possible scenario.
Instructions:
1. Understand the conditions given in the problem.
2. Identify the constraints for each sales representative.
3. Determine the possible zones for each sales representative based on the constraints.
4. Consider the additional condition given in the question.
5. Evaluate each answer choice based on the conditions and constraints.
6. Choose the answer that could be true based on your evaluation.
Advice:
- Always read the conditions carefully and understand the constraints.
- Break down the problem and analyze each part separately.
- Be careful not to make assumptions that are not supported by the conditions.
- Evaluate each answer choice carefully based on the conditions and constraints.
- Practice logical reasoning problems to improve your skills.
