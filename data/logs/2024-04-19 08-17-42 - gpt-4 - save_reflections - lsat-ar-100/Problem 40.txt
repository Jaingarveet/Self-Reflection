# Model: gpt-4 | Task: save_reflection | Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Problem 40 of 100
## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misunderstood the constraints. I assumed that the pharmacy could not be in space 1 because the shoe store is in space 2. However, the constraints only state that the pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, not that it cannot be next to any other business. 
Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation
- Constraint misunderstanding
- Logical error
Solution:
Given the constraints, the pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. This means the pharmacy could be in space 1 or space 7. Since the shoe store is in space 2, the pharmacy could be in space 1 if the optometrist or the veterinarian is in space 2. Therefore, the optometrist could be in space 5.
Instructions:
1. Understand the constraints of the problem.
2. Identify the possible locations for each business based on the constraints.
3. Consider the given condition (shoe store is in space 2) and how it affects the possible locations for each business.
4. Evaluate each answer choice based on the possible locations for each business.
5. Choose the answer that could be true based on the constraints and the given condition.
Advice:
- Always read the question and constraints carefully.
- Understand the implications of each constraint.
- Consider all possible scenarios based on the constraints.
- Evaluate each answer choice carefully.
- Don't make assumptions that are not supported by the constraints or the given condition.
