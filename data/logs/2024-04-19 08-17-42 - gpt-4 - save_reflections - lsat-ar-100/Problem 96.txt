Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misunderstood the conditions. I assumed that the Himalayans must be featured on days 3, 5, and 6, which is not necessarily true. This led me to incorrectly eliminate choice B.
Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation
- Logical reasoning error
- Condition misunderstanding
Solution:
Given the conditions, the Himalayans cannot be featured on day 1, 2, or any day with Rottweilers. Since the Himalayans must be featured on exactly three days, they could be featured on days 3, 4, and 5 or days 4, 5, and 6. Since no breed featured on day 1 can be featured on day 7, the Himalayans cannot be featured on day 7. Therefore, the Himalayans must be featured on days 3, 4, and 5 or days 4, 5, and 6. This means that the Rottweilers cannot be featured on day 5 (choice C), and the Greyhounds cannot be featured on day 7 (choice E). This leaves choices A, B, and D. Since the Manx and Siamese can be featured on any day that does not feature the Himalayans, either could be true. However, since the Himalayans are featured on day 6, choice D is not possible. Therefore, the correct answer is B: Siamese are featured on day 4.
Instructions:
1. Understand the conditions given in the question.
2. Identify the days on which each breed can be featured based on the conditions.
3. Eliminate the choices that violate the conditions.
4. Choose the answer that does not violate any conditions and could be true based on the given conditions.
Advice:
- Always read the question and conditions carefully.
- Understand the implications of each condition.
- Use logical reasoning to eliminate incorrect choices.
- Double-check your understanding of the conditions and your reasoning before choosing an answer.
