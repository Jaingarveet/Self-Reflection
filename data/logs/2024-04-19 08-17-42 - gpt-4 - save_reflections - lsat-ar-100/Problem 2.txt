# Model: gpt-4 | Task: save_reflection | Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Problem 2 of 100
## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misunderstood the original constraint and its implications on the arrangement of the businesses. I focused on the separation of the restaurants, but I didn't consider the impact of the pharmacy's location, which is also a crucial part of the problem.
Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation
- Logical reasoning error
- Constraint understanding error
Solution:
The original constraint states that the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. This means that there must be at least two businesses between the two restaurants. However, the pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. This means that the restaurant nearest to the pharmacy can't be more than two spaces away from it. Therefore, the correct answer is D: "No more than two businesses can separate the pharmacy and the restaurant nearest it."
Instructions:
1. Understand the original constraints of the problem.
2. Consider the implications of each constraint on the arrangement of the businesses.
3. Understand the question and what it's asking for.
4. Evaluate each choice based on the original constraints and the question.
5. Choose the answer that best fits the original constraints and the question.
Advice:
- Always read the question and constraints carefully.
- Understand the implications of each constraint.
- Consider all aspects of the problem, not just the ones that seem most obvious.
- Practice logical reasoning problems to improve your skills.
- Don't rush your answer, take your time to understand the problem fully.
