# Model: gpt-4 | Task: save_reflection | Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Problem 13 of 100
## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I misunderstood the question and made an incorrect assumption. I assumed that since Franco and Hong testify on the same day, and Hong cannot testify on Monday, they must testify on Tuesday. However, the question does not specify that Franco and Hong cannot testify on Wednesday. This led me to incorrectly conclude that Garcia must testify on Monday.
Error Keywords:
- Misunderstanding
- Incorrect assumption
- Logical reasoning error
Solution:
Given that Franco and Hong testify on the same day, and Hong cannot testify on Monday, Franco and Hong must testify on Tuesday or Wednesday. Since Iturbe is scheduled to testify on Wednesday and exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday, Franco and Hong must testify on Tuesday. Therefore, the correct answer is "D: Hong is scheduled to testify on Tuesday."
Instructions:
1. Understand the conditions given in the question.
2. Identify the constraints for each witness.
3. Determine the possible days each witness can testify.
4. If a condition is given (like Franco and Hong testifying on the same day), apply this to the possible days.
5. Based on the conditions and constraints, determine the necessary truth of the schedule.
Advice:
- Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
- Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
- Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
- Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
- Always double-check your reasoning and final answer.
- Be careful not to make assumptions that are not supported by the information given in the question.
