# Model: gpt-4 | Task: save_reflection | Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Problem 92 of 100
## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misunderstood the conditions. I incorrectly assumed that if Quinn and Udall were in the same zone, Parra and Stuckey would also be in the same zone. However, the conditions do not state that Parra and Stuckey cannot be in the same zone. The conditions only state that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, and either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Therefore, my assumption was incorrect.
Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation
- Logical error
- Assumption error
Solution:
Given the conditions, we know that Parra and Quinn work in the same zone, and Stuckey and Udall work in the same zone. If Quinn and Tiao were in the same zone, that would mean Parra and Tiao are in the same zone, which contradicts the condition that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Therefore, Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Tiao.
Instructions:
1. Understand the conditions given in the problem.
2. Identify the relationships between the sales representatives and the zones.
3. Analyze the conditions and relationships to determine which sales representatives cannot work in the same zone.
4. Do not make assumptions that are not supported by the conditions.
5. Choose the answer that matches your analysis.
Advice:
- Always read the question and conditions carefully.
- Understand the relationships and conditions before making any conclusions.
- Do not make assumptions that are not supported by the conditions.
- Use logical reasoning to solve the problem.
- Double-check your answer to ensure it does not contradict any conditions.
