# Model: gpt-4 | Task: save_reflection | Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Problem 65 of 100
## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I misunderstood the conditions of the problem. I incorrectly assumed that only two zoologists could be selected if M was chosen. However, the condition states that if M is selected, both P and R must be selected, but it does not limit the selection to only P and R. Therefore, Q can also be selected, which makes option E the correct answer.
Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation of conditions
- Incorrect assumption
- Logical error
Solution:
If M is the only chemist selected, then according to the conditions, both P and R must be selected. This means that at least two zoologists are selected. Therefore, only one botanist can be selected because if more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. However, the condition does not limit the selection to only P and R, so Q can also be selected. Therefore, the correct answer is E: P, Q, and R are all selected.
Instructions:
1. Understand the conditions of the problem.
2. Identify the implications of each condition.
3. Apply the conditions to the given situation.
4. Evaluate each option based on the conditions and the given situation.
5. Choose the option that must be true based on the conditions and the given situation.
Advice:
- Always read and understand the conditions of the problem.
- Be careful not to make assumptions that are not supported by the conditions.
- Evaluate each option carefully.
- Remember that the question asks for what must be true, not what could be true.
