# Model: gpt-4 | Task: save_reflection | Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Problem 55 of 100
## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I did not thoroughly check all the conditions for each option. Specifically, I failed to notice that in option A, three witnesses are scheduled to testify on Wednesday, which violates the condition that exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
Error Keywords:
- Comprehension error
- Detail oversight
- Condition checking error
Solution:
The conditions are:
1. Franco does not testify on the same day that Garcia testifies.
2. Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
3. Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
4. Hong does not testify on Monday.
5. At least one witness testifies on Monday.
Let's check each option again:
A: Violates condition 3 as three witnesses testify on Wednesday.
B: Violates condition 2 as Iturbe does not testify on Wednesday.
C: Violates condition 1 as Franco and Garcia testify on the same day.
D: Meets all conditions.
E: Violates condition 2 as Iturbe does not testify on Wednesday.
Therefore, the correct answer is D.
Instructions:
1. Understand the conditions given in the question.
2. Check each option against all conditions.
3. Eliminate options that violate any condition.
4. Choose the option that meets all conditions.
Advice:
- Always read the question and conditions carefully.
- Break down the problem into smaller parts.
- Check each option against all conditions, not just until one is met.
- Be thorough and meticulous in checking details.
- Practice more problems to improve comprehension and detail checking skills.
