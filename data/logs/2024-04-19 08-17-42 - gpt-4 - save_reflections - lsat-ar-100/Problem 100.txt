# Model: gpt-4 | Task: save_reflection | Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Problem 100 of 100
## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misinterpreted the conditions. I failed to correctly apply the condition that at least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F. I also overlooked the condition that O is performed either first or fifth.
Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation
- Overlooking information
- Logical reasoning error
Solution:
Let's go through the conditions one by one and see which option satisfies all of them.
1. T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R. 
2. At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F. 
3. O is performed either first or fifth. 
4. The eighth composition performed is either L or H. 
5. P is performed at some time before S. 
6. At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
Option A: Satisfies all conditions.
Option B: Fails condition 2, there are not at least two compositions between F and R.
Option C: Fails condition 3, O is not first or fifth.
Option D: Fails condition 4, H is not the eighth composition.
Option E: Fails condition 1, T is not immediately before F or after R.
Instructions:
1. Read the question and all conditions carefully.
2. Understand the constraints of the problem.
3. Go through each option one by one.
4. Check each condition against the option.
5. If an option fails any condition, eliminate it and move to the next.
6. The correct answer is the option that satisfies all conditions.
Advice:
- Always read the question and conditions carefully.
- Understand the constraints of the problem.
- Break down the problem into smaller parts.
- Use a systematic approach to eliminate incorrect options.
- Double-check your final answer to ensure it meets all conditions.
