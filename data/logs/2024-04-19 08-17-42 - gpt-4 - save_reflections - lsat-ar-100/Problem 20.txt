# Model: gpt-4 | Task: save_reflection | Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Problem 20 of 100
## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misunderstood the conditions. I assumed that Robert could not give a report in the morning, but the condition only stated that Robert could not give an afternoon report. This led me to incorrectly eliminate option D.
Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation
- Condition misunderstanding
- Incorrect elimination
Solution:
Given the conditions, we know that:
1. George can only give a report on Tuesday.
2. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report, so they can only report in the morning.
3. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, could be given by:
D: Olivia, Robert, and Irving - This is possible. Olivia gives a report on Monday morning, Robert gives a report on Tuesday morning, and Irving gives a report on Wednesday morning.
Instructions:
1. Understand the conditions given in the question.
2. Identify the constraints for each student.
3. Eliminate options that do not meet the conditions.
4. Choose the option that meets all the conditions.
Advice:
- Always read the conditions carefully and understand them.
- Make sure to correctly interpret the conditions.
- Use the process of elimination to narrow down the options.
- Double-check your understanding of the conditions and your final answer.
