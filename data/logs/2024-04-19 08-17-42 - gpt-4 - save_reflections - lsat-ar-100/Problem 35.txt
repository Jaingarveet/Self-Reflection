# Model: gpt-4 | Task: save_reflection | Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Problem 35 of 100
## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misunderstood the conditions given in the problem. I assumed that it was possible for only one batch of cookies to be made on Friday, but given the conditions, this is not possible. 
Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation
- Logical reasoning error
- Condition misunderstanding
Solution:
Given the conditions, we know that no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day, and that the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. This means that there must be at least one day where two batches of cookies are made. Since the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, and no two batches of the same kind of cookie can be made on the same day, this means that there must be at least one day before Thursday where two batches of cookies are made. Therefore, it is not possible for only one batch of cookies to be made on Friday, making statement E the correct answer.
Instructions:
1. Understand the conditions given in the problem.
2. Identify the constraints and limitations.
3. Apply logical reasoning to the conditions.
4. Consider each answer choice and determine if it could be false given the conditions.
5. Choose the answer that could be false based on your reasoning.
Advice:
- Always read the question and conditions carefully.
- Understand the constraints and limitations before attempting to answer the question.
- Apply logical reasoning to the conditions.
- Consider each answer choice carefully.
- Double-check your reasoning before finalizing your answer.
