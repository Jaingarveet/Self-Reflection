## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that the data in the table provided evidence that infection with varroa mites increases a honeybee's susceptibility to secondary infections. However, the data in the table do not indicate whether the honeybees had been infected with mites.
Error Keywords:
 - Assumption error
 - Data interpretation error
 - Causal inference error
Solution:
The data in the table show the percent of colonies affected by each pathogen for colonies with colony collapse disorder and colonies without colony collapse disorder.
The data do not provide information about whether the honeybees had been infected with mites.
Therefore, the data do not provide support for the authors' claim that infection with varroa mites increases a honeybee's susceptibility to secondary infections.
Instructions:
1. Carefully read the question and identify the claim being made.
2. Identify the data that is being presented to support the claim.
3. Determine whether the data provides evidence to support the claim.
4. If the data does not provide evidence to support the claim, state that the data does not support the claim.
5. Do not make assumptions or draw conclusions that are not supported by the data.
Advice:
 - Be cautious about making assumptions or drawing conclusions that are not supported by the data.
 - When evaluating data, consider the source of the data, the methods used to collect the data, and the limitations of the data.
 - Be aware of your own biases and how they might influence your interpretation of the data.
 - Seek out multiple perspectives and consider alternative explanations for the data.
