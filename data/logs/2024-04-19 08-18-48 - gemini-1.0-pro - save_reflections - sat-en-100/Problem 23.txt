## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:** My initial answer was incorrect because I focused too narrowly on the specific sentence about expansion and missed the broader context of Douglas's argument. While expansion is mentioned, the main purpose of the passage is to use the country's growth as evidence that a divided Union can still be successful.
**Error Keywords:**
* **Contextual Misunderstanding:** Failing to consider the broader context of the passage.
* **Selective Focus:** Focusing on a specific detail while ignoring the overall argument.
* **Misinterpretation of Author's Intent:** Misunderstanding the author's main purpose.
**Solution:**
1. **Read the entire passage carefully:** Pay attention to the overall argument and how each sentence contributes to it.
2. **Identify the author's main point:** Ask yourself, "What is the author trying to prove or argue?"
3. **Analyze the evidence provided:** Consider how each piece of evidence supports the author's main point.
4. **Choose the answer that best reflects the author's main purpose:** Select the option that aligns with the overall argument of the passage.
**Instructions for Future Reference:**
1. **Read the entire passage multiple times:** Ensure a thorough understanding of the content.
2. **Identify the author's main point:** Ask yourself, "What is the author trying to achieve?"
3. **Analyze the supporting evidence:** Consider how each piece of evidence contributes to the main point.
4. **Eliminate answer choices that are irrelevant or contradict the main point:** Focus on options that align with the author's argument.
5. **Choose the answer that best reflects the author's purpose:** Select the option that most accurately captures the overall message of the passage.
**General Advice for Similar Problems:**
* **Pay close attention to context:** Consider the surrounding sentences and the overall argument of the passage.
* **Avoid selective focus:** Analyze the passage as a whole, not just isolated sentences or phrases.
* **Understand the author's intent:** Identify the main point the author is trying to make.
