## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I did not consider the impact of planting wheat or corn on the percentage of the surface of each strip covered with weeds. 
My error was in failing to consider all relevant information in the passage.
Error Keywords:
 - Incomplete analysis
 - Missing information
 - Overlooking relevant details
Solution:
The passage states that the pilot experiments were conducted without planting any crops to avoid competition with the emerging weeds. 
Therefore, the presence of crops would likely have affected the percentage of the surface of each strip covered with weeds. 
Planting crops would have introduced competition for resources, such as sunlight and nutrients, which could have reduced the growth of weeds.
Instructions:
1. Read the passage carefully and identify all relevant information.
2. Consider all possible factors that could affect the outcome of the experiment.
3. Analyze the impact of each factor on the percentage of the surface of each strip covered with weeds.
4. Choose the answer that best reflects the likely outcome of the experiment.
Advice:
 - Pay attention to all details in the passage, even those that seem insignificant.
 - Consider all possible scenarios and their potential outcomes.
 - Be cautious about making assumptions that are not explicitly stated in the passage.
 - When in doubt, choose the answer that is most consistent with the information provided.
