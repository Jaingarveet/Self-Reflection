## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:** I did not fully analyze the text and consider all of Akira's potential concerns. I focused on Chie's amusement and Naomi's seriousness, overlooking Akira's anxieties.
**Error Keywords:**
* Incomplete analysis
* Overlooking character's emotions
* Focusing on specific details instead of overall context
**Solution:**
1. **Read the passage carefully:** Pay close attention to Akira's words and actions, especially those indicating fear or concern.
2. **Analyze character emotions:** Consider what Akira might be feeling beyond the surface level.
3. **Consider the context:** Think about the social norms and expectations of the time and place.
4. **Eliminate irrelevant choices:** Discard options that are not supported by evidence in the text.
**Instructions for Future:**
1. Read the passage multiple times, focusing on different aspects each time.
2. Annotate the text to identify key points and character emotions.
3. Summarize the main points of the passage in your own words.
4. Consider the author's purpose and intended audience.

**General Advice:**
* **Read actively and critically:** Don't just skim the surface; engage with the text and think deeply about its meaning.
* **Consider multiple perspectives:** Think about how different characters might interpret the same situation.
* **Don't jump to conclusions:** Base your answers on evidence from the text, not on assumptions or personal opinions.
* **Be aware of common pitfalls:** Watch out for biases, misinterpretations, and oversimplifications.
* **Practice, practice, practice:** The more you read and analyze texts, the better you will become at understanding them.
