## Assistant 2:
## Self-Reflection: 
**Previous Incorrect Answer:** 
I incorrectly answered "A: Single bubble appearance" for the X-ray feature of pyloric stenosis.
**Reasoning for the Incorrect Answer:** 
I mistakenly associated the single bubble appearance with pyloric stenosis, which is actually associated with duodenal atresia.
**Correct Answer:** 
The correct answer is "B: Double bubble appearance." This is a characteristic finding on X-ray for pyloric stenosis, where the distended stomach and proximal duodenum create the double bubble appearance.
**Learning from the Mistake:** 
I need to be more careful in differentiating between similar-sounding conditions and their associated X-ray features. I will review the X-ray findings of duodenal atresia and pyloric stenosis to solidify my understanding.
**Action:** 
Based on my self-reflection and the correct answer, I will now answer the question: 
Action: Answer("B") 
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
