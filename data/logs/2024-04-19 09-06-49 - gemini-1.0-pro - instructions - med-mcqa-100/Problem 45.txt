I understand. I will use my self-reflection to answer this question correctly.
**Self-Reflection:**
* **Problem:** I previously answered the question incorrectly, selecting "1982" as the answer.
* **Solution:** I need to carefully analyze the available choices and consider the historical context of mental health programs.
* **Correct Answer:** The correct answer is likely to be a year after 1982, as mental health programs have evolved significantly since then.
**Answer:**
Based on my self-reflection and the historical context of mental health programs, I believe the correct answer is:
**Action: Answer("B")** 
**Explanation:**
While I cannot access specific information about the start date of the mental health program in question, I can reason that 1987 is a more likely answer than 1982. Mental health programs have seen significant advancements since the early 1980s, making it more probable that the program began in a later year.
