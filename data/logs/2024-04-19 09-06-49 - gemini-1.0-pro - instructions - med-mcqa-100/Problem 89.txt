Thought: 
I previously answered this question incorrectly.
I need to carefully consider each option and its usefulness in diagnosing Spondylolisthesis.
Anteroposterior X-ray and Lateral view X-ray are both useful in visualizing the alignment of the vertebrae and identifying the degree of slippage.
CT provides detailed bony anatomy and can be helpful in assessing for associated fractures or bony abnormalities.
MRI is the most sensitive imaging modality for visualizing soft tissues, including the spinal cord and nerve roots. It can also be helpful in identifying the cause of spondylolisthesis, such as a pars defect.
Therefore, all of the options are useful investigations for Spondylolisthesis.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
