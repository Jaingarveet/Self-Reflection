Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Understand the purpose of chemical peeling and the types of agents typically used. 
2. Evaluate each option independently, considering their unique properties and mechanisms of action. 
3. Avoid making assumptions about the completeness of the choices provided. 
4. Specifically, consider the mechanism of action and target skin concerns for each agent. 
5. Identify the agent that does not align with the typical goals of chemical peeling, which is primarily exfoliation and surface skin renewal.
## Assistant 2:
Reflection: I initially answered this question incorrectly, attributing the incorrect assumption that hydroquinone was primarily used for chemical peeling, while it is in fact commonly used for skin lightening. Upon further review, I can see that hydroquinone is not one of the choices, and kojic acid, which was the correct answer, also has skin-lightening properties. This reflects the importance of a nuanced understanding of the mechanisms and multiple uses of these agents.

Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
