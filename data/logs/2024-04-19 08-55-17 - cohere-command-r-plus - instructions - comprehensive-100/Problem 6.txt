## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: R, S, T, and U are points on a line, and U is the midpoint of line segment ST. If the lengths of line segments RS, RT, and ST are 5, 17, and 22, respectively. What is the length of line segment RU?
Choices:
  A: 6
  B: 7
  C: 8
  D: 9
  E: 10
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Understand the given information: segment lengths RS, RT, and ST.
2. Identify the relationship between the segments: U is the midpoint of ST.
3. Calculate the length of UT since U is the midpoint: UT = ST / 2.
4. Find the length of RU using the given information: RU = RT - UT.
5. Double-check your calculations and the relationship between the segments.
[REDACTED]. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Given that RS = 5, RT = 17, and ST = 22, and U is the midpoint of ST, we can find the length of RU.

Since U is the midpoint of ST, the length of UT is half of ST, so UT = 22 / 2 = 11.

Now, to find RU, we subtract UT from RT: RU = RT - UT = 17 - 11 = 6.

So, the length of the line segment RU is 6 units.
Action: Answer("A")

Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
