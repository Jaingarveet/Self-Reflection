## User 2:
Topic: Law
Context: The chairperson of Acme Corporation has decided to move the company from its current location in Milltown to Ocean View. Most Acme employees cannot afford housing within a 30-minute commute of Ocean View. So once the company has moved, most Acme employees will have a commute of more than 30 minutes.
Question: The argument requires assuming which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: All Acme employees can afford housing within a 30-minute commute of Milltown.
  B: The chairperson of Acme has good financial reasons for wanting to move the company to Ocean View.
  C: None of Acme's employees except the chairperson are in favor of moving the company to Ocean View.
  D: Currently, most Acme employees have a commute of less than 30 minutes.
  E: Acme's move to Ocean View will not be accompanied by a significant pay raise for Acme employees.
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Identify the key premise of the argument: most employees will have longer commutes after the move. 
2. Recognize the condition required for this premise to hold true: employees' financial situation must remain largely unchanged. 
3. Understand that the absence of a significant pay raise ensures employees cannot afford housing for shorter commutes. 
4. Choose the answer option that reflects this absence of a pay raise.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: The argument assumes that the employees' financial situation will remain relatively unchanged after the move, as indicated by the fact that they 'cannot afford' the housing near Ocean View. Therefore, it can be inferred that there is an absence of a significant pay raise accompanying the move, choice E, which ensures that employees' commutes will indeed be longer.
Action: Answer("E")
## Result:
Agent Answer: E
Correct Answer: E
Score: 1
