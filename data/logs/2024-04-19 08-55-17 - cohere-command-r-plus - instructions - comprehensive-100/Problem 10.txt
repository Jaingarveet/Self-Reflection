## Assistant 2:
Reflection: I made a mistake in calculating the number of family members. There are 11 family members in total: 5 sons + 4 daughters + 2 nephews = 11. 

Correct calculation:
1. There are a total of 11 family members: 5 sons + 4 daughters + 2 nephews = 11.
2. Each nephew's share: Rs 8600 / 11 = Rs 781.82
3. Each daughter's share is four times that of a nephew: Rs 781.82 x 4 = Rs 3127.28

Answer: Approximately Rs 3100, which corresponds to choice A: Rs 400.

Action: Answer("A")
