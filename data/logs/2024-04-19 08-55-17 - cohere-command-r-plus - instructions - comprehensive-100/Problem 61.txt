# Model: cohere-command-r-plus | Agent: instructions | Exam: comprehensive-100 | Problem 61 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:

## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: If $(a x+2)(b x+7)=15 x^{2}+c x+14$ for all values of $x$, and $a+b=8$, what are the two possible values for $c$ ?
Choices:
  A: 3 and 5
  B: 6 and 35
  C: 10 and 21
  D: 31 and 41
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Expand the left side of the equation and match coefficients. 
2. Solve for $a$ and $b$ using the given equations. 
3. Plug the values of $a$ and $b$ into the expression $7a$ to find the two possible values for $c$. 
4. Check your calculations and ensure you are correctly solving for $c$.
## Assistant 2:
Reflection: I incorrectly set up the system of equations, which led to an incorrect solution. To get the correct answer, I need to properly substitute the values of $a$ and $b$ into the equation to find the possible values of $c$.

Thought: 
Expanding the left side of the equation, we get $abx^2+7ax+2bx+14=15x^2+cx+14$.
Matching coefficients, we get:
$ab = 15$
$7a+2b = c$
$a+b = 8$

Solving the system of equations, we find $a=3, b=5$ or $a=5, b=3$.

Plugging these values into $7a$, we get $c=35$ when $a=5$ and $c=21$ when $a=3$.

Therefore, the two possible values for $c$ are 21 and 35.
Action: Answer("C")
