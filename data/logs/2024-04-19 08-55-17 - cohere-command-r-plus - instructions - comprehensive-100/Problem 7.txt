Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Calculate the total weight of the original 10 vehicles by multiplying the average weight by the number of vehicles.
2. Calculate the new average weight by adding the given increase to the original average.
3. Calculate the total weight of the new group by multiplying the new average weight by the new total number of vehicles (original + 1).
4. Find the weight of the new heavy-duty truck by subtracting the original total weight from the new total weight.
5. Check your calculations and ensure the answer matches one of the given choices.
## Assistant 2:
Reflection: I made an error in my previous attempt; I added the increase in weight to the original total weight, rather than considering the new average weight. This led me to choose an answer that was too high. To find the correct solution, I must calculate the new average weight and then determine the total weight of the group, including the new truck.

Thought: 
First, we calculate the total weight of the original 10 vehicles: 
10 vehicles * 12.2 tons/vehicle = 122 tons

Now, we find the new average weight: 
Original average weight + Increase = New average weight
12.2 tons + 2.6 tons = 14.8 tons

With the new vehicle, there are 11 vehicles in total. So, the total weight of the new group is: 
14.8 tons/vehicle * 11 vehicles = 162.8 tons

Finally, we can find the weight of the new heavy-duty truck by subtracting the original total weight from the new total weight: 
162.8 tons - 122 tons = 40.8 tons

So, the weight of the heavy-duty truck is 40.8 tons.

Action: Answer("A")
