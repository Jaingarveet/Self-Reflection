# Model: cohere-command-r-plus | Agent: instructions | Exam: comprehensive-100 | Problem 98 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Medicine.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:
Topic: Geography
Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Medicine
Subtopic: Biochemistry
Question: Aminoacyl t-RNA is not require for ?
Choices:
  A: Proline
  B: Lysine
  C: Hydroxylysine
  D: Methionine
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and identify the specific amino acids mentioned. 
2. Consider the role of aminoacyl t-RN[REDACTED] in protein translation and the charging of tRN[REDACTED] with amino acids. 
3. Recognize that [REDACTED] is not a standard amino acid and is not directly incorporated during translation. 
4. Understand that the question is asking about a process that occurs during protein translation. 
5. Select the answer choice that represents the amino acid not requiring aminoacyl t-RN[REDACTED] in this context.
## Assistant 2:
Reflection: I made a mistake in my previous answer selection. The question is asking about amino acids that do not require aminoacyl t-RNA, which is involved in protein translation. I incorrectly chose proline (A) as the answer, but proline is indeed dependent on aminoacyl t-RNA for its incorporation into proteins. The correct answer is actually C: Hydroxylysine. This is because hydroxylysine is not a standard amino acid and is not directly incorporated into proteins during translation.

Thought: Aminoacyl t-RNA is required for the charging of tRNA with amino acids during protein translation. However, hydroxylysine is not a standard amino acid and is not directly incorporated during translation.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
