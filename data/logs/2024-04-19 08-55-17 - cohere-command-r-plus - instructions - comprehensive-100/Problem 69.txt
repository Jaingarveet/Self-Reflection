# Model: cohere-command-r-plus | Agent: instructions | Exam: comprehensive-100 | Problem 69 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:
Topic: Geography
Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: $$\begin{aligned}& 2 x-3 y=-14 \\& 3 x-2 y=-6\end{aligned}$$If $(x, y)$ is a solution to the system of equations above, what is the value of $x-y$ ?
Choices:
  A: -20
  B: $\quad-8$
  C: -4
  D: 8
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:

1. Multiply the first equation by 3 and the second equation by 2 to make the coefficients of $x$ equal.
2. Add (or subtract) the equations to eliminate one variable.
3. Solve for the remaining variable.
4. Substitute the value found into the original equation to find the other variable.
5. Calculate the value of $x - y$ using the values of $x$ and $y$.
6. Double-check your calculations and the final answer.
## Assistant 2:
Reflection: I made a calculation error when performing step 4. I found the value of $y$ correctly, but when substituting it back into one of the original equations, I incorrectly calculated $x$. I need to pay closer attention to my arithmetic to avoid similar mistakes in the future.

Thought: 
Multiplying the first equation by 3 and the second equation by 2, we get:
$\begin{aligned} 6x-9y &= -42 \\ 6x-4y &= -12 \end{aligned}$

Adding the two equations eliminates $y$:
$10x = -54 \implies x = -\frac{27}{5}$

Substituting $x$ back into one of the original equations to solve for $y$:
$2 \left(-\frac{27}{5}\right) - 3y = -14 \implies y = -\frac{2}{5}$

Now, we can calculate the value of $x - y$:
$\left(-\frac{27}{5}\right) - \left(-\frac{2}{5}\right) = -8$
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
