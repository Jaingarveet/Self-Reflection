Context: The corrido, a type of narrative folk song, comes from a region half in Mexico and half in the United States known as the Lower Rio Grande Border. Corridos, which flourished from about 1836 to the late 1930s, are part of a long-standing ballad tradition that has roots in eighteenth-century Spain. Sung in Spanish, corridos combine formal features of several different types of folk songs, but their narratives consistently deal with subject matter specific to the Border region. For example, "El Corrido de Kiansis" (c. 1870), the oldest corrido surviving in complete form, records the first cattle drives to Kansas in the late 1860s. A single important event is likely to have inspired several corrido variants, yet the different versions of any given story all partake of standard generic elements. When sung at social gatherings, corridos served to commemorate significant local happenings, but more importantly, their heavy reliance on familiar linguistic and thematic conventions served to affirm the cohesiveness of Border communities. Corridos take their name from the Spanish verb correr, meaning to run or to flow, for corridos tell their stories simply and swiftly, without embellishments. Figures of speech such as metaphors are generally rare in corridos, and when metaphors are used, they usually incorporate everyday images that are familiar to the songs' listeners. In the popular "El Corrido de Gregorio Cortez," for example, the hero Cortez, fighting off pursuers, uses the metaphor of a thunderstorm to boast that he has had harder fights than the one they gave him: "I have weathered thunderstorms; / This little mist doesn't bother me." Similar storm imagery is found in other corridos including "Kiansis," which tells of stampedes caused by thunderstorms during the Kansas cattle drives. Such imagery, highly conventional and readily recognizable to corrido listeners, reflects and strengthens the continuity of the corrido tradition. The corrido is composed not only of familiar images but also of certain ready-made lines that travel easily from one ballad to another. This is most evident in the corrido's formal closing verse, or despedida. The despedida of one variant of "Gregorio Cortez" is translated as follows: "Now with this I say farewell / In the shade of a cypress tree; / This is the end of the ballad / Of Don Gregorio Cortez." The first and third lines are a set convention. The second and fourth lines are variable, the fourth carrying the name of the corrido or expressing its subject, and the second varying according to exigencies of rhyme. In the despedida, perhaps the clearest marker of both the corrido's uniqueness and its generic continuity, the corrido's maker asserts that the task of relating an authentic Border tale has been accomplished.
Question: Given its tone and content, from which one of the following was the passage most likely drawn?
Choices:
  A: a brochure for contemporary tourists to the Lower Rio Grande Border
  B: a study focusing on the ballad's influence on the music of eighteenth-century Spain
  C: an editorial in a contemporary newspaper from the Lower Rio Grande Border
  D: Lower Rio Grande Border
  E: a book describing various North American folk song forms
## Assistant 2:
To determine which source the passage was most likely drawn from, let's consider the tone and content:
Tone: The passage has an informative and analytical tone. It provides historical context and analyzes the structure, themes, and conventions of corridos.
Content: The passage discusses the origins, time period, geographical region, subject matter, linguistic features, and cultural significance of corridos. It provides specific examples and explains how certain elements contribute to the cohesiveness of the corrido tradition.
Now, let's evaluate each choice:
A) A tourist brochure would likely focus more on the contemporary experience and attractions of the region, rather than providing an in-depth analysis of a historical musical form. The tone and content do not match.
B) The passage mentions that corridos have roots in 18th-century Spain but does not focus on the ballad's influence on Spanish music. The main focus is on the corrido tradition in the Lower Rio Grande Border region.
C) An editorial in a contemporary newspaper would likely focus on current events or issues, rather than providing a detailed, historical analysis of a musical form.
D) "Lower Rio Grande Border" is a geographical region, not a type of publication.
E) A book describing various North American folk song forms aligns with the passage's informative and analytical tone, as well as its content focusing on the history, structure, and cultural significance of a specific folk song form (corridos) from a particular region (Lower Rio Grande Border).
