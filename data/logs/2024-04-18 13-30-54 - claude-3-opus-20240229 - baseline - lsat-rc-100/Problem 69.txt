Context: Many educators in Canada and the United States advocate multicultural education as a means of achieving multicultural understanding. There are, however, a variety of proposals as to what multicultural education should consist of. The most modest of these proposals holds that schools and colleges should promote multicultural understanding by teaching about other cultures, teaching which proceeds from within the context of the majority culture. Students should learn about other cultures, proponents claim, but examination of these cultures should operate with the methods, perspectives, and values of the majority culture. These values are typically those of liberalism: democracy, tolerance, and equality of persons. Critics of this first proposal have argued that genuine understanding of other cultures is impossible if the study of other cultures is refracted through the distorting lens of the majority culture's perspective. Not all cultures share liberal values. Their value systems have arisen in often radically different social and historical circumstances, and thus, these critics argue, cannot be understood and adequately appreciated if one insists on approaching them solely from within the majority culture's perspective. In response to this objection, a second version of multicultural education has developed that differs from the first in holding that multicultural education ought to adopt a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures. The values of one culture should not be standards by which others are judged; each culture should be taken on its own terms. However, the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in this second version of multicultural education are still identifiably Western. They are the methods of anthropology, social psychology, political science, and sociology. They are, that is, methods which derive from the Western scientific perspective and heritage. Critics of this second form of multicultural education argue as follows: The Western scientific heritage is founded upon an epistemological system that prizes the objective over the subjective, the logical over the intuitive, and the empirically verifiable over the mystical. The methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are thus already value laden; the choice to examine and understand other cultures by these methods involves a commitment to certain values such as objectivity. Thus, the second version of multicultural education is not essentially different from the first. Scientific discourse has a privileged place in Western cultures, but the discourses of myth, tradition, religion, and mystical insight are often the dominant forms of thought and language of non-Western cultures. To insist on trying to understand nonscientific cultures by the methods of Western science is not only distorting, but is also an expression of an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism: the chauvinism of science. According to this objection, it is only by adopting the (often nonscientific) perspectives and methods of the cultures studied that real understanding can be achieved.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately states the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Proponents of two proposals for promoting multicultural understanding disagree about both the goal of multicultural education and the means for achieving this goal.
  B: Proponents of two proposals for promoting multicultural understanding claim that education should be founded upon an epistemological system that recognizes the importance of the subjective, the intuitive, and the mystical.
  C: Proponents of two proposals for promoting multicultural understanding claim that it is not enough to refrain from judging non-Western cultures if the methods used to study these cultures are themselves Western.
  D: Critics of two proposals for promoting multicultural understanding disagree about the extent to which a culture's values are a product of its social and historical circumstances.
  E: Critics of two proposals for promoting multicultural understanding claim these proposals are not value neutral and are therefore unable to yield a genuine understanding of cultures with a different value system.
## Assistant 2:
To determine the main point, let's break down the key ideas in the passage:
1. The first proposal for multicultural education advocates teaching about other cultures from the perspective of the majority liberal culture. Critics argue this distorts the understanding of cultures with different values.
2. The second proposal adopts a neutral stance regarding cultural value differences but still uses Western scientific methods to study cultures. Critics argue these methods are value-laden and express Eurocentric cultural chauvinism. 
3. Critics argue that real understanding of non-scientific cultures can only be achieved by adopting their own, often non-scientific, perspectives and methods.
Looking at the answer choices:
A) This is incorrect as both proposals share the same goal of promoting multicultural understanding, just through different means.
B) Incorrect. Neither proposal claims education should be founded on subjective, intuitive, or mystical epistemology. 
C) Incorrect. The critics, not the proponents, argue it's not enough to refrain from judging if Western methods are used.
D) The critics' views on how values relate to circumstances are not the main focus.
E) Correct. The main point is that critics argue both proposals fail to be value-neutral due to their reliance on the majority culture's liberal values (1st proposal) or Western scientific methods (2nd proposal), preventing genuine understanding of other cultures.
