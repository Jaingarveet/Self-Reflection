Context: Advances in scientific understanding often do not build directly or smoothly in response to the data that are amassed, and in retrospect, after a major revision of theory, it may seem strange that a crucial bypothesis was long overlooked. A case in point is the discovery of a means by which the nuclei of atoms can be split Between 1934, when a group ofitalian physicists including Enrico Fermi first bombarded uranium with neutrons, and 1939, when exiled Austrian physicist Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection, scientists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, without, however, recognizing what they were witnessing.Earlier, even before the neutron and proton composition of atomic nuclei had been experimentally demonstrated, sometheoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart. But the neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving such a result, and researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that it might happen in that context. A common view was that a neutron's breaking apart a uranium nucleus would be analogous to a pebble, thrown through a window, causing a house to collapse.In Berlin, Meitner pursued research related to that of the Italians, discovering a puzzling group of radioactive substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium. Fermi and others achieved numerous similar results. These products remained unidentified partly because precise chemical analyses were hampered by the minute quantities of the substances produced and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials, but more significantly because of the expectation that they would all be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition. In 1938 Meitner escaped from Nazi Germany and undertook related research in Sweden, but her research partner Otto Hahn kept her informed of his continuing experimentation. Late in that year he wrote to her of a surprising result: one of the substances resulting from the neutron bombardment of uranium had been conclusively identified as barium, an element whose structure would have made it impossible to produce through any mechanism he envisaged as being involved in the experiments. Hahn even remarked that, despite the clear chemical evidence of what had occmred, it went "against all previous experiences of nuclear physics," but be also noted that together the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium, the accompanying product of the experiment, added up to the number of such particles that compose a uranium nucleus.It was Meitner who finally recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations: the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms. Coining the term "nuclear fission," she quickly submitted her conclusion for publication in a paper coauthored with pbysicist Otto Frisch. When scientists in Europe and North America rushed to corroborate the findings, it became clear that the relevant evidence had been present for some rime, lacking mainly the right conceptual link.
Question: The author's primary aim in the passage is to
Choices:
  A: criticize a traditional view of scientific progress and advocate a replacement
  B: illustrate the often erratic way in which a scientific community achieves progress
  C: judge the relative importance of theory and experimentation in science
  D: take issue with the idea that scientists make slow,steady progress
  E: display the way in which intellectual arrogance sometimes hinders scientific progress
## Assistant 2:
To determine the author's primary aim, let's analyze the key points in the passage:
1. The author states that scientific understanding doesn't always progress smoothly or directly in response to data, and crucial hypotheses may be overlooked until a major revision of theory occurs.
2. The author uses the discovery of nuclear fission as an example, where evidence was compiled without recognizing what was being witnessed until Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection.
3. The author notes that scientists were not receptive to the possibility of breaking atoms apart in the context of the neutron-bombardment experiments, despite some theoretical calculations indicating it should be possible.
4. The author emphasizes that the relevant evidence for nuclear fission had been present for some time, but lacked the right conceptual link until Meitner recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations.
Considering these points, the author's primary aim seems to be illustrating the often erratic way in which a scientific community achieves progress. The passage focuses on how the discovery of nuclear fission did not occur in a straightforward manner, with crucial evidence being overlooked until a major theoretical breakthrough was made.
