Topic: Law
Context: Counselor: Many people assume that personal conflicts are inevitable, but that assumption is just not so. Personal conflicts arise primarily because people are being irrational. For instance, people often find it easier to ascribe bad qualities to a person than good ones-even when there is more evidence of the latter. If someone suspects that a friend is unreliable, for example, a single instance may turn this suspicion into a feeling of certainty, whereas a belief that someone is reliable is normally built up only after many years of personal interaction.

  D: Personal conflicts are not inevitable.
  E: Unlike a suspicion that a friend is unreliable, a belief that someone is reliable is normally built up only after many years of personal interaction.

The counselor argues that personal conflicts arise from irrationality, specifically the tendency to ascribe bad qualities more easily than good ones. This aligns with option B. While the passage mentions other points like the assumption of inevitability and the slow build-up of trust, the core argument focuses on the biased attribution of qualities. 
Action: Answer("B")
