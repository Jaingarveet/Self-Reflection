## User 2:
Topic: Law
Context: In some jurisdictions, lawmakers have instituted sentencing guidelines that mandate a penalty for theft that is identical to the one they have mandated for bribery. Hence, lawmakers in those jurisdictions evidently consider the harm resulting from theft to be equal to the harm resulting from bribery.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would most strengthen the argument?
Choices:
  A: In general, lawmakers mandate penalties for crimes that are proportional to the harm they believe to result from those crimes.
  B: In most cases, lawmakers assess the level of harm resulting from an act in determining whether to make that act illegal.
  C: Often, in response to the unusually great harm resulting from a particular instance of a crime, lawmakers will mandate an increased penalty for that crime.
  D: In most cases, a victim of theft is harmed no more than a victim of bribery is harmed.
  E: If lawmakers mandate penalties for crimes that are proportional to the harm resulting from those crimes, crime in those lawmakers' jurisdictions will be effectively deterred.

Explanation:
## Assistant 2:
## Reflection on Previous Attempt:
In my previous attempt, I likely focused on the general principles of lawmaking and harm assessment, leading to an incorrect choice.  The key to strengthening the argument is to find an option that directly supports the equivalence of harm between theft and bribery as perceived by lawmakers.
## Analysis:
*   **A:** This is a general principle of lawmaking but doesn't specifically address the equivalence of harm between theft and bribery.
*   **B:** Similar to A, it discusses the general process of criminalizing acts but doesn't directly support the argument.
*   **C:** This option talks about increasing penalties for unusually harmful instances, which is not relevant to the comparison between theft and bribery.
*   **D:** This option directly supports the argument by stating that victims of theft and bribery experience similar levels of harm, aligning with the lawmakers' perspective. 
*   **E:** This option discusses the effectiveness of proportional penalties in deterring crime, which is not relevant to the comparison of harm between theft and bribery.
## Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the choice that most strengthens the argument is the one that directly supports the equivalence of harm between theft and bribery as perceived by lawmakers.
**Action: Answer("D")**
