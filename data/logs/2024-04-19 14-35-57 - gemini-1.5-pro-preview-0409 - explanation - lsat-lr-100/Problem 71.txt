Context: Curator: Our museum displays only twentieth-century works, which are either on loan from private collectors or in the museum's permanent collection. Prints of all of the latter works are available in the museum store.

Choices:
  A: Every print in the museum store is of a work that is either on loan to the museum from a private collector or part of the museum's permanent collection.

  C: There are prints in the museum store of every work that is displayed in the museum and not on loan from a private collector.

## Assistant 2:
## Reflection on Previous Attempt:
**Error Analysis:**
In my previous attempt, I likely focused too much on the details about the museum's collection and print availability, overlooking the key phrase "must be true." This led me to choose an answer that was possibly true based on the information, but not necessarily guaranteed to be true.
**Understanding the Correct Answer:**
The correct answer should be a statement that is **always true**, regardless of any specific details about the museum's collection or the prints available. It should be a logical conclusion that directly follows from the curator's statements.
**Applying the Learning:**
For this attempt, I will focus on identifying the statement that is a direct and unavoidable consequence of the curator's statements, ensuring it holds true in all possible scenarios. 
## Answering the Question:
Analyzing each option:
*   **A:** This may not be true as the store sells prints of works not in the museum's collection (e.g., Nighthawks).
*   **B:** This must be true. The curator states the museum only displays 20th-century works, and the store only sells prints of displayed works.
*   **C:** This may not be true as the store may not have prints of every single work in the permanent collection.
*   **D:** This may not be true as Nighthawks is specifically stated as not being part of the permanent collection.
*   **E:** This may not be true as Nighthawks could be on display even if it's not part of the permanent collection.
Therefore, the only statement that must be true is that all prints sold are copies of 20th-century works. 
**Action: Answer("B")** 
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
