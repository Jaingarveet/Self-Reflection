## System:
You are an expert in Logic.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")

Context: In a study, 51 middle school student volunteers were divided into a test group and a control group to receive the same mathematics training.During the five-day training, the researchers used a technique called transcranial random noise stimulation to lightly shock the areas of the brains of 25 test group members that were considered to be related to computing power.The subsequent test results showed that the mathematics ability of the test group members was significantly higher than that of the control group members.To their surprise, the effect of this ability improvement can last at least half a year.The researchers therefore believe that micro-shocks in the brain can improve the brain's computing power.
Question: Which of the following, if true, best supports the above researchers â€™views?
Choices:
  A: This non-invasive stimulus is inexpensive and will not cause any pain to the human body
  B: After a slight electric shock to the brain, the blood flow between the neurons in the brain is significantly enhanced, but it returns to normal after multiple stimulations
  C: Before the experiment, the mathematics scores of the two groups of students were almost the same
  D: Subjects with microshocks in the brain are more concerned about their behavior, and their concentration is more focused during the test

## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The researchers believe that micro-shocks in the brain can improve the brain's computing power.
We need to find the option that supports this view.
Option A talks about the non-invasive nature of the stimulus, but it does not support the researchers' view.
Option B talks about the effect of electric shock on blood flow, but it does not support the researchers' view.
Option D talks about the behavior and concentration of subjects, but it does not support the researchers' view.
Option C talks about the similarity of the two groups before the experiment, which supports the researchers' view that the improvement in the test group was due to the micro-shocks.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
