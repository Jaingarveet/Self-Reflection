## Assistant 2:
Thought:
If Ding is not in the fourth, then at least one person of Bingding must be selected. Therefore, Bing must be in the fourth. If E is selected, then A and B are also selected. Therefore, if A is not in the fourth, then E cannot be selected. If B is not in the fourth, then E cannot be selected. Therefore, either A or B must be in the fourth. A maximum of 2 people are selected. Therefore, C cannot be in the fourth because there are already two people in the fourth. 
Action: Answer("C")
