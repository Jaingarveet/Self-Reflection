Explanation:
## Assistant 2:
**Self-Reflection:**
* **Mistake:** I initially chose answer A ("K is shown in the evening") because I mistakenly assumed that the rule "J must be shown in the evening" implied that only one house could be shown in the evening.
* **Reasoning:** I realized that my assumption was incorrect and that multiple houses could be shown in the evening.
* **Correction:** I reviewed the rules carefully and considered all possible combinations of house showings. I concluded that the only rule that must be true is that L is shown in the evening.
**Answer:**
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
