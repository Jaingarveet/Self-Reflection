## Assistant 2:
## Self-Reflection
**Previous Incorrect Answer:** C
**Reasoning:** I incorrectly assumed that since exactly three students review Undulation, Jiang must be one of them. However, this assumption was not supported by the given information.
**Correct Answer:** B
**Reasoning:**
* We know that exactly three students review Undulation.
* We also know that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
* Since Kramer and Lopez each review fewer plays than Megregian, and neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews, it follows that Megregian must review Undulation.
* Therefore, the remaining two students who review Undulation must be either Jiang and Lopez, or Jiang and O'Neill.
* However, we know that exactly two students review the same play(s) as each other. This means that Jiang cannot review Undulation, as this would violate the condition.
* Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that O'Neill does not review Undulation.
**Action:** Answer("B")
