## Assistant 2:
Self-reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly because I did not consider all of the conditions in the problem. Specifically, I did not consider the condition that if Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
I have now reflected on the problem and my solution, and I am confident that I can answer the question correctly.
Thought:
Kyle gives the afternoon report on Tuesday.
Helen gives the afternoon report on Wednesday.
Nina gives a report on Monday.
Therefore, Helen and Irving must both give reports on Tuesday.
The only possible list of students who give the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, is Irving, Lenore, and Nina.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: D
