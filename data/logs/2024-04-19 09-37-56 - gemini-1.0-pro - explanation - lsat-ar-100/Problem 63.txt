Explanation:
## Assistant 2:
Explanation:
If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, then Julio cannot lead any other session.
Since Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day, and Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's, Kevin and Rebecca cannot lead the Thursday afternoon session.
Since Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day, and Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's, Lan cannot lead the Thursday afternoon session.
Since Nessa must lead an afternoon session, and Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's, Nessa cannot lead the Thursday afternoon session.
Therefore, if Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, then for four of the other lab assistants one can determine which sessions they lead.
