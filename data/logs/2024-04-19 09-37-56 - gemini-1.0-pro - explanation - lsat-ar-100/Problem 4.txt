Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that if Lan does not lead a Wednesday session, then she must lead a Thursday or Friday session. However, Lan could also lead a Wednesday session. 
The gap in my knowledge was not in understanding the constraints but in considering all possible scenarios.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Lan cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day as Olivia.
If Lan does not lead a Wednesday session, then she could lead a Thursday or Friday session.
However, Lan could also lead a Wednesday session.
Therefore, we cannot determine which lab assistant must lead a Thursday session based on the given information.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
