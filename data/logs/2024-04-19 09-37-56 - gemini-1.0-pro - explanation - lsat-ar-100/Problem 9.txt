Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.

## Self-Reflection
**Previous Incorrect Answer:**
My previous answer was incorrect because I did not consider all the rules and constraints. Specifically, I did not consider the rule that Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
**Corrected Approach:**
To answer this question correctly, I need to consider all the rules and constraints and then systematically eliminate the answer choices that violate any of them.
**Step-by-Step Analysis:**
1. **Young is assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.** This means that Souza cannot be assigned parking spaces #5 or #6.
2. **Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.** This means that Young cannot be assigned parking spaces #1, #2, or #3.
3. **Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.** This means that Robertson cannot be assigned parking space #5 or #6.
**Eliminating Answer Choices:**
* **A: Togowa is assigned parking space #1.** This violates the rule that Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
* **B: Young is assigned parking space #2.** This violates the rule that Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
* **C: Robertson is assigned parking space #3.** This violates the rule that Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
* **D: Souza is assigned parking space #3.** This violates the rule that Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
* **E: Vaughn is assigned parking space #4.** This does not violate any of the rules.
**Therefore, the only possible scenario is that Vaughn is assigned parking space #4.**
**Action: Answer("E")**
## Result:
Agent Answer: E
Correct Answer: A
