## Assistant 2:
Self-reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly because I did not carefully consider the conditions regarding the number of sales representatives in each zone. I incorrectly assumed that there were more sales representatives in Zone 2 than in Zone 3, which led me to choose an incorrect answer.
To avoid making the same mistake again, I will pay close attention to the conditions regarding the number of sales representatives in each zone and ensure that my answer is consistent with those conditions.
