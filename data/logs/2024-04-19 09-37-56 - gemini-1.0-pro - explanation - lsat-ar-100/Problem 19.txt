## User 2:
Topic: Law
Context: Of the eight students—George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert—in a seminar, exactly six will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
Question: If Helen, Kyle, and Lenore, not necessarily in that order, give the three morning reports, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Helen gives a report on Monday.
  B: Irving gives a report on Monday.
  C: Irving gives a report on Wednesday.
  D: Kyle gives a report on Tuesday.
  E: Kyle gives a report on Wednesday.

Explanation:
I incorrectly stated the answer in the format of a thought process instead of the required format. 
The gap in my knowledge was not in law but in following instructions. 
I knew the correct answer but failed to format it correctly.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Since Helen, Kyle, and Lenore give the three morning reports, they cannot give afternoon reports.
Since Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports, they must give morning reports.
Since George can only give a report on Tuesday, he must give the afternoon report on Tuesday.
Since Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
Since Nina cannot give a report on Wednesday (because Olivia and Robert give the morning reports), Nina must give a report on Monday.
Since Helen and Irving must both give reports on Tuesday, they cannot give reports on Monday.
Therefore, Kyle must give a report on Monday.
Action: Answer("D")
