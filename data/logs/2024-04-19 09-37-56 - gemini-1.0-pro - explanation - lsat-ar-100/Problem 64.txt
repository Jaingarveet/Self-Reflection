Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that all possible scenarios were equally likely. However, the prompt states that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. This information was crucial for determining the most likely scenario.
## Assistant 2:
## Analyzing the conditions:
1. **Parra and Tiao:** Only one of them can be in Zone 1.
2. **Tiao and Udall:** Only one of them can be in Zone 2.
3. **Parra and Quinn:** They are in the same zone.
4. **Stuckey and Udall:** They are in the same zone.
5. **Zone 3:** More representatives than Zone 2.
## Analyzing the options:
**A: Kim works in Zone 2:** This is possible. Kim could be in Zone 2 with either Parra or Tiao in Zone 1.
**B: Mahr works in Zone 1:** This is possible. Mahr could be in Zone 1 with Parra and Quinn in Zone 3.
**C: Parra works in Zone 3:** This is possible. Parra could be in Zone 3 with Quinn and either Mahr or Stuckey in Zone 1.
**D: Stuckey works in Zone 2:** This is possible. Stuckey could be in Zone 2 with Udall and either Parra or Tiao in Zone 1.
**E: Tiao works in Zone 1:** This is possible. Tiao could be in Zone 1 with Mahr and Stuckey in Zone 3.
## Conclusion:
All options are possible given the conditions and the information that there are more representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
