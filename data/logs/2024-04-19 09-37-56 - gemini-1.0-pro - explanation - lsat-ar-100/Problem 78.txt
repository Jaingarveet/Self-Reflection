## User 2:
Topic: Law
Context: Of the eight students—George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert—in a seminar, exactly six will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
Question: If George, Nina, and Robert give reports and they do so on different days from one another, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Helen gives a report on Wednesday.
  B: Nina gives a report on Monday.
  C: Nina gives a report on Tuesday.
  D: Olivia gives a report on Monday.
  E: Robert gives a report on Wednesday.

Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that Nina's report could not be on Tuesday. 
I overlooked the possibility that Nina could give a report on Tuesday, followed by Helen and Irving on Wednesday, even though George also gave a report on Tuesday.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
George, Nina, and Robert give reports on different days.
Nina's report cannot be on Wednesday because then Helen and Irving would have to give reports on Thursday, which is not possible.
Therefore, Nina's report must be on Monday or Tuesday.
If Nina's report is on Monday, then George's report cannot be on Tuesday because then Helen and Irving would have to give reports on Wednesday, which is not possible.
Therefore, George's report must be on Wednesday.
If Nina's report is on Tuesday, then George's report cannot be on Monday because then Helen and Irving would have to give reports on Tuesday, which is not possible.
Therefore, George's report must be on Wednesday.
In either case, George's report is on Wednesday.
Action: Answer("A")
