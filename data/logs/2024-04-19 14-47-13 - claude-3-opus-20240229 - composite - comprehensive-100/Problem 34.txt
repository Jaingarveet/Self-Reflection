## User 2:
Topic: Law
Context: The chairperson of Acme Corporation has decided to move the company from its current location in Milltown to Ocean View. Most Acme employees cannot afford housing within a 30-minute commute of Ocean View. So once the company has moved, most Acme employees will have a commute of more than 30 minutes.
Question: The argument requires assuming which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: All Acme employees can afford housing within a 30-minute commute of Milltown.
  B: The chairperson of Acme has good financial reasons for wanting to move the company to Ocean View.
  C: None of Acme's employees except the chairperson are in favor of moving the company to Ocean View.
  D: Currently, most Acme employees have a commute of less than 30 minutes.
  E: Acme's move to Ocean View will not be accompanied by a significant pay raise for Acme employees.
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I focused too narrowly on the commute times mentioned in the argument and failed to consider the underlying reason why the commute times would increase for most employees after the move. The argument implicitly assumes that there will not be a significant pay raise to offset the increased housing costs near Ocean View.
Error Keywords:
 - Overlooking implicit assumptions
 - Focusing on irrelevant details
 - Ignoring financial considerations
 - Incomplete analysis of the argument
Solution:
The argument states that most Acme employees cannot afford housing within a 30-minute commute of Ocean View, which is why their commute times will increase after the company moves there. For this to be true, the argument must assume that the employees' pay will not increase enough to make housing near Ocean View affordable. If Acme provided a significant pay raise along with the move, employees might be able to afford closer housing, and the conclusion about increased commute times would not necessarily follow.
[REDACTED], [REDACTED], [REDACTED], [REDACTED]: While these statements might be true, they are not required for the argument's conclusion to hold.
[REDACTED]: This is the necessary assumption. Without assuming that there will be no significant pay raise, it's possible that employees could afford housing near Ocean View, invalidating the argument's conclusion.
Instructions:
1. Read the argument carefully and identify the conclusion.
2. Look for the gap between the evidence presented and the conclusion.
3. Consider what must be assumed to bridge that gap and make the conclusion follow logically.
4. Examine each answer choice to see if it fulfills the necessary assumption.
5. Select the choice that best represents the missing piece needed for the argument to hold.
Advice:
 - Don't just focus on the explicit details; consider implicit assumptions that the argument relies on.
 - Think about counterexamples that could weaken or invalidate the conclusion if the assumption is not true.
 - Pay attention to the scope of the argument and avoid bringing in irrelevant outside factors.
 - In assumption questions, the correct answer choice will be a statement that is not directly stated but is necessary for the argument's reasoning to be valid.
## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1. The conclusion of the argument is that once Acme moves to Ocean View, most employees will have a commute of more than 30 minutes.
2. The evidence presented is:
   - Most Acme employees cannot afford housing within a 30-minute commute of Ocean View.
   - There is a gap between this evidence and the conclusion. The argument assumes something to bridge this gap.
3. For the conclusion to logically follow, we must assume that employees will not be able to afford housing near Ocean View even after the move. This implies that there will not be a significant pay raise to offset the higher housing costs.
4. Looking at each answer choice:
   A, B, C, D: While possibly true, these are not necessary assumptions for the conclusion to hold. Even if false, the conclusion could still follow.
   E: This directly addresses the gap. If this assumption is false and there is a significant pay raise, employees might afford nearby housing, invalidating the conclusion.
5. Therefore, E is the required assumption - the argument assumes there will not be a significant pay raise accompanying the move.
Following the advice:
- The argument implicitly assumes no significant pay raise, which is key to the conclusion.
- A counterexample would be a large pay raise that allows employees to afford housing near Ocean View, contradicting the conclusion.
- The other choices bring in irrelevant factors not needed for the argument's core reasoning.
- E is not directly stated but is a required assumption to make the reasoning valid.
