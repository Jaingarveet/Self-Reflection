## Get Reflection:
Explanation: I misinterpreted the information in the passage and selected an answer that was not supported by the text. I overlooked the fact that the passage hints at a historical context, indicating that the city has rarely enforced water bill payments in the past. 

Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation
- Oversight
- Lack of attention to detail

Solution: The correct answer is inferred from the passage's discussion of the city's plans to target high-income neighborhoods and the mention of "a few residences with outstanding bills." This indicates a selective approach, suggesting that most residences with overdue bills have not been targeted in the past. 

Instructions: 
1. Read and understand the context provided in Passage B.
2. Identify the key information in the passage that relates to the question.
3. Analyze the relationships and implications of the information presented.
4. Determine which option is directly supported by the passage's content and structure.
5. Avoid making assumptions or interpreting the information beyond what is explicitly stated.

Step-by-step solution: 
1. The passage discusses the city's plan to address overdue water bills.
2. The key information is that officials plan to "selectively" target a few residences, particularly in high-income neighborhoods, to make examples of residents with outstanding bills.
3. The selective nature of the plan implies that most residences with overdue bills have not been targeted previously.
4. Choice D directly reflects this inference: "In recent years, the city has rarely, if ever, turned off the water of customers who were late paying their water bills."
5. The other choices are either unsupported or inaccurate based on the information provided.

Advice: 
 - Read and understand the context thoroughly.
 - Identify and analyze key information and relationships.
 - Avoid making assumptions or interpreting beyond the provided information.
 - Ensure that your interpretation directly reflects the content and structure of the passage.
 - Stay focused on the specific details that support the correct answer.
