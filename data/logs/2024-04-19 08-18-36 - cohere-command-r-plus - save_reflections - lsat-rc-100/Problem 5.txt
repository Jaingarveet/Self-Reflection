Explanation: I misinterpreted the structure of the passage and the comparison made between the three positions. I focused on the detailed elaboration of the third position, Dostoyevsky's view, and its distinction from the first two positions. However, the correct answer choice (C) highlights that the third position is specifically differentiated from the second position, not just presented as a unique perspective. 

Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation
- Comparison error
- Structural analysis

Solution: The passage introduces three distinct positions in Russian literary criticism during Dostoyevsky's era:
1. Art is separate from everyday life.
2. Art should be grounded in concrete reality and serve a political view.
3. Dostoyevsky's view: Reality is shaped by individual experience, blending fantasy and the tangible. Art should prioritize artistic merit over utility.

The structure of the passage presents each position and then focuses on differentiating Dostoyevsky's perspective (the third position) from the second position, which is the radical view. It emphasizes how Dostoyevsky's understanding of reality and art differs from the radical critics' insistence on the tangible and their belief in art's utility.

Instructions:
1. Identify the topic of the passage: Russian literary criticism during Dostoyevsky's time.
2. Recognize the structure: The passage presents three distinct positions.
3. Analyze the comparison: Focus on how the third position differs from the other two, especially the second position.
4. Evaluate the level of detail: Note that the third position is differentiated from the second in detail.
