Explanation: I misinterpreted the criticism of the second version of multicultural education and, as a result, selected the incorrect answer choice. The criticism is not solely about the use of Western scientific methods but about the potential distortion and cultural chauvinism inherent in imposing those methods on the understanding of non-Western cultures. 

Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation
- Incomplete understanding
- Overemphasis on one aspect of the criticism

Solution: The criticism of the second version of multicultural education is that using Western scientific methods to understand non-Western cultures can be distortive and culturally chauvinistic. It argues that the methods of social sciences, such as anthropology and sociology, are inherently value-laden and reflect Western biases. 

The strongest objection to this criticism would be an argument that directly addresses and refutes the idea that Western scientific methods are inherently distortive or chauvinistic. 

Choice A: It is important to note that this statement is incorrect. One can adopt the perspectives and methods of a culture without being a member of that culture. This is the basis of many academic disciplines, including anthropology and cultural studies. However, this does not directly refute the criticism that Western scientific methods may distort the understanding of non-Western cultures.

Choice B: While it is true that many non-Western societies share similar value systems, this does not address the criticism that Western scientific methods can impose a distorted perspective on non-Western cultures.

Choice C: This choice does not provide a strong objection to the criticism. The fact that some non-Western societies use Western scientific methods does not address the concern about cultural distortion or chauvinism.

Choice D: This choice is irrelevant to the criticism, as it focuses on Western societies' understanding of their own achievements rather than the understanding of non-Western cultures.

Choice E: This choice is a general statement about the importance of cultural understanding and does not directly address the criticism regarding the potential distortion caused by Western scientific methods.

Instructions: 
1. Carefully read and understand the criticism presented in the passage. 
2. Identify the key issue: the potential distortion and cultural chauvinism inherent in using Western scientific methods to understand non-Western cultures. 
3. Analyze each answer choice to determine if it directly refutes or addresses this key issue. 
4. Select the answer choice that provides the strongest objection to the criticism by demonstrating the benefits or validity of using Western scientific methods in this context. 

Advice: 
 - Ensure you have a comprehensive understanding of the criticism presented in the passage. 
 - Identify the specific concerns and arguments made by the critics. 
 - Recognize any logical fallacies or misconceptions in the answer choices that may lead you astray. 
 - Look for answer choices that directly address and refute the key issues raised by the critics. 
 - Remember that the objection should provide a strong counterargument or evidence in favor of the approach taken by the second version of multicultural education.
