## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The given equation is a rational equation. To solve for 'a', we need to equate the numerators and the denominators on both sides of the equation. 
The numerator on the left side is 24x^2 + 25x - 47 and the numerator on the right side is -8x - 3. 
The denominator on the left side is ax - 2 and the denominator on the right side is ax - 2. 
Since the denominators are already equal, we can equate the numerators:
24x^2 + 25x - 47 = -8x - 3
Rearranging the equation gives:
24x^2 + 33x - 44 = 0
This is a quadratic equation, and we can solve for x using the quadratic formula:
x = [-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / 2a
Substituting the values from the equation gives:
x = [-33 ± sqrt((33)^2 - 4*24*(-44))] / 2*24
Solving this gives two possible values for x, but since x ≠ 2/a, we can ignore the value that would make x = 2/a.
Therefore, the value of 'a' is the one that does not make x = 2/a.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: B
