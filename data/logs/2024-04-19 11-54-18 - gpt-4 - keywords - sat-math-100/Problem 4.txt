# Model: gpt-4 | Agent: keywords | Exam: sat-math-100 | Problem 4 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")

## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The line passes through the origin, so the slope of the line is determined by the points (2, k) and (0, 0). The slope is (k-0)/(2-0) = k/2. 
The line also passes through the points (k, 32) and (0, 0), so the slope is also (32-0)/(k-0) = 32/k. 
Setting these two equal to each other gives k/2 = 32/k. Solving for k gives k^2 = 64, so k = 8 or k = -8. 
Since k is not negative in the choices, the answer is k = 8.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
