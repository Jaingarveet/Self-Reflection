## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Choices:
  A: -0.5
  B: -0.25
  C: 0.8
  D: 1.75

## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
To find the x-coordinate of the intersection point, we need to solve the system of equations. We can do this by using the method of substitution or elimination. Here, I will use the method of elimination.
First, I will multiply the first equation by 0.5 and the second equation by 1.5 to make the coefficients of y in both equations the same:
1.2x - 0.75y = 0.15
2.4x + 0.75y = -1.95
Adding these two equations together, we get:
3.6x = -1.8
Dividing both sides by 3.6, we get:
x = -1.8 / 3.6 = -0.5
Action: Answer("A")
