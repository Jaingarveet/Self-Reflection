## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The initial payment of $60 is subtracted from the total price of $300, leaving $240 to be paid in weekly installments of $30. Therefore, the equation to find the number of weekly payments, w, would be $240 = 30w. However, this equation is not among the choices. The closest equation to this is $300 = 30w + 60$, which is incorrect because it adds the initial payment to the total price instead of subtracting it. The correct equation should be $300 = 30w + 60$, which means the total price is equal to the weekly payments plus the initial payment. 
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: C
