For guidance, I will provide you with a single generic example problem and reflection (below).
## User 1:
Topic: Geography and Math
Question: What is the product of the number of letters contained in the name of the city where Iowa State University is located multiplied by the number of letters contained in the name of the state?
Choices:
    A: 16
    B: 20
    C: 24
    D: 32
Thought:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
ISU is located in the state of Iowa.
Action: Answer("D")
---
Correct Answer: A
## Assistant 1:
Explanation:
I miscalculated the product of the number of letters in the city and state names. 
The gap in my knowledge was not in geography but in basic arithmetic. 
I knew the correct city and state but made a calculation error.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Arithmetic error
 - Multiplication error
Solution:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
Iowa State University is located in the state of Iowa.
The city name "Ames" contains 4 letters.
The state name "Iowa" contains 4 letters.
The product of 4*4 is 16.
Instructions:
1. Identify the city where the university is located.
2. Identify the state where the university is located.
3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.
4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.
5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.
6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.
7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them.

Topic: Science
Question: To determine the boiling point of a liquid, a student must use all of these tools except
Choices:
  A: a stopwatch.
  B: a heat source.
  C: safety goggles.
  D: a thermometer.

Thought: The boiling point of a liquid can be determined using a heat source, a thermometer, and a stopwatch to note the time. Safety goggles are important for eye protection but are not essential for the determination of the boiling point.
Action: Answer("C")

 --- 
Correct Answer: A
## Assistant 2:
Response:
Explanation: I incorrectly assumed that safety goggles were not essential to the experiment. The correct answer is that a stopwatch is not necessary to determine the boiling point. 

Error Keywords:
- Assumption error
- Safety equipment error
- Experimental design error 

Solution: To determine the boiling point, one needs a heat source and a thermometer to observe the temperature change. Safety goggles are essential for eye protection during any experiment, especially those involving heat. A stopwatch is not necessary as the boiling point is a fixed temperature, and timing is not a factor. 

Instructions: 
1. Identify the tools required to determine the boiling point of a liquid. 
2. Recognize that safety goggles are essential for any experiment. 
3. Understand that a heat source and a thermometer are necessary to observe temperature changes. 
4. Realize that a stopwatch is not needed as the boiling point is a fixed temperature. 

Advice: 
 - Always consider safety first when designing experiments. 
 - Ensure you have a comprehensive understanding of the experimental procedure and requirements. 
 - Avoid making assumptions about the necessity of safety equipment. 
 - Remember that a stopwatch is used for timing, which is not required to determine a fixed temperature like the boiling point.
