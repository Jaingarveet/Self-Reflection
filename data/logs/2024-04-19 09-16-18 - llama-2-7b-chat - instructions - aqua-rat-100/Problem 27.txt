## Assistant 2:
  Thought: I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand that the correct answer is (C) M/(D-3).

Reflection: I analyzed my previous solution and realized that I made a mistake in my calculation. I misunderstood the problem and calculated the amount each person would have to contribute based on the total amount of money (D) instead of the remaining amount (D-3).

To solve the problem correctly, I need to divide the total amount of money by the remaining number of people (M-3). This will give me the amount each person will have to contribute, which is (M/(D-3)).

Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
