## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: X and Y are two alloys which were made by mixing zinc and copper in the ratio 6:9 and 7:11, respectively. If 40 grams of alloy X and 60 grams of alloy Y are melted and mixed to form alloy Z, what is the ratio of zinc and copper in the alloy Z ?
Choices:
  A: 69:91
  B: 59:91
  C: 59:90
  D: 59:91
  E: 69:101

## Assistant 2:
  Thought: 
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand that the ratio of zinc and copper in alloy Z is not 69:91.
I reflected on my previous solution and realized that I made a mistake in my calculation.
Action: I will re-solve the problem using the correct ratio of zinc and copper in alloys X and Y.

Reflection:
To find the ratio of zinc and copper in alloy Z, I will use the information given in the problem:

* 40 grams of alloy X and 60 grams of alloy Y are melted and mixed to form alloy Z.
* The ratio of zinc and copper in alloy X is 6:9, and the ratio of zinc and copper in alloy Y is 7:11.

I will use the concept of equivalent ratios to find the ratio of zinc and copper in alloy Z.

Equivalent ratios are ratios that have the same value, but different numbers.
For example, 6:9 and 7:11 are equivalent ratios because they both have the same value (6:9 = 7:11).

To find the ratio of zinc and copper in alloy Z, I will use the equivalent ratios of zinc and copper in alloys X and Y:

* 6:9 = 7:11 (equivalent ratios)
* 40/6 = 60/7 (multiplying the ratios by the number of grams of each metal)
* 40/9 = 60/11 (multiplying the ratios by the number of grams of each metal)

Therefore, the ratio of zinc and copper in alloy Z is:

Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: B
