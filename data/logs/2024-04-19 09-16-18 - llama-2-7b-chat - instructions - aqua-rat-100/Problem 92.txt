## Assistant 2:
  Thought: 
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand that the commission percentage is 10% and the sale price is $250.
Action: 
Commission earned per sale = $250 x 10% = $25
Desired salary = $1000
Number of sales required = $1000 / $25 = 40

Reflection: 
I made a mistake in my previous answer by not calculating the commission earned per sale correctly. I double-checked my calculations, and I am confident that the number of sales required to reach a salary of at least $1000 is 40.
Answer: C) 40 sales.
