  Topic: Math
Question: A cyclist travels at 12 miles per hour. How many minutes will it take to travel 48 miles?

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand that I made a mistake in my calculation. To solve this problem correctly, I will follow the steps below:

1. Identify the distance and speed given in the problem:
Distance = 48 miles
Speed = 12 miles/hour
2. Divide the distance by the speed to find the time:
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 48 miles / 12 miles/hour = 4 hours
3. Work step-by-step through my mathematical calculations:
48 miles / 12 miles/hour = 4 hours
4 hours x 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 240 minutes.

I apologize for my previous mistake and hope this answer is correct.
