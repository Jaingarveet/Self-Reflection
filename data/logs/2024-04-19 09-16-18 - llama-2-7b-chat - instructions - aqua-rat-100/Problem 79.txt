## Assistant 2:
  Thought: I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand the mistake. Let me re-evaluate the problem and find the correct solution.

Reflection: I see that the problem states that each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, and each son receives five times as much as each nephew. So, if each nephew receives Rs 8600 / 5 = Rs 1720, then each daughter will receive Rs 4 times 1720 = Rs 6880.

Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: E
