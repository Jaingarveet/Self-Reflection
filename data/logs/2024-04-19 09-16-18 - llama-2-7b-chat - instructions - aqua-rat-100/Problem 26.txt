Question: A wire in the shape of a rectangle of length 27 cm and breadth 17 cm is rebent to form a square. What will be the measure of each side?

Self-Reflection:

I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand where I went wrong. The problem requires me to calculate the perimeter of the original rectangle and then determine the length of each side of the square. I will follow the correct steps to arrive at the correct answer.

Step 1: Identify the problem and understand the given information.
The problem is to find the measure of each side of the square formed by rebending a wire in the shape of a rectangle. The length of the rectangle is 27 cm and the breadth is 17 cm.

Step 2: Determine the perimeter of the original rectangle.
The perimeter of a rectangle is found by adding the lengths of all its sides. In this case, the perimeter of the original rectangle is:
Perimeter = 2(length + breadth) = 2(27 + 17) = 64 cm

Step 3: Calculate the length of each side of the square.
Since the wire is being rebent to form a square, the length of each side of the square is half the length of the original rectangle. Therefore, the length of each side of the square is:
Length of each side = Perimeter / 4 = 64 cm / 4 = 16 cm

Step 4: Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
I have calculated the length of each side of the square to be 16 cm.

Therefore, the answer is (B) 11 cm.

I hope this self-reflection helps me arrive at the correct answer this time.
