## Assistant 2:
  Thought: I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand that the semi-circles drawn on the opposite sides of the square paper as diameters will result in a total area of 8.75 square centimeters. However, I made a mistake in my calculation.

Reflection: I realized that I misunderstood the problem and calculated the area of the remaining paper incorrectly. I should have taken into account the area of the semi-circles as well.

Action: To calculate the area of the remaining paper, I will use the formula for the area of a semi-circle, which is (θ/2)πr^2, where θ is the angle of the semi-circle and r is the radius. Since the semi-circles are drawn as diameters, the angle θ is 90 degrees, and the radius is half the side length of the square paper, which is 20 cm.

Area of semi-circle = (90/2)π(10 cm) = 7.85 cm^2

Area of remaining paper = area of square - area of semi-circle = 20 cm - 7.85 cm = 12.15 cm^2

Answer: The area of the remaining paper is 12.15 square centimeters.

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 8.71.
