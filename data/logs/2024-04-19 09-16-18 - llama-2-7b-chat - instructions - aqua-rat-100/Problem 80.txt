## Assistant 2:
  Thought: 
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand that I paid 1 rupee more for each white sharpeners than brown sharpeners. To find the number of white and brown sharpeners Jack bought, I need to use the information that he paid Rs. 100 for 18 sharpeners.
Action: Let's analyze the problem step by step:

1. Jack paid Rs. 100 for 18 sharpeners.
2. Since he paid 1 rupee more for each white sharpeners than brown sharpeners, the cost of each white sharpeners is Rs. 100 + 1 = Rs. 101.
3. The cost of each brown sharpeners is Rs. 100.
4. Since Jack bought 18 sharpeners, the number of white sharpeners he bought is:
18 x (101/100) = 9 white sharpeners
The number of brown sharpeners he bought is:
18 x (100/100) = 9 brown sharpeners

Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
