## Assistant 2:
  Thought: 
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand the mistake. Arjun and Sajal's money is the key to solving this problem. If Arjun gives $30 to Sajal, Sajal will have twice as much money left with Arjun, so Sajal will have $60 left ($30 + $30). If Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much money left with Sajal, so Arjun will have $90 left ($60 + $30).

Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: B
