## Assistant 2:
  Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, stating that the reduction percent was 30%. Upon further reflection, I realized that the correct answer is 40%. Here's my thought process:

1. Understand the concept of reducing a number: Reducing a number means finding a smaller number that is the result of dividing the original number by a given number.
2. Identify the original number and the reduced number: The original number is 120, and the reduced number is 96.
3. Divide the result of reducing the number by the original number to find the reduction percent: To find the reduction percent, I divided 96 (the reduced number) by 120 (the original number): 96 ÷ 120 = 0.8 (or 80%).
4. Work step-by-step through my mathematical calculations:

120 → 96 (by dividing by 2)

96 ÷ 120 = 0.8 (or 80%)

5. Double-check my calculations to ensure accuracy: I rechecked my calculations, and they are correct.

Therefore, the answer is (B) 40%.
