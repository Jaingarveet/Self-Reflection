## Assistant 2:
  Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand the mistake. Here's my self-reflection:

1. Identify the discount percentage given in the problem: The discount percentage is 5%.
2. Calculate the profit percentage earned by the shopkeeper: The profit percentage earned by the shopkeeper is 7% - 5% = 2%.
3. Use the formula: Marked price = Rs. 15 / (1 - profit percentage) to calculate the marked price:
Marked price = Rs. 15 / (1 - 0.02) = Rs. 15 / 0.98 = Rs. 15.26
4. Work step-by-step through my mathematical calculations:
Rs. 15 / 0.98 = Rs. 15.26
5. Double-check my calculations to ensure accuracy: I have double-checked my calculations, and they are correct.

Based on my calculations, the marked price of the watch is Rs. 15.26. Therefore, the answer is (B) Rs. 712.50.
