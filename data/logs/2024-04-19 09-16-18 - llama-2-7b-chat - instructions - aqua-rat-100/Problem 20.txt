## Assistant 2:
  Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, stating that the group had 277 members. Upon reflection, I realized that I made a mistake in my calculation. The correct answer is 288 members.

To solve the problem, I need to identify the number of boys and girls in the group. Let's assume that 64 boys and 40 girls joined the group.

Number of boys = 64
Number of girls = 40

Now, I need to use the ratio of boys to girls to find the total number of members in the group. The ratio is 4:3, which means that for every 4 boys, there are 3 girls.

Total number of members = Number of boys x Ratio of boys to girls
Total number of members = 64 x 4/3
Total number of members = 100

Finally, I need to double-check my calculations to ensure accuracy.

100 + 40 = 140

Therefore, the group has 140 members. The correct answer is (B) 288.
