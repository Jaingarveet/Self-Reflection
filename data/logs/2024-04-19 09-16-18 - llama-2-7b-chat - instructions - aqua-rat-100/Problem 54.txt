Reflection:

Information given in the problem:

* Silu's weight is 51 Kgs.
* Meenu's weight is 29 Kgs plus half of her weight.

Calculation:

Meenu's weight can be calculated as follows:

Meenu's weight = 29 Kgs + (half of Meenu's weight)
Meenu's weight = 29 Kgs + (half of 51 Kgs)
Meenu's weight = 29 Kgs + 25.5 Kgs
Meenu's weight = 54.5 Kgs

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 27.

Action: Answer("C")
