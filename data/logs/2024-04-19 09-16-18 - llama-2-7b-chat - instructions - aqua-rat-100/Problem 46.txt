## Assistant 2:
  Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand the mistake. Here's my reflection:

1. Total monthly income of the man: I calculated the total monthly income of the man as Rs. 4270 (B).
2. Monthly savings of the man: I calculated the monthly savings of the man as 12.5% of his income, which is Rs. 512.50 (C).
3. Formula to find the monthly income: The formula to find the monthly income is: Monthly Income = Total Income / (1 - Savings Percentage).

Using the formula, I calculated the monthly income as follows:

Monthly Income = Rs. 4270 / (1 - 0.125) = Rs. 4270 / 0.875 = Rs. 4900

So, the monthly income of the man is Rs. 4900 (D).

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) Rs. 4900.

I apologize for any confusion caused by my previous incorrect answer.
