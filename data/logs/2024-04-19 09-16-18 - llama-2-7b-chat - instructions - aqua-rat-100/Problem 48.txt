## Assistant 2:
  Thought: 
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand that 20% of members of the swim team are not members of the chess club.
Action: Let's use the information given to find the percentage of all Daifu students who are members of the swim team.

Swim team members who are not in the chess club = 20% of 24% = 4.8%
Total number of Daifu students = 100%

So, the percentage of all Daifu students who are members of the swim team is:
4.8% / 100% = 0.048 or 4.8%

Answer: (D) 4.8%
## Result:
Agent Answer: None
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
