## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

4. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
## Assistant 2:
  Thought: 
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand the mistake. To solve this problem correctly, I need to calculate the volume of the hollow cube and determine the number of smaller cubes that can fit inside it.
Action:
1. Volume of the hollow cube = 5cm x 5cm x 1cm = 25 cubic centimeters (cm続)
2. Number of smaller cubes that can fit inside the hollow cube = Volume of the hollow cube / Volume of a single smaller cube
= 25 cm続 / 1 cm続 = 25 smaller cubes
3. Number of faces of the smaller cubes that remain unpainted = Total number of faces of the smaller cubes - Number of faces of the smaller cubes that are inside the hollow cube
= 6 faces (per smaller cube) - 25 faces (of smaller cubes inside the hollow cube)
= 29 faces

Answer: C - 29 faces

Explanation:
The volume of the hollow cube is 25 cm続, and the number of smaller cubes that can fit inside it is 25. Therefore, the number of faces of the smaller cubes that remain unpainted is 29.
