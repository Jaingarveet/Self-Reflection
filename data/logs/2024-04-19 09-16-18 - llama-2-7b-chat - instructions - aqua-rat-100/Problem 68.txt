## Assistant 2:
  Thought: I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand that the greatest common factor of two positive integers is 11. The least common multiple of these two integers is 7700. I need to find the other integer.

Reflection: I reflected on my previous answer and realized that I made a mistake in calculating the least common multiple. I multiplied 350 and 7700, but I should have multiplied 350 and 35000 to get the correct answer.

Action: Answer("C")
