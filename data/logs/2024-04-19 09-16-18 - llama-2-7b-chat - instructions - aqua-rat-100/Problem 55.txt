Question: If a man rows at the rate of 4 kmph in still water and his rate against the current is 2 kmph, then the man's rate along the current is:
Choices:
  A: 15 kmph
  B: 6 kmph
  C: 12 kmph
  D: 14 kmph
  E: 6 kmph

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand where I went wrong. Here is my reflection:

I misunderstood the problem and calculated the rate of the man in still water instead of the rate against the current. I calculated the rate in still water to be 8 kmph (4 kmph + 2 kmph), but that is not the correct answer.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to find the rate of the man against the current. We know that the man's rate against the current is 2 kmph, so the rate of the man along the current is 2 kmph + 4 kmph = 6 kmph.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 6 kmph.

Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: E
