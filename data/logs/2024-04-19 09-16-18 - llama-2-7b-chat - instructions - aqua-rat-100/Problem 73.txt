## Assistant 2:
  Thought: I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I need to reassess the problem.

Let's analyze the given information:

* There are more than 501 students in the school.
* 20% of them took physics, which means 20% of 501 = 100 students took physics.
* 28% of them took math, which means 28% of 501 = 140 students took math.

Now, we need to find the least possible number of students in the school. We can do this by using the information that 20% of the students took physics and 28% of the students took math.

Let's assume the number of students in the school is x.

From the problem, we know that 20% of the students took physics, so the number of students who took physics is 0.2x.

We also know that 28% of the students took math, so the number of students who took math is 0.28x.

Now, we need to find the least possible value of x that satisfies both equations.

We can do this by subtracting the number of students who took physics from the number of students who took math:

0.2x - 0.20x = 0.28x - 0.20x = 0.08x = 40

So, the least possible number of students in the school is 501 - 40 = 461.
