Context: A certain class intends to select two of three girls from Fang Rufen, Guo Yanran, He Zhilian, and three from five boys, including Peng Youwen, Qiu Zhijie, Ren Xiangyang, Song Wenkai, and Tang Xiaohua, to form a five-person support group for university students to volunteer teaching in the mountains.Requirements? (1) Guo Yanran and Tang Xiaohua are not selected at the same time; (2) Peng Youwen and Song Kaiwen are not selected at the same time; (3) Qiu Zhijie and Tang Xiaohua are not selected at the same time.
Question: If He Zhilian is not selected, which of the following is not selected?
Choices:
  A: Tang Xiaohua
  B: Peng Youwen
  C: Qiu Zhijie
  D: Song Wenkai
## Assistant 2:
  Thought: Let's analyze the requirements given in the question:

(1) Guo Yanran and Tang Xiaohua are not selected at the same time, so we can assume that they are selected in different rounds.

(2) Peng Youwen and Song Kaiwen are not selected at the same time, so we can assume that they are selected in different rounds.

(3) Qiu Zhijie and Tang Xiaohua are not selected at the same time, so we can assume that they are selected in different rounds.

Now, let's consider the possible combinations of selections:

1. Guo Yanran and He Zhilian are selected in round 1 and 2, respectively.
2. Tang Xiaohua is selected in round 3.
3. Peng Youwen and Qiu Zhijie are selected in round 1 and 2, respectively.
4. Song Wenkai is selected in round 3.

Now, let's analyze the options:

A) Tang Xiaohua: Since Guo Yanran and He Zhilian are selected in round 1 and 2, respectively, Tang Xiaohua cannot be selected in round 1. Therefore, option A is not possible.

B) Peng Youwen: Since Peng Youwen and Qiu Zhijie are selected in round 1 and 2, respectively, Peng Youwen cannot be selected in round 3. Therefore, option B is not possible.

C) Qiu Zhijie: Since Qiu Zhijie and Tang Xiaohua are not selected at the same time, Qiu Zhijie cannot be selected in round 3. Therefore, option C is not possible.

D) Song Wenkai: Since Song Wenkai is selected in round 3, option D is possible.

Therefore, the answer is D: Song Wenkai.
