Context: When a team travels to Tibet, in addition to Lhasa, there are 6 cities or scenic spots to choose from? City E, City F, Lake G, Mountain H, Mountain I, Lake J Taking into account factors such as time, funding, plateau environment, and physical condition of the personnel, (1) at least one of Lake G and Lake J should be visited.(2) If you don't go to E city or F city, you can't go to G lake.(3) If you don't go to E city, you can't go to H mountain.(4) Only when I cross the I peak can I reach Lake J.
Question: If this team does not go to I Peak due to climate reasons, which of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: The group went to E city and J lake
  B: The group went to city E instead of city F
  C: The group went to visit G Lake and H Mountain
  D: The group went to F city and G lake tour
## Assistant 2:
  Thought: Let's analyze the given conditions and determine the possible scenarios based on the given information.

(1) At least one of Lake G and Lake J should be visited.
(2) If you don't go to E city or F city, you can't go to G lake.
(3) If you don't go to E city, you can't go to H mountain.
(4) Only when I cross the I peak can I reach Lake J.

From the above conditions, we can form a logical conclusion:

If the team does not go to I Peak due to climate reasons, then they must have visited either Lake G or Lake J.

Now, let's evaluate each of the given choices:

A: The group went to E city and J lake.
This is not a possible scenario as per condition (3). If the team doesn't go to E city, they cannot go to H mountain.

B: The group went to city E instead of city F.
This is not a possible scenario as per condition (2). If the team doesn't go to F city, they cannot go to G lake.

C: The group went to visit G Lake and H Mountain.
This is a possible scenario as per conditions (1) and (4). The team can visit both G Lake and H Mountain if they don't go to I Peak.

D: The group went to F city and G lake tour.
This is not a possible scenario as per condition (2). If the team doesn't go to F city, they cannot go to G lake.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) The group went to visit G Lake and H Mountain.
## Result:
