1. The two floors of the human resources department and the sales department are not adjacent.
2. The finance department is on the next floor of the planning department.

Floor 1: Sales Department
Floor 2: Human Resources Department

Floor 5: Administration Department
Floor 6: Research and Development Department

Now, let's match the distribution of the departments with the choices given in the question:

B: This option matches the layout we created earlier. The finance department is on the next floor of the planning department, and the human resources department is on a different floor than the sales department.

C: This option does not match the information given in the question. The planning department is not on the same floor as the finance department, and the sales department is not on the same floor as the human resources department.

D: This option does not match the information given in the question. The sales department is not on the same floor as the finance department, and the human resources department is not on the same floor as the research and development department.
