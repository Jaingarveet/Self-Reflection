## Assistant 2:
  To determine the most doubtful assertion, we need to evaluate each option based on the given context.

Option A: Shanghai's housing prices increased by 19.1% in the first quarter of 2005, and land prices rose by 6.53%. While this information may be relevant to the topic, it does not directly address the assertion that rising land prices are the chief culprit in soaring housing prices. Therefore, this option is not the most doubtful.

Option B: Residential prices in Beijing increased by 7.2% in the first quarter of 2005 compared with the same period last year, and residential land prices rose by 0.37%. This information suggests that residential prices are increasing, but it does not provide evidence that land prices are the primary cause of the increase. Therefore, this option is also not the most doubtful.

Option C: The chairman of Huayuan Real Estate believes that as land development costs increase, house prices will definitely increase. This assertion is doubtful because it implies a direct causal relationship between land prices and housing prices, which may not be the case. There could be other factors influencing housing prices, such as changes in supply and demand, interest rates, and economic conditions. Therefore, this option is the most doubtful.

Option D: The chairman of Yongtai Development Company said, "The skyrocketing housing prices are because supply has not kept up with demand." This assertion is the most doubtful because it oversimplifies the complex factors contributing to rising housing prices. It does not account for other factors such as changes in government policies, economic conditions, and the role of land prices in the housing market.

In conclusion, the most doubtful assertion is Option C, which implies a direct causal relationship between land prices and housing prices without considering other factors that may influence the housing market.
