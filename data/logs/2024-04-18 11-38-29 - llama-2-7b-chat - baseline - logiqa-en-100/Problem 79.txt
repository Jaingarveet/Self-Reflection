## User 2:
Topic: Logic
Context: There must be an outside world, because if there is something outside me that can shine or reflect, shining the light into my eyes, which gives me a visual experience, I ca nâ€™t see the buildings, the crowds and the stars these things.And, not only have visual experience like me, but others also have such visual experience; book knowledge also tells us repeatedly that there is an outside world outside of us.
Question: Which of the following does not constitute doubt or rebuttal to the above argument?
Choices:
  A: To use sensory evidence to explain the existence of the external world requires presupposing the existence of the external world in the mind.
  B: How do you prove that others have similar visual experience to you?
  C: Since the visual experience is reliable, Mirage is not a so-called illusion, but a real existence.
  D: If there is no external world and natural science knowledge is not a true reflection of it, then why does natural science achieve such great success in practice?
## Assistant 2:
  Thought: The argument suggests that the existence of an outside world can be inferred from the fact that we can see things outside of us, such as buildings, crowds, and stars. However, this argument can be challenged by several points:

Action: Answer("D")

Explanation: The argument does not address the possibility that the visual experience of the outside world could be an illusion or a misperception. It is possible that our senses are deceiving us, and the things we see outside of us are not actually there. This would challenge the assumption that the external world exists independently of our perception of it.

Additionally, the argument does not provide any evidence for the existence of the external world beyond our visual experiences. It is possible that the external world is simply a creation of our minds, and the visual experiences we have are simply a product of our imagination.

Therefore, option D, "If there is no external world and natural science knowledge is not a true reflection of it, then why does natural science achieve such great success in practice?" is the best answer, as it challenges the assumption that the external world exists independently of our perception of it and provides a possible alternative explanation for the success of natural science.
