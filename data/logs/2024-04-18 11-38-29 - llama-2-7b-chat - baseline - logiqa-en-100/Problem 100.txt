  B: Before? G In? K After? N
  C: Before? L Middle? Q After? G
  D: Before? G Middle? K After? L
## Assistant 2:
  Great! Let's apply the conditions given in the problem to determine the acceptable arrangement for Team 1:

1. If G or H is arranged to play, they must be in the front.
	* H is in Team 2, so G must be in the front for Team 1.
2. If K is scheduled to play, he must be in the middle.
	* K is in Team 1, so he must be in the middle.
3. If L is scheduled to play, he must be on team 1.
	* L is on Team 1, so he must be in the middle.
4. Neither P nor K can be in the same team as N.
	* P is in Team 1, and K is in Team 2, so N cannot be in the same team as P or K.
5. P cannot be in the same team as Q.
	* Q is in Team 1, so P cannot be in the same team as Q.
6. If H is in Team 2, Q is in the middle of Team 1.
	* H is in Team 2, so Q must be in the middle of Team 1.

Now, let's check the given options:

A: Before? L Middle? Q After? N
	* G is in the front, K is in the middle, and L is in the middle, but N is not in the same team as P or K.
	* This arrangement satisfies all the conditions.

B: Before? G In? K After? N
	* G is in the front, but K is not in the middle, and N is not in the same team as P or K.
	* This arrangement does not satisfy condition 4.

C: Before? L Middle? Q After? G
	* L is in the middle, but G is not in the front, and K is not in the same team as P or K.
	* This arrangement does not satisfy condition 1.

D: Before? G Middle? K After? L
	* G is in the front, but K is not in the middle, and L is not in the same team as P or K.
	* This arrangement does not satisfy condition 2.

Therefore, the only acceptable arrangement for Team 1 is:

A: Before? L Middle? Q After? N
