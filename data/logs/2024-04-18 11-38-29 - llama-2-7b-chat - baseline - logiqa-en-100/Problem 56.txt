Context: The Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge, built in 1968, has a clear height of 24 meters in the Fengshui area.Theoretically, it can pass a maximum of 3,000 tons of ships.Today, with the rapid economic development, it has become a building that “cuts the waist” of the Yangtze River waterway and hinders the passage of giant ships.A bridge expert asserted that the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge must be demolished and rebuilt in order to dredge the golden waterways of the Yangtze River completely.
Question: If any of the following is true, can you raise the most doubts about this expert's point of view?
Choices:
  A: Due to the inability of large ships to pass through the Nanjing Bridge, a large number of exported goods in the middle and upper reaches of the Yangtze River can only be taken by road or railway.
  B: 99% of international ships entering the Yangtze River are moored at ports below the Nanjing Bridge, and dozens of foreign trade terminals above Nanjing rarely have large external ships berthed.
  C: It is not enough to dismantle only the Nanjing Bridge.The Yangtze River Bridge, which was built in Wuhu, Tongling, Anqing and other places, has a clear height of 24 meters.
  D: Shipbuilding technology is highly developed, and 8000-ton ships designed for adapting to the passage of the Yangtze River abroad have passed through Nanjing to Wuhan.
## Assistant 2:
  The correct answer is (C): It is not enough to dismantle only the Nanjing Bridge.

The expert's argument for demolishing and rebuilding the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge is based on the assumption that the bridge hinders the passage of giant ships in the Yangtze River waterway. However, this assumption is not entirely accurate.

Option (C) highlights that other bridges along the Yangtze River, such as the Wuhu, Tongling, and Anqing bridges, also have a clear height of 24 meters, which means that they too can hinder the passage of large ships. Therefore, simply demolishing and rebuilding the Nanjing Bridge will not solve the problem entirely.

In other words, the issue of large ships passing through the Yangtze River waterway is not limited to the Nanjing Bridge alone, and addressing this issue will require a more comprehensive approach that involves the demolition and reconstruction of multiple bridges along the river.
