Context: Recently, hundreds of seals died from eating a fish contaminated with chemicals.Even small amounts of this chemical can poison mammals.However, some people have not been poisoned after eating this fish.
Question: Which of the following, if correct, is most helpful in explaining the contradictions in the above statement?
Choices:
  A: The fish contaminated with this chemical has not been harmed by the chemical itself.
  B: Toxic chemicals gather in the parts of the fish that seals eat but people don't.
  C: Traces of this chemical poison were also found in the bodies of some people who ate neither fish nor fish products.
  D: Fish contaminated with this chemical only accounts for a small portion of the seal â€™s total food intake.
## Assistant 2:
  Thought: The statement suggests that some people have not been poisoned after eating the contaminated fish, despite the fact that even small amounts of the chemical can poison mammals. This could be explained by the fact that the people who have not been poisoned may have a different diet or metabolism than the seals, which could affect how the chemical is processed in their bodies.
