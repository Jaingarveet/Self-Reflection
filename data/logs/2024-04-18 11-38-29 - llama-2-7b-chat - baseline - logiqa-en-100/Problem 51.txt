Context: There are 7 candidates hired by Haier? F, G, H, I, W, X and Y.One of them needs to be assigned to the public relations department, three to the production department, and three to the sales department.The personnel allocation of these 7 employees must meet the following conditions? (1) H and Y must be allocated in the same department.(2) F and G cannot be allocated in the same department (3) If X is allocated in the sales department, W is allocated in the production department.(4) F must be allocated in the production department.
Question: If X and F are assigned to the same department, which of the following statements cannot be true?
Choices:
  A: G is assigned to the sales department
  B: H is assigned to the production department.
  C: I was assigned to the sales department.
  D: W is assigned to the public relations department.
## Assistant 2:
  Thought: Let's analyze the given conditions and the options:

1. H and Y must be allocated in the same department.
2. F and G cannot be allocated in the same department.
3. If X is allocated in the sales department, W is allocated in the production department.

From condition 1, we know that H and Y must be in the same department. Let's assume H and Y are both in the production department (P).

From condition 2, we know that F and G cannot be in the same department. So, F must be in a different department than G. Let's assume F is in the sales department (S).

From condition 3, we know that if X is in the sales department, W is in the production department. So, X is in the sales department (S).

Now, let's evaluate each option:

A: G is assigned to the sales department.
This option is false because G is not in the sales department (by condition 2).

B: H is assigned to the production department.
This option is true because H is in the production department (by condition 1).

C: I was assigned to the sales department.
This option is false because I is not in the sales department (by condition 2).

D: W is assigned to the public relations department.
This option is false because W is in the production department (by condition 3).

Therefore, the correct answer is B: H is assigned to the production department.
## Result:
