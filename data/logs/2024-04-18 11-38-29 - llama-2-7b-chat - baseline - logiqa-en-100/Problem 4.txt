## Assistant 2:
  Thought: Let's analyze the given information to determine who the third speaker is if J is the fourth speaker.

1. Each speaker speaks only once, and only once at the same time.
2. Three speakers speak before lunch, and the other three speak after lunch.
3. G must speak before lunch.
4. Only one speaker is between M and N.
5. F speaks in the first or third place.

From these conditions, we can deduce the following:

* The first speaker is either F or M.
* The second speaker is either G or L.
* The third speaker is either J or N.
* The fourth speaker is J.

Now, let's use the information provided in the question:

* J is the fourth speaker.

So, the third speaker must be either N or M.

Action: Answer("C")
