You are an expert in Logic.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

## User 2:
Topic: Logic
Context: Conne Levi with a "moe" look looks like other newborns.But because it is the world's first test-tube baby screened by next-generation gene sequencing technology, his advent has attracted the attention of experts and scholars.Not long ago, this news detonated the audience at the "European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology Annual Meeting" held in London, England.And ordinary people also believe that humans may usher in the era of "customized babies".
Question: Which of the following, if true, would best refute the views of ordinary people?
Choices:
  A: "Artificial" genetic screening does not rule out that there will be loopholes; in natural conception, the guidelines for survival of the fittest in nature seem to be more subtle and effective
  B: It can be seen from the development history of modern science and technology that technological development is often faster than human cognition, and sometimes technology will go further and deviate from the track of human cognition
  C: Gene screening is mainly to avoid reproductive defects, this technology brings opportunities for human eugenics and eugenics; as for "customized babies", the concept of cloning is more involved, the two should not be confused
  D: "Customized babies" have not been tried globally, this concept also challenges the most controversial human reproductive ethics
## Assistant 2:
  Action: Answer("C")

The correct answer is option C: Gene screening is mainly to avoid reproductive defects, this technology brings opportunities for human eugenics and eugenics; as for "customized babies", the concept of cloning is more involved, the two should not be confused.

Explanation:

The passage suggests that the development of gene screening technology has raised concerns about the potential for "customized babies" and eugenics. Option C correctly explains that gene screening is primarily aimed at avoiding reproductive defects, but the technology also brings opportunities for human eugenics. This means that the ability to screen for specific genetic traits could potentially be used to select for certain characteristics in offspring, which raises ethical concerns.

Option A is incorrect because while it is true that there may be loopholes in gene screening technology, this does not necessarily refute the views of ordinary people.

Option B is also incorrect because while technological development can often outpace human cognition, this does not necessarily address the ethical concerns surrounding gene screening and "customized babies".

Option D is incorrect because while the concept of "customized babies" has been discussed, it has not been tried globally and therefore cannot be considered a challenge to established human reproductive ethics.
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
