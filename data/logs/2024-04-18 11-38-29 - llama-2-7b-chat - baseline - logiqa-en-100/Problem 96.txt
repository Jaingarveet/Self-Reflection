## User 2:
Topic: Logic
Context: Based on the following questions? Most people think that advertisers do whatever they can to attract customers.But advertisers are not always like this.Recently, in order to expand sales, a family magazine called "Bay" was renamed "Inferno", which mainly published violent and pornographic content.As a result, some perennial advertisers from the original "Bay" magazine refused to renew the contract and turned to other publications.This shows that these advertisers not only consider economic benefits, but also take into account their ethical responsibilities.
Question: If the following item is true, can the argument be strengthened most?
Choices:
  A: The cost and selling price of "Inferno" are lower than that of "Harbour".
  B: The above advertisers who refused to renew their contracts have not affected the benefits after switching to other publications.
  C: Readers of family magazines are generally not interested in violent and pornographic content.
  D: Some clients who advertise in other family magazines and so on turn to "Inferno" magazine.
## Assistant 2:
  Action: Answer("C")

The argument can be strengthened most if the statement "Readers of family magazines are generally not interested in violent and pornographic content" is true. This is because the renaming of "Bay" magazine to "Inferno" and the subsequent loss of advertisers can be seen as a result of the magazine's shift in content, which goes against the ethical responsibilities of the advertisers. If readers of family magazines are not interested in violent and pornographic content, then the advertisers who refused to renew their contracts are likely to be motivated by their ethical concerns rather than purely economic benefits.
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: D
