Context: An editor is considering the issue of choosing the manuscript for the theoretical version of the newspaper.Six papers from E, F, G, J and K are available.Taking into account the content of the article, the layout of the newspaper and other factors.(1) If paper E is used, then paper F cannot be used but paper K must be used; (2) Paper G or paper H can only be used without paper J.(3) If you don't need thesis G, you don't need thesis K.(4) Essay E is a manuscript requested by a celebrity and cannot be used.
Question: If the above items are true, which of the following items must be true?
Choices:
  A: Paper E is used, but paper H is not used.
  B: Both articles G and H are used.
  C: No paper J, but paper K.
  D: Both G and J articles are unnecessary.
## Assistant 2:
  Thought: Based on the given information, we need to determine which of the six papers can be used and which cannot be used based on the conditions provided.

From condition (1), if paper E is used, then paper F cannot be used, but paper K must be used. So, the only option that satisfies this condition is (C) No paper J, but paper K.

From condition (2), paper G or paper H can only be used without paper J. So, the only option that satisfies this condition is (B) Both articles G and H are used.

From condition (3), if you don't need thesis G, you don't need thesis K. So, the only option that satisfies this condition is (A) Paper E is used, but paper H is not used.

Based on the above analysis, the correct answer is (C) No paper J, but paper K.
