Context: Since 1993, sand and dust storms have frequently occurred in the Inner Mongolia region of our country, causing major economic losses.Some people think that sand and dust storms are caused by grassland degradation and desertification caused by climate drought.They are natural disasters, so they are inevitable.
Question: If the following items are true, can the above opinions be questioned, except?
Choices:
  A: In the 1950s, grass in Xilin Gol grassland in Inner Mongolia was as tall as a horse's belly, and now grass can't even cover mice.
  B: Opposite the degraded grasslands of Hulunbeier and Xilinguole in Inner Mongolia, the grasslands of Mongolian grassland are about 1 meter high.
  C: On the almost uninhabited border line of 10 kilometers wide between China and Mongolia, grass still maintains the height of the 1950s.
  D: The increase in dust storms is mainly due to human factors such as overloaded grazing and predatory management of grasslands.
## Assistant 2:
  Thought: The opinions that sand and dust storms in the Inner Mongolia region are caused by grassland degradation and desertification due to climate drought may be questioned based on the given information.

Action: Answer("D")

Explanation:

The information provided in the passage suggests that the height of grass in the Inner Mongolia region has changed over time. In the 1950s, the grass in Xilin Gol grassland was tall enough to cover a horse's belly, but now it can't even cover mice. This indicates that there may be other factors contributing to the sand and dust storms in the region, beyond just grassland degradation and desertification.

Option D suggests that the increase in dust storms is mainly due to human factors such as overloaded grazing and predatory management of grasslands. This is a plausible explanation, as human activities can indeed have a significant impact on the environment and contribute to desertification. Therefore, the opinion that sand and dust storms are solely caused by natural disasters may be questioned based on the given information.
