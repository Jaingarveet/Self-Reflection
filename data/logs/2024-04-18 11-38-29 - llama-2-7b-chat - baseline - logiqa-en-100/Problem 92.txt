## Assistant 2:
  Great! Let's analyze the situation:

We know that Professor Zhao said "The champion is not the Tsinghua University team nor the Zhejiang University team." This means that if Tsinghua University team wins, Professor Zhao's prediction will be incorrect.

We also know that Professor Qian said "The champion is not the Tsinghua University team, but the University of Science and Technology of China." This means that if the University of Science and Technology of China wins, Professor Qian's prediction will be incorrect.

Finally, we know that Professor Sun said "The champion is not the China University of Science and Technology team, but the Tsinghua University team." This means that if the China University of Science and Technology team wins, Professor Sun's prediction will be incorrect.

Now, let's analyze the situation:

If the Tsinghua University team wins, then Professor Zhao and Professor Qian's predictions are incorrect. But Professor Sun's prediction is correct. Therefore, the answer is (D) Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics.

Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
