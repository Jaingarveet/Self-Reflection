Context: There are five volcanic islands E, F, G, H, and I in the east coast of a country.They are arranged in a straight line from north to south, and they are found? (1) F is adjacent to H and is on the north side of H.(2) I and E are adjacent.(3) G is somewhere in the north of F.
Question: If it is found that G is the northernmost island, how many possible arrangements are there for this group of islands?
Choices:
  A: 2
  B: 3
  C: 4
  D: 5
## Assistant 2:
  Great, let's tackle this question!

From the given information, we can form the following diagram:

E | F | G | H | I

From (1), we know that F is adjacent to H and is on the north side of H. Therefore, the position of F can be represented as:

F | H

From (2), we know that I and E are adjacent. Therefore, the position of I can be represented as:

I | E

From (3), we know that G is somewhere in the north of F. Therefore, the position of G can be represented as:

G | F

Now, we have the positions of all the islands in the diagram:

E | F | G | H | I

There are 5 possible arrangements for this group of islands:

1. E | F | G | H | I
2. E | F | I | G | H
3. E | G | F | H | I
4. E | G | I | F | H
5. E | H | G | F | I

So, the answer is (C) 4 possible arrangements.
## Result:
Agent Answer: None
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
