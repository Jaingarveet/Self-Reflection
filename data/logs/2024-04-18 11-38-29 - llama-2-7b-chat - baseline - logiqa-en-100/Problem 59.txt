  D: Public Relations Department? X; Production Department? F, I, W; Sales Department? G, H, Y
## Assistant 2:
  Thought: Based on the given conditions, we need to allocate the 7 employees to the departments in a way that satisfies the conditions.

Action: Let's list the possible combinations of employees and departments:

1. Public Relations Department: W
2. Production Department: F, H, Y
3. Sales Department: G, I, X

Now, let's check each combination to see if it satisfies the conditions:

A. Public Relations Department: W; Production Department: F, G, H; Sales Department: I, X
This combination satisfies conditions (1) and (3). However, it violates condition (2) as F and G are in the same department.

B. Public Relations Department: W; Production Department: G, I, X; Sales Department: F, H, Y
This combination satisfies conditions (1), (2), and (3).

C. Public Relations Department: X; Production Department: F, G, H; Sales Department: I, Y, W
This combination satisfies conditions (1), (2), and (3).

D. Public Relations Department: X; Production Department: F, I, W; Sales Department: G, H, Y
This combination satisfies conditions (1), (2), and (3).

Therefore, the final distribution of the 7 employees is:

A: Public Relations Department? W; Production Department? F, G, H; Sales Department? I, X

Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
