  B: Wang, Zhao and Liu were all hired by Tianji.
  C: Only Liu was hired by Tian Xuan.
  D: Only Wang was hired by Tianxuan.
## Assistant 2:
  Great! Let's apply our logical thinking skills to solve this problem.

From the given information, we can conclude that:

1. Li was hired by Tianshu.
2. Li and Zhao were not hired by the same unit.
3. Liu and Zhao were hired by the same unit.
4. If Zhang was hired by Tianxuan, then Wang was hired by Tianxuan.

Now, let's evaluate each of the given choices:

A: Li and Liu were hired by the same unit.
This choice is incorrect because Liu and Zhao were hired by the same unit, not Li and Liu.

B: Wang, Zhao, and Liu were all hired by Tianji.
This choice is also incorrect because Zhang was not hired by Tianxuan, so Wang was not hired by Tianxuan.

C: Only Liu was hired by Tian Xuan.
This choice is correct! Since Liu and Zhao were hired by the same unit, and Zhao was hired by Tianxuan, we can conclude that only Liu was hired by Tianxuan.

D: Only Wang was hired by Tianxuan.
This choice is also incorrect because Wang was not hired by Tianxuan, as we established earlier.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C): Only Liu was hired by Tian Xuan.
## Result:
