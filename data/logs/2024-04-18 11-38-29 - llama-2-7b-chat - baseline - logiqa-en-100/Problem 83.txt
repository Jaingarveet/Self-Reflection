Topic: Logic
Context: A provincial Go team coach selects 4 of the 7 players from E, F, G, H, J, K and M to participate in the professional league.The selection must meet the following conditions? E or F has one person to participate, but not both .One of J or K will participate, but not both.If J participates, then G participates.Unless F participates, M does not participate.
Question: If H does not participate in the game, which of the following two players must be included in the game?
Choices:
  A: F and G
  C: F and K
  B: E and M
  D: G and K
## Assistant 2:
  Thought: Let's analyze the conditions given in the problem:

1. E or F has one person to participate, but not both.
2. One of J or K will participate, but not both.
3. If J participates, then G participates.
4. Unless F participates, M does not participate.

Now, let's consider the possible combinations of players based on these conditions:

1. E and F both participate: This is not allowed by condition 1.
2. F and G both participate: This is allowed by conditions 1 and 3, but not by condition 2.
3. F and K both participate: This is allowed by conditions 1 and 3, but not by condition 2.
4. G and K both participate: This is allowed by conditions 3 and 4, but not by condition 1.
5. E and M both participate: This is allowed by condition 4, but not by conditions 1 and 2.

Now, let's evaluate each of the given options:

A: F and G: This combination does not meet condition 1, as both F and G are participating.

C: F and K: This combination meets conditions 1 and 3, but not condition 2.

B: E and M: This combination meets condition 4, but not conditions 1 and 2.

D: G and K: This combination meets conditions 3 and 4, but not condition 1.

Therefore, the answer is (D) G and K.
