## System:
You are an expert in Medicine.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Reflection on Previous Incorrect Answer
**Problem:** I incorrectly identified the medication that affects the trabecular meshwork and aqueous outflow. This demonstrates a gap in my knowledge regarding the specific mechanisms of action for different classes of glaucoma medications.
**Solution:** I have reviewed the pharmacology of glaucoma medications, focusing on their impact on aqueous humor dynamics. I now understand that:
* **Beta-blockers (e.g., Timolol):** Reduce aqueous humor production.
* **Miotics (e.g., Pilocarpine):** Increase outflow through the trabecular meshwork by contracting the ciliary muscle and opening the drainage angle.
* **Alpha-2 agonists (e.g., Brimonidine):** Reduce aqueous humor production and increase uveoscleral outflow.
* **Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (e.g., Brinzolamide):** Reduce aqueous humor production.
**Correct Answer:** Based on this understanding, the medication that affects the trabecular meshwork and aqueous outflow is a **miotic**.
**Action: Answer("B")** 
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
