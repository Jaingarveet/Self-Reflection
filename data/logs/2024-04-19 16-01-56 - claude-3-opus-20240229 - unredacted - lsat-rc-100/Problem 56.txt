Context: David Warsh's book describes a great contradiction inherent in economic theory since 1776, when Adam Smith published The Wealth of Nations. Warsh calls it the struggle between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand. Using the example of a pin factory, Smith emphasized the huge increases in efficiency that could be achieved through increased size. The pin factory's employees, by specializing on narrow tasks, produce far more than they could if each worked independently. Also, Smith was the first to recognize how a market economy can harness self-interest to the common good, leading each individual as though "by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention." For example, businesses sell products that people want, at reasonable prices, not because the business owners inherently want to please people but because doing so enables them to make money in a competitive marketplace. These two concepts, however, are opposed to each other. The parable of the pin factory says that there are increasing returns to scaleâ€”the bigger the pin factory, the more specialized its workers can be, and therefore the more pins the factory can produce per worker. But increasing returns create a natural tendency toward monopoly, because a large business can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than a small business. So given increasing returns, bigger firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business, until each industry is dominated by just a few players. But for the invisible hand to work properly, there must be many competitors in each industry, so that nobody can exert monopoly power. Therefore, the idea that free markets always get it right depends on the assumption that returns to scale are diminishing, not increasing. For almost two centuries, the assumption of diminishing returns dominated economic theory, with the Pin Factory de-emphasized. Why? As Warsh explains, it wasn't about ideology; it was about following the line of least mathematical resistance. Economics has always had scientific aspirations; economists have always sought the rigor and clarity that comes from representing their ideas using numbers and equations. And the economics of diminishing returns lend themselves readily to elegant formalism, while those of increasing returns-the Pin Factory- are notoriously hard to represent mathematically. Many economists tried repeatedly to bring the Pin Factory into the mainstream of economic thought to reflect the fact that increasing returns obviously characterized many enterprises, such as railroads. Yet they repeatedly failed because they could not state their ideas rigorously enough. Only since the late 1970s has this "underground river" -a term used to describe the role of increasing returns in economic thought-surfaced into the mainstream of economic thought. By then, economists had finally found ways to describe the Pin Factory with the rigor needed to make it respectable.
Question: The reference to railroads (line 51) serves to
Choices:
  A: resolve an ambiguity inherent in the metaphor of the Invisible Hand
  B: illustrate the difficulty of stating the concept of the Pin Factory with mathematical rigor
  C: call attention to the increasing prevalence of industries that have characteristics of the Pin Factory
  D: point to an industry that illustrates the shortcomings of economists' emphasis on the Invisible Hand
  E: present an example of the high levels of competition achieved in transportation industries
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I misinterpreted the purpose of the railroad example in the context of the passage. The railroad industry is not being used to illustrate the difficulty of mathematically modeling increasing returns (the Pin Factory concept). Rather, it is an example that highlights the limitations of focusing too heavily on the Invisible Hand concept, which assumes diminishing returns.
Error Keywords:
 - Misinterpretation of example
 - Incorrect context
 - Invisible Hand vs Pin Factory confusion
Solution:
The passage discusses the contradiction between the Invisible Hand (diminishing returns, perfect competition) and the Pin Factory (increasing returns, tendency towards monopoly). Economists historically focused on the Invisible Hand because diminishing returns were easier to model mathematically than increasing returns.
The railroad industry is mentioned as an example of an industry characterized by increasing returns (the Pin Factory concept). This example illustrates that many real-world industries exhibit increasing returns, which contradicts the assumptions of the Invisible Hand. Therefore, the emphasis on the Invisible Hand in economic thought has shortcomings, as it fails to account for industries like railroads.
Instructions:
1. Carefully read the passage to understand the main concepts and their relationships.
2. Identify the key concepts in the question (here, the purpose of the railroad example).
3. Locate the relevant part of the passage that discusses the railroad example.
4. Analyze the context in which the example is used and how it relates to the main concepts.
5. Eliminate answer choices that are not supported by the passage.
6. Choose the answer that best fits the purpose of the example in the context of the passage's main argument.
Advice:
 - Always read the passage carefully and make sure you understand the main concepts and their relationships.
 - Pay attention to how examples are used in the passage and what they are meant to illustrate.
 - Don't get caught up in the details of the examples themselves; focus on their purpose in the context of the main argument.
 - Eliminate answer choices that are not directly supported by the information in the passage.
 - If you're unsure, go back to the passage and re-read the relevant sections to clarify the context and purpose of the examples.
