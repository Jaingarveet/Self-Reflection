## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: A car is being driven, in a straight line and at a uniform speed, towards the base of a vertical tower. The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower?
Choices:
  A: 5(√3 + 1)
  B: 6(√3 + √2)
  C: 7(√3 – 1)
  D: 8(√3 – 2)
  E: None of these

## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let the speed of the car be v and the height of the tower be h. 
Let the car be at points A and B when the angles of elevation are 45° and 60° respectively. Let the base of the tower be C.
From the given information, we have:
* Angle ACB = 60°
* Angle AC[REDACTED] = 45°
* Time taken to travel from [REDACTED] to B = 10 minutes
We can use trigonometry to relate the distances and angles:
* In triangle ABC: tan(60°) = h/BC, so BC = h/√3
* In triangle A[REDACTED]C: tan(45°) = h/A[REDACTED]C, so A[REDACTED]C = h
The distance traveled by the car in 10 minutes is A[REDACTED]B = A[REDACTED]C - BC = h - h/√3 = h(√3 - 1)/√3
Since the speed is uniform, we can use the formula: time = distance/speed
Time taken to reach the base (C) from B = BC/v = (h/√3) / v = h / (v√3)
To find the time in terms of the given 10 minutes, we can divide the time to reach C from B by the time to travel from [REDACTED] to B:
(h / (v√3)) / (h(√3 - 1)/(v√3)) = 1 / (√3 - 1)
To rationalize the denominator, we multiply both numerator and denominator by the conjugate (√3 + 1):
1 / (√3 - 1) * (√3 + 1) / (√3 + 1) = (√3 + 1) / 2
Therefore, the additional time needed is (√3 + 1)/2 times the 10 minutes:
Time = 10 * (√3 + 1)/2 = 5(√3 + 1) minutes 
Action: Answer("A") 
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
