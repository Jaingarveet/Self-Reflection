## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Each picket is 0.5 inches wide, and there are 6 inches of space between each pair, so the total width per section is 0.5 (picket) + 6 (space) = 6.5 inches.
Since there are x pickets, there are x-1 spaces between them.
Therefore, the total length of the fence in inches is 0.5x (pickets) + 6.5(x-1) (spaces).
Simplifying, we get 0.5x + 6.5x - 6.5 = 7x - 6.5 inches.
To convert to feet, we divide by 12: (7x - 6.5)/12. 
This is not one of the options, so we need to find an equivalent expression.
Multiplying both numerator and denominator by 2 to eliminate the decimal gives (14x - 13)/24.
Action: Answer("E")
