## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let x be the distance traveled by the ship when they meet.
The plane travels 10 times faster than the ship, so it travels x - 180 miles.
Since time = distance/speed, the time taken by the ship and the plane is the same: x/1 = (x-180)/10
Solving for x: 10x = x - 180
9x = -180
x = -20
Since distance cannot be negative, there seems to be an error in the problem statement or the answer choices.
