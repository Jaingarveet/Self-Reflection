## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let x be the distance between A and B. 
The total time for the trip is x/70 + x/90.
3 hours before the end, he was 70 miles from B, meaning he had traveled x-70 miles at 70 mph, taking (x-70)/70 hours.
So, the total trip time minus this time equals 3 hours: (x/70 + x/90) - (x-70)/70 = 3.
Solving for x, we get x = 270 miles.
Action: Answer("C") 
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
