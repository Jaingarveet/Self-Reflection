## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The company needs to make $626,400 profit in a year, which means $626,400 / 12 = $52,200 profit per month.
They produce 420 components, so they need to make a profit of $52,200 / 420 = $124.29 per component.
Adding the production cost of $110, the minimum selling price should be $124.29 + $110 = $234.29.
Looking at the options, the closest value above this is $240.
Action: Answer("C") 
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
