## Assistant 2:
  Thought: I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I need to reflect on my solution and the correct answer.

Action: I will use my self-reflection to help me answer the question.

Reflection:

* I incorrectly calculated the original price of the book by multiplying the sale price by 40% instead of 0.40.
* The correct calculation for the original price of the book is: Original price = Sale price x (1 - Discount percentage) = $18.00 x (1 - 0.40) = $18.00 x 0.60 = $10.80

Therefore, the original price of the book was $10.80.

Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
