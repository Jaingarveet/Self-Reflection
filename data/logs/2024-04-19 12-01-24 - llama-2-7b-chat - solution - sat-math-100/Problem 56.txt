# Model: llama-2-7b-chat | Agent: solution | Exam: sat-math-100 | Problem 56 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:

Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: $$g(x)=a x^{2}+24$$For the function $g$ defined above, $a$ is a constant and $g(4)=8$. What is the value of $g(-4)$ ?
Choices:
  A: 8
  B: 0
  C: -1
  D: -8
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
The function $g(x) = a x^2 + 24$ can be factored as $a (x + 4)^2$.

Plugging in -4, we get:

$g(-4) = a (-4 + 4)^2 = a [REDACTED]^2 = [REDACTED]$

Therefore, the value of $g(-4)$ is [REDACTED].
## Assistant 2:
  Thought: 
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I am now reflecting on my solution and the correct answer.

Action: Answer("C")

Explanation:
The function $g(x) = a x^2 + 24$ can be factored as $a (x + 4)^2$.
Plugging in -4, we get:

$g(-4) = a (-4 + 4)^2 = a [REDACTED]^2 = [REDACTED]$

Therefore, the value of $g(-4)$ is [REDACTED].
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
