## Assistant 2:
  Thought: I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I need to reflect on my solution and the correct answer.

Action: I will use the information I have to determine the value of $p$.

Reflection:

The problem states that the length of the rectangle was increased by 10 percent, which means the new length is $1.10 \times 100 = 110$ percent of the original length.

The problem also states that the width of the rectangle was decreased by $p$ percent, which means the new width is $0.90 \times 100 = 90$ percent of the original width.

The area of the rectangle is given by the product of the length and width, so the new area is:

New area = $110 \times 90 = 9900$ square units

The problem states that the area of the rectangle decreased by 12 percent, so the original area was:

Original area = $10000$ square units

Now, I need to find the value of $p$ that will result in a 12 percent decrease in the area.

I can do this by setting up a proportion:

$9900 = 10000 \times (1 - 0.12)$

Solving for $p$, I get:

$p = 0.12 \times 100 = 12$ percent

Action: I will answer the question with the correct choice, which is (B) $p = 15$.

Answer: (B) $p = 15$
