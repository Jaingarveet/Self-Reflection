Question: $$0.10 x+0.20 y=0.18(x+y)$$Clayton will mix $x$ milliliters of a $10 \%$ by mass saline solution with $y$ milliliters of a $20 \%$ by mass saline solution in order to create an $18 \%$ by mass saline solution. The equation above represents this situation. If Clayton uses 100 milliliters of the $20 \%$ by mass saline solution, how many milliliters of the $10 \%$ by mass saline solution must he use?
Choices:
  A: 5
  B: 25
  C: 50
  D: 100

## Assistant 2:
  Thought: I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I need to reevaluate the problem to find the correct solution.

Reflection: I made a mistake in my previous answer by not properly simplifying the equation. The equation can be simplified by multiplying both sides by $x + y$, which gives us:

$$0.10x + 0.20y = 0.18(x + y)$$

Now, we are asked to find the value of $x$ that satisfies the equation when $y = 100$. We can solve for $x$ by subtracting $0.20y$ from both sides, which gives us:

$$0.10x = 0.18(x + 100)$$

Now, we can divide both sides by $0.10$ to find the value of $x$:

$$x = \frac{0.18(x + 100)}{0.10}$$

Now, we are given that Clayton uses 100 milliliters of the $20 \%$ by mass saline solution. We can substitute this value into the equation we just derived to find the value of $x$:

$$x = \frac{0.18(x + 100)}{0.10} = \frac{0.18(x + 100)}{0.10} = \frac{0.18(100 + x)}{0.10}$$

Now, we can simplify the equation by multiplying both sides by $0.10$ to find the value of $x$:

$$x = \frac{0.18(100 + x)}{0.10} = 18 + \frac{x}{0.10}$$

Now, we are asked to find the value of $x$ that satisfies the equation. We can solve for $x$ by subtracting $18$ from both sides, which gives us:

$$\frac{x}{0.10} = \frac{x - 18}{0.10}$$

Now, we can simplify the equation by multiplying both sides by $0.10$ to find the value of $x$:

$$x = \frac{x - 18}{0.10} = \frac{x}{0.10}$$

Therefore, the value of $x$ that satisfies the equation is $x = 5$.

Action: Answer("A")
