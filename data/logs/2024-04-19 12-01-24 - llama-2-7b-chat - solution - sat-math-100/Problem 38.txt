## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Assistant 2:
  Thought:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand that I made a mistake in my reasoning. I will take a closer look at the problem and my previous solution to determine where I went wrong.

Reflection:
I see that my previous answer was based on a misunderstanding of the problem. I mistakenly believed that $a^{\frac{2}{3}}$ meant $a$ raised to the power of $\frac{2}{3}$, when in fact it means $a$ raised to the power of $\frac{2}{3}$ itself.

To find the correct answer, I will use the definition of exponentiation: $a^b = a \times a \times ... \times a$, where $b$ is the exponent. In this case, $b = \frac{2}{3}$, so:

$$a^{\frac{2}{3}} = a \times a \times ... \times a$$

Now, I need to find the value of $a$ that makes the expression true for all values of $a$.

Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
