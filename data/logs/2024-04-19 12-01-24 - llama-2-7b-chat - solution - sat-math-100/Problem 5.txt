## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Question: The number of states that joined the United States between 1776 and 1849 is twice the number of states that joined between 1850 and 1900. If 30 states joined the United States between 1776 and 1849 and $x$ states joined between 1850 and 1900 , which of the following equations is true?
Choices:
  A: $30 x=2$
  B: $2 x=30$
  C: $\frac{x}{2}=30$
  D: $x+30=2$

## Assistant 2:
  Thought:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and upon reflection, I realized that I made a mistake in my calculation. I need to use the correct equation to solve for the number of states that joined between 1850 and 1900.

Action:
I will use the equation $2x = 30$, where $x$ is the number of states that joined between 1850 and 1900.

Solution:
The correct answer is (B) $2 x = 30$.

Explanation:
The number of states that joined the United States between 1776 and 1849 is 30, and the number of states that joined between 1850 and 1900 is $x$. Since the number of states that joined between 1776 and 1849 is twice the number of states that joined between 1850 and 1900, we can set up the equation $2x = 30$. Solving for $x$, we get $x = 15$. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) $2 x = 30$.
