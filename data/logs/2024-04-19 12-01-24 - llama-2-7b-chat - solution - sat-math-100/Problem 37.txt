## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: The volume of right circular cylinder A is 22 cubic centimeters. What is the volume, in cubic centimeters, of a right circular cylinder with twice the radius and half the height of cylinder A?
Choices:
  A: 11
  B: 22
  C: 44
  D: 66
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
The volume of the first cylinder is [REDACTED] cubic centimeters.
The radius of the first cylinder is twice the radius of the second cylinder, so the radius of the second cylinder is 1/2 of the radius of the first cylinder.
The height of the first cylinder is half the height of the second cylinder, so the height of the second cylinder is 2 times the height of the first cylinder.
Using the formula V = πr^2h, we can calculate the volume of the second cylinder as follows:
V = π(1/2)^2 \* 2h = π \* 1/4 \* 2 \* [REDACTED] = [REDACTED] cubic centimeters
## Assistant 2:
  Great job on reflecting on your previous answer and using that self-reflection to help you solve the problem! Here's how you can apply the same process to answer the question:

The volume of the first cylinder is 22 cubic centimeters.
The radius of the first cylinder is twice the radius of the second cylinder, so the radius of the second cylinder is 1/2 of the radius of the first cylinder.
The height of the first cylinder is half the height of the second cylinder, so the height of the second cylinder is 2 times the height of the first cylinder.
Using the formula V = πr^2h, we can calculate the volume of the second cylinder as follows:
V = π(1/2)^2 \* 2h = π \* 1/4 \* 2 \* [REDACTED] = [REDACTED] cubic centimeters

So, the volume of the right circular cylinder with twice the radius and half the height of cylinder A is 44 cubic centimeters.

Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
