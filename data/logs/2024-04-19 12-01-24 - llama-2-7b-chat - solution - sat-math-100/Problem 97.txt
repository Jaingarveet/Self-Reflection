## Assistant 2:
  Thought:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand that the correct answer is $h(5)-h(3) = 2$.

Reflection:
I made a mistake in my previous answer by misunderstanding the formula for $h(x)$. I see now that $h(x) = 2^x$, so $h(5) = 2^5 = 32$ and $h(3) = 2^3 = 8$. Therefore, $h(5)-h(3) = 32 - 8 = 24$.

Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
