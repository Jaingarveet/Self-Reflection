## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: The equation $\frac{24 x^{2}+25 x-47}{a x-2}=-8 x-3-\frac{53}{a x-2}$ is true for all values of $x \neq \frac{2}{a}$, where $a$ is a constant.What is the value of $a$ ?
Choices:
  A: -16
  B: -3
  C: 3
  D: 16

## Assistant 2:
  Thought: I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I need to reflect on my solution and the correct answer.

Action: I will start by simplifying the equation by combining like terms:

$$\frac{24 x^{2} + 25 x - 47}{ax - 2} = -8 x - 3 - \frac{53}{a x - 2}$$

$$\frac{24 x^{2} + 25 x - 47}{ax - 2} = -8 x - 3 - \frac{53}{a}$$

$$\frac{24 x^{2} + 25 x - 47}{a} = -8 x - 3 - \frac{53}{a}$$

Now, I need to find the value of $a$ that makes the equation true for all values of $x \neq \frac{2}{a}$.

Reflection: I realized that the equation is true for all values of $x$ when $a = 3$.

Action: I will select choice (C) as the correct answer.

Answer: $a = 3$
## Result:
Agent Answer: None
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
