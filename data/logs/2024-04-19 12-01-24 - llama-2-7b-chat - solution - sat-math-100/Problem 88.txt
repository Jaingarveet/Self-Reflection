## Assistant 2:
  Thought: I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I need to reflect on my solution and the correct answer.

Action: I will analyze the equation and identify the key elements to determine when the ball will hit the ground.

Reflection: The equation $h=-4.9t^2+25t$ represents the height of the ball as a function of time $t$. To find when the ball will hit the ground, we need to set the height equal to zero, which gives us $h=0$.

Solving for $t$, we get:

$$t = \frac{-h}{-4.9} = \frac{25}{-4.9} = 5.0$$

So, the ball will hit the ground after approximately 5 seconds.

Action: I will select the correct answer, which is (D) 5.0 seconds.

Answer: D) 5.0 seconds
## Result:
Agent Answer: None
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
