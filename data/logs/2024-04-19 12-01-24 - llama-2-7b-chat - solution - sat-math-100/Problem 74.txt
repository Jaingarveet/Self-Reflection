## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Assistant 2:
  Thought:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand that it was due to a mistake in my calculation. I will take a closer look at the problem and use my self-reflection to help me arrive at the correct answer.

Reflection:
I see that the problem is asking for the equivalent of $\frac{1}{\frac{1}{x+2}+\frac{1}{x+3}}$ in terms of $x$. To solve this, I will use the fact that $\frac{1}{x+2}$ and $\frac{1}{x+3}$ are both equivalent to $\frac{1}{x}$ when $x$ is greater than 3.

So, the equivalent of $\frac{1}{\frac{1}{x+2}+\frac{1}{x+3}}$ is:

$$\frac{1}{\frac{1}{x}} + \frac{1}{\frac{1}{x}} = \frac{2}{x}$$

Therefore, the correct answer is (B): $\frac{x^{2}+5 x+6}{2 x+5}$.

Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
