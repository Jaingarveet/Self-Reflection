## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: \begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|c||c|c|c|c|}\hline$n$ & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\\hline$f(n)$ & -2 & 1 & 4 & 7 \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}The table above shows some values of the linear function $f$. Which of the following defines $f$ ?
Choices:
  A: $f(n)=n-3$
  B: $f(n)=2 n-4$
  C: $f(n)=3 n-5$
  D: $f(n)=4 n-6$

Solution:
## Assistant 2:
  Thought:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and upon reflection, I realized that I misunderstood the problem. The table provided shows the values of $f(n)$, and we need to find the formula that defines $f$.

Action: Answer("B")

Reflection:
I analyzed the table and noticed that the values of $f(n)$ are always twice the corresponding value of $n$. This means that the formula for $f$ is $f(n) = 2n - 4$.

Explanation:
The formula for $f(n)$ is $f(n) = 2n - 4$. This is the correct answer.
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
