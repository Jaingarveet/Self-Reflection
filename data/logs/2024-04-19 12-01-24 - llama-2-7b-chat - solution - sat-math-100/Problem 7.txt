## Assistant 2:
  Thought:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand that the correct answer is $(7+3i) + (-8+9i) = 15 + 12i$.

Reflection:
I made a mistake in my previous answer by adding the terms incorrectly. I realized that the sum of $(7+3i)$ and $(-8+9i)$ is actually $15+12i$. I should have used the distributive property to expand the addition of the complex numbers.

Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
