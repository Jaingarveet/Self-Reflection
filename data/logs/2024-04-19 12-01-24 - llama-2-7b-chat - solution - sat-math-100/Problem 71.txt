## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

## Assistant 2:
  Thought: 
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand that the correct answer is B: 0.38.

Reflection:
I made a mistake in my initial calculation by misinterpreting the information provided in the table. I realized that the percentage of respondents who answered "Always" is 30.9%, not 31.3% as I previously calculated. To calculate the probability that a tablet user answered "Always," given that they did not answer "Never," I need to use the formula:

Probability = (Number of successes / Total number of trials)

In this case, the number of successes is 30.9% (the percentage of respondents who answered "Always"), and the total number of trials is 100% (the total number of respondents in the survey).

Therefore, the closest answer to the probability that a tablet user answered "Always," given that they did not answer "Never," is B: 0.38.

Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
