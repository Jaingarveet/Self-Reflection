Context: Many educators in Canada and the United States advocate multicultural education as a means of achieving multicultural understanding. There are, however, a variety of proposals as to what multicultural education should consist of. The most modest of these proposals holds that schools and colleges should promote multicultural understanding by teaching about other cultures, teaching which proceeds from within the context of the majority culture. Students should learn about other cultures, proponents claim, but examination of these cultures should operate with the methods, perspectives, and values of the majority culture. These values are typically those of liberalism: democracy, tolerance, and equality of persons. Critics of this first proposal have argued that genuine understanding of other cultures is impossible if the study of other cultures is refracted through the distorting lens of the majority culture's perspective. Not all cultures share liberal values. Their value systems have arisen in often radically different social and historical circumstances, and thus, these critics argue, cannot be understood and adequately appreciated if one insists on approaching them solely from within the majority culture's perspective. In response to this objection, a second version of multicultural education has developed that differs from the first in holding that multicultural education ought to adopt a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures. The values of one culture should not be standards by which others are judged; each culture should be taken on its own terms. However, the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in this second version of multicultural education are still identifiably Western. They are the methods of anthropology, social psychology, political science, and sociology. They are, that is, methods which derive from the Western scientific perspective and heritage. Critics of this second form of multicultural education argue as follows: The Western scientific heritage is founded upon an epistemological system that prizes the objective over the subjective, the logical over the intuitive, and the empirically verifiable over the mystical. The methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are thus already value laden; the choice to examine and understand other cultures by these methods involves a commitment to certain values such as objectivity. Thus, the second version of multicultural education is not essentially different from the first. Scientific discourse has a privileged place in Western cultures, but the discourses of myth, tradition, religion, and mystical insight are often the dominant forms of thought and language of non-Western cultures. To insist on trying to understand nonscientific cultures by the methods of Western science is not only distorting, but is also an expression of an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism: the chauvinism of science. According to this objection, it is only by adopting the (often nonscientific) perspectives and methods of the cultures studied that real understanding can be achieved.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would provide the strongest objection to the criticism in the passage of the second version of multicultural education?
Choices:
  A: It is impossible to adopt the perspectives and methods of a culture unless one is a member of that culture.
  B: Many non-Western societies have value systems that are very similar to one another.
  C: Some non-Western societies use their own value system when studying cultures that have different values.
  D: Students in Western societies cannot understand their culture's achievements unless such achievements are treated as the subject of Western scientific investigations.
  E: Genuine understanding of another culture is necessary for adequately appreciating that culture.
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I incorrectly chose answer choice [REDACTED] as the strongest objection to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education. While [REDACTED] points out that some non-Western societies also use their own methods to study other cultures, it does not directly address the key point of the criticism - that using external methods prevents genuine understanding. Answer choice [REDACTED], on the other hand, directly challenges the criticism's claim that real understanding requires adopting the internal perspectives of the studied culture.
Error Keywords:
 - Misinterpreting the main point of an argument
 - Failing to identify the most relevant counterargument
 - Focusing on tangential details rather than core issues
Solution:
The criticism of the second version of multicultural education argues that using Western scientific methods to study non-Western cultures is distorting and an attempt to maintain cultural chauvinism. It claims that real understanding can only be achieved by adopting the internal perspectives and methods of the cultures being studied.
Answer choice [REDACTED] directly challenges this criticism by arguing that it is impossible to truly adopt the perspectives and methods of a culture unless one is a member of that culture. If this is true, then the criticism's proposed solution - studying cultures using their own internal methods - is not feasible. This undermines the criticism by suggesting its key claim is impossible to implement.
Instructions:
1. Carefully read the passage to identify the main arguments and criticisms.
2. Analyze each answer choice to determine how it relates to the criticism being discussed.
3. Eliminate answer choices that are irrelevant or fail to directly address the key points of the criticism.
4. Select the answer choice that most directly challenges or undermines the reasoning of the criticism.
5. Double-check that the selected answer is the strongest objection among the available choices.
Advice:
 - Always focus on the core issues and main points of arguments, rather than getting sidetracked by tangential details.
 - When evaluating objections, look for counterarguments that directly challenge the reasoning or assumptions of the argument being criticized.
 - Eliminate answer choices that are irrelevant or fail to engage with the key points under discussion.
 - Remember that the strongest objection will be the one that most fundamentally undermines the reasoning of the argument being challenged.
## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's carefully analyze this question step-by-step:
The key criticism of the second version of multicultural education is that using Western scientific methods to study non-Western cultures is distorting and an attempt to maintain cultural chauvinism. The critics argue that real understanding can only be achieved by adopting the internal perspectives and methods of the cultures being studied.
Looking at each answer choice:
A) If it's impossible to adopt the perspectives and methods of a culture unless one is a member of that culture, then the critics' proposed solution of studying cultures using their own internal methods would not be feasible. This directly challenges the criticism.
B) The similarity of value systems between many non-Western societies is not directly relevant to the specific criticism being made. It doesn't address the issue of using Western methods vs. internal cultural perspectives.
C) The fact that some non-Western societies use their own value systems to study other cultures doesn't directly address the criticism that Western societies using Western methods prevents genuine understanding. It's a tangential point.
D) This is about understanding one's own culture through scientific investigation, which is not the issue being discussed in the criticism of the second version of multicultural education.
E) While this states that genuine understanding is necessary for appreciation, it doesn't challenge the criticism that using Western methods prevents such genuine understanding. It actually seems to align with the critics' perspective.
After analyzing each choice, A emerges as the strongest objection. If adopting the internal perspectives of another culture is impossible for outsiders, as A suggests, then the critics' argument that this is required for genuine understanding would be fundamentally undermined.
