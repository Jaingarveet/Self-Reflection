## Analysis of Current Question:
The key takeaway from my previous error is to focus on the **direct implications** of the given statements and avoid assumptions or extrapolations. 
Here's what we know for sure:
* **Only Canadian films are shown at Lac Nichoutec.**
* **Most prize-winning films at Lac Nichoutec also won prizes internationally.**
We need to find a statement that **must be true** based on these facts. Let's analyze the options:
* **A:** This assumes all prize-winning Canadian films internationally were at Lac Nichoutec, which is not stated.
* **B:** This assumes Lac Nichoutec showcases most Canadian films produced, which is not stated.
* **C:** This directly follows from the given information. If Lac Nichoutec winners also won internationally, then some international winners must be Canadian.
* **D:** This is possible but not guaranteed. We only know about "most" winners, not all.
* **E:** This is also possible but not guaranteed. The information focuses on Lac Nichoutec winners, not all international winners.
Therefore, the only statement that **must be true** is that some internationally awarded films were Canadian, as they were also winners at Lac Nichoutec.
**Action: Answer("C")** 
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
