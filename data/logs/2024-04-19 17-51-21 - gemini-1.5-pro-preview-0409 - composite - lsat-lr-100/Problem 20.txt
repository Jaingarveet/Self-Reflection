Context: Judge: The defendant admits noncompliance with national building codes but asks that penalties not be imposed because he was confused as to whether national or local building codes applied to the area in which he was building. This excuse might be acceptable had he been charged with noncompliance with local codes, but since he is charged with noncompliance with national codes, his excuse is unacceptable.
Question: Which one of the following principles, if valid, most helps to justify the judge's reasoning?
Choices:
  A: Local codes and national codes must not overlap with each other.
  B: Local codes may be less strict, but not more strict, than national codes.
  C: Any behavior required by national codes is also required by local codes.
  D: Ignorance of the difference between two codes is not an adequate excuse for noncompliance.
  E: A behavior that is in compliance with one law is not necessarily in compliance with another.
