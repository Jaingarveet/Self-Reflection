Context: Ethicist: Marital vows often contain the promise to love "until death do us part." If "love" here refers to a feeling, then this promise makes no sense, for feelings are not within one's control, and a promise to do something not within one's control makes no sense. Thus, no one—including those making marital vows—should take "love" in this context to be referring to feelings.
Question: The ethicist's conclusion follows logically if which one of the following is assumed?
Choices:
  A: None of our feelings are within our control.
  B: People should not make promises to do something that is not within their control.
  C: "Love" can legitimately be taken to refer to something other than feelings.
  D: Promises should not be interpreted in such a way that they make no sense.
  E: Promises that cannot be kept do not make any sense.

## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The ethicist argues that if "love" in marital vows refers to a feeling, then the promise to love "until death do us part" makes no sense. This is because feelings are not within one's control.
2. The ethicist then concludes that no one should take "love" in this context to be referring to feelings. 
3. For this conclusion to follow logically, there must be an unstated assumption. Let's look at each answer choice:
A) This is too broad. The argument doesn't require that none of our feelings are within our control, just that love (as a feeling) is not.
B) This is promising, as it directly supports the idea that one shouldn't promise what one can't control. But let's check the other options.
C) This could work as an assumption, but it's not necessary for the conclusion. Even if love can refer to something else, that doesn't mean it should in this context.
D) This looks correct. If we assume promises shouldn't be interpreted to make no sense, and interpreting "love" as a feeling makes the promise nonsensical, then we should not interpret "love" as a feeling in this promise.
E) This is similar to D, but a bit stronger. A promise could make sense even if it can't be kept (e.g., "I promise to try my best").
4. Therefore, the best answer is D. The ethicist's conclusion relies on the assumption that promises should not be interpreted in a way that makes them nonsensical.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
