## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I made a mistake in the calculation of the discriminant (b²-4ac) in the quadratic formula. I incorrectly calculated it as 12² - 4*3*6, when it should have been 12² - 4*3*2.
Error Keywords:
- Calculation error
- Discriminant error
- Quadratic formula error
Solution:
The given equation is a quadratic equation. The solutions to a quadratic equation $ax^{2}+bx+c=0$ are given by the formula $x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^{2}-4ac}}{2a}$.
Here, a=3, b=12, and c=6.
So, the solutions are $x=\frac{-12\pm\sqrt{12^{2}-4*3*6}}{2*3}$.
This simplifies to $x=-2\pm\frac{\sqrt{36}}{6}$, which further simplifies to $x=-2\pm\sqrt{2}$.
Instructions:
1. Identify the coefficients a, b, and c in the quadratic equation.
2. Substitute these values into the quadratic formula $x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^{2}-4ac}}{2a}$.
3. Calculate the discriminant (b²-4ac) carefully.
4. Simplify the expression under the square root.
5. Simplify the entire expression to find the solutions.
Advice:
- Always double-check your calculations, especially when calculating the discriminant in the quadratic formula.
- Be careful with signs when substituting values into the quadratic formula.
- Simplify the expression under the square root before proceeding with the rest of the calculation.
- Practice more problems involving the quadratic formula to become more comfortable with the process.
