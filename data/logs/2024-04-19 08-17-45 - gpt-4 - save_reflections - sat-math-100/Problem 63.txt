Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I subtracted the initial payment from the total price before setting up the equation. This led me to choose an incorrect equation. The correct approach is to include the initial payment in the equation.
Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation of problem
- Incorrect equation setup
- Arithmetic error
Solution:
The total price of the television is $300. This includes an initial payment of $60 and the remaining amount to be paid in weekly installments of $30. Therefore, the correct equation to find the number of weekly payments, w, is $300 = 60 + 30w.
Instructions:
1. Identify the total price of the item.
2. Identify the initial payment.
3. Identify the amount of the weekly payments.
4. Set up an equation where the total price is equal to the initial payment plus the product of the weekly payment and the number of weeks.
5. Choose the answer that matches your equation.
Advice:

- When setting up equations, consider all components of the problem.
- Be careful with arithmetic operations; ensure you are adding, subtracting, multiplying, or dividing as appropriate.
