Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I incorrectly eliminated the correct answer, new season, because I did not consider it an event. 
The gap in my knowledge was not in science but in the interpretation of the question.
I knew the correct frequency of high tide and new moon but did not consider new season an event.
Error Keywords:
 - Interpretation error
 - Definition error
 - Misunderstanding
Solution:
High tide occurs twice a day.
New moon occurs about every 29.5 days.
New season occurs about every 3 months.
A season change is an event that occurs every 3 months.

1. Read the question carefully and understand the problem.
2. Identify the events listed in the answer choices.
3. Eliminate the events that do not occur every 3 months.
4. Consider the remaining events as potential answers.
5. Determine if any of the remaining events occur every 3 months.

7. Double-check your answer to ensure accuracy.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
