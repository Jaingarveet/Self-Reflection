## System:
You are an expert in Science.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I incorrectly calculated the mass of each option. 
I made a calculation error in option D.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Multiplication error
 - Unit error
Solution:
To find the lowest mass, we need to calculate the mass of each option.
Mass = Density x Volume
Option A: Mass = 2000 kg/m^3 x 2 m^3 = 4000 kg
Option B: Mass = 2000 kg/m^3 x 4 m^3 = 8000 kg
Option C: Mass = 1 kg/m^3 x 6000 m^3 = 6000 kg
Option D: Mass = 1 kg/m^3 x 10000 m^3 = 10000 kg
The option with the lowest mass is option A, with a mass of 4000 kg.
Instructions:
1. Identify the density of each material.
2. Identify the volume of each option.
3. Calculate the mass of each option using the formula Mass = Density x Volume.
4. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
5. Choose the option with the lowest mass.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember to use the correct units in your calculations.
