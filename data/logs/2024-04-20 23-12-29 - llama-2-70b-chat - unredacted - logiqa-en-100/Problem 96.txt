## User 2:
Topic: Logic
Context: Based on the following questions? Most people think that advertisers do whatever they can to attract customers.But advertisers are not always like this.Recently, in order to expand sales, a family magazine called "Bay" was renamed "Inferno", which mainly published violent and pornographic content.As a result, some perennial advertisers from the original "Bay" magazine refused to renew the contract and turned to other publications.This shows that these advertisers not only consider economic benefits, but also take into account their ethical responsibilities.
Question: If the following item is true, can the argument be strengthened most?
Choices:
  A: The cost and selling price of "Inferno" are lower than that of "Harbour".
  B: The above advertisers who refused to renew their contracts have not affected the benefits after switching to other publications.
  C: Readers of family magazines are generally not interested in violent and pornographic content.
  D: Some clients who advertise in other family magazines and so on turn to "Inferno" magazine.

Action: Answer("D")

Explanation:
The correct answer is D, "Some clients who advertise in other family magazines and so on turn to 'Inferno' magazine."

This answer choice strengthens the argument by providing additional evidence that advertisers are not only focused on economic benefits, but also consider ethical responsibilities. The fact that some advertisers are willing to switch to a magazine with violent and pornographic content suggests that they are willing to compromise their ethical values for the sake of profit. This undermines the argument that advertisers are not always only focused on economic benefits and take ethical considerations into account.

Therefore, option D weakens the argument and is the correct answer.
