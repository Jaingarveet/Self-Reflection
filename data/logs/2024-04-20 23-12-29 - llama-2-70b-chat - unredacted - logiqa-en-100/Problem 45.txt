Context: The Amendment (Draft) of China's Personal Income Tax Law raises the deduction standard for salary income from the original 800 yuan / month to 1500 yuan / month; when the person's monthly income is less than 1500 yuan, no tax is required; After taxing the income after 1,500 yuan, an official commented that the starting point for personal income tax should not be too high, because taxation is also a citizen's right.If the starting point is too high, it will deprive low-income earners the honor of being the most taxpayers.
