Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Advice:
- Carefully interpret the relationships and implications between different statements. 
- Identify the absolute truths and contradictions within the problem. 
- Avoid making assumptions or drawing conclusions based on incomplete information. 
- Consider all provided statements and their potential correctness or falsity. 
- Remember that the relationships between statements can be complex and interdependent.
## Assistant 2:
Reflection: I made an incorrect assumption that Professor Sun's statement was correct, which led to the wrong answer. In fact, Professor Sun's statement is false, as it contradicts Professor Zhao's statement, which is definitely true (as it is possible for neither team to be the champion). Therefore, the correct answer is that we cannot determine the winner based on the information provided, as two of the statements are false and one is true, but it is unclear which team Professor Qian supported.

Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
