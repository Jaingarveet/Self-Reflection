## System:
You are an expert in Logic.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:
Topic: Geography
Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Logic
Context: Most people think that the thinking of scientists is based on strict logical reasoning, not on image thinking means such as analogy, intuition, and epiphany.However, research shows that Nobel Prize winners make more use of these image thinking methods than general scientists.Therefore, image thinking methods help to achieve major scientific breakthroughs.
Question: The above conclusion is based on which of the following assumptions?
Choices:
  A: Organized, step-by-step reasoning is essential for general scientific research.
  B: Nobel Prize winners have the ability to think creatively through analogy, intuition, and insight.
  C: Nobel winners have made major scientific breakthroughs.
  D: Nobel Prize winners are smarter and harder than ordinary scientists.
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Advice:
 - Focus on the core relationship between the context and the conclusion. 
 - Ensure you understand the underlying assumptions that connect the statements. 
 - Avoid overcomplicating the problem by focusing on peripheral or implied assumptions. 
 - Always read and interpret the question and choices carefully.
## Assistant 2:
Reflection: 
The correct answer is "C: Nobel winners have made major scientific breakthroughs."

The assumption here is that there is a causal link between image thinking and scientific breakthroughs; therefore, the statement "Nobel winners have made major scientific breakthroughs" is the underlying assumption that connects the context and the conclusion.

While the other statements may be true or implied, they are not essential to the argument's logic.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
