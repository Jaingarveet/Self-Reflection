 - Remember that family relationships can be complex and vary depending on individual circumstances. 
 - Take a systematic approach to identifying and counting unique individuals or roles to avoid double-counting or missing possibilities.
## Assistant 2:
Reflection: I made an incorrect assumption that the brother-in-law's father and the brother's mother-in-law were the same person. However, they are distinct individuals with different relationships to Mr. Chen. By considering the unique relationships and avoiding overlap, the correct answer can be determined.

Thought: 
Mr. Chen invited:
1. Father's brother-in-law (1 guest)
2. Brother-in-law's father (1 guest)
3. Brother's mother-in-law (1 guest)
4. Brother-in-law's brother (1 guest)

Each of these individuals has a unique relationship to Mr. Chen, so there are four guests invited in total.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
