You are an expert in Logic.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

## Assistant 1:

The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Logic
Context: There must be an outside world, because if there is something outside me that can shine or reflect, shining the light into my eyes, which gives me a visual experience, I ca nâ€™t see the buildings, the crowds and the stars these things.And, not only have visual experience like me, but others also have such visual experience; book knowledge also tells us repeatedly that there is an outside world outside of us.
Question: Which of the following does not constitute doubt or rebuttal to the above argument?
Choices:
  A: To use sensory evidence to explain the existence of the external world requires presupposing the existence of the external world in the mind.
  B: How do you prove that others have similar visual experience to you?
  C: Since the visual experience is reliable, Mirage is not a so-called illusion, but a real existence.
  D: If there is no external world and natural science knowledge is not a true reflection of it, then why does natural science achieve such great success in practice?
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Advice:
 - Always read and understand the argument and the question thoroughly.
 - Carefully interpret the specific requirements of the question, such as "doubt" or "rebuttal."
 - Consider all choices and evaluate them critically and independently.
 - Avoid narrow focus; consider the broader context and implications of the argument and choices.
 - Recognize that doubts or rebuttals should directly challenge or question the argument's core claims or evidence.
## Assistant 2:
Reflection: I made a mistake by not interpreting the question accurately. I focused too narrowly on the first part of the argument, which mentioned sensory evidence, and chose an answer related to that. However, the argument also includes the mention of 'others' having similar experiences and the success of natural science, which are crucial to the broader context. The correct answer should consider the argument's entirety and identify a choice that doesn't cast doubt on the conclusion.

Thought: 
The argument concludes that there must be an outside world based on visual experiences, shared experiences of others, and the success of natural science.
Choice A questions the validity of using sensory evidence by claiming it presupposes the existence of the external world, which is a doubt against the argument.
Choice B questions how it can be proven that others have similar visual experiences, directly challenging the argument's claim.
Choice C asserts that mirages are real and not illusions, which doesn't address the argument's main point and fails to acknowledge the argument's conclusion.
Choice D raises a valid point about the success of natural science, which supports the argument's conclusion. It doesn't constitute doubt or rebuttal as it doesn't challenge the argument's core claims.

Therefore, the correct answer is C.

Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
