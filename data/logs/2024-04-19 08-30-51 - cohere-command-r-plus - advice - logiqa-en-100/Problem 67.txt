Topic: Logic
Context: Since the emperor, the official history of China has been the diary of the emperor â€™s own family.That is the standard image of the emperor.To understand the true face of the emperor, one must also read Ye Shi, which is a portrayal of the emperor's life.
Question: Which of the following statements is the assumption upon which the above argument relies?
Choices:
  A: All the official history records are personal matters of the emperor's family.
  B: Only by reading wild history can you know the little-known privacy of the emperor.
  C: Only by combining Zhengshi and Yeshi can we see the true face of the emperor.
  D: The official history records the emperor's major affairs, while the wild history describes the emperor's daily affairs.

## Assistant 2:
Reflection: I incorrectly chose answer choice "D" previously. Upon reflection, I realize that the correct answer is "C" because it completes the gap in the argument's logic. The argument concludes that reading Ye Shi is necessary to understand the emperor fully, and assumption C supports this by asserting that only through combining official and wild histories can we see the emperor's true face.

Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
