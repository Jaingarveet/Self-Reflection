## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I made an incorrect assumption about the number of sales representatives that could be in Zone 3.
The gap in my knowledge was not in the law but in logical reasoning.
I did not consider all the possible scenarios and made an assumption based on incomplete information.
Error Keywords:
 - Incorrect assumption
 - Incomplete information
 - Logical reasoning error
Solution:
Since Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other, they cannot be in Zone 2 because Tiao cannot work in Zone 2.
Since Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other, they cannot be in Zone 1 because Parra cannot work in Zone 1.
Since there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, and Parra and Quinn cannot be in Zone 2, they must be in Zone 3.
Since Stuckey and Udall cannot be in Zone 1, and there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, they must also be in Zone 3.
Therefore, the complete and accurate list of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 is Kim and Mahr.
Instructions:
1. Identify the conditions that apply to each sales representative.
2. Identify the conditions that apply to each sales zone.
3. Consider all possible scenarios based on the given conditions.
4. Eliminate scenarios that violate any of the given conditions.
5. Identify the scenario that satisfies all the given conditions.
6. Work step-by-step through your logical reasoning.
7. Double-check your reasoning to ensure accuracy.
8. Choose the answer that matches your identified scenario.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never make assumptions based on incomplete information.
 - Always consider all possible scenarios based on the given conditions.
 - Always eliminate scenarios that violate any of the given conditions.
 - Always double-check your reasoning and final answer.
 - Remember that logical reasoning is a critical skill in law.
