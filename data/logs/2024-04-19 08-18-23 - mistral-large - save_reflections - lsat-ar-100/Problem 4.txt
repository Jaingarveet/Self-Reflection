## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I made an incorrect assumption about the constraints of the problem.
The gap in my knowledge was not in law but in logical reasoning.
I misinterpreted the constraint that "Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day" to mean that they must lead sessions on the same day of the week, rather than the same day of the lab schedule.
I also overlooked the constraint that "Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's."

Error Keywords:
- Incorrect assumption
- Misinterpretation of constraints
- Overlooking constraints

Solution:
Since Lan does not lead a Wednesday session, he must lead a session on Thursday or Friday.
However, since Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day, Olivia must lead a session on Wednesday.
This means that Julio must lead a session on Monday or Tuesday, since his session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
Since Nessa must lead an afternoon session, she cannot lead a session on Wednesday morning, which means that either Kevin or Rebecca must lead that session.
Since Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day, they cannot both lead sessions on Wednesday.
Therefore, one of them must lead a session on Thursday.
Since Lan must lead a session on Thursday or Friday, and he cannot lead a session on the same day as Olivia, he must lead a session on Thursday.
However, since Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day, and Rebecca cannot lead a session on Wednesday since Nessa must lead an afternoon session on that day, Kevin must lead a session on Thursday.
Therefore, the lab assistant who must lead a Thursday session is Kevin.

Instructions:
1. Identify the constraints of the problem.
2. Determine which lab assistant cannot lead a session on Wednesday.
3. Determine which lab assistant must lead a session on Wednesday.
4. Determine which lab assistant must lead a session on an earlier day of the week than another lab assistant.
5. Determine which lab assistant must lead an afternoon session.
6. Determine which lab assistants must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
7. Determine which lab assistant must lead a session on Thursday.
8. Work step-by-step through the constraints to determine the correct answer.
9. Double-check your reasoning to ensure accuracy.
10. Choose the answer that matches your reasoning.

Advice:
- Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
- Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
- Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
- Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
- Always double-check your reasoning and final answer.
- Remember that constraints may refer to the same day of the week or the same day of the lab schedule.
- Remember to consider all constraints when determining the correct answer.
