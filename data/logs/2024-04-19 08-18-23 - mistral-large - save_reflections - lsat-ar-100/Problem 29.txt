## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I made an incorrect assumption about the placement of the books.
The gap in my knowledge was not in law but in logical reasoning.
I misinterpreted the condition that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf to mean that the bottom shelf must have at least 3 books.
I also overlooked the condition that F is placed on the same shelf as M.
Error Keywords:
 - Incorrect assumption
 - Misinterpretation
 - Overlooked condition
Solution:
We know that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, so the bottom shelf must have at least 3 books. Since at least two books are placed on each shelf, the top shelf must have exactly 2 books.
We also know that I is placed on the middle shelf, so the middle shelf must have at least 2 books as well.
Since L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, L cannot be on the bottom shelf. Therefore, L must be on the top shelf.
Since O is placed on a higher shelf than L, O must be on the top shelf as well.
Since F is placed on the same shelf as M, they cannot be on the top shelf because it already has two books (L and O). Therefore, F and M must be on the middle shelf with I.
Since K is placed on a higher shelf than F, K must be on the top shelf.
Therefore, the top shelf has L, O, and K; the middle shelf has I, F, and M; and the bottom shelf has G and H.
Since H and M are placed on the same shelf as each other, the correct answer is C.
Instructions:
1. Identify the conditions that must apply to the placement of the books.
2. Determine the minimum number of books that must be placed on each shelf.
3. Use the given conditions to determine the possible placement of each book.
4. Consider all possible combinations of book placements that satisfy the given conditions.
5. Eliminate any combinations that violate the given conditions.
6. Choose the answer that must be true based on the remaining combinations.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never make assumptions that are not supported by the given conditions.
 - Always double-check your reasoning and final answer.
 - Remember that logical reasoning is a critical skill in law and many other fields.
