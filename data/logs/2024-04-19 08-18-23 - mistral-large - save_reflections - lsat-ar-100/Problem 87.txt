Explanation:
I misinterpreted the requirements for the selection of works.
The gap in my knowledge was in understanding the constraints of the problem.
I incorrectly assumed that if the organizer selected only one French novel, then at least one French play must be selected.
However, the organizer can select two French novels to meet the requirement of selecting at least as many French novels as Russian novels.

Error Keywords:
 - Misinterpretation of requirements
 - Incorrect assumption
 - Constraint misunderstanding

Solution:
The organizer must select at least three novels, and at least as many French novels as Russian novels.
Therefore, the organizer must select at least two French novels to meet the requirement of selecting at least as many French novels as Russian novels.
The organizer can select at most four French works, and if both French plays are selected, then the Russian play is not selected.
Therefore, the organizer cannot select both French plays.
The organizer must select at least five works, so if only two French novels are selected, then at least one Russian novel must be selected.

Instructions:
1. Identify the minimum and maximum number of works that the organizer must select.
2. Identify the constraints for the selection of French works and novels.
3. Identify the constraints for the selection of Russian works and novels.
4. Identify the constraints for the selection of plays.
5. Consider all possible combinations of works that meet the constraints.
6. Eliminate any combinations that violate the constraints.
7. Choose the answer that meets all the constraints.

Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never make assumptions without verifying them against the problem constraints.
 - Always double-check your reasoning and final answer against the problem constraints.
 - Remember that the constraints of the problem must be satisfied simultaneously.
