Explanation:
I made an incorrect assumption about the relationship between the website and voicemail targets for Image.
The gap in my knowledge was not in the law but in logical reasoning.
I knew the correct conditions but made an incorrect inference.
Error Keywords:
 - Incorrect assumption
 - Logical reasoning error
 - Inference error
Solution:
Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target.
Truvest's website target can be either 1 day or 2 days.
Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
Solide's website target can be 1 day.
Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
Image's voicemail target can be 1 day or 2 days.
None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
Image's website target can be 1 day.
Since Solide's website target can be 1 day, and none of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target, Solide's voicemail target must be 1 day or 2 days.
Since Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets, Image's voicemail target must be 1 day.
Since Image's voicemail target is 1 day, and none of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target, Image's website target must be 1 day.
Since Solide's website target can be 1 day, and Image's website target is 1 day, Solide's website target must be 1 day.
