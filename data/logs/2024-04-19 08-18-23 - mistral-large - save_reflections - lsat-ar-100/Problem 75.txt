## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I made an incorrect assumption about the number of plays Megregian reviews.
The gap in my knowledge was not in the law but in logical reasoning.
I knew the conditions but made an incorrect inference.
Error Keywords:
 - Incorrect assumption
 - Logical reasoning error
 - Inference error
Solution:
Since Kramer and Lopez each review fewer plays than Megregian, Megregian must review at least two plays.
Since neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews, Jiang must review only one play, which cannot be Tamerlane since Kramer and O'Neill both review it. Therefore, Jiang must review only Sunset.
Since exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other, and Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, Lopez must review only one play, which cannot be Tamerlane or Sunset. Therefore, Lopez must review only Undulation.
The only student who could review only Sunset is Lopez.
Instructions:
1. Identify the conditions given in the problem.
2. Use logical reasoning to infer the possible plays each student could review.
3. Eliminate the plays that cannot be reviewed by a student based on the conditions.
4. Identify the student who could review only Sunset based on the conditions.
5. Work step-by-step through your logical reasoning.
6. Double-check your inferences to ensure accuracy.
7. Choose the answer that matches your inferred result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never make assumptions; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your inferences and final answer.
 - Remember that logical reasoning is essential in solving law problems.
