## Get Reflection:
  Action: Answer("D")

Explanation:
The correct answer is D, "Some clients who advertise in other family magazines and so on turn to 'Inferno' magazine."

This answer choice strengthens the argument by providing additional evidence that advertisers are not only focused on economic benefits, but also consider ethical responsibilities. The fact that some advertisers are willing to switch to a magazine with violent and pornographic content suggests that they are willing to compromise their ethical values for the sake of profit. This undermines the argument that advertisers are not always only focused on economic benefits and take ethical considerations into account.

Therefore, option D weakens the argument and is the correct answer.
