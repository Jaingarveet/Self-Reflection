## Get Reflection:
  Action: Answer("B")

Explanation:

The correct answer is B: There are groups of real estate speculators among the wealthy Chinese who have speculated in Beijing and Shanghai.

This answer choice weakens the argument that wealthy Chinese people are transferring their assets abroad by suggesting that at least some wealthy Chinese people are investing in real estate within China. This implies that the increase in Chinese buyers of US real estate may not be solely due to wealthy Chinese people transferring their assets abroad.

Option A, Although the turnover has increased by 23%, the volume of Chinese buyers has not increased this year, does not provide any evidence against the idea that wealthy Chinese people are transferring their assets abroad.

Option D, The risk of the US real estate market has been small in recent years and has a certain function of value preservation and appreciation, also does not provide any evidence against the idea that wealthy Chinese people are transferring their assets abroad.

Therefore, option B is the best answer.
