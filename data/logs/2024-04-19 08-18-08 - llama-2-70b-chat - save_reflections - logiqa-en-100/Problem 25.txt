Solution:
From (1), we know that Prince Lima is tall, handsome, and a doctor.
From (2), we know that Wang Wei and Wu Gang are both doctors.
From (3), we know that Liu Dawei and Li Qiang are the same height.
From (4), we know that Li Qiang and Wang Wei are not both tall.

We can deduce that Li Qiang is not tall, and Wang Wei is tall.
Wu Gang is a doctor, and we know that he is tall because Liu Dawei and Li Qiang are the same height, and Liu Dawei is not a doctor.
Therefore, Wu Gang meets all of Li Na's requirements.
