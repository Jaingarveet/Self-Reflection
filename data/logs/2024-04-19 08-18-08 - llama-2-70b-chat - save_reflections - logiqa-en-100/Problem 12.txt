## Get Reflection:
  Action: Answer("C")

The conclusion that image thinking methods help to achieve major scientific breakthroughs is based on the assumption that Nobel Prize winners, who have made significant scientific contributions, use these methods more frequently than other scientists. This assumption is stated in choice C: Nobel winners have made major scientific breakthroughs.

The other choices do not accurately reflect the assumption made in the argument. Choice A, organized, step-by-step reasoning is essential for general scientific research, does not relate to the argument's focus on image thinking methods. Choice B, Nobel Prize winners have the ability to think creatively through analogy, intuition, and insight, is a premise of the argument but does not explain why they were successful. Choice D, Nobel Prize winners are smarter and harder than ordinary scientists, is not supported by the argument and could be considered a subjective opinion.

Therefore, the correct answer is C: Nobel winners have made major scientific breakthroughs.
