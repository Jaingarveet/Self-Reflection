## Get Reflection:
  Action: Answer("C")

Explanation:
The statement that raises the most doubts about the experts' opinion is option C: Xinjiang salamander is a kind of animal that is afraid of light. Most of them hide under the rocks of the creek during the day and avoid the trampling of cattle and sheep.

This statement suggests that the northern salamander is not active during the day and hides under rocks, which means that cattle and sheep trampling would not be a significant factor in their decline. This raises doubts about the experts' opinion that the habitat of the northern salamander in Xinjiang was originally a local pasture, and the cattle and sheep walking around on the grassland in summer will trample them to death, resulting in a sharp decline in their numbers.

Therefore, option C is the correct answer.
