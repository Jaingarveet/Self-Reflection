Explanation:
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The total number of small cubes is  (5-2)^3 = 27
The number of cubes with 0 faces painted is (3-2)^3 = 1
The number of cubes with 1 face painted is  6 * (3-2)^2 = 6
The number of cubes with 2 faces painted is 12 * (3-2) = 12 
The number of cubes with 3 faces painted is 8
So, the number of cubes with 0 faces painted is 27 - (1+6+12+8) = 0
Action: Answer("A") 
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
