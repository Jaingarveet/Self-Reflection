## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:
Topic: Geography
Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: Points A, B, C, D lie in this order on the circumference of a circle. Minor arc AC is 160°, and minor arc BD is 150°. If B bisects minor arc AC, then what is the measure of minor arc AD?
Choices:
  A: 80°
  B: 130°
  C: 140°
  D: 160°
  E: 220°
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I misinterpreted the meaning of "[REDACTED] bisects minor arc A[REDACTED]." I incorrectly assumed it meant [REDACTED] was the midpoint of arc A[REDACTED], dividing it into two equal arcs. However, it actually means that line segment A[REDACTED] bisects the angle formed by arc A[REDACTED], not necessarily dividing the arc length equally.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Since B bisects minor arc AC, and the measure of arc AC is 160°, then the measures of arcs AB and BC are each 80°. 
The measure of arc ABD is the sum of arcs AB and BD, which is 80° + 150° = 230°.
Since a full circle is 360°, the measure of minor arc AD is 360° - 230° = 130°.
Action: Answer("B") 
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
