Explanation:
I made a rounding error when calculating the required profit per unit. I rounded $124.2857... down to $124.29, leading to an incorrect minimum selling price.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The company needs a yearly profit of $626,400, which means a monthly profit of $626,400 / 12 = $52,200.
To achieve this, they need a profit per unit of $52,200 / 420 = $124.2857...
Therefore, the minimum selling price should be the production cost + required profit per unit, which is $110 + $124.2857... = $234.2857...
Rounding up to the nearest dollar to guarantee the profit, the minimum selling price should be $235.
Action: Answer("C") 
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
