Explanation:
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The original ratio of boys to girls is 64:40, which simplifies to 8:5. 
We need to find the number of new members that joined, keeping the ratio 4:3.
Let x be the number of new members (boys and girls) who joined.
The new ratio is (64+x):(40+x) = 4:3
Solving for x: 3(64+x) = 4(40+x)
192 + 3x = 160 + 4x
x = 32
Therefore, 32 boys and 32 girls joined.
The total number of members now is 64+40+32+32 = 168
Action: Answer("E")
