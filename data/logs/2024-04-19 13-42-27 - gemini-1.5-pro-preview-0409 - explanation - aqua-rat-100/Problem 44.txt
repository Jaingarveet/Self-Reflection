Explanation:
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The relationship between workdays and manpower is inverse: fewer days require more men. 
We can set up a proportion: 8 men / x men = 1/2 day / 6 days.
Solving for x, we get x = 8 men * 6 days / (1/2 day) = 96 men.
Action: Answer("D") 
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
