## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Explanation:
My initial approach was correct in calculating the probability of neither event occurring under the assumption of independence. However, I misinterpreted the question's intent in seeking the "greatest value" for this probability. I incorrectly assumed perfect negative correlation, leading to the choice of the higher individual probability. The error lies in overlooking the constraint that the probability of neither event occurring cannot exceed the individual probabilities of each event not occurring.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The probability of neither event occurring is maximized when the events are perfectly negatively correlated, meaning if one occurs, the other cannot. In this case, the probability is limited by the smaller individual probability of an event not occurring. 
Action: Answer("B") 
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
