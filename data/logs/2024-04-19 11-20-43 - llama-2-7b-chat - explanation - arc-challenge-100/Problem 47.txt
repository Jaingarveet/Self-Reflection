## System:
You are an expert in Science.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Science
Question: A ship leaks a large amount of oil near a coastal area. Which statement describes how the oil most likely will affect the coastal habitat?
Choices:
  A: Fish reproduction rates will increase.
  B: Water birds will be unable to use their wings.
  C: Water plants will be exposed to more sunlight.
  D: Coastal plants will have access to more nutrients.
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I incorrectly selected answer "[REDACTED]" as the correct response. The correct answer is actually "[REDACTED]".

The oil spill will likely have a negative impact on the coastal habitat, including:

* Harming or killing marine life, including fish, birds, and other organisms that depend on the coastal ecosystem.
* Coating or smothering plants and habitats, reducing their ability to photosynthesize and providing shelter for marine life.
* Altering the water's chemistry, reducing the amount of oxygen available and affecting the overall health of the ecosystem.

The other options are not accurate descriptions of how the oil spill will affect the coastal habitat:

* Option "[REDACTED]" is incorrect because oil spills can actually have a negative impact on fish reproduction rates, rather than increasing them.
* Option "[REDACTED]" is incorrect because oil spills can reduce the amount of sunlight reaching water plants, rather than exposing them to more sunlight.
* Option "[REDACTED]" is incorrect because coastal plants may not have access to more nutrients as a result of an oil spill.
