## System:
You are an expert in Science.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:
Topic: Geography
Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Science
Question: When moist air comes in contact with a cold surface in the winter, one result can be frost. What has happened to the water vapor in the air to cause frost?
Choices:
  A: It has melted.
  B: It has sublimated.
  C: It has evaporated.
  D: It has condensed.
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I correctly identified the answer as "[REDACTED]" - "[REDACTED]"

The correct explanation is:
When moist air comes in contact with a cold surface in the winter, the water vapor in the air can sublimate, meaning it changes directly from a liquid to a gas without going through the solid phase (i.e., ice). This process is known as sublimation, and it is the reason why frost forms on cold surfaces in winter.

So, the correct answer is "[REDACTED]" - "[REDACTED]"
## Assistant 2:
  Thought: 
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand now that frost forms when moist air comes in contact with a cold surface in the winter because the water vapor in the air sublimates.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
