## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The argument is that more and more rich people in China are transferring their property abroad, as evidenced by the increase in transaction volume of US real estate purchased by mainland Chinese buyers.
The best argument against this would be one that shows that the increase in transaction volume is not necessarily due to an increase in the number of wealthy Chinese buyers.
Choice A states that the volume of Chinese buyers has not increased this year, which directly contradicts the argument.
Choice C is not relevant to the argument, as it discusses real estate speculation within China.
Choice D provides a possible reason for the increase in transaction volume, but it does not necessarily contradict the argument.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
