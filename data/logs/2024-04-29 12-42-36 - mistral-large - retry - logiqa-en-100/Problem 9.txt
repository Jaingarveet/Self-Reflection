## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The printing group consists of F, H, L, and M, and the binding group consists of G, H, and J.
Condition (1) is met since both groups have at least 3 employees.
Condition (2) is met since F and K are not in the same group.
Condition (3) is met since K is not in any group, so J does not have to be in the same group as K.
Condition (4) is met since M is in the printing group.
Condition (5) is met since H is in both groups.
If K replaces F, then condition (2) will be violated since F and K will be in the same group.
If K replaces G, then condition (3) will be violated since K will be in the binding group without J.
If K replaces H, then condition (5) will be violated since H is the only common member between the two groups.
If K replaces L, then none of the conditions will be violated.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
