## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Condition (1) states that H and Y must be allocated in the same department.
Condition (2) states that F and G cannot be allocated in the same department.
Condition (3) states that if X is allocated in the sales department, W is allocated in the production department.
Condition (4) states that F must be allocated in the production department.

From condition (4), we know that F must be allocated in the production department.
Since F is in the production department, G cannot be in the production department due to condition (2).
Therefore, G must be in the sales department.

Since F is in the production department, there are two more spots left in the production department.
From condition (1), H and Y must be allocated in the same department.
If H and Y are allocated in the production department, then the production department would be full, and there would be no spot left for W if X is allocated in the sales department (condition 3).
Therefore, H and Y cannot be allocated in the production department.
They must be allocated in the public relations department.

If X is allocated in the sales department, then W must be allocated in the production department (condition 3).
Since F is already in the production department, the remaining spot in the production department must be filled by I.
Therefore, the production department would consist of F, W, and I.

If X is not allocated in the sales department, then W can be allocated in any department.
However, since H and Y are already in the public relations department, W cannot be allocated there.
If W is allocated in the production department, then the remaining spot in the production department must be filled by I.
Therefore, the production department would consist of F, W, and I.

In either case, the production department consists of F, W, and I.
Since H and Y are in the public relations department, the remaining spot in the public relations department must be filled by X.
Therefore, the public relations department consists of H, Y, and X.

Since G is in the sales department, the remaining spots in the sales department must be filled by I and W (if W is not in the production department).
However, W is already in the production department.
Therefore, the sales department consists of G, I, and another employee who cannot be F, G, H, Y, or W.
The only remaining employee is I.

Therefore, the final distribution of these 7 employees is:
Public Relations Department: H, Y, X
Production Department: F, W, I
Sales Department: G, I (this is a mistake, I cannot be in two departments)

Since I cannot be in two departments, the correct answer must be:
Public Relations Department: H, Y, X
Production Department: F, W, I
Sales Department: G, [REDACTED]

The only choice that matches this distribution is:
D: Public Relations Department? X; Production Department? F, I, W; Sales Department? G, H, Y

However, this choice is still incorrect because H and Y are not in the same department.
Therefore, I must have made a mistake in my reasoning.

Let's go back to the point where I allocated W to the production department.
If W is allocated to the production department, then X cannot be allocated to the sales department because there would be no spot left for W in the production department (condition 3).
Therefore, X must be allocated to the public relations department.

If X is allocated to the public relations department, then the remaining spot in the public relations department must be filled by W.
Therefore, the public relations department consists of H, Y, and W.

Since F is in the production department, the remaining spots in the production department must be filled by G and I.
However, G cannot be in the production department because of condition (2).
Therefore, the production department consists of F, H, and Y (since H and Y must be in the same department).

Since G is not in the production department, G must be in the sales department.
The remaining spots in the sales department must be filled by I and W (if W is not in the public relations department).
However, W is already in the public relations department.
Therefore, the sales department consists of G, I, and another employee who cannot be F, G, H, Y, or W.
The only remaining employee is X.

Therefore, the final distribution of these 7 employees is:
Public Relations Department: H, Y, W
Production Department: F, H, Y
Sales Department: G, I, X

The only choice that matches this distribution is:
A: Public Relations Department? W; Production Department? F, H, Y; Sales Department? G, I, X
