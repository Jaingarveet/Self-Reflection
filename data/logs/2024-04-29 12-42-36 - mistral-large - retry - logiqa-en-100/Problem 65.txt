Context: A survey of traffic accidents has found that the incidence of traffic accidents is actually similar in cities where drunk driving is strictly investigated and those who do not.However, most experts believe that strict investigation of drunk driving can indeed reduce the occurrence of traffic accidents.
Question: Which of the following is most helpful in eliminating this inconsistency?
Choices:
  A: Severe investigations of drunk driving have occurred in urban traffic accidents.
  B: The city that implements strict investigation of drunk driving has not eliminated drunk driving.
  C: It is more important to improve drivers' traffic safety awareness than strict management.
  D: In addition to strict investigation of drunk driving, other traffic violations should also be stopped.

## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The inconsistency lies in the fact that the incidence of traffic accidents is similar in cities with strict investigation of drunk driving and those without, despite the belief that strict investigation can reduce accidents.
To eliminate this inconsistency, we need to consider other factors that might contribute to traffic accidents.
Choice D suggests that other traffic violations should also be stopped, implying that there might be other causes of accidents besides drunk driving.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
