## System:
You are an expert in Logic.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")

Context: In a study, 51 middle school student volunteers were divided into a test group and a control group to receive the same mathematics training.During the five-day training, the researchers used a technique called transcranial random noise stimulation to lightly shock the areas of the brains of 25 test group members that were considered to be related to computing power.The subsequent test results showed that the mathematics ability of the test group members was significantly higher than that of the control group members.To their surprise, the effect of this ability improvement can last at least half a year.The researchers therefore believe that micro-shocks in the brain can improve the brain's computing power.
Question: Which of the following, if true, best supports the above researchers â€™views?
Choices:
  A: This non-invasive stimulus is inexpensive and will not cause any pain to the human body
  B: After a slight electric shock to the brain, the blood flow between the neurons in the brain is significantly enhanced, but it returns to normal after multiple stimulations
  C: Before the experiment, the mathematics scores of the two groups of students were almost the same
  D: Subjects with microshocks in the brain are more concerned about their behavior, and their concentration is more focused during the test

## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The researchers' view is that micro-shocks in the brain can improve the brain's computing power, as evidenced by the improved mathematics ability of the test group members who received the shocks.
To support this view, we need to find a choice that explains why the micro-shocks might have improved the test group's mathematics ability.
Choice A is not relevant to the researchers' view, as it only discusses the cost and painlessness of the stimulus.
Choice B discusses the effect of the electric shock on blood flow between neurons, but it does not explain why this would improve computing power.
Choice C only discusses the pre-experiment mathematics scores of the two groups, which does not support the researchers' view about the effect of the micro-shocks.
Choice D discusses the effect of the micro-shocks on the subjects' behavior and concentration during the test, which could potentially explain why their mathematics ability improved.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
