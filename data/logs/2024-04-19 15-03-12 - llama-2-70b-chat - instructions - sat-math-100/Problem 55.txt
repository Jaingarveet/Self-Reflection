# Model: llama-2-70b-chat | Agent: instructions | Exam: sat-math-100 | Problem 55 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:
Topic: Geography
Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: $$y=-(x-3)^{2}+a$$In the equation above, $a$ is a constant. The graph of the equation in the $x y$-plane is a parabola. Which of the following is true about the parabola?
Choices:
  A: Its minimum occurs at $(-3, a)$.
  B: Its minimum occurs at $(3, a)$.
  C: Its maximum occurs at $(-3, a)$.
  D: Its maximum occurs at $(3, a)$.
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Identify the equation in the form $y = a x^2 + b x + c$.
2. Determine the nature of the parabola (opens upwards or downwards).
3. Identify the minimum value of $y$ and its corresponding $x$-coordinate.
4. Check your answer by plugging in the $x$-coordinate into the equation.

Self-Reflection:
Previously, I answered this question incorrectly by selecting choice A.
Upon reflection, I realized that the minimum value of $y$ occurs when $x = 3$, not $-3$.
The correct answer is choice B.

Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
