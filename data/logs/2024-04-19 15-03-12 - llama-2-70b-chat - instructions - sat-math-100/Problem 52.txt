Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Read the question carefully and understand the variables.
Katarina is a botanist studying the production of pears by two types of pear trees. She noticed that Type A trees produced 20 percent more pears than Type B trees did.

Variables:

* Type A trees
* Type B trees
* pears

2. Use the correct variables in your calculation.
We know that Type A trees produced 20% more pears than Type B trees. So, if Type B trees produced x pears, Type A trees produced x + (20% of x) pears.

We are given that Type A trees produced 144 pears. So, we can set up the equation:

x + (20% of x) = 144

3. Check your calculation to ensure accuracy.
First, let's calculate 20% of x:

20% of x = 0.2x

Now, we can substitute this into the equation:

x + 0.2x = 144

Combine like terms:

1.2x = 144

Divide both sides by 1.2:

x = 120

4. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
The answer is B: 120.

Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
