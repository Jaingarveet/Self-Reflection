## Assistant 2:
  Sure, I'll be happy to help! Here's how to solve the problem:

[REDACTED]. Substitute the given value of $x$ into the equation:
$$\sqrt{k+2}-9=0$$
2. Add $9$ to both sides of the equation:
$$\sqrt{k+2}=9+9$$
3. Square root both sides of the equation:
$$k+2=16$$
4. Subtract $2$ from both sides of the equation:
$$k=14$$
5. Solve for $k$.

Action: Answer("C")
