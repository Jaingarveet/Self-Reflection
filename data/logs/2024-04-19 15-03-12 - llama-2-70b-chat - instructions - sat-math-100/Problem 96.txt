Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:

1. Read the question carefully and understand the problem.
2. Let's call the original length and width of the rectangle $L$ and $W$, respectively.
3. The area of the original rectangle is $[REDACTED] = LW$.
4. After the alterations, the length is $L + 10\%$ of $L$ = $1.1L$ and the width is $W - p\%$ of $W$ = $0.9W$.
5. The area of the modified rectangle is $A' = (1.1L)(0.9W) = 0.99LW$.
6. The question states that the area of the modified rectangle is [REDACTED]% less than the area of the original rectangle, so we can set up the equation:

$0.99LW = 0.88L^2$

7. Now, we can solve for $p$. We know that $L$ and $W$ are positive, so we can divide both sides of the equation by $LW$ to get:

$0.99 = 0.88\frac{L^2}{LW}$

$1 = 0.88\frac{L}{W}$

$W = 0.88L$

8. Now, we can substitute this expression for $W$ into the equation for the area of the modified rectangle:

$A' = (1.1L)(0.88L) = 0.99L^2$

9. We know that the area of the modified rectangle is [REDACTED]% less than the area of the original rectangle, so we can set up the equation:

$0.99L^2 = 0.88A$

10. Now, we can solve for $L$:

$L = \sqrt{\frac{0.88A}{0.99}} = \sqrt{\frac{A}{1.1}}$

11. Now, we can substitute this expression for $L$ into the equation for $W$:

$W = 0.88L = 0.88\sqrt{\frac{A}{1.1}}$

[REDACTED]. Now, we can find $p$ by substituting $W$ into the equation for $A'$:

$A' = (1.1L)(0.88\sqrt{\frac{A}{1.1}}) = 0.99L^2$

$0.99L^2 = 0.88A$

$L^2 = \frac{0.88A}{0.99}$

$L = \sqrt{\frac{0.88A}{0.99}}$

$W = 0.88L = 0.88\sqrt{\frac{0.88A}{0.99}}$

$p = \frac{W}{L} = \frac{0.88\sqrt{\frac{0.88A}{0.99}}}{\sqrt{\frac{0.88A}{0.99}}} = 0.88$

Therefore, the value of $p$ is $0.88$, which corresponds to choice $B$.
