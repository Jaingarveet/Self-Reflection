# Model: llama-2-70b-chat | Agent: instructions | Exam: sat-math-100 | Problem 80 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:
Topic: Geography
Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: $$\begin{aligned}& k x-3 y=4 \\& 4 x-5 y=7\end{aligned}$$In the system of equations above, $k$ is a constant and $x$ and $y$ are variables. For what value of $k$ will the system of equations have no solution?
Choices:
  A: $\frac{12}{5}$
  B: $\frac{16}{7}$
  C: $-\frac{16}{7}$
  D: $-\frac{12}{5}$
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:

1. Set the two equations equal to each other.
2. Subtract $4x$ from both sides.
3. Solve for $k$.
## Assistant 2:
  Sure! Here's how I would answer the question:

Action: Answer("B")

Reflection:
Previously, I answered this question incorrectly. After reflecting on the problem, my solution, and the correct answer, I realized that I made a mistake in step 3 of my solution. Specifically, I incorrectly solved for $k$.

To solve for $k$, I should have set the two equations equal to each other, subtracted $4x$ from both sides, and then solved for $k$. This would have given me the correct solution of $k = \frac{16}{7}$.

Therefore, the correct answer is B: $\frac{16}{7}$.
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
