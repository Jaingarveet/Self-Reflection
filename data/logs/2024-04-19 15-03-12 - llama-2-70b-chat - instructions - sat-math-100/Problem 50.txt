## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Question: \begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}\cline { 2 - 3 }\multicolumn{1}{c|}{} & \multicolumn{2}{c|}{Handedness} \\\hlineGender & Left & Right \\\hline\hlineFemale &  &  \\\hlineMale &  &  \\\hline\hlineTotal & 18 & 122 \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}The incomplete table above summarizes the number of left-handed students and right-handed students by gender for the eighth-grade students atKeisel Middle School. There are 5 times as many right-handed female students as there are left-handed female students, and there are 9 times as many right-handed male students as there are left-handed male students. If there is a total of 18 left-handed students and 122 right-handed students in the school, which of the following is closest to the probability that a right-handed student selected at random is female? (Note: Assume that none of the eighth-grade students are both right-handed and left-handed.)
Choices:
  A: 0.410
  B: 0.357
  C: 0.333
  D: 0.250

## Assistant 2:
  My previous answer was incorrect because I made a mistake in my calculations. I misunderstood the information given in the problem and wrote down the wrong equations.

Let's start by analyzing the given information:

* There are 5 times as many right-handed female students as there are left-handed female students.
* There are 9 times as many right-handed male students as there are left-handed male students.
* There are 18 left-handed students and 122 right-handed students in total.

Now, let's identify the variables:

* Number of left-handed female students: LF
* Number of right-handed female students: RF
* Number of left-handed male students: LM
* Number of right-handed male students: RM

We can write down the following equations based on the given information:

* LF + RF = 18 (total number of left-handed students)
* LM + RM = 122 (total number of right-handed students)
* RF = 5LF (number of right-handed female students is 5 times the number of left-handed female students)
* RM = 9LM (number of right-handed male students is 9 times the number of left-handed male students)

Now, we can solve the system of equations. We know that LF + RF = 18 and LM + RM = 122. Substituting RF = 5LF and RM = 9LM, we get:

LF + 5LF = 18
LM + 9LM = 122

Simplifying, we get:

6LF = 18
10LM = 122

Now, we can solve for LF and LM:

LF = 3
LM = 12

Now, we can calculate the probability that a right-handed student selected at random is female:

Probability = (number of right-handed female students) / (total number of right-handed students)
Probability = (RF) / (RM + RF)
Probability = (5LF) / (9LM + 5LF)
Probability = (5LF) / (12 + 5LF)
Probability = (5LF) / 17

Simplifying, we get:

Probability = LF / 17
Probability = 3 / 17
Probability = 0.176

Therefore, the closest answer to the probability that a right-handed student selected at random is female is:

Action: Answer("B")
