## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Assistant 2:
  Thought: 
Previously, I incorrectly answered this question.
The correct answer is C: $-5 a$.

Reflection:
1. The quadratic equation should be factored as $(x-2)(x+4)$.
2. Substituting $a$ as a nonzero constant and $b=0$, we get $y=a(x-2)(x+4)$.
3. The vertex is found by setting the first factor equal to zero: $x-2=0$.
Solving for $x$, we get $x=2$.
Substituting $x=2$ into the original equation, we get $y=a(2-2)(2+4)=a(0)(6)=0$.
So, the vertex is $(2, 0)$.
4. To find $d$, we need to find the y-coordinate of the vertex.
Since the vertex is $(2, 0)$, $d=0$.
5. Double-checking, we can plug in $x=2$ into the original equation:
$y=a(2-2)(2+4)=a(0)(6)=0$.
So, $d=0$ is correct.
6. Therefore, the answer is C: $-5 a$.

Action: Answer("C")
