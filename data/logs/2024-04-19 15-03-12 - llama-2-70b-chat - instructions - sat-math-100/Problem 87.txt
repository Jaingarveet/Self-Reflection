## Assistant 2:
  My apologies for my previous mistake. Let's reflect on the problem and the correct answer.
The equation of the parabola is $y = (x - 11)^2$. To find the x-intercepts, we can set $y = 0$ and solve for $x$.

$0 = (x - 11)^2$
$x - 11 = 0$
$x = 11$

Now, we can substitute $x = 11$ into the equation of the parabola to find the y-intercepts.

$y = (11 - 11)^2$
$y = 0$

So, the x-intercepts are $x = 11$, and the y-intercept is $y = 0$.

Now, let's find the equation of the line that passes through the points $(11, 0)$ and $(x, 25)$. We can use the point-slope form of the linear equation.

$y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$

where $(x_1, y_1) = (11, 0)$ and $(x_2, y_2) = (x, 25)$.

$y - 0 = m(x - 11)$
$y = m(x - 11)$

We can solve for $m$ by substituting the values of $x_2$ and $y_2$.

$25 - 0 = m(x - 11)$
$25 = m(x - 11)$

$m = \frac{25}{x - 11}$

Now, we can substitute $x = 11$ into the equation of the line to find the slope.

$m = \frac{25}{11 - 11}$
$m = \frac{25}{0}$
$m = \infty$

Since the slope is infinite, the line is vertical, and we can't find the equation of the line.

Therefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED].
