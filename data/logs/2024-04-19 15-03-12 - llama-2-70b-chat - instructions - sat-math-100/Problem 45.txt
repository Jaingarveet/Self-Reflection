Question: Shipping Charges\begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}\hline$\begin{array}{c}\text { Merchandise weight } \\ \text { (pounds) }\end{array}$ & $\begin{array}{c}\text { Shipping } \\ \text { charge }\end{array}$ \\\hline5 & $\$ 16.94$ \\\hline10 & $\$ 21.89$ \\\hline20 & $\$ 31.79$ \\\hline40 & $\$ 51.59$ \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}The table above shows shipping charges for an online retailer that sells sporting goods. There is a linear relationship between the shipping charge and the weight of the merchandise. Which function can be used to determine the total shipping charge $f(x)$, in dollars, for an order with a merchandise weight of $x$ pounds?
Choices:
  A: $f(x)=0.99 x$
  B: $f(x)=0.99 x+11.99$
  C: $f(x)=3.39 x$
  D: $f(x)=3.39 x+16.94$

  Sure, I'll do my best to answer the question.

My previous answer was [REDACTED].
Upon reflection, I realized that my mistake was [REDACTED].

The correct answer is B: $f(x)=0.99 x+11.99$.

To determine the shipping charge, we can analyze the given table and observe that there is a linear relationship between the shipping charge and the weight of the merchandise. We can write the equation of the line in slope-intercept form, where the slope represents the rate of change of the shipping charge with respect to the weight, and the y-intercept represents the shipping charge for a weight of 0 pounds.

From the table, we can see that the shipping charge for a weight of 0 pounds is $11.99$, and the rate of change of the shipping charge with respect to the weight is approximately $0.99$ (since the shipping charge increases by approximately $0.99$ for each pound of merchandise weight). Therefore, the equation of the line can be written as:

f(x) = 0.99x + 11.99

So, the correct answer is B: $f(x)=0.99 x+11.99$.

I hope this answer is correct. Please let me know if there's anything else I can help with.
