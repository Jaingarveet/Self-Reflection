Question: $$0.10 x+0.20 y=0.18(x+y)$$Clayton will mix $x$ milliliters of a $10 \%$ by mass saline solution with $y$ milliliters of a $20 \%$ by mass saline solution in order to create an $18 \%$ by mass saline solution. The equation above represents this situation. If Clayton uses 100 milliliters of the $20 \%$ by mass saline solution, how many milliliters of the $10 \%$ by mass saline solution must he use?
Choices:
  A: 5
  B: 25
  C: 50
  D: 100
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and understand the problem.
2. Isolate x by subtracting 0.20y from both sides of the equation.
3. Substitute y = [REDACTED] into the equation.
4. Simplify the equation to solve for x.
[REDACTED]. Check your calculation to ensure accuracy.
## Assistant 2:
  Sure, I'll be happy to help! Here's how to solve the problem:

Step 1: Isolate x by subtracting 0.20y from both sides of the equation.

0.10x + 0.20y = 0.18(x+y)
0.10x + 0.20y - 0.20y = 0.18x + 0.18y
0.10x = 0.18x - 0.02y

Step 2: Substitute y = 100 into the equation.

0.10x = 0.18(100) - 0.02(100)
0.10x = 18 - 2
0.10x = 16

Step 3: Simplify the equation to solve for x.

0.10x = 16
x = 16/0.10
x = 160

Therefore, the answer is C: 50.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.
