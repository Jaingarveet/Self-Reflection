## User 2:
Topic: Logic
Context: There must be an outside world, because if there is something outside me that can shine or reflect, shining the light into my eyes, which gives me a visual experience, I ca nâ€™t see the buildings, the crowds and the stars these things.And, not only have visual experience like me, but others also have such visual experience; book knowledge also tells us repeatedly that there is an outside world outside of us.
Question: Which of the following does not constitute doubt or rebuttal to the above argument?
Choices:
  A: To use sensory evidence to explain the existence of the external world requires presupposing the existence of the external world in the mind.
  B: How do you prove that others have similar visual experience to you?
  C: Since the visual experience is reliable, Mirage is not a so-called illusion, but a real existence.
  D: If there is no external world and natural science knowledge is not a true reflection of it, then why does natural science achieve such great success in practice?
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
Let's reconsider each choice in light of the original argument:
[REDACTED]: Poses a valid doubt by highlighting the circular reasoning in using sensory evidence to prove the external world. 
[REDACTED]: Raises a valid question about proving others have similar experiences, casting doubt on that aspect of the argument.
[REDACTED]: Points out that if visual experience is reliable, then mirages would be real. This challenges the reliability of visual experience, a key part of the original argument. So this is a relevant doubt.
[REDACTED]: Argues that science's practical successes suggest there is a real external world that science reflects. This supports the original argument rather than challenging it.
Therefore, choice [REDACTED] is the one that does not constitute a doubt or rebuttal to the argument.
## Assistant 2:
Let's reconsider each choice in light of the original argument:
A: Poses a valid doubt by highlighting the circular reasoning in using sensory evidence to prove the external world. This challenges a key premise of the argument.
B: Raises a valid question about proving others have similar experiences, casting doubt on that aspect of the argument.
C: Points out that if visual experience is reliable, then mirages would be real. This challenges the reliability of visual experience, a key part of the original argument. So this is a relevant doubt.
D: Argues that science's practical successes suggest there is a real external world that science reflects. This supports the original argument rather than challenging it.
Therefore, choice D is the one that does not constitute a doubt or rebuttal to the argument.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
