## System:
You are an expert in Logic.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Topic: Logic
Context: The football game in the "Master Cup 2003 China Robot Competition" is in progress.Three professors predicted the final result? Professor Zhao said? "The champion is not the Tsinghua University team nor the Zhejiang University team." Professor Qian said ? "The champion is not the Tsinghua University team, but the University of Science and Technology of China." Professor Sun said? "The champion is not the China University of Science and Technology team, but the Tsinghua University team.The results of the competition showed that only one of them judged both, one 'S judgment is one-to-one wrong, the other one is wrong.
Question: According to the above situation, we know that the winner is
Choices:
  A: Tsinghua University Team
  B: China University of Science and Technology Team
  C: Zhejiang University Team
  D: Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
Let's reconsider the statements of each professor:
1. Professor Zhao: "The champion is not the Tsinghua University team nor the Zhejiang University team."
   - If true, this eliminates Tsinghua and Zhejiang, leaving China University of Science and Technology and [REDACTED] as possibilities.
2. Professor Qian: "The champion is not the Tsinghua University team, but the University of Science and Technology of China."
   - If true, this directly states that China University of Science and Technology is the champion.
3. Professor Sun: "The champion is not the China University of Science and Technology team, but the Tsinghua University team."
   - If true, this directly states that Tsinghua University is the champion.
We know that only one professor is fully correct, one is half correct, and one is fully incorrect.
- If Professor Zhao is fully correct, then both Professor Qian and Professor Sun must be incorrect, which violates the constraint.
- If Professor Qian is fully correct, then Professor Zhao is half correct and Professor Sun is fully incorrect. However, this is inconsistent because Professor Zhao's statement eliminates Tsinghua, contradicting Professor Qian.
- If Professor Sun is fully correct, then Professor Zhao is half correct (correct about Zhejiang not being champion) and Professor Qian is fully incorrect. This is the only scenario that satisfies the constraints.
Therefore, the champion must be the Tsinghua University team.
## Assistant 2:
Based on the additional reflection, let's analyze the statements again:
1. Professor Zhao: "The champion is not the Tsinghua University team nor the Zhejiang University team."
   - If Professor Zhao is half correct, then Zhejiang University is not the champion.
2. Professor Qian: "The champion is not the Tsinghua University team, but the University of Science and Technology of China."
   - If Professor Qian is fully incorrect, then the champion is not the University of Science and Technology of China, and it is the Tsinghua University team.
3. Professor Sun: "The champion is not the China University of Science and Technology team, but the Tsinghua University team."
   - If Professor Sun is fully correct, then the champion is indeed the Tsinghua University team.
The only scenario that satisfies the given conditions is:
- Professor Sun is fully correct
- Professor Zhao is half correct (correct about Zhejiang not being champion)
- Professor Qian is fully incorrect
Therefore, the champion must be the Tsinghua University team.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
