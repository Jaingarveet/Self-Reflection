Context: Many educators in Canada and the United States advocate multicultural education as a means of achieving multicultural understanding. There are, however, a variety of proposals as to what multicultural education should consist of. The most modest of these proposals holds that schools and colleges should promote multicultural understanding by teaching about other cultures, teaching which proceeds from within the context of the majority culture. Students should learn about other cultures, proponents claim, but examination of these cultures should operate with the methods, perspectives, and values of the majority culture. These values are typically those of liberalism: democracy, tolerance, and equality of persons. Critics of this first proposal have argued that genuine understanding of other cultures is impossible if the study of other cultures is refracted through the distorting lens of the majority culture's perspective. Not all cultures share liberal values. Their value systems have arisen in often radically different social and historical circumstances, and thus, these critics argue, cannot be understood and adequately appreciated if one insists on approaching them solely from within the majority culture's perspective. In response to this objection, a second version of multicultural education has developed that differs from the first in holding that multicultural education ought to adopt a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures. The values of one culture should not be standards by which others are judged; each culture should be taken on its own terms. However, the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in this second version of multicultural education are still identifiably Western. They are the methods of anthropology, social psychology, political science, and sociology. They are, that is, methods which derive from the Western scientific perspective and heritage. Critics of this second form of multicultural education argue as follows: The Western scientific heritage is founded upon an epistemological system that prizes the objective over the subjective, the logical over the intuitive, and the empirically verifiable over the mystical. The methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are thus already value laden; the choice to examine and understand other cultures by these methods involves a commitment to certain values such as objectivity. Thus, the second version of multicultural education is not essentially different from the first. Scientific discourse has a privileged place in Western cultures, but the discourses of myth, tradition, religion, and mystical insight are often the dominant forms of thought and language of non-Western cultures. To insist on trying to understand nonscientific cultures by the methods of Western science is not only distorting, but is also an expression of an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism: the chauvinism of science. According to this objection, it is only by adopting the (often nonscientific) perspectives and methods of the cultures studied that real understanding can be achieved.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would provide the strongest objection to the criticism in the passage of the second version of multicultural education?
Choices:
  A: It is impossible to adopt the perspectives and methods of a culture unless one is a member of that culture.
  B: Many non-Western societies have value systems that are very similar to one another.
  C: Some non-Western societies use their own value system when studying cultures that have different values.
  D: Students in Western societies cannot understand their culture's achievements unless such achievements are treated as the subject of Western scientific investigations.
  E: Genuine understanding of another culture is necessary for adequately appreciating that culture.

Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The key criticism of the second version of multicultural education is that by using Western scientific methods to study other cultures, it is still imposing certain Western values like objectivity. The critics argue this is distorting and Eurocentric.
2. Looking at the answer choices:
A) Whether it's possible to fully adopt another culture's perspective is tangential to the criticism. This doesn't directly address the key issue.
B) The similarity or dissimilarity between non-Western value systems is not relevant to the specific criticism being made. 
C) This choice points out that some non-Western cultures also study other cultures through their own value systems. This directly challenges the idea that studying other cultures through one's own methods and values is uniquely Eurocentric or chauvinistic. If non-Western cultures do the same, the criticism loses force.
D) The criticism is not about Western students understanding their own culture's achievements. This is off-topic.
E) The necessity of genuine cultural understanding is not in dispute. This choice doesn't counter the criticism about how that understanding is achieved.
3. A, B, D and E can be eliminated as they don't squarely address the key points of the criticism.
4. C emerges as the strongest objection. If some non-Western cultures also study others through their own cultural lens, it undermines the charge that this approach is a form of Western chauvinism.
5. Double-checking, C still stands out as the best answer among the choices for directly challenging the reasoning of the criticism.
Therefore, the strongest objection to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education is:
Action: Answer("C")
