Context: Curator: Our museum displays only twentieth-century works, which are either on loan from private collectors or in the museum's permanent collection. Prints of all of the latter works are available in the museum store. The museum store also sells prints of some works that are not part of the museum's permanent collection, such as Hopper's Nighthawks.
Question: If the curator's statements are true, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Every print in the museum store is of a work that is either on loan to the museum from a private collector or part of the museum's permanent collection.
  B: Every print that is sold in the museum store is a copy of a twentieth-century work.
  C: There are prints in the museum store of every work that is displayed in the museum and not on loan from a private collector.
  D: Hopper's Nighthawks is both a twentieth-century work and a work on loan to the museum from a private collector.
  E: Hopper's Nighthawks is not displayed in the museum.

Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Read the curator's statements carefully, especially the parts about the museum store and the permanent collection. 
2. Identify the key points: the museum store sells prints of all works in the permanent collection and some works not in the collection. 
3. Understand the implications: for all works displayed and not on loan (part of the permanent collection), there are prints available in the store. 
4. Choose the answer option that aligns with this understanding.
## Assistant 2:
Reflection: I misread the question previously and did not consider the fact that the museum only displays twentieth-century works. Hopper's Nighthawks is a twentieth-century work, so it satisfies the museum's display criteria. However, the question asks about the work being on loan, which it is not according to the curator's statement. This rules out choice D.

Thought: 
The curator states that the museum only displays twentieth-century works and that the museum store sells prints of all works in the permanent collection and some that are not.

This means that:
- All works displayed and not on loan (part of the permanent collection) have prints available in the store (implied by 'some works not in the collection').
- All works on loan are from private collectors.

So, we can determine the following:
- Choice A is not true because the museum store also sells prints of works not on display in the museum (e.g., Hopper's Nighthawks).
- Choice B is true because the museum only displays twentieth-century works, so all prints sold in the store would be copies of these works.
- Choice C is not true because it is not true that there are prints of "every" work that satisfies the condition. The statement only tells us that there are prints of works that are in the permanent collection and not on loan.
- Choice D is not true because, while Hopper's Nighthawks is a twentieth-century work, it is not on loan from a private collector but rather one of the works that the museum store sells prints of even though it is not part of the museum's collection.
- Choice E is incorrect because, while Hopper's Nighthawks is not on loan to the museum, it could still be displayed as it is a twentieth-century work.

Therefore, choice B is the only statement that must be true.

Action: Answer("B")
