Topic: Law
Context: Ethicist: Marital vows often contain the promise to love "until death do us part." If "love" here refers to a feeling, then this promise makes no sense, for feelings are not within one's control, and a promise to do something not within one's control makes no sense. Thus, no one—including those making marital vows—should take "love" in this context to be referring to feelings.
Question: The ethicist's conclusion follows logically if which one of the following is assumed?
Choices:
  A: None of our feelings are within our control.
  B: People should not make promises to do something that is not within their control.
  C: "Love" can legitimately be taken to refer to something other than feelings.
  D: Promises should not be interpreted in such a way that they make no sense.
  E: Promises that cannot be kept do not make any sense.

4. Understand that option [REDACTED] directly addresses this interpretation aspect, while the other options only tangentially relate to the main point. 
5. Choose option [REDACTED] as the correct answer.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: The ethicist's conclusion is that the term "love" in marital vows should not be interpreted as referring to feelings, as this would render the promise illogical. The key assumption is that promises should be interpreted in a way that makes logical sense. 

Choice D directly addresses this point, stating that promises should not be interpreted in a way that makes no sense. This assumption is crucial to the ethicist's argument and conclusion. 

Therefore, choice D is the correct answer.

Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
