  I'm sorry, but since there is no reflection information provided, I cannot use my self-reflection to help me answer this question. However, I can give you information on recycling programs and which materials can be reused many times.

In a recycling program, materials that can be reused many times include:

A: Steel cans - Steel is one of the most recyclable materials, and steel cans can be reused many times without losing their quality.

B: Glass bottles - Glass is 100% recyclable and can be reused in many ways, including being turned into new glass bottles.

C: Paper containers - Paper can be recycled multiple times, and paper containers can be turned into new paper products.

D: Plastic containers - Some types of plastic containers can be recycled, but they are not as recyclable as other materials.

Therefore, the answer to the question is A: Steel cans.
