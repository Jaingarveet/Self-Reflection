Action: Answer("D")

Explanation: Building nests is not an example of animal instinct. While some animals do build nests, it is not an instinctual behavior. Nest-building is a learned behavior that is passed down from generation to generation.

Instincts are innate behaviors that are present in an organism from birth and do not require learning or experience. Migrating, hibernating, and hunting skills are all examples of animal instincts, as they are innate behaviors that are present in certain species and are not learned.
