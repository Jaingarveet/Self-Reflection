## System:
You are an expert in Science.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: Red-clay bricks have a density of approximately 2000 kg/m^3. Air has a density of 1 kg/m^3. Which of the following has the lowest mass?
Choices:
  A: 2 m^3 of bricks
  B: 4 m^3 of bricks
  C: 6000 m^3 of air
  D: 10,000 m^3 of air

## Assistant 2:
  I'm sorry, but since there is no reflection information provided, I cannot use my self-reflection to help me answer this question. Therefore, I'll provide a new answer.

Thought:
The mass of an object is determined by its density and volume.
The density of red-clay bricks is 2000 kg/m^3, and the density of air is 1 kg/m^3.
To find the lowest mass, we need to calculate the mass of each choice.

Action: Answer("D") 

The mass of 10,000 m^3 of air is 10,000 x 1 = 10,000 kg.
This is the lowest mass among the four choices.
Therefore, the correct answer is D: 10,000 m^3 of air.
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
