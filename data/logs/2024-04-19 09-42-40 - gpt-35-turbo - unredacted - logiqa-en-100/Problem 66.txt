## System:
You are an expert in Logic.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## User 2:
Topic: Logic
Context: There are five volcanic islands E, F, G, H, and I in the east coast of a country.They are arranged in a straight line from north to south, and they are found? (1) F is adjacent to H and is on the north side of H.(2) I and E are adjacent.(3) G is somewhere in the north of F.
Question: If it is found that G is the northernmost island, how many possible arrangements are there for this group of islands?
Choices:
  A: 2
  B: 3
  C: 4
  D: 5
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
My mistake was that I did not consider all possible arrangements of the islands. 
I assumed that G must be at the top of the line, but it could also be second from the top. 
Error Keywords:
 - Assumption error
 - Limited thinking
 - Failure to consider all possibilities
Solution:
If G is the northernmost island, it could be either at the top of the line or second from the top. 
Case 1: G is at the top of the line
From (1), F is adjacent to H and is on the north side of H, so F and H must be in the south of the line.
From (3), G is somewhere in the north of F, so G must be adjacent to F and in the north of F.
From (2), I and E are adjacent, so they must be in the middle of the line.
Therefore, the only possible arrangement is G-F-H-E-I.
Case 2: G is second from the top of the line
From (1), F is adjacent to H and is on the north side of H, so F and H must be in the south of the line.
From (3), G is somewhere in the north of F, so G must be adjacent to F and in the north of F.
From (2), I and E are adjacent, so they must be in the middle of the line.
Therefore, the possible arrangement is F-G-H-E-I.
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and understand the problem.
2. Consider all possible arrangements of the given conditions.
3. Think through each subproblem step-by-step.
4. Double-check your calculations and final answer.
5. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always consider all possible arrangements of the given conditions.
 - Never assume anything that is not explicitly stated in the problem.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that there may be more than one correct answer to a problem.
