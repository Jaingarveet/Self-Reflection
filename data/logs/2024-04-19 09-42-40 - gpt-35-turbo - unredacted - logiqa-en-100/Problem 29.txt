Context: If I debate with you, can we distinguish between true and false? You and I do nâ€™t know, and everyone else has prejudices.Who can we judge? Please judge with someone who shares your opinion.Since he has the same opinion as you, how can he judge? Please judge by someone who has the same opinion as me.Since he has the same opinion as me, how can he judge? Please judge with people who have different opinions from you and me.Since he has different opinions from you and me, how can he judge? Therefore, "invincible".

Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I incorrectly identified the type of logical error in the argument. The argument is not guilty of a "mis-problem" logical error, but rather it ignores the implementation standards and logical standards beyond the debaters and commentators. 
Error Keywords:
 - Misidentification of logical error
 - Mis-problem error
 - Ignoring implementation standards
 - Ignoring logical standards
Solution:
The argument presents a scenario where it is impossible to judge between true and false due to biases and lack of knowledge. It then asks how judgment can be made, but the options presented are flawed. The argument concludes that the scenario is "invincible". 
The argument is guilty of ignoring the implementation standards and logical standards beyond the debaters and commentators. It assumes that the only way to judge is through debate and commentary, which is not necessarily true. 
Instructions:
1. Read the argument carefully and identify the main points.
2. Identify the logical error in the argument.
3. Evaluate each option carefully and choose the most accurate one.
4. Double-check your answer to ensure accuracy.
Advice:
 - Always read the argument carefully and identify the main points.
 - Always evaluate each option carefully before choosing an answer.
 - Always double-check your answer to ensure accuracy.
 - Remember that logical errors can take many forms, so be familiar with different types of logical errors. 
 - Remember that logical errors can be subtle, so pay attention to the details of the argument.
