Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I incorrectly identified option B as the most similar argument. 
Option D is the correct answer because it presents a similar conditional statement: anyone who meets the basic conditions can apply for a small loan. Then, it applies the negation of the consequent to Sun Wen, concluding that Sun Wen did not meet the basic conditions.
Error Keywords:
 - Misidentification error
 - Conditional statement error
 - Negation error
Solution:
Option D presents a similar conditional statement: anyone who meets the basic conditions can apply for a small loan. Then, it applies the negation of the consequent to Sun Wen, concluding that Sun Wen did not meet the basic conditions.
Instructions:
1. Identify the conditional statement in the argument.
2. Identify the negation of the antecedent or consequent.
3. Apply the negation to the subject of the argument.
4. Determine the conclusion of the argument.
5. Identify the argument that presents a similar conditional statement and negation.
6. Apply the negation to the subject of the argument.
7. Determine the conclusion of the argument.
8. Compare the conclusions of the two arguments to identify the correct answer.
Advice:
 - Always identify the conditional statement in the argument.
 - Always identify the negation of the antecedent or consequent.
 - Always apply the negation to the subject of the argument.
 - Always determine the conclusion of the argument.
 - Always compare the conclusions of the two arguments to identify the correct answer.
