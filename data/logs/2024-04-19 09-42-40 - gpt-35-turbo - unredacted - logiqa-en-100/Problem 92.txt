Explanation:
I misunderstood the question and the given information. 
I did not consider all the statements made by the professors and their implications.
Error Keywords:
 - Misunderstanding
 - Incomplete analysis
 - Logical error
Solution:
Professor Zhao said that the champion is not the Tsinghua University team nor the Zhejiang University team.
Professor Qian said that the champion is not the Tsinghua University team, but the University of Science and Technology of China.
Professor Sun said that the champion is not the China University of Science and Technology team, but the Tsinghua University team.
Only one of them judged both, one 'S judgment is one-to-one wrong, the other one is wrong.
If Professor Zhao is correct, then the winner is either the University of Science and Technology of China or Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics.
If Professor Qian is correct, then the winner is the University of Science and Technology of China.
If Professor Sun is correct, then the winner is Tsinghua University.
Since only one of them judged both, one 'S judgment is one-to-one wrong, the other one is wrong, we know that Professor Zhao is wrong.
Therefore, the winner is either the University of Science and Technology of China or Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics.
Since only one of them judged both, one 'S judgment is one-to-one wrong, the other one is wrong, we know that Professor Qian is wrong.
Therefore, the winner is Tsinghua University.
