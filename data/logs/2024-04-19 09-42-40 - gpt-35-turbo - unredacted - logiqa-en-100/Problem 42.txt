Context: Aptripa Cave is located near the bay of Dilos in the Peninsula of Maina, and is as large as four football fields.This cave dates back to the Neolithic Age, but was not accidentally discovered by a man walking a dog until the 1950s.After decades of scientific research work, archaeologists excavated tools, pottery, obsidian, silver and copper utensils from the cave, and thus believed that hundreds of people had lived in the cave.
Question: Which of the following, if true, can best refute the above argument?
Choices:
  A: The cave inspired the description of hell in Greek mythology
  B: The cave is actually an ancient cemetery and funeral venue
  C: There is no prehistoric village in Europe that has been found earlier than the cave
  D: The entrance to the cave collapsed 5000 years ago
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I chose option D, which does not necessarily refute the argument. The argument states that hundreds of people had lived in the cave, but option D only states that the entrance to the cave collapsed 5000 years ago. This does not necessarily mean that people did not live in the cave before the entrance collapsed. Option B, on the other hand, provides an alternative explanation that contradicts the argument. If the cave is actually an ancient cemetery and funeral venue, then it is less likely that hundreds of people had lived in the cave. 
Error Keywords:
 - Misunderstanding the question
 - Incorrectly evaluating answer choices
 - Insufficiently analyzing answer choices
Solution:
The argument states that hundreds of people had lived in the cave, but we need to find a statement that contradicts this claim. Option B provides an alternative explanation that contradicts the argument. If the cave is actually an ancient cemetery and funeral venue, then it is less likely that hundreds of people had lived in the cave. 
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and understand the problem.
2. Analyze each answer choice carefully.
3. Evaluate each answer choice against the question and the argument.
4. Choose the answer choice that best refutes the argument.
5. Double-check your answer to ensure accuracy.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Analyze each answer choice carefully.
 - Evaluate each answer choice against the question and the argument.
 - Choose the answer choice that best refutes the argument.
 - Double-check your answer to ensure accuracy.
 - Remember that the correct answer is the one that best refutes the argument, not necessarily the one that is true.
