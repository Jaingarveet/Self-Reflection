Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Reflection:
I incorrectly answered the question because I did not consider all the options carefully. 
I did not think through the implications of each option and how it could explain the contradiction. 
I chose option B because it seemed to provide a reasonable explanation for the contradiction. 
However, option C is the correct answer because it suggests that respondents who favor college students as nannies may have different reasons for doing so than those who would not actually hire them. 
Error Keywords:
 - Insufficient analysis
 - Failure to consider all options
 - Misinterpretation of options
Solution:
The survey shows that a majority of respondents favor college students as nannies, but a majority of respondents would not actually hire college students as nannies. There must be a reason for this contradiction.
Option C provides a possible explanation for the contradiction. If respondents who favor college students as nannies believe that doing housekeeping work is good for college students themselves, they may not be as concerned about the quality of the housekeeping services provided by college students. On the other hand, respondents who would not actually hire college students as nannies may be more concerned about the quality of the housekeeping services provided and may not believe that college students are capable of providing high-quality services.
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and understand the problem.
2. Consider all the options carefully and think through the implications of each option.
3. Choose the option that provides the best explanation for the contradiction.
4. Double-check your answer to ensure that it makes sense.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always consider all the options carefully and think through the implications of each option.
 - Always choose the option that provides the best explanation for the problem.
 - Always double-check your answer to ensure that it makes sense.
 - Remember that there may be multiple factors that contribute to a problem, so it is important to consider all possible explanations.
