D: Fish contaminated with this chemical only accounts for a small portion of the seal's total food intake.

Reflection:
After reviewing my previous answer and the correct answer, I realized that I made a mistake in my reasoning. The correct answer is (B) Toxic chemicals gather in the parts of the fish that seals eat but people don't.
The statement suggests that the chemical is more toxic to seals than to people, which means that the parts of the fish that seals eat are more likely to contain higher concentrations of the chemical. Therefore, the contradiction between the seals dying and some people not being poisoned can be explained by the fact that seals eat more of the contaminated fish than people do.
