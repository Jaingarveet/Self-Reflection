Question: If G is the northernmost island, how many possible arrangements are there for this group of islands?

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I realized that I made a mistake in my reasoning. I will use my self-reflection to help me answer the question correctly this time.

From the given information, we know that the islands are arranged in a straight line from north to south, and they are found in the east coast of a country. We also know that F is adjacent to H and is on the north side of H, and I and E are adjacent.

So, the possible arrangements of the islands are:

1. E, F, G, H, I (in this arrangement, G is the northernmost island)
2. F, G, H, I, E (in this arrangement, G is still the northernmost island)

Therefore, the answer is (B) 3.
