3. Qiu Zhijie and Tang Xiaohua are not selected at the same time.

Now, let's consider the options:

B) Peng Youwen - This option is not selected because Peng Youwen and Song Kaiwen are not selected at the same time, according to the requirements.

C) Qiu Zhijie - This option is not selected because Qiu Zhijie and Tang Xiaohua are not selected at the same time, according to the requirements.
