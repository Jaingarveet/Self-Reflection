## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Without the biopsy report or any specific details about the biopsy findings, it's challenging to make a definitive diagnosis. However, based on the patient's age, symptoms of nasal obstruction and bloody discharge, Wegener's granulomatosis (also known as Granulomatosis with polyangiitis) could be a possibility. This condition is a rare disorder that causes inflammation of the blood vessels and can affect the nose, sinuses, throat, lungs, and kidneys. The other options are less likely based on the given information.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
