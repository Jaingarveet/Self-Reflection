## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Bicarbonate buffers are ideal in blood because their pKa (6.1) is close to the physiological pH (7.4) of blood. This allows the bicarbonate buffer system to effectively neutralize both acids and bases and maintain a stable pH in the blood. Therefore, the answer is A: Pka is equal to Ph.

Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
