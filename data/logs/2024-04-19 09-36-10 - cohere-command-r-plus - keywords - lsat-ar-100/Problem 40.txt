Topic: Law
Context: A shopping center has exactly seven spaces—space 1 through space 7—arranged in a straight row. Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
Question: If the shoe store is in space 2, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: The optometrist is in space 5.
  B: The pharmacy is in space 1.
  C: A restaurant is in space 3.
  D: The toy store is in space 6.
  E: The veterinarian is in space 4.

## Assistant 2:
Thought: If the shoe store is in space 2, it is not possible for a restaurant to be in space 3 as there would only be one business between the two restaurants. This eliminates choices C and E, as they suggest the veterinarian or a restaurant is in space 4.

Choice A can be eliminated as, with the optometrist in space 5, there would be nowhere for the second restaurant to go, given it must be at one end of the row. 

Choice D can also be eliminated as it would place the toy store next to the veterinarian, which is not allowed according to the constraints. 

Therefore, the correct answer is choice B. With the pharmacy in space 1, the remaining spaces can be arranged as follows: 
1. Pharmacy
2. Shoe Store
3. Optometrist
4. Veterinarian
5. Toy Store
6. Restaurant
7. Restaurant

This arrangement satisfies all the given constraints.

Action: Answer("B")
