## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The question asks for a statement that could be true, so we must find a statement that is consistent with the rules provided.

Statement A is incorrect because K cannot be shown before J, as K cannot be shown in the morning and J must be shown in the evening.

Statement B is possible because L must be shown after K, and if K is shown in the afternoon, then L could be shown in the evening after J.

Statement C is incorrect because if P is shown after J, then it would violate the rule that J must be shown in the evening, as P must be shown in the morning or afternoon.

Statement D is possible because N and O can be shown after M, as long as they are shown in the evening after M.

Statement E is incorrect because if N and P are shown after K, then it would place N and P in the evening slot, which is not possible as J must be shown in the evening.

Therefore, the correct answer is 'D: Both N and O are shown at some time after M'.

This question required me to adopt a more flexible mindset and carefully interpret the rules to identify all the possible combinations of house showings that could occur.
