Context: A government needs to assign new ambassadors to Venezuela, Yemen, and Zambia. The candidates for these ambassadorships are Jaramillo, Kayne, Landon, Novetzke, and Ong. One ambassador will be assigned to each country, and no ambassador will be assigned to more than one country. The assignment of the ambassadors must meet the following constraints: Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships. If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne. If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen. If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
Question: If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then the other two ambassadors assigned could be
Choices:
  A: Jaramillo and Landon
  B: Jaramillo and Novetzke
  C: Kayne and Landon
  D: Kayne and Novetzke
  E: Landon and Novetzke

## Assistant 2:
Reflection: I misread the constraint regarding Ong and Kayne. If Ong is the ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne cannot be the ambassador to Yemen, but could still be assigned to Zambia.

Thought: If Ong is the ambassador to Venezuela, this automatically rules out Yemen as a possibility for Kayne due to the constraint. Zambia is still a possibility for Landon and Kayne. As Kayne can still be assigned, we can apply the constraint that if Jaramillo is assigned an ambassadorship, so is Kayne. Venezuela and Yemen could then be assigned to Jaramillo and Kayne, with Zambia going to Landon.
Action: Answer("C")
