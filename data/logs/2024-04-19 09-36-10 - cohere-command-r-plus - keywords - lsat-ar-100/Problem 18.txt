Context: Of the eight students—George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert—in a seminar, exactly six will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.

Choices:
  A: Mon. morning: Helen; Mon. afternoon: Robert Tues. morning: Olivia; Tues. afternoon: Irving Wed. morning: Lenore; Wed. afternoon: Kyle
  B: Mon. morning: Irving; Mon. afternoon: Olivia Tues. morning: Helen; Tues. afternoon: Kyle Wed. morning: Nina; Wed. afternoon: Lenore
  C: Mon. morning: Lenore; Mon. afternoon: Helen Tues. morning: George; Tues. afternoon: Kyle Wed. morning: Robert; Wed. afternoon: Irving

## Assistant 2:
Reflection: I misinterpreted the condition regarding Nina's report; I arranged the schedule as if Nina's report had to be followed by Helen and Irving's reports the next day, but the condition actually states that Helen and Irving's reports are required the next day only if Nina's report is not given on Wednesday. As a result of this misinterpretation, I arranged Nina, Helen, and Irving's reports in an order that did not satisfy the condition. To correct this, I should ensure that either Nina's report is given on Wednesday, or that Helen and Irving's reports follow Nina's the next day.

Thought: 
The correct answer is D.

Tuesday is the only day George can present, so he must present on Tuesday.
Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon presentation, so they must give morning presentations.
As Tuesday is the only option left for an afternoon presentation, Robert presents on Tuesday morning, and Olivia presents on Monday morning.

Nina, Helen, and Irving must present consecutively, with Nina presenting first, unless Nina presents on Wednesday. 
As Monday and Tuesday mornings are already taken, to satisfy this condition, Nina must present on Wednesday morning, with Helen and Irving presenting on Monday and Tuesday afternoons, respectively.

Finally, Lenore and Kyle can present at any time, so they take the remaining slots of Monday morning and Wednesday afternoon, respectively.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
