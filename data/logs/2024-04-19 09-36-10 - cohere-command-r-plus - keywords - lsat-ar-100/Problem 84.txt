## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
We know that F and M are on the same shelf, and that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. This means that F and M cannot be on the top shelf, as that would leave only six books for the middle and bottom shelves, and we have eight books in total. 

We also know that I is on the middle shelf, and K is on a higher shelf than F, which means K cannot be on the bottom shelf, as that would place it lower than F. 

O is placed higher than L, but we don't know if either of these books is on the bottom shelf. As there must be at least two books on the bottom shelf, and F and M cannot go there, at least one other book is needed. This could be either L or another book. 

Therefore, the bottom shelf could include F, H, and M, or it could be G, H, L, and M.
