## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The correct answer is choice B. This schedule meets all the conditions: Franco and Garcia do not testify on the same day, Iturbe testifies on Wednesday, two witnesses testify on Tuesday, Hong does not testify on Monday, and Franco testifies on Monday. There is no reason given to prefer any particular witness to testify on any particular day, so this schedule is acceptable.

Choice A is unacceptable because only one witness testifies on Monday, contrary to the condition that at least one witness testifies on Monday.

Choice C is unacceptable because Hong testifies on Monday, contrary to the condition that Hong does not testify on Monday.

Choice D is unacceptable because three witnesses testify on Wednesday, contrary to the condition that exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.

Choice E is unacceptable because Garcia and Jackson testify on Monday, contrary to the condition that Franco and Garcia do not testify on the same day.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
