## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
We know the following:
- I is on the middle shelf
- K is on a higher shelf than F
- O is on a higher shelf than L
- F and M are on the same shelf

From these conditions, we can deduce that statement A must be true. As O is on a higher shelf than L, and F is on the same shelf as M, it follows that O must be on a higher shelf than M.

Statement B could be true, but it is not a necessary truth as we do not know the positions of G or K in relation to each other, or in relation to the other books. The same logic applies to statements D and E; they could be true, but they are not guaranteed to be true. 

Statement C is false, as we do not know the position of F, and it could be on the top shelf, with I in the middle and K on the bottom. 

Therefore, the correct answer is A.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
