Topic: Law
Context: An administrator must assign parking spaces to six new employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young. Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
Question: If Robertson is assigned parking space #3, then which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Souza is assigned parking space #4.
  B: Togowa is assigned parking space #2.
  C: Vaughn is assigned parking space #5.
  D: Xu is assigned parking space #6.
  E: Young is assigned parking space #2.

## Assistant 2:
Reflection: I misinterpreted the condition "Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa." I incorrectly assumed that Young and Togowa had to be assigned consecutive spaces, with Young immediately after Togowa. This is not the case, as "higher-numbered" only indicates that Young's space must be greater in number than Togowa's, allowing for other employees to be assigned spaces between theirs.

Correct answer selection logic: If Robertson is assigned parking space #3, then Young must be assigned a higher number. The only higher numbers available are 4, 5, and 6. As Xu must be higher than Souza, we can assign Xu to 6 and Souza to 4, leaving 5 for Young. This means Vaughn and Togowa can take 2 and 1 in any order, so we cannot determine where Togowa is parked based on this information.

Thought: If Robertson is assigned parking space #3, we know that Young must be assigned a higher number: 4, 5, or 6. We also know that Xu must be assigned a higher number than Souza. So, Xu could be 5 or 6, with Souza taking the other space. This would leave only one remaining space (either 4, 5, or 6) for Young, fulfilling the condition that Young must have a higher number than Togowa. Therefore, we can conclude that Xu must be assigned a higher number, but we cannot determine specific space assignments for the others.
Action: Answer("D")
