## Assistant 2:
Reflection: I made an interpretation error in my previous attempt. I incorrectly assumed that because "at least one witness testifies on Monday," that witness had to be Franco or Garcia. However, this is not specified in the conditions, and it could be any of the witnesses.

The correct answer is B. If Jackson testifies on Wednesday, then Garcia must testify on Monday, as Franco cannot testify on the same day as Garcia, and Hong and Monday are also excluded by the conditions.
## Result:
Agent Answer: None
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
