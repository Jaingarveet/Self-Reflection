2. At least two compositions must be performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
3. O is performed either first or fifth.
4. The eighth composition performed is either L or H.
5. P is performed at some time before S.
6. At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.

Choice B satisfies all the conditions:

2. There are three compositions (P, S, and H) performed after F and before R.
3. O is performed first.
4. H is the eighth composition performed.
