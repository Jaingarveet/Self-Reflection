## Assistant 2:
  Action: Answer("C")

Explanation:
Methimazole is the preferred antithyroid drug during pregnancy due to its lower risk of adverse effects compared to carbimazole. Propylthiouracil is not safe to use during pregnancy due to the risk of congenital malformations. I121 is not a commonly used antithyroid drug, and its safety during pregnancy has not been well-established. Carbimazole has a higher risk of adverse effects compared to methimazole and is not the preferred choice for pregnant women. Therefore, the correct answer is C: Methimazole.
