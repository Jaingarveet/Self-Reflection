Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
Type 2 pattern of etched enamel is characterized by small, rounded pits that give the surface a rough, sandpapery feel. It is also known as the "cobblestone pattern" due to its resemblance to the irregularly shaped stones used in paving roads.
## Assistant 2:
  Action: Answer("C")

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, selecting option A, "Honeycomb pattern." However, upon reflection, I realized that the description of the type 2 pattern of etched enamel did not match the honeycomb pattern. The correct answer is option C, "Cobblestone pattern," as it accurately describes the rough, sandpapery feel and irregular shape of the etched enamel surface. I will make sure to carefully read and analyze the question and options in the future.
