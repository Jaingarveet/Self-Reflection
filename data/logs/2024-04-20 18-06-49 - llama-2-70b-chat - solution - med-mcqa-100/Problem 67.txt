Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
[REDACTED] cystogastrostomy is a surgical procedure that creates a connection between a pancreatic cyst and the stomach. One of the major complications of this procedure is the development of hemorrhage, or bleeding, which can occur due to the fragility of the pancreatic tissue and the risk of damaging blood vessels during the procedure.
## Assistant 2:
  Action: Answer("D")

Explanation:
Previously, I incorrectly answered this question as "C: Fistula." However, upon reflection, I realized that the correct answer is "D: Hemorrhage." A fistula is an abnormal connection between two organs or between an organ and the skin, and while it is a possible complication of surgery, it is not the most likely complication of cystogastrostomy. Hemorrhage, or bleeding, is a more common complication of this procedure due to the delicate nature of the pancreatic tissue and the risk of damaging blood vessels during the procedure.
