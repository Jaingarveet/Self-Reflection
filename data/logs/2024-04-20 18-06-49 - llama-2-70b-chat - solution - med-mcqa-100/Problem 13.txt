Question: Investigation of choice in pyloric stenosis-
Choices:
  A: USG
  B: UGI series
  C: CT
  D: MRI
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:

1. Review the imaging modalities and their indications for pyloric stenosis.
2. Understand that [REDA[REDACTED]ED] is the initial imaging modality of choice for pyloric stenosis.
3. Recognize that [REDACTED] scan is a more invasive and expensive modality that should be used when [REDA[REDACTED]ED] is equivocal or when there are other indications for its use.
## Assistant 2:
  Action: Answer("A")

Reflection:
Previously, I incorrectly answered this question as "D: MRI."
Upon reflection, I realized that the initial imaging modality of choice for pyloric stenosis is ultrasound (USG), which is non-invasive and can accurately diagnose the condition in most cases.
Therefore, the correct answer is "A: USG."
I will keep in mind that while other imaging modalities like UGI series, CT, and MRI may be useful in certain situations, USG is the most appropriate choice for initial evaluation of pyloric stenosis.
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
