Question: Ten grams of sugar is dissolved in 100 grams (g) of water. How many grams is the sugar-and-water solution?
Choices:
  A: 90 g
  B: 100 g
  C: 110 g
  D: 1000 g
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I made a mistake in my answer. I incorrectly calculated the amount of sugar in the solution.

The correct calculation is:

10 grams of sugar dissolved in 100 grams of water = 100 grams of sugar-and-water solution

So, the correct answer is (C) 110 grams.

Error Keywords:

* Miscalculation
* Mistake
* Incorrect calculation

Solution:

To find the amount of sugar in the sugar-and-water solution, we need to use the fact that 10 grams of sugar is dissolved in 100 grams of water.

Step-by-step calculation:

1. Identify the given information: 10 grams of sugar is dissolved in 100 grams of water.
2. Calculate the amount of sugar in the solution: 10 grams / 100 grams = 0.1 grams (or 100 grams)

Therefore, the amount of sugar in the sugar-and-water solution is 110 grams (C).

Instructions:

1. Identify the given information: 10 grams of sugar is dissolved in 100 grams of water.
2. Calculate the amount of sugar in the solution using the given information.
3. Choose the correct answer from the options provided.

Advice:

* Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
* Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
* Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
* Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
* Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
* Remember that the amount of sugar in the solution is directly proportional to the amount of sugar dissolved in the water.

  D: 1000 g

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly. I made a mistake in my calculation, and I understand now that the amount of sugar in the solution is directly proportional to the amount of sugar dissolved in the water.

Step-by-step calculation:

1. Identify the given information: 10 grams of sugar is dissolved in 100 grams of water.
2. Calculate the amount of sugar in the solution: 10 grams / 100 grams = 0.1 grams (or 100 grams)

Therefore, the amount of sugar in the sugar-and-water solution is 110 grams (C).
