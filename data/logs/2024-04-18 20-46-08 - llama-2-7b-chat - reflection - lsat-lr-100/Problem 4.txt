Topic: Law
Context: A film makes a profit if the number of people who see it is sufficient to generate revenues from ticket sales greater than the amount spent to make it. Hence, the primary goal of movie executives is to maximize the number of people who see a film. However, it is not the primary goal of television executives to maximize the number of viewers for their shows.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain the difference between the goals of movie executives and those of television executives?
Choices:
  A: More people are willing to see a film more than once than are willing to watch a television show more than once.
  B: There is no analog in television to the large profits that owners of movie theaters make by selling refreshments to their customers.
  C: The average cost of producing an hour of film is much greater than the average cost of producing an hour of television.
  D: Television shows make their profits from sponsors, who are chiefly concerned with the purchasing power of the people who watch a television show.
  E: Over half of the most popular television shows are shows that viewers do not have to pay to watch.

  Action: Answer("C")

The correct answer is (C) The average cost of producing an hour of film is much greater than the average cost of producing an hour of television.

Explanation:
The difference in the goals of movie executives and television executives can be attributed to the difference in production costs. The average cost of producing an hour of film is significantly higher than the average cost of producing an hour of television. This means that movie executives need to recoup their investment through ticket sales, which requires a larger audience. In contrast, television executives have a lower production cost, which allows them to focus on creating high-quality content that appeals to a smaller audience. Therefore, the primary goal of television executives is not to maximize the number of viewers but to create engaging content that attracts a loyal audience.

Correct Answer: D
## Assistant 2:
Response:
  Explanation:
The correct answer is (D) Television shows make their profits from sponsors, who are chiefly concerned with the purchasing power of the people who watch a television show.

The difference in the goals of movie executives and television executives can be attributed to the difference in revenue streams. Movie executives primarily rely on ticket sales to generate profits, which requires a large audience. In contrast, television executives rely on advertising revenue, which is generated through sponsorships. Sponsors are primarily concerned with the purchasing power of the people who watch a television show, which means they are more interested in attracting a loyal audience rather than maximizing the number of viewers. Therefore, the primary goal of television executives is not to maximize the number of viewers but to create engaging content that attracts a loyal audience.

Keywords:

* Revenue streams
* Ticket sales
* Advertising revenue
* Sponsorships
* Purchasing power
* Loyal audience

Advice:

* Understand the revenue streams of different media platforms to better explain the goals of executives in those industries.
* Recognize the importance of production costs in determining the goals of executives in different industries.
* Appreciate the role of sponsors in shaping the goals of television executives.
* Be aware of the different metrics used to measure the success of movie and television executives.
