The gap in my knowledge was not in geography but in basic arithmetic. 
I knew the correct city and state but made a calculation error.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Arithmetic error
 - Multiplication error
Solution:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
Iowa State University is located in the state of Iowa.
The city name "Ames" contains 4 letters.

Topic: Law
Context: Native speakers perceive sentences of their own language as sequences of separate words. But this perception is an illusion. This is shown by the fact that travelers who do not know a local language hear an unintelligible, uninterrupted stream of sound, not sentences with distinct words.
Question: Which one of the following is an assumption on which the argument depends?
Choices:
  A: It is impossible to understand sentences if they are in fact uninterrupted streams of sound.
  B: Those who do not know a language cannot hear the way speech in that language actually sounds.
  C: People pay less close attention to the way their own language sounds than they do to the way an unfamiliar language sounds.
  D: Accomplished non-native speakers of a language do not perceive sentences as streams of sound.
  E: Native speakers' perceptions of their own language are not more accurate than are the perceptions of persons who do not know that language.

  Thought: The argument depends on the assumption that those who do not know a language cannot hear the way speech in that language actually sounds.

Action: Answer("B")

Correct Answer: E
## Assistant 2:
Response:
  Explanation:
The argument depends on the assumption that those who do not know a language cannot hear the way speech in that language actually sounds. This assumption is choice B: Those who do not know a language cannot hear the way speech in that language actually sounds.

The argument is based on the idea that native speakers perceive sentences of their own language as sequences of separate words, but this perception is an illusion. The argument shows that this perception is an illusion by pointing out that travelers who do not know a local language hear an unintelligible, uninterrupted stream of sound, not sentences with distinct words.

The argument does not rely on the other options:

Option A is not a assumption, as it is not a necessary condition for the argument.

Option C is not a assumption, as it does not affect the argument's conclusion.

Option D is not a assumption, as it is not related to the argument's premise.

Option E is the correct assumption, as it is the basis for the argument.

Advice:

* Always read the question carefully and understand the argument.
* Identify the assumption on which the argument depends.
* Choose the best answer based on the argument.
* Double-check your answer to ensure accuracy.
