Choices:
    A: 16
    B: 20

## Assistant 1:
Explanation:
I miscalculated the product of the number of letters in the city and state names. 
The gap in my knowledge was not in geography but in basic arithmetic. 
I knew the correct city and state but made a calculation error.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Arithmetic error
 - Multiplication error
Solution:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
Iowa State University is located in the state of Iowa.
The city name "Ames" contains 4 letters.
The state name "Iowa" contains 4 letters.
The product of 4*4 is 16.
Instructions:
1. Identify the city where the university is located.
2. Identify the state where the university is located.
3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.
4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.
5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.
6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.
7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them.

Topic: Law
Context: When a group is unable to reach a consensus, group members are often accused of being stubborn, bullheaded, or unyielding. Such epithets often seem abusive, are difficult to prove, and rarely help the group reach a resolution. Those who wish to make such an accusation stick, however, should choose "unyielding," because one can always appeal to the fact that the accused has not yielded; obviously if one acknowledges that a person has not yielded, then one cannot deny that the person is unyielding, at least on this issue.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately descrthes the argumentative technique employed above?
Choices:
  A: rejecting a factic on the grounds that it constitutes an attack on the character of a person and has no substance in :fact
  B: rejecting a factic on the grounds that the factic makes it virtually imposSlble for the group to reach a consensus on the issue in question
  C: conditionally advocating a factic on the grounds that it results in an accusation that is less offensive than the alternatives
  D: conditionally advocating a factic on the grounds that it results in an argument that would help the group to reach a consensus on the issue in question
  E: conditionally advocating a factic on the grounds that it results in an argument for which one could not consistently accept the premise but deny the conclusion

  The argumentative technique employed in the passage is most accurately described as:

B: rejecting a factic on the grounds that the factic makes it virtually impossible for the group to reach a consensus on the issue in question.

The passage explains that when a group is unable to reach a consensus, group members are often accused of being stubborn, bullheaded, or unyielding. The author argues that these epithets are difficult to prove and rarely help the group reach a resolution. Instead of accusing a person of being unyielding, the author suggests that one can appeal to the fact that the person has not yielded, which makes it virtually impossible for the group to reach a consensus. Therefore, option B is the best answer.
