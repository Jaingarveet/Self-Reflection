## Assistant 2:
Reflection:
I made a calculation error when finding the number of terms in the arithmetic progression. I incorrectly calculated the sum of the ages as 250 years instead of 250 months.

Thought:
The youngest member is 7 years old, which is equivalent to 84 months.
The ages of the members form an arithmetic progression with a common difference of 3 months.
Let n be the number of members in the club.
The sum of the ages of all the members is given as 250 months.
The formula for the sum of an arithmetic progression is:
Sn = n/2 * (2a + (n-1)d)
where a is the first term, d is the common difference, and n is the number of terms.
Substituting the given values, we get:
250 = n/2 * (2*84 + (n-1)*3)
Expanding and simplifying, we get:
250 = n/2 * (168 + 3n - 3)
250 = n/2 * (165 + 3n)
500 = n * (165 + 3n)
Dividing both sides by 3, we get:
166.67 â‰ˆ n * (55 + n)
Since n must be an integer, we can round up to the nearest integer and check if it satisfies the equation:
167 = n * (55 + n)
Factoring, we get:
(n - 25)(n + 7) = 0
The possible values for n are 25 and -7.
Since the number of members cannot be negative, we choose n = 25.

Action: Answer("C")
