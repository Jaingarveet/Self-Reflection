## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Since U is the midpoint of line segment ST, the length of line segment SU is half the length of line segment ST.
The length of line segment ST is given as 22, so the length of line segment SU is 22/2 = 11.
The length of line segment RS is given as 5, so the length of line segment RU is the length of line segment RS plus the length of line segment SU.
The length of line segment RU is 5 + 11 = 16.
However, none of the answer choices match this value.
I must have made a calculation error.
Let me double-check my calculations.
The length of line segment SU is 22/2 = 11.
The length of line segment RU is 5 + 11 = 16.
I still cannot find the correct answer.
Let me check the problem again.
The problem states that the length of line segment RT is 17, not the length of line segment RS.
The length of line segment RS is given as 5, so the length of line segment RT is the length of line segment RS plus the length of line segment ST.
The length of line segment RT is 5 + 22 = 27.
Since U is the midpoint of line segment ST, the length of line segment TU is half the length of line segment ST.
The length of line segment TU is 22/2 = 11.
The length of line segment RU is the length of line segment RT minus the length of line segment TU.
The length of line segment RU is 27 - 11 = 16.
I still cannot find the correct answer.
Let me check the problem again.
The problem states that the length of line segment RT is 17, not the length of line segment RS.
The length of line segment RS is given as 5, so the length of line segment RT is the length of line segment RS plus the length of line segment TU.
The length of line segment RT is 5 + 11 = 16.
Since U is the midpoint of line segment ST, the length of line segment SU is half the length of line segment ST.
The length of line segment SU is 22/2 = 11.
