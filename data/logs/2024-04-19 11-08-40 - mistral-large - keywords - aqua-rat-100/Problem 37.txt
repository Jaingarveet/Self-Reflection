The formula for calculating the batting average is (total runs scored) / (number of matches played).
In this case, we know that Sachin's batting average increased from 51 to 54 after scoring 78 runs in the finals.
Let's denote the number of matches played by Sachin before the finals as x.
Then, the total runs scored by Sachin before the finals can be calculated as 51x.
After the finals, the total runs scored by Sachin is 51x + 78, and the total number of matches played by Sachin is x + 1.
We can set up an equation using the new batting average of 54:
(51x + 78) / (x + 1) = 54
Solving this equation for x, we get:
51x + 78 = 54x + 54
3x = 24
x = 8
Therefore, Sachin played a total of 8 + 1 = 9 matches in this season.
Action: Answer("C")
