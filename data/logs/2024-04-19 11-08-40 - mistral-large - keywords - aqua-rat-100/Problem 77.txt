## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

## Assistant 2:
Reflection:
I made a calculation error in my previous answer. I incorrectly calculated the sum of the 5 consecutive odd numbers. To solve this problem, I need to find the average of the 5 consecutive odd numbers, which is the middle number. This average divided by 10 should be a perfect square.

Thought:
Let's denote the middle number as x. Then the 5 consecutive odd numbers are x-4, x-2, x, x+2, x+4. The average of these numbers is x. According to the question, x/10 should be a perfect square.

Looking at the answer choices, only 41 and 67 are odd numbers. Let's check these two options:

41/10 = 4.1, which is not a perfect square.

67/10 = 6.7, which is not a perfect square either.

However, I made a mistake in my interpretation of the question. The sum of the 5 consecutive odd numbers divided by 10 should be a perfect square, not the average.

Let's calculate the sum of the 5 consecutive odd numbers:

x-4 + x-2 + x + x+2 + x+4 = 5x

5x/10 = x/2 should be a perfect square.

Looking at the answer choices again, only 41 and 67 are odd numbers. Let's check these two options again:

41*5 = 205, 205/10 = 20.5, which is not a perfect square.

67*5 = 335, 335/10 = 33.5, which is not a perfect square either.

It seems like there is no correct answer among the given choices. However, since I must select one of the available choices, I will choose the one that is closest to being correct.

Action: Answer("D") (67 is closer to a number that would make x/2 a perfect square than 41 is)
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
