## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Assistant 2:
Reflection:
I made a conceptual error in my previous answer. I misunderstood the problem and incorrectly applied the least common multiple (LCM) concept. The problem states that 20% of the students took physics and 28% took math, and we need to find the least possible number of students in the school. To find this, we need to find the LCM of 20 and 28, but we also need to consider that there are more than 501 students in the school.

Thought:
The LCM of 20 and 28 is 140. However, since there are more than 501 students in the school, we need to find the smallest multiple of 140 that is greater than 501.

Action: Answer("D")

Explanation:
The smallest multiple of 140 that is greater than 501 is 700. Therefore, the least possible number of students in the school is 700.
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: E
Score: 0
