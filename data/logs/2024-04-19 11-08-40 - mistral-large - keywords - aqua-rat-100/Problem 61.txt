Question: Kevin drove from A to B at a constant speed of 70 mph. Once he reached B, he turned right around with pause, and returned to A at a constant speed of 90 mph. Exactly 3 hours before the end of his trip, he was still approaching B, only 70 miles away from it. What is the distance between A and B?
Choices:
  A: 180
  B: 90
  C: 270
  D: 360
  E: None of the above

## Assistant 2:
Reflection:
I previously made a calculation error when determining how long it took Kevin to travel from A to B. I incorrectly divided the distance by the speed, rather than using the formula time = distance/speed.

Thought:
First, we need to determine how long it took Kevin to travel the last 70 miles to B. Since he was traveling at a constant speed of 70 mph, it took him 1 hour (70 miles / 70 mph = 1 hour).

Since we know that 3 hours before the end of his trip, he was still approaching B, and it took him 1 hour to travel the last 70 miles to B, this means that the entire trip took 4 hours (3 hours + 1 hour = 4 hours).

Next, we need to determine how long it took Kevin to travel from A to B. Since he was traveling at a constant speed of 70 mph, and the entire trip took 4 hours, it took him 2 hours to travel from A to B (4 hours - 2 hours = 2 hours).

Finally, we can determine the distance between A and B by using the formula distance = speed x time. Since Kevin was traveling at a constant speed of 70 mph, and it took him 2 hours to travel from A to B, the distance between A and B is 140 miles (70 mph x 2 hours = 140 miles).

Action: Answer("E")

Note: None of the available choices match the correct answer, so the answer is "E: None of the above".
