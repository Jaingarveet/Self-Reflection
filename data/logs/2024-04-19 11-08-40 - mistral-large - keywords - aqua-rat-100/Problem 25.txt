Question: A car is being driven, in a straight line and at a uniform speed, towards the base of a vertical tower. The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower?
Choices:
  A: 5(√3 + 1)
  B: 6(√3 + √2)
  C: 7(√3 – 1)
  D: 8(√3 – 2)
  E: None of these

## Assistant 2:
Reflection:
I made an error in my previous answer by not considering the rate of change of the angle of elevation with respect to time.

Thought:
To solve this problem, I need to use trigonometry and the concept of similar triangles.
Let's denote the height of the tower as "h" and the distance from the car to the base of the tower as "x" when the angle of elevation is 45°.
Then, when the angle of elevation is 60°, the distance from the car to the base of the tower is "x - d", where "d" is the distance traveled by the car in 10 minutes.
Using the tangent function, we can write two equations:
tan(45°) = h/x
tan(60°) = h/(x - d)

Since tan(45°) = 1 and tan(60°) = √3, we can simplify the equations as:
h = x
h = √3(x - d)

Now, we can solve for "d" in terms of "x":
x = √3(x - d)
x = √3x - √3d
√3d = (√3 - 1)x
d = (√3 - 1)x/√3

We know that the car travels this distance "d" in 10 minutes. To find the time it takes to travel the remaining distance "x - d", we can set up a proportion:
(10 minutes) / d = t / (x - d)

Substituting the expression for "d" and solving for "t", we get:
t = (x - d) * 10 / d
t = (x - (√3 - 1)x/√3) * 10 / ((√3 - 1)x/√3)
t = (x/√3) * 10 / ((√3 - 1)x/√3)
t = 10 / (√3 - 1)
