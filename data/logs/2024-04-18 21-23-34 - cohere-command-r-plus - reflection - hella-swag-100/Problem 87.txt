Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to keep a cat out of potted plants [title] Use stones or rocks. [step] If you're struggling to keep your cat out of potted plants, a barrier method may be your best option to keep him out of the soil. Some owners find using rocks or stones can be a fun, aesthetically pleasing option.
Choices:
  A: A rock can be placed on the ground next to the plant that prevents your cat from accidentally planting it underneath the plant. [substeps] If you have your own small potted plant, try placing one rock or twig inside each plant.
  B: Block off any spaces around plant entrances to potted plants with rocks. [substeps] Make sure to check under the plants for broken glass, broken twigs, or other debris.
  C: [substeps] Lay the rocks around the base of the plant, making sure not to crush any stems or dig up the roots. When you water, the water should easily slip through the cracks of the rocks and get through to the soil.
  D: You can also create a barrier by setting up flat stones or pieces of furniture in small areas that your cat will be unable to easily get to. [substeps] Placing hidden objects above or below the plants is another suggestion.

Thought: 
The text describes using stones or rocks as a barrier method to keep cats out of potted plants.
Choice A describes placing a rock next to the plant, which doesn't create an effective barrier.
Choice B is about blocking spaces around plant entrances, which isn't relevant to potted plants.
Choice C mentions watering, which is not relevant to the topic and doesn't make sense in the context of the sentence.
Choice D describes creating a barrier with flat stones or furniture, which aligns with the topic and provides a logical conclusion to the previous steps.
Action: Answer("D")

Correct Answer: C
