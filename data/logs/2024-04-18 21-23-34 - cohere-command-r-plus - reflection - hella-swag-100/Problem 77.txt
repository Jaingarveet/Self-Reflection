Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to get rid of calluses on feet [title] Soak your feet on a regular basis. [step] If you have calluses, try soaking your feet on a regular basis to soften the dry and dead skin. Softening the skin with a warm water and mild soap foot bath will make removing that skin much easier.
Choices:
  A: [substeps] Fill a bowl with warm water and mild soap and add epsom salts. Gently immerse your feet in the bath for 10 to 15 minutes.
  B: The softer the skin on your feet, the less likely calluses will develop. Soak any areas that you have calluses on for at least thirty minutes.
  C: You may want to consider adding some dish soap to your foot bath to get your feet properly soaked. [title] Rinse off with warm water after soaking.
  D: [substeps] Use warm water instead of hot water. Hot water can dry out your skin and irritate your feet.

Thought: 
The text suggests that the next logical step would be to provide specific instructions for preparing and performing the foot soak. Choice A provides these instructions, including the use of warm water, mild soap, and epsom salts, which are commonly used for soothing foot baths.
