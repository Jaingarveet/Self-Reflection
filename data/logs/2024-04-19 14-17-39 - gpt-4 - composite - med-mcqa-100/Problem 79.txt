Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I miscalculated the average gain in length over 4 years. I underestimated the average yearly growth rate for children during the preschool years. 
Error Keywords:
- Calculation error
- Growth rate error
- Pediatric growth estimation error
Solution:
The average child grows about 5-6 cm per year during the preschool years (ages 3-5). Therefore, over a period of 4 years, the average length gain would be around 20-24 cm per year. Multiplying this by 4 years, we get a range of 80-96 cm. The closest answer to this range is [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Understand the average yearly growth rate for children in the specified age range.
2. Multiply the average yearly growth rate by the number of years specified in the question.
3. Compare your calculated result with the answer choices.
4. Choose the answer that is closest to your calculated result.
Advice:
- Always read the question carefully and understand what is being asked.
- Be aware of the average growth rates for children at different ages.
- Always double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
- Remember that growth rates can vary, so consider the answer that is closest to your calculated result.
