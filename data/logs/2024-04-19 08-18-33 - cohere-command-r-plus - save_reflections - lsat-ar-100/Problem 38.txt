## Get Reflection:
Explanation: 
I overlooked the condition that "K is placed on a higher shelf than F." 
This condition eliminates the option where I, K, and L are on the middle shelf because it would mean K is on the same shelf as F, contradicting the given condition. 
Error Keywords:
 - Oversight
 - Condition oversight
 - Contradiction oversight
Solution: 
Given conditions: 
- At least two books on each shelf
- More books on the bottom shelf than the top
- I is on the middle shelf
- K is on a higher shelf than F
- O is on a higher shelf than L
- F and M are on the same shelf

If G is placed on the top shelf, we know that the middle shelf must have at least two books, and K and F cannot be on the same shelf. 

The only option that satisfies all conditions is: 
- I, K, and L are on the middle shelf (D)

Instructions: 
1. Identify the given conditions and rules. 
2. Understand the question: If G is on the top shelf, which books could be on the middle shelf? 
3. For each choice, assess if it satisfies all conditions. 
4. Eliminate choices that contradict any condition. 
5. Choose the answer that remains viable after this process. 

Advice: 
 - Always read and re-read the conditions and rules to ensure you don't miss any. 
 - Break down complex conditions into simpler ones. 
 - Understand the implications of each condition and how they relate to each other. 
 - For shelf-organization questions, visualize the placement and consider all relationships between books and shelves. 
 - Double-check each choice against every condition to avoid oversights.
