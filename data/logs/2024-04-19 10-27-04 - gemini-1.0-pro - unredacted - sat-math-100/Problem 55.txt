## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:**
My initial reasoning was correct in identifying that the parabola opens downward due to the negative coefficient of the $x^2$ term. However, I made a mistake in determining the vertex's location and consequently the maximum point.
**Error Keywords:**
* Vertex identification error
* Maximum point misinterpretation
**Solution:**
1. **Analyze the equation:** The equation is in vertex form: $y = A(x - h)^2 + k$, where $(h, k)$ is the vertex.
2. **Identify the vertex:** In this case, $h = 3$ and $k = a$. Therefore, the vertex is at $(3, a)$.
3. **Determine the direction:** Since $A$ is negative, the parabola opens downward.
4. **Conclude about the maximum:** As the parabola opens downward, the vertex represents the maximum point.
**Instructions for Future:**
1. Carefully analyze the equation to identify its form (e.g., vertex, standard, etc.).
2. Accurately pinpoint the vertex's coordinates based on the identified form.
3. Determine the direction of the parabola based on the coefficient of the $x^2$ term.
4. Relate the vertex's location and the parabola's direction to identify the minimum/maximum point.
**General Advice:**
* **Visualize:** Sketching a rough graph of the parabola can aid in understanding its behavior.
* **Double-check:** Review each step of the reasoning to ensure no errors in logic or calculation.
* **Practice:** Solve similar problems to solidify understanding and avoid repeating mistakes.
* **Seek clarification:** If unsure about any aspect, consult resources or seek help from others.
