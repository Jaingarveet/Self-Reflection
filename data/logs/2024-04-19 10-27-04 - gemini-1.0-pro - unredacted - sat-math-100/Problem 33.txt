# Model: gemini-1.0-pro | Agent: unredacted | Exam: sat-math-100 | Problem 33 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:**
I incorrectly identified the standard equation of a circle. While I correctly plugged in the given center and radius, I used the wrong signs for the differences in the equation. This led me to choose answer choice C instead of the correct answer, A.
**Error Keywords:**
* Sign error
* Equation manipulation error
* Standard equation of a circle error
**Solution:**
1. Recall the standard equation of a circle: $(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2$, where $(h, k)$ is the center and $r$ is the radius.
2. Identify the given center $(5, 7)$ and radius $2$.
3. Substitute these values into the standard equation: $(x - 5)^2 + (y - 7)^2 = 2^2$.
4. Simplify the equation: $(x - 5)^2 + (y - 7)^2 = 4$.
**Instructions for Future:**
1. Memorize the standard equation of a circle.
2. Carefully identify the center and radius from the given information.
3. Substitute the values into the standard equation without making sign errors.
4. Simplify the equation and compare it to the answer choices.
**General Advice:**
* Double-check calculations and ensure correct signs are used.
* Visualize the problem and the geometric interpretation of the equation.
* Practice solving similar problems to solidify understanding.
* Be mindful of common errors and learn from mistakes.
