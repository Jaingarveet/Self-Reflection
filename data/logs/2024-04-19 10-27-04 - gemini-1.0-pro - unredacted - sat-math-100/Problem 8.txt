## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Question: Alma bought a laptop computer at a store that gave a 20 percent discount off its original price. The total amount she paid to the cashier was $p$ dollars, including an 8 percent sales tax on the discounted price. Which of the following represents the original price of the computer in terms of $p$ ?
Choices:
  A: $0.88 p$
  B: $\frac{p}{0.88}$
  C: $(0.8)(1.08) p$
  D: $\frac{p}{(0.8)(1.08)}$

Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I incorrectly calculated the original price of the computer. 
I made a mistake in the order of operations when calculating the final price. 
I should have first calculated the discounted price and then added the sales tax.
Error Keywords:
 - Order of operations error
 - Calculation error
 - Discount and tax calculation error
Solution:
Let x be the original price of the computer.
After a 20% discount, the price becomes 0.8x.
An 8% sales tax is added, resulting in a final price of 1.08(0.8x) = 0.864x.
We are given that the final price is p dollars, so 0.864x = p.
To isolate x, we divide both sides by 0.864: x = p / 0.864.
The original price of the computer is p / 0.864, which can be written as p / (0.8)(1.08).
Instructions:
1. Identify the original price of the computer as x.
2. Calculate the discounted price by multiplying the original price by (1 - discount).
3. Calculate the final price by multiplying the discounted price by (1 + sales tax).
4. Set the final price equal to p dollars.
5. Solve for x by isolating it on one side of the equation.
6. Express the original price in terms of p.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember the order of operations: parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), addition and subtraction (from left to right).

Thought: 
The original price of the computer is $x$.
After a 20% discount, the price becomes 0.8x.
An 8% sales tax is added, resulting in a final price of 1.08(0.8x) = 0.864x.
We are given that the final price is $p$ dollars, so 0.864x = p.
To isolate x, we divide both sides by 0.864: x = p / 0.864.
The original price of the computer is p / 0.864, which can be written as p / (0.8)(1.08).
