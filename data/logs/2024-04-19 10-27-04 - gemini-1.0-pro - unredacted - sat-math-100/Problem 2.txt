# Model: gemini-1.0-pro | Agent: unredacted | Exam: sat-math-100 | Problem 2 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Explanation:
My initial thought process was correct in terms of distributing the negative sign and combining like terms. However, I made a mistake while combining the $x^2y$ terms. I incorrectly added them instead of subtracting them, leading to an inaccurate final answer.
## Error Keywords:
* Sign error
* Combining like terms error
* Addition/subtraction error
## Solution:
1. Distribute the negative sign:
$$(x^{2} y-3 y^{2}+5 x y^{2}) - (-x^{2} y+3 x y^{2}-3 y^{2}) =$$
$$x^{2} y-3 y^{2}+5 x y^{2} + x^{2} y-3 x y^{2}+3 y^{2}$$
2. Combine like terms:
* Combine $x^2y$ terms: $x^2 y + x^2 y = 2x^2 y$
* Combine $xy^2$ terms: $5xy^2 - 3xy^2 = 2xy^2$
* Combine $y^2$ terms: $-3y^2 + 3y^2 = 0$
3. Final expression:
$$2x^2 y + 2xy^2$$
## Instructions:
1. Carefully distribute any negative signs.
2. Identify like terms (terms with the same variables and exponents).
3. Combine like terms by adding or subtracting their coefficients, depending on their signs.
4. Double-check your calculations and ensure all like terms are combined.
5. Write the final simplified expression.
## General Advice:
* Pay close attention to signs when distributing or combining terms.
* Double-check your calculations to avoid arithmetic errors.
* Organize your work to keep track of like terms and their coefficients.
* If unsure, break down the problem into smaller steps and tackle them one at a time.
* Practice similar problems to solidify your understanding and avoid repeating mistakes.
