## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:**
My initial approach was correct in attempting to solve the system of equations using substitution. However, I made an error in the calculation of $x$ after substituting the value of $y$. Instead of $-31$, I incorrectly calculated $x$ as $-19$. This resulted in selecting the wrong answer choice.
**Error Keywords:**
* Calculation error
* Substitution error
* Sign error
**Solution:**
Following the correct steps of substitution:
1. From the second equation, $x = 2y - 19$.
2. Substitute this expression for $x$ in the first equation: $3(2y - 19) + 4y = -23$.
3. Simplify and solve for $y$: $6y - 57 + 4y = -23$, $10y = 34$, $y = \dfrac{34}{10}$, $y = \dfrac{17}{5}$.
4. Substitute the value of $y$ back into the second equation to solve for $x$: $2(\dfrac{17}{5}) - x = -19$, $\dfrac{34}{5} - x = -19$, $x = \dfrac{34}{5} + 19$, $x = \dfrac{133}{5}$.
5. Therefore, the correct solution to the system of equations is $(x, y) = (\dfrac{133}{5}, \dfrac{17}{5})$.
**Instructions for Future:**
1. Carefully perform calculations, paying close attention to signs and operations.
2. Double-check calculations before moving to the next step.
3. Use a calculator for complex calculations to minimize manual errors.
4. Review the solution process to identify any potential mistakes.
**General Advice:**
* Understand the underlying concepts of the problem before attempting to solve it.
* Choose an appropriate method for solving the problem based on its type.
* Break down complex problems into smaller, manageable steps.
* Be meticulous and organized in your calculations and reasoning.
* Always double-check your work before finalizing your answer.
