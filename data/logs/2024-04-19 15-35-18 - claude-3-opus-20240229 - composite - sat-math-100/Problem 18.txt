## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: Which of the following is equivalent to $9^{\frac{3}{4}}$ ?
Choices:
  A: $\sqrt[3]{9}$
  B: $\sqrt[4]{9}$
  C: $\sqrt{3}$
  D: $3 \sqrt{3}$
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I made an error in my understanding of the properties of exponents. I incorrectly interpreted $9^{\frac{3}{4}}$ as $(9^3)^{\frac{1}{4}}$, which is not correct. The correct interpretation is that $9^{\frac{3}{4}} = (9^{\frac{1}{4}})^3$, as per the rules of exponents.
Error Keywords:
 - Misunderstanding of exponent properties
 - Incorrect order of operations with exponents
 - Misinterpretation of fractional exponents
Solution:
$9^{\frac{3}{4}}$ can be rewritten as $(9^{\frac{1}{4}})^3$ according to the properties of exponents.
$9^{\frac{1}{4}} = \sqrt[4]{9} = \sqrt{\sqrt{9}} = \sqrt{3}$ 
Therefore, $9^{\frac{3}{4}} = (\sqrt{3})^3 = \sqrt{3} \cdot \sqrt{3} \cdot \sqrt{3} = 3\sqrt{3}$
Instructions:
1. Identify the base number and the exponent.
2. If the exponent is a fraction, rewrite the expression according to the properties of exponents: $(a^{\frac{m}{n}}) = (\sqrt[n]{a})^m = (a^{\frac{1}{n}})^m$.
3. Simplify the inner expression first, i.e., $a^{\frac{1}{n}}$.
4. Then, raise the simplified inner expression to the power of the numerator of the original exponent.
5. Simplify the resulting expression if possible.
6. Choose the answer that matches your simplified expression.
Advice:
 - Always keep the properties of exponents in mind, especially when dealing with fractional exponents.
 - Remember that $a^{\frac{m}{n}} = (\sqrt[n]{a})^m = (a^{\frac{1}{n}})^m$, not $(a^m)^{\frac{1}{n}}$.
 - Always simplify expressions step by step, following the correct order of operations.
 - If you're unsure about a property or rule, take a moment to verify it before proceeding.
 - Double-check your work to catch any errors in your calculations or reasoning.
## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's approach this step-by-step using the instructions and advice from the reflection:
1. The base number is 9 and the exponent is $\frac{3}{4}$.
2. Since the exponent is a fraction, we can rewrite the expression according to the properties of exponents:
   $9^{\frac{3}{4}} = (9^{\frac{1}{4}})^3$
3. Now, let's simplify the inner expression $9^{\frac{1}{4}}$:
   $9^{\frac{1}{4}} = \sqrt[4]{9} = \sqrt{\sqrt{9}} = \sqrt{3}$
4. Next, we raise the simplified inner expression to the power of the numerator of the original exponent, which is 3:
   $(9^{\frac{1}{4}})^3 = (\sqrt{3})^3 = \sqrt{3} \cdot \sqrt{3} \cdot \sqrt{3}$
5. Simplify the resulting expression:
   $\sqrt{3} \cdot \sqrt{3} \cdot \sqrt{3} = 3\sqrt{3}$
6. Looking at the answer choices, the expression $3\sqrt{3}$ matches choice D.
Therefore, the correct answer is D: $3\sqrt{3}$.
