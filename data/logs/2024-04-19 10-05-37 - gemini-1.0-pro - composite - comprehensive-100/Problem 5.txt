## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

  E: 27
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I made a mistake in the calculation of the sum of the ages of the members. I used the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series, but I did not take into account the fact that the youngest member is 7 years old.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Arithmetic series error
 - Age calculation error
Solution:
Let the number of members in the club be n.
Then, the sum of the ages of all the members = 7 + (7 + 3) + (7 + 6) + ... + (7 + 3(n - 1))
= n(7 + 3(n - 1))/2
= [REDACTED]0
=> n(7 + 3n - 3) = 500
=> n(3n + 4) = 500
=> 3n^2 + 4n - 500 = 0
=> 3n^2 + 30n - [REDACTED]n - 500 = 0
=> 3n(n + 10) - [REDACTED](n + 10) = 0
=> (3n - [REDACTED])(n + 10) = 0
=> n = [REDACTED] or n = -10
Since, the number of members cannot be negative, therefore n = [REDACTED].
The sum of the ages of the members is [REDACTED]0.
The average age of the members is [REDACTED]0/[REDACTED] = 9.61 years.
The youngest member is 7 years old.
The oldest member is 7 + 3([REDACTED] - 1) = 80 years old.
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and understand the problem.
2. Identify the given information and what is being asked.
3. Determine the appropriate formula or method to solve the problem.
4. Apply the formula or method step-by-step.
5. Check your calculations and answer.
6. Make sure your answer is consistent with the given information.
Advice:
- Be careful with calculations and double-check your work.
- Pay attention to units and make sure they are consistent.
- Consider all possible cases and scenarios.
- Use common sense and logic to check your answer.
- If you get stuck, try to break down the problem into smaller parts.
- Don't be afraid to ask for help if you need it.
