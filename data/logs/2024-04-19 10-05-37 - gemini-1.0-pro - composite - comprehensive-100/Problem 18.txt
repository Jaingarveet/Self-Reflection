## System:
You are an expert in Logic.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:

## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Logic
Context: A laboratory has three types of robots, A.B, and C.Type A can recognize colors, type B can recognize shapes, and type C can neither recognize colors nor shapes.The laboratory experimented with robots 1 and 2 with red balls, blue balls, red squares, and blue squares, and ordered them to pick up the red balls, but number 1 picked up the red squares, and number 2 picked up the blue balls.
Question: Based on the above experiment, which of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Both No.1 and No.2 are type C.
  B: Only one of No.1 and No.2 is C type.
  C: No.1 is type A and No.2 is type B.
  D: No.1 is not Type B and No.2 is not Type A.
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that the robots could only recognize one type of object (either colors or shapes). However, the robots could potentially recognize both colors and shapes.
Error Keywords:
- Oversimplification
- Incomplete analysis
- Ignoring possibilities
Solution:
Robot 1 picked up the red squares, which means it can recognize shapes.
Robot 2 picked up the blue balls, which means it can recognize colors.
However, we don't know if they can recognize both colors and shapes.
Therefore, we cannot determine the specific types of robots 1 and 2.
Instructions:
1. Identify the capabilities of each robot based on the experiment.
2. Consider all possible combinations of capabilities for each robot.
3. Eliminate options that are contradicted by the experiment.
4. Choose the option that is consistent with all observations.
Advice:
- Avoid making assumptions that are not explicitly stated.
- Consider all possible scenarios before drawing conclusions.
- Be cautious about eliminating options without sufficient evidence.
- Remember that the absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.
