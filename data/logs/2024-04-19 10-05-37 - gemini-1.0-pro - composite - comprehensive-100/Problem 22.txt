Topic: Law
Context: Of the eight students—George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert—in a seminar, exactly six will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
Question: If George, Nina, and Robert give reports and they do so on different days from one another, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Helen gives a report on Wednesday.
  B: Nina gives a report on Monday.
  C: Nina gives a report on Tuesday.
  D: Olivia gives a report on Monday.
  E: Robert gives a report on Wednesday.

Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that Nina's report could not be on Wednesday. 
I overlooked the exception in the rule about Nina's report. 
I focused too much on the constraint about Nina's report and did not consider the possibility that the exception could apply.
Error Keywords:
 - Rule-based reasoning error
 - Exception handling error
 - Overlooking exception
Solution:
George, Nina, and Robert give reports on different days.
George can only give a report on Tuesday.
Nina's report cannot be on Wednesday.
Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports.
If Nina gives a report, then Helen and Irving must both give reports the next day, unless Nina's report is on Wednesday.
Nina's report cannot be on Wednesday because George and Robert are giving reports on the other two days.
Therefore, Nina must give a report on Tuesday.
Since Nina gives a report on Tuesday, Helen and Irving must both give reports on Wednesday.
Therefore, [REDACTED]
