## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: At its maximum speed, a space shuttle can travel 700m high in 40 seconds. It will also take 5 seconds to pass a point. What then is the length of the space shuttle?
Choices:
  A: 50 m
  B: 75 m
  C: 100 m
  D: 125 m
  E: 150 m
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I incorrectly calculated the length of the space shuttle by multiplying its speed by the time it takes to pass a point. This is incorrect because the time it takes to pass a point is not the same as the time it takes to travel its own length.
Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation of the problem
- Incorrect application of speed formula
- Confusion between distance and time
Solution:
1. Identify the given information:
    - Maximum speed: 700 m/s
    - Time to travel 700 m high: 40 seconds
    - Time to pass a point: 5 seconds
2. Calculate the actual speed:
    - Speed = Distance / Time
    - Speed = 700 m / 40 s
    - Speed = 17.5 m/s
3. Calculate the length of the space shuttle:
    - Length = Speed * Time (to pass a point)
    - Length = 17.5 m/s * 5 s
    - Length = 87.5 m
4. Choose the answer that matches the calculated length:
    - Answer: [REDACTED] ([REDACTED]) - closest to the calculated length of 87.5 m
Instructions:
1. Carefully read the problem and identify all given information.
2. Determine the specific values that need to be calculated.
3. Apply the appropriate formulas or concepts to calculate the required values.
4. Double-check your calculations and ensure they are consistent with the problem.
5. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
General Advice:
- Pay close attention to the wording of the problem and what is being asked.
- Break down complex problems into smaller, more manageable steps.
- Use the correct formulas and concepts for the specific problem you are solving.
- Double-check your calculations and reasoning to avoid errors.
- Consider alternative approaches or interpretations if your initial solution doesn't seem right.
