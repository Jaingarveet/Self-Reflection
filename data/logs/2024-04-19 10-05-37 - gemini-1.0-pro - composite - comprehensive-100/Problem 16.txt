## Assistant 2:
I understand. I will use my self-reflection to answer this question correctly.
**Thought:**
* **Prince Lima in Li Na's mind is tall, handsome, and a doctor.**
* **There are four men: Wang Wei, Wu Gang, Li Qiang, and Liu Dawei.**
* **One of them meets all the conditions.**
* **Among the four men:**
    * **Three are tall.**
    * **Two are doctors.**
    * **One is handsome.**
* **Wang Wei and Wu Gang are both doctors.**
* **Liu Dawei and Li Qiang are the same height.**
* **Li Qiang and Wang Wei are not both tall.**
**Analysis:**
* Since Wang Wei and Wu Gang are both doctors, and only one person meets all the conditions, neither of them can be the Prince Lima in Li Na's mind.
* Since Li Qiang and Wang Wei are not both tall, and there are only three tall men, Li Qiang must be tall.
* Since Liu Dawei and Li Qiang are the same height, and Li Qiang is tall, Liu Dawei must also be tall.
* Therefore, the only man who is tall, handsome, and a doctor is **Wu Gang**.
**Action:** Answer("C")
## Result:
