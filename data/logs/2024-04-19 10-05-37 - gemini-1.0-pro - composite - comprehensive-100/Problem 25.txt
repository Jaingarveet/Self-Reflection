## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
Let's try to place the pharmacy and the restaurants first. We know that the pharmacy must be at one end and one of the restaurants at the other. We also know that the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. This means that the only possible arrangements for the pharmacy and the restaurants are:
Pharmacy, Restaurant, [REDACTED], [REDACTED], [REDACTED], Restaurant, [REDACTED]
[REDACTED], Restaurant, [REDACTED], [REDACTED], [REDACTED], Restaurant, Pharmacy
Now, let's consider the constraint that the pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. We can see that in the first arrangement, the pharmacy is next to the optometrist, and in the second arrangement, the pharmacy is next to the veterinarian.
Finally, let's consider the constraint that the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian. We can see that in both arrangements, the toy store is not next to the veterinarian.
Therefore, both of the following arrangements are possible:
Pharmacy, Restaurant, [REDACTED], [REDACTED], [REDACTED], Restaurant, [REDACTED]
[REDACTED], Restaurant, [REDACTED], [REDACTED], [REDACTED], Restaurant, Pharmacy
Now, let's fill in the remaining spaces with the other businesses. We know that the shoe store and the toy store must be placed in the remaining spaces. We also know that the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
Let's consider the first arrangement:
Pharmacy, Restaurant, [REDACTED], [REDACTED], [REDACTED], Restaurant, [REDACTED]
We can place the shoe store in any of the remaining spaces except for the space next to the veterinarian. This means that the shoe store can be placed in spaces 3, 4, or 5.
If the shoe store is placed in space 3, then the toy store must be placed in space 6.
If the shoe store is placed in space 4, then the toy store must be placed in space 5.
If the shoe store is placed in space 5, then the toy store must be placed in space 4.
Therefore, the following three arrangements are possible:
Pharmacy, Restaurant, Shoe Store, [REDACTED], [REDACTED], Restaurant, Toy Store
Pharmacy, Restaurant, [REDACTED], Shoe Store, [REDACTED], Restaurant, Toy Store
Pharmacy, Restaurant, [REDACTED], [REDACTED], Shoe Store, Restaurant, Toy Store
Let's consider the second arrangement:
[REDACTED], Restaurant, [REDACTED], [REDACTED], [REDACTED], Restaurant, Pharmacy
We can place the shoe store in any of the remaining spaces except for the space next to the veterinarian. This means that the shoe store can be placed in spaces 2, 3, or 4.
If the shoe store is placed in space 2, then the toy store must be placed in space 5.
If the shoe store is placed in space 3, then the toy store must be placed in space 4.
If the shoe store is placed in space 4, then the toy store must be placed in space 3.
Therefore, the following three arrangements are possible:
[REDACTED], Restaurant, Shoe Store, [REDACTED], [REDACTED], Restaurant, Pharmacy
[REDACTED], Restaurant, [REDACTED], Shoe Store, [REDACTED], Restaurant, Pharmacy
[REDACTED], Restaurant, [REDACTED], [REDACTED], Shoe Store, Restaurant, Pharmacy
Therefore, the following six arrangements are possible:
Pharmacy, Restaurant, Shoe Store, [REDACTED], [REDACTED], Restaurant, Toy Store
Pharmacy, Restaurant, [REDACTED], Shoe Store, [REDACTED], Restaurant, Toy Store
Pharmacy, Restaurant, [REDACTED], [REDACTED], Shoe Store, Restaurant, Toy Store
[REDACTED], Restaurant, Shoe Store, [REDACTED], [REDACTED], Restaurant, Pharmacy
[REDACTED], Restaurant, [REDACTED], Shoe Store, [REDACTED], Restaurant, Pharmacy
[REDACTED], Restaurant, [REDACTED], [REDACTED], Shoe Store, Restaurant, Pharmacy
Now, let's fill in the remaining spaces with the optometrist and the veterinarian. We know that the pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. We also know that the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
Let's consider the first arrangement:
Pharmacy, Restaurant, Shoe Store, [REDACTED], [REDACTED], Restaurant, Toy Store
We can place the optometrist in space 4 and the veterinarian in space 5.
We can also place the optometrist in space 5 and the veterinarian in space 4.
Therefore, the following two arrangements are possible:
Pharmacy, Restaurant, Shoe Store, Optometrist, Veterinarian, Restaurant, Toy Store
Pharmacy, Restaurant, Shoe Store, Veterinarian, Optometrist, Restaurant, Toy Store
Let's consider the second arrangement:
Pharmacy, Restaurant, [REDACTED], Shoe Store, [REDACTED], Restaurant, Toy Store
We can place the optometrist in space 3 and the veterinarian in space 4.
We can also place the optometrist in space 4 and the veterinarian in space 3.
Therefore, the following two arrangements are possible:
Pharmacy, Restaurant, Optometrist, Shoe Store, Veterinarian, Restaurant, Toy Store
Pharmacy, Restaurant, Veterinarian, Shoe Store, Optometrist, Restaurant, Toy Store
Let's consider the third arrangement:
Pharmacy, Restaurant, [REDACTED], [REDACTED], Shoe Store, Restaurant, Toy Store
We can place the optometrist in space 3 and the veterinarian in space 2.
We can also place the optometrist in space 2 and the veterinarian in space 3.
Therefore, the following two arrangements are possible:
Pharmacy, Restaurant, Optometrist, [REDACTED], Shoe Store, Restaurant, Toy Store
Pharmacy, Restaurant, Veterinarian, [REDACTED], Shoe Store, Restaurant, Toy Store
Let's consider the fourth arrangement:
[REDACTED], Restaurant, Shoe Store, [REDACTED], [REDACTED], Restaurant, Pharmacy

Therefore, the following two arrangements are possible:
[REDACTED], Restaurant, Optometrist, Shoe Store, [REDACTED], Restaurant, Pharmacy
[REDACTED], Restaurant, Veterinarian, Shoe Store, [REDACTED], Restaurant, Pharmacy
Let's consider the fifth arrangement:
[REDACTED], Restaurant, [REDACTED], Shoe Store, [REDACTED], Restaurant, Pharmacy
We can place the optometrist in space 2 and the veterinarian in space 4.
We can also place the optometrist in space 4 and the veterinarian in space 2.
Therefore, the following two arrangements are possible:
[REDACTED], Restaurant, Optometrist, [REDACTED], Shoe Store, Restaurant, Pharmacy
[REDACTED], Restaurant, Veterinarian, [REDACTED], Shoe Store, Restaurant, Pharmacy
Let's consider the sixth arrangement:
[REDACTED], Restaurant, [REDACTED], [REDACTED], Shoe Store, Restaurant, Pharmacy
We can place the optometrist in space 2 and the veterinarian in space 3.
We can also place the optometrist in space 3 and the veterinarian in space 2.
