Question: In 2015 the populations of City $\mathrm{X}$ and City $\mathrm{Y}$ were equal. From 2010 to 2015, the population of City X increased by $20 \%$ and the population of City $\mathrm{Y}$ decreased by $10 \%$. If the population of City $\mathrm{X}$ was 120,000 in 2010, what was the population of City Y in 2010 ?
Choices:
  A: 60,000
  B: 90,000
  C: 160,000
  D: 240,000
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I made a mistake in setting up the equation that represents the equality of the populations in 2015. I incorrectly assumed that the population of City X in 2015 was 1.2 times the population of City Y in 2010, when it should have been 1.2 times the population of City X in 2010.
Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation
- Incorrect equation setup
- Population growth/decline calculation error
Solution:
Let $x$ be the population of City Y in 2010.
In 2010, the population of City X was 120,000.
From 2010 to 2015, the population of City X increased by 20%, so in 2015 it was 1.2 * 120,000 = 144,000.
From 2010 to 2015, the population of City Y decreased by 10%, so in 2015 it was 0.9 * $x$.
Since the populations were equal in 2015, we have 144,000 = 0.9 * $x$.
Solving for $x$, we get $x = 144,000 / 0.9 = 1[REDACTED]$.
Instructions:
1. Carefully read the problem and identify the key information.
2. Define variables to represent the unknowns.
3. Translate the problem into mathematical equations based on the given information.
4. Pay close attention to population growth/decline rates and ensure calculations are performed correctly.
5. Solve the equations to find the desired value.
6. Double-check your calculations and reasoning to ensure the solution is correct.
General Advice:
- When dealing with word problems, take your time to understand the context and identify the relevant information.
- Clearly define variables and use them consistently throughout your calculations.
- Translate the problem into equations step-by-step, ensuring each equation accurately reflects the given information.
- Be mindful of units and ensure they are consistent throughout the problem.
- Double-check your calculations and reasoning to avoid careless mistakes.
- If you get stuck, try to break down the problem into smaller, more manageable parts.
- Consider using different approaches or representations to solve the problem.
- Don't be afraid to ask for help or clarification if needed.
