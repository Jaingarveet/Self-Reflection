## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The key to solving this problem is focusing on the restrictions placed on the Himalayan and Rottweiler breeds.  Himalayans are featured on three days, but not on day 1 or day 7, and Rottweilers cannot be on the same day as a Himalayan or on day 7. This limits the possible positions for these two breeds significantly.
