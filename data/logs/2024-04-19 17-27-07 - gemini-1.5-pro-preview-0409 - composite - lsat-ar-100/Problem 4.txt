Context: A chemistry class has six lab sessions scheduled over three days—Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday—one session heing held each morning and one each afternoon. Each session will be led by a different lab assistant—Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, or Rebecca. The assignment of lab assistants to sessions is constrained as follows: Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day. Nessa must lead an afternoon session. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
Question: If Lan does not lead a Wednesday session, then which one of the following lab assistants must lead a Thursday session?
Choices:
  A: Rebecca
  B: Olivia
  C: Nessa
  D: Kevin
  E: Julio

## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The key constraint here is that Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions on the same day. If Lan is not on Wednesday, then Olivia must be on Wednesday. This leaves Thursday and Friday for Lan. Since the question asks who MUST lead a Thursday session, and Lan could be on either Thursday or Friday, we cannot definitively say it's Lan. 
We need to analyze other constraints. 
*   Kevin and Rebecca must be on the same day, but this doesn't necessarily mean Thursday.
*   Nessa must be in the afternoon, but this doesn't specify a day.
*   Julio's session is earlier in the week than Olivia's, meaning Julio cannot be on Friday (since Olivia is already on Wednesday). This leaves only Wednesday or Thursday for Julio.
Therefore, the only person who MUST be on Thursday is Julio.
