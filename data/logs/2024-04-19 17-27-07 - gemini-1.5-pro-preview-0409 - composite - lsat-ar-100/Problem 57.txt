Context: Of the eight students—George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert—in a seminar, exactly six will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
Question: Which one of the following is a pair of students who, if they give reports on the same day as each other, must give reports on Wednesday?
Choices:
  A: George and Lenore
  B: Helen and Nina
  C: Irving and Robert
  D: Kyle and Nina
  E: Olivia and Kyle

## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The key to solving this is focusing on the constraint around Nina's presentation day. If Nina presents, then both Helen and Irving must present the next day. This immediately eliminates options B, C, and E, as they involve pairings with either Helen or Irving, which would contradict the given condition. 
Now, we are left with options A (George and Lenore) and D (Kyle and Nina). We know George must present on Tuesday. If Nina and Kyle present on the same day, it cannot be Tuesday due to George's constraint. If Nina presents on Monday, then Helen and Irving must present on Tuesday, again conflicting with George's Tuesday presentation. Therefore, the only possibility for Nina and Kyle to present on the same day without causing a conflict is Wednesday.
Action: Answer("D") 
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: B
