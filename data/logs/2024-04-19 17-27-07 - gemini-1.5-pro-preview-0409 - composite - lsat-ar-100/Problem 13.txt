## Reflection on Previous Error:
**Error Keywords:** Scheduling, Conditional Reasoning, Logical Constraints
**Solution:**
1. **Analyze Constraints:** Carefully review each condition and its implications for the schedule.
2. **Eliminate Possibilities:** Use the constraints to eliminate impossible scenarios and narrow down options.
3. **Consider Combinations:** Explore different combinations of witness schedules that satisfy all conditions.
4. **Verify Against Question:** Ensure the chosen answer aligns with the specific question asked.
**Instructions:**
1. **Focus on the given condition:** Franco and Hong testify on the same day.
2. **Utilize other constraints:** Remember Iturbe testifies on Wednesday, and Hong doesn't testify on Monday.
3. **Deduce implications:** Determine the possible day for Franco and Hong based on remaining options.
4. **Choose the MUST be true option:** Select the answer that is always true based on the deductions.
**Advice:**
* **Avoid assumptions:** Don't make assumptions beyond the given information.
* **Consider all possibilities:** Explore all valid combinations before choosing an answer.
* **Double-check logic:** Ensure each step of reasoning is sound and follows from the constraints.
## Answering the Question:
Given Franco and Hong testify on the same day, and considering the other constraints:
* **Hong cannot be on Monday:** This leaves Tuesday or Wednesday for both.
* **Iturbe is on Wednesday:** So, Franco and Hong cannot be on Wednesday.
* **Therefore, Franco and Hong must be on Tuesday.**
Analyzing the options:
* **A, C, E are not necessarily true:** They involve Wednesday, which is ruled out.
* **B is not necessarily true:** Garcia's schedule is not directly determined.
* **D is MUST be true:** Hong is indeed scheduled for Tuesday.
**Action: Answer("D")** 
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
