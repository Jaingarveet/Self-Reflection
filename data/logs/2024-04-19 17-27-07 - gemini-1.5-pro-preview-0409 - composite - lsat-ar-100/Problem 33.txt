Context: The organizer of a reading club will select at least five and at most six works from a group of nine works.

## Analysis of Choices Based on Reflection:
Based on my previous error and the reflection provided, I will focus on the constraints related to the number of novels and plays, as well as the balance between French and Russian works.
**A: No Russian novels and exactly one play are selected.** 
This could be possible if the play is French and there are 3-4 French novels selected. 
**B: Exactly one Russian novel and both French plays are selected.**
This violates the rule that if both French plays are selected, the Russian play cannot be. 
**C: Exactly two French novels and the Russian play are selected.**
This is possible as it satisfies the novel and play requirements and maintains the balance between French and Russian works.
**D: Exactly two French novels and exactly two plays are selected.**
This could be possible if one play is French and the other is Russian, fulfilling the requirements.
**E: Exactly two Russian novels and exactly one play are selected.**
This violates the rule that there must be at least as many French novels as Russian novels.
