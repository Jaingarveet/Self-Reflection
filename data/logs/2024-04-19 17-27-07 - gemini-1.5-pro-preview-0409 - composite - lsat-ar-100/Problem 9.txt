Topic: Law
Context: An administrator must assign parking spaces to six new employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young. Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
Question: If Young is assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Togowa is assigned parking space #1.
  B: Young is assigned parking space #2.
  C: Robertson is assigned parking space #3.
  D: Souza is assigned parking space #3.
  E: Vaughn is assigned parking space #4.

## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The key to solving this question is focusing on the relationships between employees and parking space numbers, as dictated by the rules. We know:
*   Young > Togowa (Young gets a higher number than Togowa)
*   Xu > Souza
*   Robertson > Young
*   Robertson gets one of #1-4
If Young is assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, it means Young cannot be in space #1 or #2 (as those would be lower than Souza's potential #3). This eliminates options A and B.
Option C states Robertson is in #3. This would mean Young and Xu must be in #4-6, leaving Souza with #1 or #2, satisfying the condition Young > Souza. So, option C is possible.
Option D puts Souza in #3. This would force Young into #4-6 and Robertson into #1 or #2. This violates the rule Robertson > Young. So, option D is not possible.
Option E doesn't provide enough information to determine the relative positions of Young and Souza, so we cannot conclude if it's true or not.
Therefore, the only option that could be true given the condition is C.
Action: Answer("C")
