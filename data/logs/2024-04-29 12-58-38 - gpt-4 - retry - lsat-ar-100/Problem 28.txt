## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types. We already have a botanist (F), a chemist (L), and two zoologists (Q and R). We need another chemist because K and M cannot both be selected and K cannot be selected with F. So, the only option left is M. But if M is selected, both P and R must be selected. R is already selected, so P must be the fifth scientist.
Action: Answer("E")
