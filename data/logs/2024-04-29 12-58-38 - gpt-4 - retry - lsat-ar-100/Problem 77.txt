## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The rules state that:
1. Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
2. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
3. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
4. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
From rule 3 and 4, Robertson can only be assigned parking space #1, #2, or #3 because he must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. So, Young can only be assigned parking space #1 or #2. 
From rule 1, Togowa can only be assigned parking space #1 because Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
So, the assignment of a parking space is limited to one of only two possible spaces for Young and Togowa.
Action: Answer("B")
