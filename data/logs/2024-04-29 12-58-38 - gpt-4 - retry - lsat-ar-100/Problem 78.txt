Topic: Law
Context: Of the eight students—George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert—in a seminar, exactly six will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
Question: If George, Nina, and Robert give reports and they do so on different days from one another, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Helen gives a report on Wednesday.
  B: Nina gives a report on Monday.
  C: Nina gives a report on Tuesday.
  D: Olivia gives a report on Monday.
  E: Robert gives a report on Wednesday.

## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
George can only give a report on Tuesday. 
Robert cannot give an afternoon report, so he must give a morning report. 
If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. 
So, if George, Nina, and Robert give reports on different days, Nina cannot give a report on Monday because Helen and Irving would have to give reports on Tuesday, but George is already giving a report on Tuesday. 
Nina also cannot give a report on Tuesday because Helen and Irving would have to give reports on Wednesday, but there are only two slots on Wednesday and one of them is taken by Robert. 
Therefore, Nina must give a report on Wednesday. 
This means that Robert must give a report on Monday and George on Tuesday. 
So, Helen cannot give a report on Wednesday because all slots on Wednesday are taken. 
Therefore, the only possible answer is D: Olivia gives a report on Monday.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
