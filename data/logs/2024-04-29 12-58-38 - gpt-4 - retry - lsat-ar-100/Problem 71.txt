## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
From the conditions, we know that Parra and Quinn work in the same zone, and Stuckey and Udall work in the same zone. Also, either Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1, and either Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2. This means that Parra and Quinn cannot be in Zone 1 or 2, so they must be in Zone 3. Similarly, Stuckey and Udall cannot be in Zone 1, so they must be in Zone 2 or 3. Since there are more representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, Stuckey and Udall must also be in Zone 3. Therefore, the representatives in Zone 3 could be Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, and Udall.
Action: Answer("E")
