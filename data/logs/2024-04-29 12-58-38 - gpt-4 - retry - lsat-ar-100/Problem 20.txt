## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Kyle and Lenore are not giving reports, so we are left with George, Helen, Irving, Nina, Olivia, and Robert. 
George can only give a report on Tuesday. 
Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report, so they can only give morning reports. 
If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. 
Looking at the options:
A: Helen, George, and Nina - This is not possible because if Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, but Helen has already given a report on Monday.
B: Irving, Robert, and Helen - This is possible. Irving can give a report on Monday, Robert (who can only give a morning report) can give a report on Tuesday, and Helen can give a report on Wednesday.
C: Nina, Helen, and Olivia - This is not possible because if Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, but Helen has already given a report on Tuesday.
D: Olivia, Robert, and Irving - This is not possible because Robert and Olivia can only give morning reports and they are scheduled on consecutive days.
E: Robert, George, and Helen - This is not possible because Robert and George can only give morning reports and they are scheduled on consecutive days.
Action: Answer("B")
