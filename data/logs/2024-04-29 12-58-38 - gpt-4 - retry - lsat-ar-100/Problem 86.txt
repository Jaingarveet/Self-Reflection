## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Given that bay 4 is holding produce, and the bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel, the fuel must be in one of the bays numbered 1, 2, or 3. 
The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce, so textiles must be in bay 3 or bay 5. 
The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles, so livestock must be in one of the bays numbered 4, 5, or 6. But since bay 4 is holding produce, livestock must be in bay 5 or 6. 
The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock, so grain must be in bay 6. 
So, the cargo for bays 4 (produce), 6 (grain), and 5 (livestock) are determined. 
Action: Answer("B")
