## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Given that Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian, Megregian must review at least two plays. Since neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews, and Jiang does not review Tamerlane, Megregian must review Tamerlane and another play. Since Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, and exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other, Megregian cannot review the same plays as Kramer or O'Neill. Therefore, Megregian must review Tamerlane and Sunset or Undulation. 
Action: Answer("D")

Score: 1
