## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The conditions state that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, and at least two books are placed on each shelf. This means that the bottom shelf must have at least three books. 
I is placed on the middle shelf, so it cannot be on the bottom shelf. 
K is placed on a higher shelf than F, so K cannot be on the bottom shelf. 
O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so O cannot be on the bottom shelf. 
F is placed on the same shelf as M, so if F is on the bottom shelf, M must also be on the bottom shelf. 
Given these conditions, the only possible answer is choice E: G, H, L, M.
Action: Answer("E")
## Result:
Agent Answer: E
Correct Answer: B
