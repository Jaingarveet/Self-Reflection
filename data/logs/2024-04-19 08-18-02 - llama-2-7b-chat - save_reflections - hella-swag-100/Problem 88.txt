## Get Reflection:
 Explanation:
The correct answer is (D) Ask yourself if you want a healthier body.

The text does not support the other options as the most likely completion. Option (A) is incorrect because the text does not mention that a healthy body needs more testosterone to maintain erections. Option (C) is also incorrect because the text does not provide any information about distinguishing between testosterone and regular erections. Option (B) is the best match for the given text, as it suggests that individuals should be honest with themselves if they want to lower their testosterone levels, which is consistent with the negative effects of taking testosterone supplements mentioned in the text.

Reflection:
I misinterpreted the text and selected the incorrect answer. I misunderstood the purpose of the text and thought it was providing information about the benefits of taking testosterone supplements, rather than the potential negative effects. I should have read the text more carefully and paid attention to the language used, which suggests that individuals should be honest about their reasons for taking the supplements.
