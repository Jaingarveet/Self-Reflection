## Get Reflection:
  Great job! Your explanation is spot on. Here's why:

You correctly identified the most likely completion to the text based on the information provided. You explained that losing patience with your dog can cause them to be confused, and that consistency is key to helping the dog understand what is expected of them. You also provided a clear and concise explanation of why you chose the correct answer.

Here's a breakdown of why your answer is correct:

* The text states that losing patience with your dog can cause them to be confused. This implies that the dog may not know what you want or how you will react if they do something.
* The correct answer, C, states that being consistent helps keep the dog from getting confused. This makes sense because if you are consistent in your commands and actions, the dog will have a better understanding of what is expected of them.
* The other options do not provide a clear explanation for why being consistent is important. Option A does not address the issue of confusion, while option B simply states that consistency is important without explaining why. Option D is incorrect because it does not address the issue of confusion and does not provide a clear explanation for why being consistent is important.

Overall, your explanation is well-reasoned and accurately reflects the information provided in the text. Great job!
