## Get Reflection:
 Explanation:
The correct completion to the text is option C: "If you're smoking alone, a small plastic bottle should work. You may want a large plastic bottle if you're smoking with multiple people."

Reasoning:
The text is providing instructions on how to make a gravity bong, which is a simple smoking device that uses gravity to filter and smoke marijuana. The text mentions that any size bottle can be used, but the bigger the bottle, the bigger the hits will be. Option C is the most likely completion because it provides additional information on the size of the bottle based on the number of people smoking. Using a small bottle for smoking alone and a large bottle for multiple people makes sense, as it will provide a more even distribution of the smoke.

Error Keywords:

* None

Solution:
To make a gravity bong, you will need an empty plastic bottle. The bottle should be clean and dry before use. If you are smoking alone, a small plastic bottle will work, but a larger bottle may be needed for multiple people.

Instructions:

1. Find an empty plastic bottle.
2. Ensure that the nozzle is clean and dry before using it.
3. Use a zip lock or a sheet of tin foil if you are using an empty bottle.
4. Choose a bottle size based on the number of people smoking.
5. Use the gravity bong as instructed.

Advice:

* Always use a clean and dry bottle to avoid contamination and unpleasant flavors.
* Consider the size of the bottle based on the number of people smoking to ensure a more even distribution of the smoke.
* Follow proper safety precautions when using any smoking device, including the gravity bong.
* Be aware of the laws and regulations regarding marijuana use in your area before attempting to make or use a gravity bong.
