## Get Reflection:
  Great job! Your explanation and answer are correct. Here's why:

The correct answer is option C: "When you're running around like a chicken with its head cut off, you're not thinking clearly and not totally focused. Many, many school bus accidents happen in the school parking lot."

This option is the most likely completion to the text because it addresses the main idea of the passage, which is how to maintain total focus while driving a school bus. The sentence "Many, many school bus accidents happen in the school parking lot" supports this idea by highlighting the importance of staying focused while driving, especially in a high-risk area like a school parking lot.

Well done!
