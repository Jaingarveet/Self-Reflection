## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

## Assistant 2:
[REDACTED] 
As there is a linear relationship between $x$ and $y$, we can use the slope-intercept form of a linear equation, $y=mx+b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept. 
To find the slope, we can use any two points from the table. Let's use the first and second rows: 
$\text{slope}=\frac{\text{change in y}}{\text{change in x}}=\frac{-a-0}{3a-a}=-1$ 
Now we can use the slope and one of the points to find the y-intercept: 
$0=(-1)(0)+b \Rightarrow b=0$ 
Therefore, the equation of the line is $y=-x+0$ or simply $y=-x$. 
To check which equation represents this relationship, we can rearrange each equation into slope-intercept form and see which one has a slope of $-1$ and a y-intercept of $0$. 
A: $x+2y=a \Rightarrow 2y=-x+a \Rightarrow y=-\frac{1}{2}x+\frac{a}{2}$ 
B: $x+2y=5a \Rightarrow 2y=-x+5a \Rightarrow y=-\frac{1}{2}x+\frac{5a}{2}$ 
C: $2x-y=-5a \Rightarrow -y=-2x-5a \Rightarrow y=2x+5a$ 
D: $2x-y=7a \Rightarrow -y=-2x+7a \Rightarrow y=2x-7a$ 
The only equation that matches our slope and y-intercept is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 2x-y=-5a}$.
