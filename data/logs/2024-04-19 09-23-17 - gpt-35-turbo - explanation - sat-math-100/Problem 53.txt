## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:
Topic: Geography
Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: A line in the $x y$-plane passes through the origin and has a slope of $\frac{1}{7}$. Which of the following points lies on the line?
Choices:
  A: $(0,7)$
  B: $(1,7)$
  C: $(7,7)$
  D: $(14,2)$
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I used the equation of the line passing through the origin with slope $\frac{1}{7}$ correctly. However, I made a calculation error while substituting the values of $x$ and $y$ in the equation of the line. 
The point [REDACTED] does not lie on the line $y=\frac{1}{7}x$.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The equation of the line passing through the origin with slope $\frac{1}{7}$ is $y=\frac{1}{7}x$.
Substituting the values of $x$ and $y$ in the equation of the line, we get $y=\frac{1}{7} \cdot 7 = 1$ when $x=7$.
Therefore, the point $(7,1)$ lies on the line.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
