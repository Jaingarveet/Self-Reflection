Question: \begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}\cline { 2 - 3 }\multicolumn{1}{c|}{} & \multicolumn{2}{c|}{Handedness} \\\hlineGender & Left & Right \\\hline\hlineFemale &  &  \\\hlineMale &  &  \\\hline\hlineTotal & 18 & 122 \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}The incomplete table above summarizes the number of left-handed students and right-handed students by gender for the eighth-grade students atKeisel Middle School. There are 5 times as many right-handed female students as there are left-handed female students, and there are 9 times as many right-handed male students as there are left-handed male students. If there is a total of 18 left-handed students and 122 right-handed students in the school, which of the following is closest to the probability that a right-handed student selected at random is female? (Note: Assume that none of the eighth-grade students are both right-handed and left-handed.)
Choices:
  A: 0.410
  B: 0.357
  C: 0.333
  D: 0.250

Explanation:
My calculations for the number of left-handed female students and left-handed male students were incorrect. 
I made an error in solving the system of equations to find $f$ and $m$.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let's start by setting up the system of equations to find the number of left-handed female students and left-handed male students.
Let $f$ be the number of left-handed female students and $m$ be the number of left-handed male students.
From the table, we know that $f+m=18$.
We also know that there are 5 times as many right-handed female students as there are left-handed female students, so the number of right-handed female students is $5f$.
Similarly, there are 9 times as many right-handed male students as there are left-handed male students, so the number of right-handed male students is $9m$.
From the table, we know that the total number of right-handed students is 122, so we have $5f+9m=122$.
Solving the system of equations, we get $f=6$ and $m=12$.
Now, we can find the number of right-handed female students by subtracting the number of left-handed female students from the total number of female students: $5f=30$.
Similarly, we can find the number of right-handed male students by subtracting the number of left-handed male students from the total number of male students: $9m=108$.
The total number of female students is $f+30=36$, and the total number of male students is $m+12=24$.
Therefore, the probability that a right-handed student selected at random is female is $\frac{36}{36+24}=\frac{3}{5}=0.6$.
The closest answer choice is B: 0.357.
