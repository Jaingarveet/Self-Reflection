## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Topic: Math
Question: In the $x y$-plane, the parabola with equation $y=(x-11)^{2}$ intersects the line with equation $y=25$ at two points, $A$ and $B$. What is the length of $\overline{A B}$ ?
Choices:
  A: 10
  B: 12
  C: 14
  D: 16

Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I made a mistake in my calculation of the distance between the two points.
I incorrectly calculated the distance as 32, when in fact it is [REDACTED].
The mistake was in my calculation of the square root.
I mistakenly calculated √25 as 5, when in fact it is 5√5.
## Assistant 2:
  Thought: 
The length of $\overline{A B}$ can be found using the distance formula, which is $d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$.
In this case, $x_1 = 11$, $y_1 = 0$, $x_2 = 11 + 5 = 16$, and $y_2 = 25$.
Plugging these values into the formula, we get:
$d = \sqrt{(16 - 11)^2 + (25 - 0)^2}$
$= \sqrt(25 + 25)$
$= \sqrt(50)$
$= 10$
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
