## Assistant 2:
  Thought: 
The sum of the two polynomials is $8 x^{2}-7 x-4$.
Action: Answer("A")

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly because I made a mistake in my calculation. I mistakenly added the like terms incorrectly. I thought the sum of the two polynomials was $8 x^{2}+7 x-4$, but the correct answer is $8 x^{2}-7 x-4$. I realized my mistake after reviewing the problem and the correct answer. I made sure to double-check my calculation and ensure that I correctly added the like terms. I learned that it's essential to be careful when adding like terms and to double-check my work to avoid simple mistakes.
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
