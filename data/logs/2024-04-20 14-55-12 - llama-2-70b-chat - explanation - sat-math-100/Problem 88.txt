## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Question: $$h=-4.9 t^{2}+25 t$$The equation above expresses the approximate height $h$, in meters, of a ball $t$ seconds after it is launched vertically upward from the ground with an initial velocity of 25 meters per second. After approximately how many seconds will the ball hit the ground?
Choices:
  A: 3.5
  B: 4.0
  C: 4.5
  D: 5.0

Explanation:
I made a mistake in my calculation. I misunderstood the units of the variables and made a mistake in my calculation of the square root.
## Assistant 2:
  Thought: 
The equation h = -4.9t^2 + 25t gives the height of the ball at time t. To find when the ball will hit the ground, we need to find when the height is equal to zero.

Setting h = 0 and substituting the given equation, we get:

0 = -4.9t^2 + 25t

Now, we can solve for t:

t^2 = 25/4.9

t^2 = 5

t = sqrt(5)

t â‰ˆ 2.236

Since the question asks for the approximate time, we can round up to 2.3 seconds.

Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: D
