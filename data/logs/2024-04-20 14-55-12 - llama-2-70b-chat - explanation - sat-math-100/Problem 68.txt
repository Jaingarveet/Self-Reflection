## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Topic: Math
Question: $$0.10 x+0.20 y=0.18(x+y)$$Clayton will mix $x$ milliliters of a $10 \%$ by mass saline solution with $y$ milliliters of a $20 \%$ by mass saline solution in order to create an $18 \%$ by mass saline solution. The equation above represents this situation. If Clayton uses 100 milliliters of the $20 \%$ by mass saline solution, how many milliliters of the $10 \%$ by mass saline solution must he use?
Choices:
  A: 5
  B: 25
  C: 50
  D: 100
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I made a mistake in my calculation.
I isolated x by subtracting 0.20y from both sides of the equation, but then I made a mistake in simplifying the equation.
I incorrectly substituted y = [REDACTED] into the equation, which led to an incorrect solution.
## Assistant 2:
  Action: Answer("B")
Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I made a mistake in my calculation.
I isolated x by subtracting 0.20y from both sides of the equation, but then I made a mistake in simplifying the equation.
I incorrectly substituted y = 100 into the equation, which led to an incorrect solution.

Reflecting on my previous answer, I realize that I should have been more careful in my calculation.
I should have double-checked my work to ensure that I had simplified the equation correctly.
Additionally, I should have checked my answer to make sure it was reasonable.
In this case, the answer I received was 25, which is a reasonable answer given the information provided.

Therefore, the correct answer is B: 25.
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
