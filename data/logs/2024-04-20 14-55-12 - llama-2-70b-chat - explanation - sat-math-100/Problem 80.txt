## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Explanation:
I made a mistake in my calculation. I misunderstood the equation and wrote the wrong value for $k$.
## Assistant 2:
  My apologies for my previous mistake. Let's analyze the system of equations:

$$\begin{aligned}
kx - 3y &= 4 \\
4x - 5y &= 7
\end{aligned}$$

We can solve the first equation for $x$:

$$x = \frac{4}{k} + \frac{3y}{k}$$

Now, substitute the expression for $x$ into the second equation:

$$4\left(\frac{4}{k} + \frac{3y}{k}\right) - 5y = 7$$

Expand and simplify:

$$\frac{16}{k} + 4\frac{3y}{k} - 5y = 7$$

Now, we can see that the coefficient of $y$ is $-\frac{16}{k}$, so we need $k$ to be negative in order for the system to have no solution.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

$$k = -\frac{16}{7}$$

Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
