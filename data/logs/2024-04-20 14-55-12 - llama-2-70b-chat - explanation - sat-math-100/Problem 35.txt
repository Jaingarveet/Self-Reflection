## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:
Topic: Geography

Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: $$\sqrt{4 x}=x-3$$What are all values of $x$ that satisfy the given equation?I. 1II. 9
Choices:
  A: I only
  B: II only
  C: I and II
  D: Neither I nor II
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I made a mistake in my calculation. I incorrectly solved for x = 3, when in fact, x = 3 does not satisfy the equation.
I misunderstood the equation and solved for the wrong value of x.
## Assistant 2:
  Action: Answer("D")

Explanation:
On reflection, I realize that my previous answer was incorrect. I mistakenly solved for x = 3, which does not satisfy the equation. In fact, x = 3 does not satisfy the equation.
The correct solution is x = 1 and x = 9.
Therefore, the correct answer is (C) I and II.

I have learned from my mistake and will be more careful in my calculations in the future. I will double-check my work to ensure that I am solving for the correct value of x and that my answer satisfies the equation.
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
