Question: A television with a price of $\$ 300$ is to be purchased with an initial payment of $\$ 60$ and weekly payments of $\$ 30$. Which of the following equations can be used to find the number of weekly payments, $w$, required to complete the purchase, assuming there are no taxes or fees?
Choices:

Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I misunderstood the equation that represents the total amount paid so far.
I thought the total amount paid so far was $30w$, but it should be $30w + 60$, since the initial payment of $60$ is included in the total amount paid.
Therefore, the correct equation to find the number of weekly payments required to complete the purchase is:
$300 = 30w + 60$
## Assistant 2:
  Action: Answer("B")

Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I misunderstood the equation that represents the total amount paid so far.
I thought the total amount paid so far was $30w$, but it should be $30w + 60$, since the initial payment of $60$ is included in the total amount paid.
Therefore, the correct equation to find the number of weekly payments required to complete the purchase is:
$300 = 30w + 60$

This equation can be solved by subtracting $60$ from both sides:
$240 = 30w$

Dividing both sides by $30$ gives:
$8 = w$

Therefore, the number of weekly payments required to complete the purchase is $8$.

The correct answer is B: $300=30w$.
