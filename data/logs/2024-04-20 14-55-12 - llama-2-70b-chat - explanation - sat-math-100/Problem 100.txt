## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Context: $$.a=1,052+1.08 t.$$.The speed of a sound wave in air depends on the air temperature. The formula above shows the relationship between $a$, the speed of a sound wave, in feet per second, and $t$, the air temperature, in degrees Fahrenheit $\left({ }^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\right)$.
Question: At which of the following air temperatures will the speed of a sound wave be closest to 1,000 feet per second?
Choices:
  A: $-46^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$
  B: $-48^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$
  C: $-49^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$
  D: $-50^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$

Explanation:
I made a mistake in my reasoning. I incorrectly assumed that the closest value of $a$ to 1,000 would be achieved when $t$ is as small as possible. However, the formula $a=1,052+1.08 t$ shows that as $t$ decreases, $a$ also decreases. Therefore, the closest value of $a$ to 1,000 will be achieved when $t$ is as large as possible.
## Assistant 2:
  Action: Answer("D")
Explanation:
I made a mistake in my reasoning. I incorrectly assumed that the closest value of $a$ to 1,000 would be achieved when $t$ is as small as possible. However, the formula $a=1,052+1.08 t$ shows that as $t$ decreases, $a$ also decreases. Therefore, the closest value of $a$ to 1,000 will be achieved when $t$ is as large as possible.

Among the given choices, the largest temperature is $-50^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$, which corresponds to a speed of approximately 996.4 feet per second. Therefore, the closest value of $a$ to 1,000 feet per second will be achieved at an air temperature of $-50^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$.

Hence, the correct answer is (D) $-50^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$.
