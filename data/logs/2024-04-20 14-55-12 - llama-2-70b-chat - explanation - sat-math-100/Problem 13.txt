Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Question: $$\sqrt{k+2}-x=0$$In the equation above, $k$ is a constant. If $x=9$, what is the value of $k$ ?
Choices:
  A: 1
  B: 7
  C: 16
  D: 79
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.

Explanation:
I made a mistake in my calculation. I squared both sides of the equation, which led to an incorrect solution.
## Assistant 2:
  Thought: 
The equation is $\sqrt{k+2}-x=0$. If $x=9$, then we can substitute 9 for x in the equation:

$$\sqrt{k+2}-9=0$$

Squaring both sides of the equation, we get:

$$k+2-18=0$$

Simplifying, we have:

$$k=16$$

Therefore, the value of $k$ is 16.

Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
