Question: Alan drives an average of 100 miles each week. His car can travel an average of 25 miles per gallon of gasoline. Alan would like to reduce his weekly expenditure on gasoline by $\$ 5$. Assuming gasoline costs $\$ 4$ per gallon, which equation can Alan use to determine how many fewer average miles, $m$, he should drive each week?
Choices:
  A: $\frac{25}{4} m=95$
  B: $\frac{25}{4} m=5$
  C: $\frac{4}{25} m=95$
  D: $\frac{4}{25} m=5$

Explanation:
I made a mistake in my calculation. I misunderstood the problem and calculated the wrong value for the number of miles Alan needs to reduce.
## Assistant 2:
  My apologies for my previous response. Let's break down the problem step by step:
Alan's weekly gasoline expenditure can be calculated as follows:
Weekly gasoline expenditure = Total miles driven × Gas price
Weekly gasoline expenditure = 100 miles/week × $4/gallon = $400/week
Alan wants to reduce his weekly gasoline expenditure by $5, so he needs to reduce his total weekly miles driven by:
Reduction in weekly miles = Weekly gasoline expenditure ÷ Gas price
Reduction in weekly miles = $5 ÷ $4/gallon = 1.25 gallons
Since Alan's car can travel 25 miles per gallon, he needs to reduce his weekly miles driven by:
Reduction in weekly miles = 1.25 gallons × 25 miles/gallon = 31.25 miles/week
Therefore, the equation Alan can use to determine how many fewer average miles, m, he should drive each week is:
25/4 m = 31.25

Action: Answer("B")
