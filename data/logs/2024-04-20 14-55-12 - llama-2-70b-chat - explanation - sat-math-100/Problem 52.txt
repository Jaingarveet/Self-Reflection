## Assistant 2:
  Action: Answer("B")

Explanation:
I made a mistake in my calculation. I misunderstood the question and used the wrong variables. I used X to represent the number of pears produced by Type A trees, but the question actually asks for the number of pears produced by Type B trees.

Let X be the number of pears produced by Type B trees.
Since Type A trees produced 20% more pears than Type B trees, Type A trees produced 1.2X pears.
We know that Type A trees produced 144 pears, so 1.2X = 144.
Dividing both sides by 1.2, we get X = 120.

Therefore, the correct answer is B: 120.
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
