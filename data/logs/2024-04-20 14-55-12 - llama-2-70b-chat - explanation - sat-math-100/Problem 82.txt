## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: $$y=a(x-2)(x+4)$$In the quadratic equation above, $a$ is a nonzero constant. The graph of the equation in the $x y$-plane is a parabola with vertex $(c, d)$. Which of the following is equal to $d$ ?
Choices:
  A: $-9 a$
  B: $-8 a$
  C: $-5 a$
  D: $-2 a$

Explanation:
I made a mistake in my calculation of the vertex of the parabola.
I correctly factored the quadratic equation, but I incorrectly found the vertex.
I mistakenly substituted $b = -8$ instead of $b = -2$.
## Assistant 2:
  Action: Answer("D")

Explanation:
The vertex of a quadratic equation of the form $y = a(x-h)^2 + k$ is $(h, k)$.
In this case, the equation is $y = a(x-2)(x+4)$, so the vertex is $(2, 4a)$.
Substituting $a = -1$ (since $a$ is a nonzero constant), we get $(2, 4(-1)) = (2, -4)$.
Therefore, $d = -4$, which corresponds to choice (D).

Reflection:
I reflected on my previous mistake and realized that I had incorrectly substituted $b = -8$ instead of $b = -2$.
This led me to the correct answer, which is $d = -4$.
I made sure to double-check my calculation of the vertex to ensure that I had the correct coordinates.
I also made sure to carefully read the question and choices to avoid any confusion.
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: A
