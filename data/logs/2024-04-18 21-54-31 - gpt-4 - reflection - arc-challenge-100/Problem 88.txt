## System:
You are an expert in Science.
You have incorrectly answered the following multiple-choice question.
Your task is to reflect on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
You will then use this information help you answer the same question in the future.
First, explain why you answered the question incorrectly.
Second, list the keywords that describe the type of your errors from most general to most specific. 
Third, solve the problem again, step-by-step, based on your knowledge of the correct answer.
Fourth, create a list of detailed instructions to help you correctly solve this problem in the future.
Finally, create a list of general advice to help you solve similar types of problems in the future.  
Be concise in your response; however, capture all of the essential information.  
For guidance, I will provide you with a single generic example problem and reflection (below).
## User 1:
Topic: Geography and Math
Question: What is the product of the number of letters contained in the name of the city where Iowa State University is located multiplied by the number of letters contained in the name of the state?
Choices:
    A: 16
    B: 20
    C: 24
    D: 32
Thought:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
ISU is located in the state of Iowa.
Action: Answer("D")
---
Correct Answer: A
## Assistant 1:
Explanation:
I miscalculated the product of the number of letters in the city and state names. 
The gap in my knowledge was not in geography but in basic arithmetic. 
I knew the correct city and state but made a calculation error.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Arithmetic error
 - Multiplication error
Solution:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
Iowa State University is located in the state of Iowa.
The city name "Ames" contains 4 letters.
The state name "Iowa" contains 4 letters.
The product of 4*4 is 16.
Instructions:
1. Identify the city where the university is located.
2. Identify the state where the university is located.
3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.
4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.
5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.
6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.
7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them.
## User 2:
Topic: Science
Question: Michelle performed an investigation but the results did not match her hypothesis. What should Michelle do next?
Choices:
  A: perform the investigation in a different way
  B: change the hypothesis to match the results
  C: choose a different investigation
  D: repeat the investigation

Thought: 
In the scientific method, if the results of an investigation do not match the hypothesis, the next step is usually to revise the hypothesis based on the results and then repeat the investigation. Therefore, Michelle should change her hypothesis to match the results and then repeat the investigation.
Action: Answer("B")

 --- 
Correct Answer: D
## Assistant 2:
Response:
Explanation:
I misunderstood the scientific method's process. I thought that if the results did not match the hypothesis, the hypothesis should be changed immediately. However, the correct procedure is to repeat the investigation to ensure the results were not due to experimental error.
Error Keywords:
- Misunderstanding
- Scientific method
- Hypothesis testing
Solution:
In the scientific method, if the results of an investigation do not match the hypothesis, the next step is to repeat the investigation to ensure the results were not due to experimental error. Therefore, Michelle should repeat the investigation.
Instructions:
1. Understand the question and the situation presented.
2. Recall the steps of the scientific method.
3. Identify the current step in the scientific method based on the situation.
4. Determine the next step in the scientific method.
5. Choose the answer that matches the next step in the scientific method.
Advice:
- Always remember the steps of the scientific method.
- Understand that if results do not match the hypothesis, the investigation should be repeated to ensure the results were not due to experimental error.
- Only after repeated inconsistent results should the hypothesis be reconsidered.
- Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
- Always think through each step of your reasoning.
