[header] How to make a paper dreidel garland [title] Get six to eight sheets of craft paper. [step] You will need six to eight sheets of craft paper to make the dreidels. Pick craft paper that has an interesting design, such as hebrew letters, or a plain design if you are planning on decorating the dreidels later.
Choices:
  A: Go for paper that is thick and durable as you will be gluing them together. [substeps] You can also use colored craft paper in a certain color scheme, such as blue and yellow, if you do not plan on decorating them later.
  B: [substeps] Choose paper that has no patterns or embellishments. You want the paper to be smooth and no hairs or wrinkles are present.
  C: [substeps] Craft paper typically comes in multiple shapes and colors. If your craft paper has one shape, like blossoms, flowers, animals, and designs, choose an array to paint the dreidels on.
  D: You may wish to make your garland smaller based on how strong the paper is, or you may use more narrow representations such as images, writing utensils or sequins. [substeps] If you plan on making the garland from scratch, craft paper is preferred.
