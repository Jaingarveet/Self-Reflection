## Assistant 2:
  I apologize for my previous mistake. Let's analyze the question again.
The text is discussing how to escape extreme pressure employment, and the author suggests that the lower you've hit bottom, the higher you will go. The author also suggests stopping caring about work/colleagues' criticism to feel more relaxed in the short term.
Now, let's evaluate the choices:

A: This choice is related to the idea of not caring about what others say, but it doesn't directly address the issue of work pressure.
B: This choice is in line with the author's suggestion of not caring about what others say, but it doesn't offer a long-term solution.
C: This choice is not related to the topic of work pressure and doesn't offer a solution.
D: This choice is not a healthy or productive way to deal with work pressure.

Based on the author's suggestion and the error keywords provided (misinterpretation, short-term vs. long-term), the best answer is B: But as time goes on, the hard way tends to become ever harder. Stop caring about what others say/look at what they like.

Action: Answer("B")
