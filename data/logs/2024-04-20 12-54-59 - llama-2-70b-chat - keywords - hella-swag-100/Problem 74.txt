[header] How to look sexy [title] Decide what kind of sexy you want to be. [step] There are two kinds of sexy: there's the traditional jessica rabbit sexy and then there's the kind of sexy that's more down-to-earth. By conforming to one or the other, you'll be attracting people that are looking for different things.
Choices:
  A: Experiment and find the one that looks good on you before shifting on to others. [substeps] Jessica rabbit sexy wants you to have genuine interest in how you look in the mirror.
  B: Use this to your advantage, to help you get what you're looking for. [substeps] Traditional sexy is great when you're trying to attract more temporary partners.
  C: What type of sexy you want to be can be a matter of personal preference. Consider what the dress code's like for this area.
  D: [substeps] The traditional jessica rabbit sexy is meant to be more intense and accompanied by girly positives. It doesn't really change who you are and if you wait in front of a mirror you can take it a step further.
