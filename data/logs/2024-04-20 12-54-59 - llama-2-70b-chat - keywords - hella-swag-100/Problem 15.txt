## Assistant 2:
  My apologize for my previous response, where I incorrectly answered the question.
Upon reflection, I realized that I made a mistake in my understanding of the question.
I mistakenly assumed that the glasses were already filled with lemonade, and therefore, chose option A, which is not relevant to the context.
The correct answer is option B, where the glasses are filled with ice and then poured.
This makes sense as the hot water is poured over the lemons in the glasses, and then the glasses are stirred, indicating that they are empty.
Therefore, the next step would be to fill the glasses with ice before pouring the lemonade.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
