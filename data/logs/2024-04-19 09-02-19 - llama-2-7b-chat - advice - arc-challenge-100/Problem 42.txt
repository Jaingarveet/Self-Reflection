## System:
You are an expert in Science.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:
Topic: Geography
Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Science
Question: When two unequal forces act in opposite directions on a moving object, the object will
Choices:
  A: absorb the forces.
  B: come to an immediate stop.
  C: continue to move in the same direction.
  D: move in the same direction as the larger force.
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Advice:

* Always carefully read the question and understand the problem before answering.
* Use the correct formula to calculate the net force and acceleration of the object.
* Pay attention to the direction of the forces and how they affect the object's motion.
* Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
## Assistant 2:
  Topic: Science
Question: When two unequal forces act in opposite directions on a moving object, the object will
Reflection:
In the previous question, I answered incorrectly and then reflected on my solution and the correct answer. I realized that I misunderstood the problem and did not use the correct formula to calculate the net force and acceleration of the object.

To answer this question correctly, I will use the formula F = ma, where F is the net force acting on the object, m is the mass of the object, and a is the acceleration of the object. I will also pay attention to the direction of the forces and how they affect the object's motion.

Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
