# Model: llama-2-7b-chat | Agent: advice | Exam: arc-challenge-100 | Problem 55 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Science.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:
Topic: Geography
Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Science
Question: Which statement best describes the motion of water molecules as the water changes state from steam to liquid?
Choices:
  A: The molecules move faster and occupy more space.
  B: The molecules move slower and occupy more space.
  C: The molecules move faster and occupy less space.
  D: The molecules move slower and occupy less space.
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Advice:

* Always double-check your work and reasoning to ensure accuracy.
* Make sure you understand the concept and process of state changes in water.
* Pay close attention to the motion of molecules during state changes.
* Use visual aids or diagrams to help you visualize the motion of molecules.
## Assistant 2:
  Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, stating that the molecules move faster and occupy more space as the water changes state from steam to liquid. However, upon further reflection, I realize that this is not the correct answer.

During the process of state change from steam to liquid, the molecules of water actually move slower and occupy less space. This is because the molecules are moving more slowly and are more closely packed together as they transition from a gas to a liquid.

To better understand this concept, I will use visual aids or diagrams to help me visualize the motion of the molecules during state changes. This will allow me to better understand the process and make more accurate answers in the future.

Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: D
