Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Advice:

* When the results of an investigation do not match the hypothesis, it is important to critically evaluate the data and consider alternative explanations.
* Revising the hypothesis based on the results of the investigation is a crucial step in the scientific process.
* Gathering more data through repetition of the investigation can help to obtain more accurate results.
* It is important to be systematic and thorough in the investigation to avoid repeating the same mistakes.
## Assistant 2:
  Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly by selecting option A, "perform the investigation in a different way." However, upon further reflection, I realize that this is not the correct solution. When the results of an investigation do not match the hypothesis, it is important to critically evaluate the data and consider alternative explanations. Revising the hypothesis based on the results of the investigation is a crucial step in the scientific process.

Therefore, the correct answer is option B, "change the hypothesis to match the results." This involves carefully analyzing the data and considering alternative explanations to determine why the results do not match the hypothesis. By revising the hypothesis, Michelle can refine her investigation and obtain more accurate results.
