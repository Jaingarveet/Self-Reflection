## Assistant 2:
  Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand now that the correct answer is (B) new moon. I made a mistake in my calculation, and I should have taken into account that the Earth takes approximately 3 months to complete one orbit around the Sun.

For this question, I will use the information provided in the question to determine the correct answer. I know that new moons occur approximately every 29.5 days, and since there are 3 months in every 3 months, I can conclude that new moons occur about every 3 months.

Action: Answer("B")

Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: C
