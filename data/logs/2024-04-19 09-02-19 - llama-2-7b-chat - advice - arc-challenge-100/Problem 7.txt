Question: A group of Canada geese left a Florida lake in the spring. The geese arrived at a Maine lake 2,000 km away in 40 days. If the geese traveled at a constant rate, how far did the geese travel on the first day?

Reflection:
In my previous attempt to answer this question, I made a mistake in my calculation. I realized that I misunderstood the question and did not use the correct formula to solve it. To answer this question correctly, I will break down the problem into smaller steps and use the formula: distance = speed x time.

Step 1: Identify the given information
The geese left a Florida lake in the spring, and they arrived at a Maine lake 2,000 km away in 40 days.

Step 2: Calculate the speed of the geese
We are given that the geese traveled 2,000 km in 40 days, so their average speed is:
average speed = distance / time = 2,000 km / 40 days = 50 km/day

Step 3: Calculate the distance traveled on the first day
If the geese traveled at a constant rate, they will cover half of the total distance on the first day. Therefore, the distance traveled by the geese on the first day is:
distance = speed x time = 50 km/day x 1 day = 50 km

Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
