## System:
You are an expert in Science.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Question: A ship leaks a large amount of oil near a coastal area. Which statement describes how the oil most likely will affect the coastal habitat?
Choices:
  A: Fish reproduction rates will increase.
  B: Water birds will be unable to use their wings.
  C: Water plants will be exposed to more sunlight.
  D: Coastal plants will have access to more nutrients.
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Advice:

* Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
* Consider the potential impact of the oil spill on the entire ecosystem, including marine life and water quality.
* Think through each subproblem step-by-step.
* Double-check your calculations and final answer.
* Remember that oil spills can have far-reaching and long-lasting impacts on coastal habitats and marine life.
## Assistant 2:
  Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, stating that fish reproduction rates would increase due to the oil spill. However, upon further reflection, I realize that this is not the correct answer. Oil spills can have devastating effects on coastal habitats and marine life, including the destruction of habitats, the death of marine life, and the disruption of the food chain.

To answer the question correctly, I will consider the potential impact of the oil spill on the entire ecosystem, including marine life and water quality. I will also think through each subproblem step-by-step and double-check my calculations and final answer.

Based on my reflection, the correct answer is (D) Coastal plants will have access to more nutrients. Oil spills can lead to an increase in nutrients in the water, which can benefit coastal plants. However, this is not the only factor that affects the impact of an oil spill on a coastal habitat, and it is important to consider all of the potential effects when answering this question.
