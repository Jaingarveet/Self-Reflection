# Model: gpt-35-turbo | Task: save_reflection | Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Problem 64 of 100
## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
My mistake was in assuming that Kim and Mahr must work in Zone 1. However, this is not necessarily true. 
Error Keywords:
 - Incorrect assumption
 - Misinterpretation of the problem
 - Logical error
Solution:
If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then Udall cannot work in Zone 2 because Udall and Stuckey work in the same sales zone. Therefore, Tiao must work in Zone 2. If Tiao works in Zone 2, then Parra must work in Zone 3. Since Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone, Quinn must also work in Zone 3. That means Kim must work in Zone 2.
Instructions:
1. Read the problem carefully and understand the constraints.
2. Identify any relationships between the sales representatives and the sales zones.
3. Use logic to deduce any additional relationships between the sales representatives and the sales zones.
4. Double-check your reasoning to ensure that it is valid.
5. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the problem carefully and understand the constraints.
 - Always use logic to deduce any additional relationships between the variables.
 - Always double-check your reasoning to ensure that it is valid.
 - Remember that assumptions can lead to incorrect answers.
