# Model: gpt-35-turbo | Task: save_reflection | Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Problem 7 of 100
## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I made an error in my reasoning. I assumed that Franco must testify on Tuesday because Franco cannot testify on Monday and at least one witness testifies on Monday. However, this is not necessarily true. 
Error Keywords:
 - False assumption
 - Misinterpretation of the problem
 - Logical error
Solution:
If Jackson is the only witness scheduled to testify on Monday, then Iturbe must testify on Wednesday. 
Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday, so Hong cannot testify on Tuesday because Hong does not testify on Monday. 
Franco cannot testify on Monday because at least one witness testifies on Monday and Franco cannot testify on the same day as Garcia. 
Therefore, Franco must testify on Tuesday and Garcia must testify on Wednesday. 
Hong must testify on Monday. 
Instructions:
1. Read the problem carefully and understand the constraints.
2. Identify the witnesses who must testify on specific days based on the constraints.
3. Use the constraints to eliminate possibilities and narrow down the options.
4. Double-check your reasoning to ensure that it is valid.
5. Choose the answer that must be true based on your valid reasoning.
Advice:
 - Always read the problem carefully and understand the constraints.
 - Always double-check your reasoning to ensure that it is valid.
 - Always eliminate possibilities and narrow down the options based on the constraints.
 - Never make assumptions that are not supported by the constraints.
 - Remember that logical reasoning is essential in solving problems.
