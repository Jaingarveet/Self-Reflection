Explanation:
I made an error in counting the number of possible parking spaces for each employee. 
I correctly identified the rules governing the assignment of parking spaces but made a mistake in counting the number of possible parking spaces for each employee.
Error Keywords:

Solution:
Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4. So, Robertson has only four possible parking spaces.
Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. So, Young has only two possible parking spaces (#5 or #6) and Togowa has only two possible parking spaces (#1 or #2).
Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. So, Xu has only three possible parking spaces (#3, #4, #5) and Souza has only two possible parking spaces (#1 or #2).
Vaughn has only one possible parking space.
The number of employees with only two possible parking spaces is 4 (Young, Togowa, Xu, and Souza).
