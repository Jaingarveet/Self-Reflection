# Model: gpt-35-turbo | Task: save_reflection | Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Problem 86 of 100
## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I made an error in my reasoning. I forgot to consider the fact that the bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel. Therefore, if bay 4 is holding produce, then the bay holding textiles must be bay 3. The bay holding livestock must be bay 2 and the bay holding grain must be bay 1. The bay holding fuel must be bay 6. Therefore, the type of cargo for bays 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 is completely determined. 
Error Keywords:
 - Misinterpretation of the problem
 - Logical error
 - Forgetting a constraint
Solution:
If bay 4 is holding produce, then the bay holding textiles must be bay 3. The bay holding livestock must be bay 2 and the bay holding grain must be bay 1. The bay holding fuel must be bay 6. Therefore, the type of cargo for bays 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 is completely determined. 
Instructions:
1. Read the problem carefully and understand the constraints.
2. Draw a diagram to visualize the problem.
3. Use logic to deduce the possible solutions.
4. Check each solution against the constraints.
5. Choose the solution that satisfies all the constraints.
6. Double-check your answer to ensure accuracy.
Advice:
 - Always read the problem carefully and understand the constraints.
 - Draw a diagram to visualize the problem.
 - Use logic to deduce the possible solutions.
 - Check each solution against the constraints.
 - Double-check your answer to ensure accuracy.
