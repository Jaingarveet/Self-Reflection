## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I incorrectly chose answer choice D instead of answer choice C.
I did not pay close attention to the condition that if Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
Error Keywords:
 - Misreading the condition
 - Oversight
 - Carelessness
Solution:
We can start by using the given conditions to eliminate some of the answer choices:
- Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. (Eliminates answer choices A, B, and E)
- Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. (Eliminates answer choices A and D)
Now, we can try to create a schedule based on the remaining answer choices (C):
- Mon. morning: Lenore; Mon. afternoon: Helen
- Tues. morning: George; Tues. afternoon: Kyle
- Wed. morning: Robert; Wed. afternoon: Irving
This schedule satisfies all of the given conditions:
- Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report.
- Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
- If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and understand the problem.
2. Identify the given conditions and constraints.
3. Use the given conditions to eliminate answer choices that do not satisfy the constraints.
4. Try to create a schedule based on the remaining answer choices.
5. Check if the schedule satisfies all of the given conditions and constraints.
6. Choose the answer that satisfies all of the given conditions and constraints.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Pay close attention to the given conditions and constraints.
 - Eliminate answer choices that do not satisfy the constraints.
 - Try to create a schedule based on the remaining answer choices.
 - Check if the schedule satisfies all of the given conditions and constraints.
 - Double-check your final answer to ensure accuracy.
