# Model: gpt-35-turbo | Task: save_reflection | Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Problem 4 of 100
## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
My reasoning was incorrect because I did not consider all the constraints in the problem. 
The problem states that Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's. 
If Lan does not lead a Wednesday session, then either Olivia or Nessa must lead the Wednesday session. 
If Olivia leads the Wednesday session, then Julio must lead the Thursday session, which violates the constraint that Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's. 
Therefore, Nessa must lead the Wednesday session, and Julio must lead the Thursday session. 
Instructions:
1. Identify the constraints in the problem.
2. Identify the possible scenarios based on the constraints.
3. Analyze each scenario to determine which one satisfies all the constraints.
4. Choose the answer that matches the scenario that satisfies all the constraints.
Advice:
 - Always read the problem carefully and understand all the constraints.
 - Always consider all the constraints when analyzing the problem.
 - Always double-check your reasoning to ensure that it satisfies all the constraints.
 - Remember that each constraint is important and must be satisfied to solve the problem.
