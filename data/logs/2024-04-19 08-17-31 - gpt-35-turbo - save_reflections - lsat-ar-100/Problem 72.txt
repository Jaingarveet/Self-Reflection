# Model: gpt-35-turbo | Task: save_reflection | Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Problem 72 of 100
## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
My mistake was in not considering all of the constraints and their implications. 
I only considered the constraint that the pharmacy cannot be next to the optometrist and the shoe store. 
I did not consider the constraint that the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. 
Error Keywords:
 - Ignored constraint
 - Incomplete analysis
 - Incorrect assumption
Solution:
If the optometrist is next to the shoe store, then the pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. Therefore, the pharmacy cannot be next to the shoe store. 
The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian. Therefore, the veterinarian cannot be next to the shoe store.
The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. Therefore, the two restaurants cannot be next to the shoe store.
Therefore, the businesses immediately on either side of the optometrist and the shoe store must be a restaurant and the toy store.
