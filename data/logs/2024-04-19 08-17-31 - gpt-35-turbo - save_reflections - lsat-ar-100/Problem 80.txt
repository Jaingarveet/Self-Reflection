Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misread the rule that Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4. I thought that Robertson could not be assigned parking space #5 or #6, but I did not realize that Robertson could be assigned parking space #1, #2, or #3. 
Error Keywords:
 - Misreading
 - Misinterpretation
 - Oversight
 - Carelessness
Solution:
Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
From the above rules, we can conclude that Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4 and Young must be assigned parking space #3, #4, #5, or #6.
Option A violates the rule that Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
Option B violates the rule that Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
Option C violates the rule that Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
Option D is a possible assignment of parking spaces to the new employees.
Option E violates the rule that Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
Therefore, the correct answer is D.
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and understand the problem.
2. Identify the rules that govern the assignment of parking spaces.
3. Identify the constraints on the assignment of parking spaces.
4. Analyze each option and eliminate the ones that violate the rules or constraints.
5. Choose the option that satisfies all the rules and constraints.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always identify the rules that govern the problem.
 - Always identify the constraints on the problem.
 - Always analyze each option and eliminate the ones that violate the rules or constraints.
 - Always double-check your reasoning and final answer.
 - Remember that misreading or misinterpreting the rules can lead to incorrect answers.
