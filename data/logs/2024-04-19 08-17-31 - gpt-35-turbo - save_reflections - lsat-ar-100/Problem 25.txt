# Model: gpt-35-turbo | Task: save_reflection | Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Problem 25 of 100
## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I made an error in my reasoning. I assumed that J must be first, G must be fourth, and R must be seventh. However, this is not necessarily true. J could be first, second, or third, and G could be second or third. Therefore, Y could be sixth, and H could be fifth. 
Error Keywords:
 - Misunderstanding the constraints
 - Incorrect assumption
 - Logical error
Solution:
If G is fourth, then J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R. Therefore, J could be first, second, or third, and G could be second or third. 
S must be earlier than Y, so S must be fifth or sixth. 
Q is third or later. 
H must be first, second, or third. 
Therefore, Y could be sixth, and H could be fifth.
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and understand the constraints.
2. Identify the possible positions of each article based on the constraints.
3. Use logical reasoning to eliminate impossible options.
4. Double-check your reasoning to ensure accuracy.
5. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the constraints.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your reasoning and final answer.
 - Remember that assumptions can lead to errors, so be careful when making them.
