# Model: gpt-35-turbo | Task: save_reflection | Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Problem 70 of 100
## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I made an error in my reasoning. I assumed that if Truvest's website target is 2 days, then Solide's website target must be 1 day. However, this is not necessarily true. Solide's website target could be 2 days, and Truvest's website target could be 1 day. 
Error Keywords:
 - False assumption
 - Logical error
 - Misinterpretation of the problem
Solution:
If Solide's voicemail target is shorter than Truvest's website target, then Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target. 
If Truvest's website target is 2 days, then Solide's website target could be 2 days or 1 day. 
Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets, so Image's voicemail target must be 1 day. 
Therefore, Image's website target could be 2 days, but Solide's website target could also be 2 days.

2. Identify the given conditions and constraints.
3. Use logical reasoning to determine the possible values for the targets.
4. Double-check your reasoning to ensure that it is valid.
5. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and make sure you understand the problem.
 - Identify the given conditions and constraints.
 - Use logical reasoning to determine the possible values for the variables.
 - Double-check your reasoning to ensure that it is valid.
 - Be careful not to make false assumptions or jump to conclusions.
