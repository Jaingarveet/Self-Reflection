# Model: gpt-35-turbo | Task: save_reflection | Exam: lsat-ar-100 | Problem 53 of 100
## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I misunderstood the rule that L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown. I thought that L could be shown before K, which is incorrect. 
Error Keywords:
 - Misunderstood rule
 - Misinterpreted rule
 - Logical error
Solution:
J is shown in the evening, so J is the sixth or seventh house.
K cannot be shown in the morning, so K is the third, fourth, fifth, sixth, or seventh house.
L must be shown after K and before M, so L is the fourth or fifth house.
M is the fifth, sixth, or seventh house.
Therefore, the only option that must be true is that L is shown in the afternoon.
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and understand the problem.
2. Identify the rules and constraints given in the problem.
3. Use logic to eliminate options that cannot be true.
4. Identify the option that must be true based on the given rules and constraints.
5. Double-check your reasoning to ensure accuracy.
6. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always identify the rules and constraints given in the problem.
 - Always use logic to eliminate options that cannot be true.
 - Always identify the option that must be true based on the given rules and constraints.
 - Never assume any information that is not given in the problem.
 - Always double-check your reasoning to ensure accuracy.
 - Remember that logical reasoning is a key skill in solving problems.
