## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
My mistake was in misinterpreting the rule that Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. I assumed that Young must be assigned a lower-numbered parking space than Robertson, but the rule only requires that Young be assigned a parking space with a higher number than Togowa. 
Error Keywords:
 - Misinterpretation of rules
 - Misunderstanding of requirements
 - Incorrect assumption
Solution:
If Robertson is assigned parking space #3, then Young must be assigned parking space #4 according to the rule that Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. 
Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, so Xu must be assigned parking space #5 or #6. 
Togowa must be assigned a lower-numbered parking space than Young, so Togowa must be assigned parking space #1 or #2. 
If Robertson is assigned parking space #3, then Souza must be assigned parking space #1, Vaughn must be assigned parking space #6, and Togowa must be assigned parking space #2. 
Therefore, Young must be assigned parking space #5, and the correct answer is E.
