## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The man's rate in still water is 4 kmph. His rate against the current is 2 kmph, which means the current slows him down by 2 kmph. Therefore, when he is rowing with the current, it should speed him up by the same amount. So, his rate along the current would be his rate in still water plus the speed of the current, which is 4 kmph + 2 kmph = 6 kmph.
Action: Answer("B")

Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: E
