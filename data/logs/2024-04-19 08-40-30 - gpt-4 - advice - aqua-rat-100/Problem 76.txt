# Model: gpt-4 | Agent: advice | Exam: aqua-rat-100 | Problem 76 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:
Topic: Geography
Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: If n is such that 36 ≤ n ≤ 72, then x = (n2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16) / (n+ 4√n+ 4) satisfies
Choices:
  A: 20 < x < 54
  B: 23 < x < 58
  C: 25 < x < 64
  D: 28 < x < 60
  E: None of these
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Advice:
- Always double-check your simplifications in algebraic expressions.
- Be careful when calculating ranges based on inequalities.
- Always verify your answer by substitifying the boundary values of the range into the simplified expression.
- If none of the options fully cover the calculated range, choose the option that best fits the range.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The given expression can be simplified by noticing that it is in the form of (a+b)²/a+b, which simplifies to a+b. So, x = n + 2√n. 
The minimum value of n is 36, so the minimum value of x is 36 + 2√36 = 42. 
The maximum value of n is 72, so the maximum value of x is 72 + 2√72 = 84. 
So, the range of x is 42 ≤ x ≤ 84. 
None of the given options fully cover this range, but option B: 23 < x < 58 covers the lower part of the range. 
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
