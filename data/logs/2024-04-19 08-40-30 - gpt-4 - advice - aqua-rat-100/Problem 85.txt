## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The elevator is moving downwards while you are also walking downwards. When you walk 20 steps and stop, the elevator continues to move and you reach the bottom in 10 minutes. When you walk 10 steps and stop, it takes 20 minutes to reach the bottom. This means that the elevator covers the remaining 10 steps in the extra 10 minutes. Therefore, the speed of the elevator is 10 steps/10 minutes = 1 step/minute.
Action: Answer("A")
