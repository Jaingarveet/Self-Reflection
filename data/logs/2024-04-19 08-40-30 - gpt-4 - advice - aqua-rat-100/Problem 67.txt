## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
First, we need to establish the relationship between the different types of breads. 
From the problem, we know that:
- 6 pita breads = 2 rolls
- 3 rolls = 5 baguettes
We can express the amount of falafel in one roll as 6/2 = 3 pita breads.
We can also express the amount of falafel in one baguette as 3/5 = 0.6 rolls.
Now, we want to find out how many pita breads are equivalent to 2 baguettes. 
First, we convert the 2 baguettes to rolls: 2 baguettes * 0.6 rolls/baguette = 1.2 rolls.
Then, we convert the 1.2 rolls to pita breads: 1.2 rolls * 3 pita breads/roll = 3.6 pita breads.
Action: Answer("E")
## Result:
Agent Answer: E
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
