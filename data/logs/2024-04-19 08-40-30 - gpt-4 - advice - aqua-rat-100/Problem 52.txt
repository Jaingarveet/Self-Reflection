Question: X and Y are two alloys which were made by mixing zinc and copper in the ratio 6:9 and 7:11, respectively. If 40 grams of alloy X and 60 grams of alloy Y are melted and mixed to form alloy Z, what is the ratio of zinc and copper in the alloy Z ?
Choices:
  A: 69:91
  B: 59:91
  C: 59:90
  D: 59:91
  E: 69:101

Advice:
- Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
- Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
- Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
- Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
- Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
- Remember that the ratio of two numbers is the result of dividing them, not adding them.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
First, we need to find the amount of zinc and copper in each alloy.
In alloy X, the ratio of zinc to copper is 6:9. So, in 40 grams of alloy X, there are (6/15)*40 = 16 grams of zinc and (9/15)*40 = 24 grams of copper.
In alloy Y, the ratio of zinc to copper is 7:11. So, in 60 grams of alloy Y, there are (7/18)*60 = 23.33 grams of zinc and (11/18)*60 = 36.67 grams of copper.
Now, if we melt and mix these two alloys to form alloy Z, the total amount of zinc will be 16 + 23.33 = 39.33 grams and the total amount of copper will be 24 + 36.67 = 60.67 grams.
The ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z is therefore 39.33:60.67. To simplify this ratio, we can divide both numbers by their greatest common divisor, which is approximately 0.67. This gives us a ratio of approximately 59:91.
Action: Answer("B")
