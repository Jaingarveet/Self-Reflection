## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Choices:
  A: 8.75
  B: 8.79
  C: 8.75
  D: 8.71
  E: 8.72

- Be aware of the units you are working with and make sure your answer is in the correct units.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The paper is a square with a side of 20 cm, so its total area is 20*20 = 400 cm^2.
Two semi-circles are drawn on opposite sides of the square, which together form a full circle with a diameter of 20 cm. 
The radius of this circle is 20/2 = 10 cm.
The area of a circle is given by the formula πr^2, so the area of this circle is π*10^2 = 100π cm^2.
The area of the remaining paper is the total area of the square minus the area of the circle, which is 400 - 100π cm^2.
Using the approximation π ≈ 3.14, this gives an area of approximately 400 - 314 = 86 cm^2.
However, none of the given options match this calculation. There might be a mistake in the question or the options provided.
