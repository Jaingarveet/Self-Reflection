## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The question states that 24% of all students are members of both a chess club and a swim team. This means that these students are part of the swim team. 
It also states that 20% of the swim team members are not members of the chess club. This means that 80% of the swim team members are also members of the chess club. 
If 24% of all students are the 80% of the swim team, then we can find the total percentage of students that are in the swim team by dividing 24% by 80% and multiplying by 100%.
Action: 
First, convert the percentages to decimals: 24% = 0.24 and 80% = 0.80.
Then, divide 0.24 by 0.80 to find the total percentage of students that are in the swim team: 0.24 / 0.80 = 0.30.
Finally, convert 0.30 back to a percentage by multiplying by 100: 0.30 * 100 = 30%.
Answer: Answer("B")
