## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Let's denote the number of newspapers the hotel buys on Monday (and the rest of the weekdays) as x. The hotel buys 2x newspapers on Sunday. The total cost for the newspapers is $210. We can set up the following equation to solve for x:
$4 * 2x (Sunday) + $1 * x * 6 (rest of the week) = $210
8x + 6x = $210
14x = $210
x = $210 / 14
x = 15
So, the hotel buys 15 newspapers on Monday.
Action: Answer("A")
