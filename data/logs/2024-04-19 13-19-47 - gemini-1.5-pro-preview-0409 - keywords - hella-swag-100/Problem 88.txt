Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to decide to take testosterone [title] Ask yourself if you want to improve your sexual function. [step] If you have a low sex drive, or if your sex drive has declined with age, you might want to give it a boost with some extra testosterone. In addition to increased libido, testosterone supplements can help you avoid unwanted erections and maintain erections when aroused.
Choices:
  A: A healthy body needs more testosterone in order to maintain erections. Some women who are female or older do not maintain regular erections until all their testosterone has been expended, so other people may need testosterone anyway.
  B: [substeps] Be honest with yourself if you want to lower your testosterone. Taking testosterone supplements can lead to a reduction in your sex drive.
  C: [title] Distinguish between testosterone and regular erections. [step] Studies have shown that women with low testosterone are able to have slightly lower levels of sexual function after sex, which is because the hormone changes are carried out through pleasure.
  D: [title] Ask yourself if you want a healthier body. [step] Men who suffer from low testosterone may experience increased body fat and larger breasts.

My previous response was incorrect because it focused on the effects of low testosterone rather than the potential benefits of taking testosterone supplements as the text suggests. The passage clearly discusses the positive impacts of testosterone on sexual function, such as increased libido and improved erectile function.
