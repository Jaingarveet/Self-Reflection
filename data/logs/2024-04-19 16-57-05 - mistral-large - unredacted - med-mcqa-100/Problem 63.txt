## System:
You are an expert in Medicine.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I confused the mode of inheritance with the type of disorder.
The gap in my knowledge was not in the biochemistry of the disorder but in the genetic basis of the disorder.
I knew the correct gene involved but made a mistake in identifying the mode of inheritance.

Error Keywords:
 - Mode of inheritance error
 - Genetic disorder error
 - Autosomal dominant error

Solution:
Hypophosphatemic Vitamin D Resistant Rickets is an X-linked dominant disorder caused by mutations in the PHEX gene.
The disorder is characterized by low levels of phosphate in the blood, leading to rickets and other bone abnormalities.
The disorder is inherited in an X-linked dominant manner, meaning that it affects both males and females but is more severe in males.

Instructions:
1. Identify the disorder in question.
2. Identify the gene involved in the disorder.
3. Identify the mode of inheritance of the disorder.
4. Identify the characteristics of the disorder.
5. Choose the answer that matches the mode of inheritance and characteristics of the disorder.
6. Double-check your answer to ensure accuracy.

Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your answer to ensure accuracy.
 - Remember that the mode of inheritance is a critical aspect of genetic disorders.
 - Be aware of the differences between autosomal and X-linked inheritance patterns.
 - Be aware of the differences between dominant and recessive inheritance patterns.
 - Be aware of the differences between different types of genetic disorders.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The disorder in question is Hypophosphatemic Vitamin D Resistant Rickets.
The gene involved in the disorder is PHEX.
The mode of inheritance of the disorder is X-linked dominant.
The characteristics of the disorder include low levels of phosphate in the blood, leading to rickets and other bone abnormalities.
The answer that matches the mode of inheritance and characteristics of the disorder is "D: XR".
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
