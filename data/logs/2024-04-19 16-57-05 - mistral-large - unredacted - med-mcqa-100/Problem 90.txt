Question: At 34 weeks multigravida with previous 2 normal delivery has an unstable lie with the present pregnancy. It can be due to:

  C: Pelvic tumor
  D: Uterine anomalies

Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I did not consider all the possible factors that could cause an unstable lie in a multigravida at 34 weeks. I assumed that since the patient had two previous normal deliveries, uterine anomalies were the most likely cause. However, placenta previa can also cause an unstable lie, and it is a more common cause than uterine anomalies.

Error Keywords:

* Incorrect assumption
* Incomplete analysis
* Overlooking possible causes

Solution:
The patient is a multigravida at 34 weeks with an unstable lie. The possible causes of an unstable lie in this case are uterine anomalies, oligohydramnios, placenta previa, or a pelvic tumor. However, the most likely cause is placenta previa, as it is a more common cause of an unstable lie than uterine anomalies, and the patient has had two previous normal deliveries, making oligohydramnios less likely.

Instructions:

1. Identify the patient's gestational age and gravidity.
2. Identify the patient's presenting symptom (unstable lie).
3. Consider all possible causes of an unstable lie in a multigravida at 34 weeks.
4. Analyze each possible cause and its likelihood based on the patient's history.
5. Choose the most likely cause based on the analysis.

Advice:

* Always consider all possible causes of a presenting symptom.
* Analyze each possible cause based on the patient's history.
* Do not make assumptions based on limited information.
* Be thorough in your analysis to avoid overlooking possible causes.
* Choose the most likely cause based on a comprehensive analysis.
