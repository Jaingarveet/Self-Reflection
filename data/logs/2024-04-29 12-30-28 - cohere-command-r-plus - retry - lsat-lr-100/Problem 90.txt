## System:
You are an expert in Law.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")

Context: Science journalist: Brown dwarfs are celestial objects with more mass than planets but less mass than stars. They are identified by their mass and whether or not lithium is present in their atmospheres. Stars at least as massive as the Sun have lithium remaining in their atmospheres because the mixing of elements in their internal nuclear furnaces is incomplete. Stars with less mass than the Sun have no lithium because the element has been fully mixed into their nuclear furnaces and consumed. A brown dwarf does not have a fully functional nuclear furnace and so its lithium cannot be consumed.
Question: Which one of the following is most strongly supported by the science journalist's statements?
Choices:
  A: Any celestial object without lithium in its atmosphere is a star with less mass than the Sun.
  B: Any celestial object with lithium in its atmosphere has a nuclear furnace that has incompletely mixed the object's elements.
  C: No celestial object that has no lithium in its atmosphere is a brown dwarf.
  D: No celestial object with lithium in its atmosphere has less mass than the Sun.
  E: No celestial object less massive than a brown dwarf has lithium in its atmosphere.

## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The science journalist's statements support the idea that the presence or absence of lithium in a celestial object's atmosphere is indicative of the level of mixing of elements in its internal nuclear furnace, and by extension, the mass of the object.

Statement A: While it is true that stars with less mass than the Sun have no lithium, the presence of lithium alone does not exclusively indicate a star with more mass than the Sun. Therefore, this option is not the most accurate conclusion.

Statement B: This statement is accurate according to the journalist's explanation. The presence of lithium indicates that the elements have not been completely mixed in the object's nuclear furnace, which is a characteristic of stars more massive than the Sun.

Statement C: This statement is false. A brown dwarf, by definition, is a substellar object that has not developed a fully functional nuclear furnace, which means its lithium is not consumed. Therefore, the absence of lithium is indicative of celestial objects beyond the brown dwarf stage of evolution.

Statement D: This statement is false. While stars with less mass than the Sun have no lithium, the presence of lithium does not exclusively indicate that an object is less massive than the Sun. There are stars more massive than the Sun that also have lithium due to incomplete mixing.

Statement E: This statement is supported by the explanation provided. Brown dwarfs are defined by their partially developed nuclear furnaces, which cannot fully consume lithium. Therefore, any object less massive than a brown dwarf would also lack the conditions to consume lithium.

Therefore, the correct answer is option E.
Action: Answer("E")
## Result:
Agent Answer: E
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
