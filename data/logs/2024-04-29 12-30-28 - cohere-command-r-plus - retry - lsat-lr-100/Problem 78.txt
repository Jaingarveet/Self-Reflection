Topic: Law
Context: The chairperson of Acme Corporation has decided to move the company from its current location in Milltown to Ocean View. Most Acme employees cannot afford housing within a 30-minute commute of Ocean View. So once the company has moved, most Acme employees will have a commute of more than 30 minutes.

  A: All Acme employees can afford housing within a 30-minute commute of Milltown.
  B: The chairperson of Acme has good financial reasons for wanting to move the company to Ocean View.
  C: None of Acme's employees except the chairperson are in favor of moving the company to Ocean View.
  D: Currently, most Acme employees have a commute of less than 30 minutes.

## Assistant 2:
Thought: The correct answer is D: that currently, most Acme employees have a commute of less than 30 minutes. This is because the argument states that once the company moves, most employees will have a commute of more than 30 minutes, so we can assume that previously, their commutes were shorter. 

We cannot assume that all employees can afford housing near Milltown (choice A) nor that the chairperson's financial reasons for the move are good (choice B). Choice C is incorrect because the argument does not provide information about the employees' opinions on the move. Finally, choice E is irrelevant to the argument's conclusion and is not required for the argument to hold.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: E
Score: 0
