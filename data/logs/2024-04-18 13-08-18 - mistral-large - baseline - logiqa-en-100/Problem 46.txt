Question: Which of the following pairs of employees is unlikely to be assigned to the sales department?
Choices:
  A: G and I
  B: G and X
  C: G and Y
  D: H and W
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Since F and G cannot be allocated in the same department, and F must be allocated in the production department, G cannot be allocated in the production department. Therefore, G must be allocated in either the public relations department or the sales department.
If G is allocated in the sales department, then X cannot be allocated in the sales department, because if X is allocated in the sales department, W must be allocated in the production department, and there is only one remaining position in the production department, which must be filled by F. Therefore, if G is allocated in the sales department, X cannot be allocated in the sales department.
Action: Answer("B")
