Topic: Logic
Context: Mr.Chen is going to hold a gathering of friends and family.He came forward and invited his father's brother-in-law, his brother-in-law's father, his brother's mother-in-law, his brother-in-law's brother.
Question: How many guests did Mr.Chen come forward to invite?
Choices:
  A: No guest invited
  B: 1 guest
  C: 2 guests
  D: 3 guests
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let's analyze each guest invited by Mr. Chen:

1. Father's brother-in-law: This is the brother of Mr. Chen's father's wife (stepmother or mother-in-law), so this is Mr. Chen's uncle or father-in-law.
2. Brother-in-law's father: This is the father of Mr. Chen's brother's wife, so this is Mr. Chen's father-in-law.
3. Brother's mother-in-law: This is the mother of Mr. Chen's brother's wife, so this is Mr. Chen's mother-in-law.
4. Brother-in-law's brother: This is the brother of Mr. Chen's brother's wife, so this is Mr. Chen's brother-in-law.

However, we can see that the first and second guests are the same person (Mr. Chen's father-in-law). Therefore, Mr. Chen invited only three guests.
Action: Answer("D")
