Context: A heating station has 5 valves to control the delivery of steam to the outside.The following operating rules must be followed when using these valves? (1) If valve No.1 is opened, then valve No.2 must be opened and valve No.5 must be closed.(2) If valve No.2 or valve No.5 is opened, valve No.4 must be closed.(3) No.3 valve and No.4 valve cannot be closed at the same time.
Question: Now we need to open the No.1 valve, which two valves are to be opened at the same time?
Choices:
  A: No.2 valve and No.4 valve.
  C: No.3 valve and No.5 valve.
  B: No.2 valve and No.3 valve.
  D: No.4 valve and No.5 valve.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
If valve No.1 is opened, then valve No.2 must be opened and valve No.5 must be closed (rule 1).
If valve No.2 is opened, valve No.4 must be closed (rule 2).
No.3 valve and No.4 valve cannot be closed at the same time (rule 3).
Since valve No.4 must be closed, valve No.3 cannot be closed, and therefore it must be open.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
