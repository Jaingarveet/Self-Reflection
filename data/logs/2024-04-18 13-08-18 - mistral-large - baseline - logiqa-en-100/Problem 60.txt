  C: For most people, the amount of food eaten per day will not be affected by the number of foods eaten per day.
  D: For most people, the amount of food consumed is greatly affected by the time taken to eat.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The statement suggests that increasing the number of meals per day while keeping the total amount of food constant can decrease cholesterol levels. However, most people consume more food while increasing the number of meals.

Option A is incorrect because the statement does not suggest that daily food intake does not significantly affect cholesterol levels.

Option B is correct because the statement suggests that increasing the number of meals alone will not result in a significant reduction in cholesterol levels for most people since they consume more food while increasing the number of meals.

Option C is incorrect because the statement suggests that the amount of food eaten per day is affected by the number of meals eaten per day.

Option D is incorrect because the statement does not suggest that the time taken to eat affects the amount of food consumed.
