Topic: Logic
Context: Whether a person does good behavior or bad behavior depends on the length of his life.If he only lived one day, it would be best for him to steal other people â€™s things because he would not suffer the fear of being caught.Stealing things from others is not the best for someone who can still live for 20 years, because he will suffer the fear of being caught.
Question: Which of the following statements is the assumption upon which the above argument relies?
Choices:
  A: Before deciding whether to steal something from someone else, a person can know exactly how long he can live.
  B: Anyone who steals things from others will not live for a few days.
  C: As long as you are not caught, worrying about being caught will not cause pain to people, because the people who steal things have already been prepared.
  D: A person who knows that he cannot live for a few days usually chooses to do something good instead of doing something bad.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The argument assumes that the length of a person's life determines whether they will engage in good or bad behavior, specifically stealing. It also assumes that the fear of being caught is a factor in this decision.

The assumption is not that a person knows exactly how long they can live (A), that anyone who steals will not live for a few days (B), or that people who steal are prepared for the consequences (C). It is also not assumed that a person who knows they cannot live for a few days will choose to do something good instead of bad (D).

Action: Answer("A")

Explanation:
The argument assumes that a person's decision to steal is based on how long they can live, which implies that they have some knowledge of their lifespan. Therefore, the assumption upon which the argument relies is that before deciding whether to steal something from someone else, a person can know exactly how long he can live (A).
