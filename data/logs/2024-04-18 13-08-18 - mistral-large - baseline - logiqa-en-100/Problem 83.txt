Topic: Logic
Context: A provincial Go team coach selects 4 of the 7 players from E, F, G, H, J, K and M to participate in the professional league.The selection must meet the following conditions? E or F has one person to participate, but not both .One of J or K will participate, but not both.If J participates, then G participates.Unless F participates, M does not participate.
Question: If H does not participate in the game, which of the following two players must be included in the game?
Choices:
  A: F and G
  C: F and K
  B: E and M
  D: G and K
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Since H does not participate, there are 3 spots left to fill.
Since E or F has one person to participate, but not both, we have two possibilities: E participates or F participates.
If E participates, then M can participate since F is not participating. But we still need one more player. Since J or K will participate, but not both, and if J participates, then G participates, we cannot choose J since G cannot participate (all spots are filled). Therefore, K must participate.
If F participates, then M must participate since F is participating. But we still need one more player. Since J or K will participate, but not both, and if J participates, then G participates, we cannot choose J since G cannot participate (all spots are filled). Therefore, K must participate.
In both cases, K must participate.
In the first case, E and K must participate.
In the second case, F and K must participate.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
