## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The argument presented is flawed because it assumes that no one can be impartial in judging a debate, regardless of whether they share the same opinion as the debaters or have different opinions. It fails to consider that there can be objective standards and logical reasoning beyond personal opinions that can be used to evaluate the arguments presented in a debate.
