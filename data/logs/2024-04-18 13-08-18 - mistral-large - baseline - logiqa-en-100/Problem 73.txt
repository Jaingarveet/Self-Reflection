(1) If G or H is arranged to play, they must be in the front.Bit.(2) If K is scheduled to play, he must be in the middle.(3) If L is scheduled to play, he must be on team 1.(4) Neither P nor K can be in the same team as N.(5) P cannot be in the same team as Q.(6) If H is in team 2, Q is in the middle of team 1.
Question: If G is in team 1, which pair of magicians can be in team 1?
Choices:
  A: K and L
  B: K and P
  C: L and N
  D: L and Q
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
If G is in team 1, he must be in the front (condition 1).
Since L must be in team 1 (condition 3), L can be in the middle or back.
Since K must be in the middle (condition 2), K cannot be in team 1 because L is already in team 1 and K cannot be in the same team as N (condition 4).
Since P cannot be in the same team as Q (condition 5), P and Q cannot both be in team 1.
Since H is not in team 1, Q is not in the middle of team 1 (condition 6).
Therefore, the possible pairs of magicians in team 1 are L and N or L and Q.
Action: Answer("D")
