You are an expert in Logic.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Topic: Logic
Context: Right and wrong and whether they violate the rules are two things.There may be regulations that prohibit things that are not wrong in themselves, such as laws in certain countries that prohibit criticism of the government; there may also be regulations that require things that are inherently wrong, such as laws that require apartheid in public places.And, like evaluating behavior, we can also evaluate some of the prescribed right and wrong.
Question: Which of the following does not weaken, but supports the argument in the question stem?
Choices:
  A: If we do not follow some pre-existing regulations or standards, how can we judge right and wrong?
  B: "People are doing, heaven is watching." Failure to act in accordance with ethical regulations will incur punishment from heaven.
  C: Behind the judgment of right and wrong, you can always find the rules or standards on which people judge.
  D: The basis for judgment of right and wrong lies in pushing oneself and one's moral conscience.It is common and universal; however, the moral regulations on how to act for people vary from person to person and from place to place.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The argument in the question stem is that right and wrong and whether they violate the rules are two different things. There may be regulations that prohibit things that are not inherently wrong, and there may be regulations that require things that are inherently wrong.

Choice A supports the argument by suggesting that regulations are necessary to judge right and wrong.
Choice B does not support the argument because it suggests that ethical regulations are absolute and not subject to variation.
Choice C supports the argument by suggesting that rules or standards are always behind judgments of right and wrong.
Choice D does not support the argument because it suggests that moral regulations vary from person to person and from place to place, which contradicts the idea that regulations can be inherently wrong or not wrong.

Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
