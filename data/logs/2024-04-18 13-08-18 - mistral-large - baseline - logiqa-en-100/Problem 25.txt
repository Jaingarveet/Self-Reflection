## Assistant 2:
Thought:
From (2), Wang Wei and Wu Gang are both doctors.
From (1), there are only 2 doctors, so Li Qiang and Liu Dawei cannot be doctors.
From (4), Li Qiang and Wang Wei are not all tall, so Li Qiang is not tall.
From (3), Liu Dawei and Li Qiang are the same height, so Liu Dawei is also not tall.
From (1), there are 3 tall men, so Wang Wei, Wu Gang, and one of Li Qiang or Liu Dawei must be tall. Since Li Qiang and Liu Dawei are not tall, Wang Wei and Wu Gang must be tall.
From (1), there is only 1 handsome man, and it cannot be Li Qiang or Liu Dawei since they are not tall. It also cannot be Wang Wei since he is not a doctor (from (1)). Therefore, Wu Gang must be handsome.
