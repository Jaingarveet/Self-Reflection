## User 2:
Topic: Logic
Context: Some Taiwan independence elements argue that all people under the jurisdiction of the People ’s Republic of China are Chinese, and Taiwanese are not under the jurisdiction of the People ’s Republic of China.Therefore, Taiwanese are not Chinese.
Question: Which of the following reasoning clearly shows that the above argument is not valid?
Choices:
  A: All successful people have to eat in clothes.I am not a successful person now, so I do n’t have to eat in clothes.
  B: Commodities have use value, and air certainly has use value, so air is of course a commodity.
  C: All technical backbones study hard.Xiao Zhang is a technical backbone.Therefore, Xiao Zhang is a hard-working person.
  D: Criminal behaviors are illegal behaviors, and violations should be condemned by the society, so all criminal behaviors should be condemned by the society.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The argument in the context is not valid because it is based on a false premise that being under the jurisdiction of the People's Republic of China is the only criteria for being Chinese. The argument also assumes that being Taiwanese and being Chinese are mutually exclusive, which is not necessarily true.

To show that the argument is not valid, we need to find an example of invalid reasoning that has a similar structure.

Choice A is not relevant because it does not have a similar structure to the argument in the context.

Choice B is not relevant because it does not have a similar structure to the argument in the context.

Choice C is not relevant because it is a valid argument.

Choice D is not relevant because it does not have a similar structure to the argument in the context.

Action: Answer("A")

Explanation:
Choice A is the best answer because it has a similar structure to the argument in the context. The argument in choice A is not valid because it assumes that eating in clothes is the only criteria for being successful, which is not necessarily true. Similarly, the argument in the context assumes that being under the jurisdiction of the People's Republic of China is the only criteria for being Chinese, which is also not necessarily true.
