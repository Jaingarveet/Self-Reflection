(1) H and Y must be allocated in the same department.(2) F and G cannot be allocated in the same department (3) If X is allocated in the sales department, W is allocated in the production department.(4) F must be allocated in the production department.

Choices:
  A: G is assigned to the sales department
  B: H is assigned to the production department.
  C: I was assigned to the sales department.
  D: W is assigned to the public relations department.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
If X and F are assigned to the same department, they must be assigned to the production department, as F must be allocated in the production department (condition 4).
Since H and Y must be allocated in the same department (condition 1), they cannot be assigned to the production department, as there is only one spot left in the production department.
Therefore, H and Y must be assigned to either the sales or public relations department.
Since F and G cannot be allocated in the same department (condition 2), G cannot be assigned to the production department.
Therefore, G must be assigned to either the sales or public relations department.
If G is assigned to the sales department (choice A), it is possible to allocate the remaining employees to meet all the conditions.
If H is assigned to the production department (choice B), it violates condition 1, as Y cannot be assigned to the production department.
If I is assigned to the sales department (choice C), it is possible to allocate the remaining employees to meet all the conditions.
If W is assigned to the public relations department (choice D), it is possible to allocate the remaining employees to meet all the conditions.
Action: Answer("B")
