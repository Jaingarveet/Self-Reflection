Topic: Logic
Context: There must be an outside world, because if there is something outside me that can shine or reflect, shining the light into my eyes, which gives me a visual experience, I ca nâ€™t see the buildings, the crowds and the stars these things.And, not only have visual experience like me, but others also have such visual experience; book knowledge also tells us repeatedly that there is an outside world outside of us.
Question: Which of the following does not constitute doubt or rebuttal to the above argument?
Choices:
  A: To use sensory evidence to explain the existence of the external world requires presupposing the existence of the external world in the mind.
  B: How do you prove that others have similar visual experience to you?
  C: Since the visual experience is reliable, Mirage is not a so-called illusion, but a real existence.
  D: If there is no external world and natural science knowledge is not a true reflection of it, then why does natural science achieve such great success in practice?
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The argument is that the existence of an outside world is proven by visual experiences and book knowledge.
Option A questions the use of sensory evidence to explain the existence of the external world, which is a doubt to the argument.
Option B questions the assumption that others have similar visual experiences, which is a rebuttal to the argument.
Option C is not a doubt or rebuttal to the argument, as it accepts the reliability of visual experiences.
Option D questions the success of natural science in practice if there is no external world, which is a doubt to the argument.
Action: Answer("C")
