Explanation:
I made a mistake in calculating the distance traveled by the plane when they meet. 
I multiplied the speed of the ship by the time instead of multiplying it by 10 times the time. 
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Multiplication error
 - Algebraic manipulation error
Solution:
Let's assume the speed of the ship is "s" and the time it takes to meet the plane is "t". 
The distance traveled by the ship before meeting the plane is 180 miles.
The distance traveled by the plane before meeting the ship is 10s*t.
The total distance traveled by the plane and the ship when they meet is the same and can be represented as s*t + 10s*t = 11s*t.
The distance traveled by the ship when they meet is s*t, which can be calculated using the formula: s*t = 180
The distance traveled by the plane when they meet is 10s*t, which can be calculated using the formula: 10s*t = 11s*t - 180
Solving for t, we get t = 20.
Substituting t in the formula s*t = 180, we get s = 9.
The distance traveled by the plane when they meet is 10s*t = 10*9*20 = 1800.
Therefore, the distance from the starting point when they meet is 180 + 1800 = 1980 miles.
Dividing 1980 by 10, we get 198.
Instructions:
1. Identify the speeds of the ship and the plane.
2. Identify the distance traveled by the ship before meeting the plane.
3. Identify the distance traveled by the plane before meeting the ship.
4. Write an equation that represents the total distance traveled by the plane and the ship when they meet.
5. Write an equation that represents the distance traveled by the ship when they meet.
6. Write an equation that represents the distance traveled by the plane when they meet.
7. Solve the system of equations to find the time it takes for the plane and the ship to meet.
8. Substitute the time into the equation for the distance traveled by the ship to find the speed of the ship.
9. Substitute the time into the equation for the distance traveled by the plane to find the distance traveled by the plane when they meet.
10. Add the distance traveled by the ship before meeting the plane to the distance traveled by the plane when they meet to find the distance from the starting point when they meet.
11. Check your calculations and final answer for accuracy.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always define your variables and equations before solving the problem.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember to use algebraic manipulation to solve systems of equations.
 - Remember to use the formula distance = speed x time to solve distance, speed, and time problems.
