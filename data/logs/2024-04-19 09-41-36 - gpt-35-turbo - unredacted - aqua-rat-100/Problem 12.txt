Explanation:
I correctly solved for x, but I made an error in calculating 50% of x. 
I multiplied x by 50% instead of dividing it by 2. 
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Multiplication error
 - Percentage error
Solution:
Let's assume the number is "x".
According to the problem, (x - 30) = (1/3)x.
Solving for x, we get x = 60.
Now, we need to find 50% of x, which is (50/100)x = (1/2)x = (1/2)60 = 30.
