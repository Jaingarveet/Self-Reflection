Explanation:
I correctly set up the equation to solve for x, but I made a calculation error while solving it. 
The gap in my knowledge was not in setting up the equation but in solving it. 
I knew the correct approach but made a calculation error.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Ratio error
 - Algebraic error
Solution:
Let's assume that the number of boys and girls who joined the group is x.
So, the total number of boys in the group is 64 + x and the total number of girls in the group is 40 + x.
We can set up the equation 4/3 = (64 + x)/(40 + x) to solve for x.
Multiplying both sides by 40 + x, we get 4(40 + x) = 3(64 + x).
Simplifying the equation, we get 160 + 4x = 192 + 3x.
Solving for x, we get x = 32.
Adding x to the initial number of boys and girls, we get the total number of members in the group, which is 64 + 40 + 32 + 32 = 168.
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and understand the problem.
2. Identify the unknowns and set up the equations to solve for them.
3. Simplify the equations and solve for the unknowns.
4. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
5. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always identify the unknowns and set up the equations to solve for them.
 - Always simplify the equations and solve for the unknowns.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that ratios represent proportional relationships between two or more quantities.

Solving for x, we get x = 32.
