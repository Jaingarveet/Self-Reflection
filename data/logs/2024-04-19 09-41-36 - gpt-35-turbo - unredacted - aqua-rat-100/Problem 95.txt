## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: John likes to have lightly flavored tea every evening. In a 50% strong milk tea, he replaces 15% of it with milk twice. Then, he replaces 10 percent of the resultant solution with more milk.
What is the final concentration of tea John drinks?
Choices:
  A: 15.38%
  B: 42%
  C: 39.86%
  D: 22.35%
  E: 32.51%
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I made a calculation error while calculating the concentration of tea after the second replacement. 
I forgot to subtract the percentage of milk from the resultant solution.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Arithmetic error
 - Concentration error
Solution:
John replaces 15% of 50% strong milk tea twice, which means he replaces 7.5% of tea with milk twice.
After the first replacement, the concentration of tea becomes 42.5%.
After the second replacement, the concentration of tea becomes 36.125%.
Then, he replaces 10% of the resultant solution with milk.
The concentration of tea becomes 32.5125%.
Instructions:
1. Identify the initial concentration of tea.
2. Identify the percentage of milk John replaces twice.
3. Calculate the concentration of tea after the first replacement.
4. Calculate the concentration of tea after the second replacement.
5. Calculate the concentration of tea after the third replacement.
6. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
7. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that concentration is the amount of solute divided by the total amount of solution.
