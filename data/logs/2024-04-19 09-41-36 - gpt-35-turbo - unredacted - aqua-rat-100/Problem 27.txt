## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")

Topic: Math
Question: M men agree to purchase a gift for Rs. D. If 3 men drop out how much more will each have to contribute towards the purchase of the gift?
Choices:
  A: D/(M-3)
  B: MD/3
  C: M/(D-3)
  D: 3D/(M2-3M)
  E: None of these
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
My mistake was in the calculation of the difference between the two contributions. 
The correct difference is (D/M) - (D/(M-3)) = 3D/(M(M-3)).
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Algebraic error
 - Subtraction error
Solution:
Let the initial contribution of each man be x.
So, the total contribution of M men would be Mx = D.
Therefore, x = D/M.
After 3 men drop out, the total number of men becomes M-3.
So, the new contribution of each man would be (D/(M-3)).
The difference between the two contributions would be (D/(M-3)) - (D/M) = 3D/(M(M-3)).
Instructions:
1. Identify the initial contribution of each man.
2. Calculate the total contribution of all M men.
3. Calculate the initial contribution of each man using the formula x = D/M.
4. Calculate the new number of men after 3 men drop out.
5. Calculate the new contribution of each man using the formula (D/(M-3)).
6. Calculate the difference between the two contributions using the formula (D/(M-3)) - (D/M) = 3D/(M(M-3)).
7. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
8. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that algebraic manipulation requires careful attention to detail.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
We can use the formula (D/(M-3)) - (D/M) = 3D/(M(M-3)) to calculate the difference between the two contributions.
Action: Answer("D")
