## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Explanation:
I made a mistake in the calculation of the equation 299986a + 29996b + 2996c = 25. 
I incorrectly assumed that the only possible value of c that satisfies this equation is 7. 
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Algebraic error
 - Equation solving error
Solution:
Let's assume the 5 digit number is "abcde".
According to the problem statement, if we add 1 after the number, it becomes "abcde1" and it is three times as large as it would be with a 1 before it, which is "1abcde".
So, we can write the equation as 3(1abcde) = abcde1.
Simplifying this equation, we get 299997a + 29997b + 2997c + 297d + 30e = 10a + b + c + d + e + 3.
Simplifying further, we get 299986a + 29996b + 2996c + 296d = 7e + 3.
Since the left-hand side is divisible by 7, the right-hand side must also be divisible by 7.
The only value of e that satisfies this condition is 6.
Substituting e = 6 in the equation, we get 299986a + 29996b + 2996c + 296d = 45.
The only possible value of d that satisfies this equation is 5.
Substituting d = 5 in the equation, we get 299986a + 29996b + 2996c = 25.
The only possible value of c that satisfies this equation is 2.
Substituting c = 2 in the equation, we get 299986a + 29996b = 7.
The only possible value of b that satisfies this equation is 1.
Substituting b = 1 in the equation, we get 299986a = 4.
The only possible value of a that satisfies this equation is 1.
Therefore, the 5 digit number is 14285.
