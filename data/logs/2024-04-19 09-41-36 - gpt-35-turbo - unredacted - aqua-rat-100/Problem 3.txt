Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
The correct answer is not among the choices. The correct answer is 78.
The solution process is correct, and the answer is not among the choices. 
The closest answer is A, which is 56. However, this is the perimeter of the rectangular piece of cloth, not the original square piece of cloth.
Therefore, the correct answer is None of the Above, and the perimeter of the original square piece of cloth is 4x = 4*19.55 = 78 feet.
Error Keywords:
 - Incorrect answer choices
 - Calculation error
 - Rounding error
Solution:
The solution process is correct, and the answer is not among the choices.
The closest answer is A, which is 56. However, this is the perimeter of the rectangular piece of cloth, not the original square piece of cloth.
