Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I correctly identified that Roy has to take 5 tablets with a gap of 15 minutes between each tablet. However, I made a calculation error while multiplying the time gap between each tablet by the number of tablets. 
The correct calculation is 15 minutes x 4 = 60 minutes.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Multiplication error
Solution:
Roy has to take 5 tablets with a gap of 15 minutes between each tablet.
To find the total time, we need to multiply the time gap between each tablet by the number of tablets.
The time gap between each tablet is 15 minutes.
The number of tablets is 5.
The total time taken to consume all the tablets is 15 minutes x 4 = 60 minutes.
Instructions:
1. Identify the time gap between each tablet.
2. Identify the number of tablets.
3. Multiply the time gap between each tablet by the number of tablets.
4. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.
5. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
6. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that multiplication is the result of adding a number to itself a certain number of times.
