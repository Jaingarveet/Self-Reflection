You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I used the correct method to add two numbers with different signs, but I made a calculation error.
The correct answer is +15 because we subtract the smaller absolute value from the larger absolute value and keep the sign of the larger number.
The absolute value of +45 is larger than the absolute value of -30.
So, we subtract 30 from 45 and keep the sign of +45, which is positive.
The result is +15.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Addition error
 - Sign error
Solution:
To add +45 and -30, we subtract the smaller absolute value from the larger absolute value and keep the sign of the larger number.
The absolute value of +45 is larger than the absolute value of -30.
So, we subtract 30 from 45 and keep the sign of +45, which is positive.
The result is +15.
Instructions:
1. Identify the two numbers to be added.
2. Determine the sign of each number.
