## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

  A: 550
  B: 570
  C: 600
  D: 700
  E: none of these

Explanation:
I made a mistake in assuming that the answer must be one of the given choices. 
The correct answer is "none of these" because none of the given choices satisfy the conditions of the problem. 
To find the minimum number of students, we need to find the smallest integer value of x that satisfies both equations. 
We can start by assuming that x is a multiple of 100, since 20% and 28% are multiples of 100. 
If x = 500, then 20% of x is 100 and 28% of x is 140, which means that there are at least 240 students in the school. 
If x = 600, then 20% of x is 120 and 28% of x is 168, which means that there are at least 288 students in the school. 
If x = 700, then 20% of x is 140 and 28% of x is 196, which means that there are at least 336 students in the school. 
Therefore, the minimum possible value of x is 700, and the correct answer is "none of these".

 - Calculation error
 - Logical error
Solution:
Let's assume that the number of students in the school is x.
According to the question, 20% of x took physics and 28% of x took math.
We can write the following equations:
0.2x > 0 (since there must be at least one student who took physics)
0.28x > 0 (since there must be at least one student who took math)
To find the minimum value of x, we need to find the smallest integer value of x that satisfies both equations.
We can start by assuming that x is a multiple of 100, since 20% and 28% are multiples of 100.
If x = 500, then 20% of x is 100 and 28% of x is 140, which means that there are at least 240 students in the school.
If x = 600, then 20% of x is 120 and 28% of x is 168, which means that there are at least 288 students in the school.
If x = 700, then 20% of x is 140 and 28% of x is 196, which means that there are at least 336 students in the school.
Therefore, the minimum possible value of x is 700, and the correct answer is "none of these".
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and understand the problem.
2. Write down the given information and the equations that represent the problem.
3. Identify the unknown variable and the conditions that it must satisfy.
4. Start with a reasonable assumption for the value of the variable.
5. Use logical reasoning and calculations to narrow down the possible values of the variable.
6. Check each possible value of the variable to see if it satisfies the conditions of the problem.
7. Choose the minimum value of the variable that satisfies all the conditions.
8. If none of the given choices match the minimum value, choose "none of these".
