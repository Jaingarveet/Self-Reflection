## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Explanation:
I made an error in the order of operations. I should have multiplied first before adding or subtracting. 
Error Keywords:
 - Order of operations error
 - Arithmetic error
 - Algebraic error
Solution:
[5 + ? × 19 - 15 - 7]/[13 × 13 - 156] = 6
[5 + ? × 19 - 22]/[13 × 13 - 156] = 6
[? × 19 - 17]/[169 - 156] = 6
[? × 19 - 17]/[13] = 6
? × 19 - 17 = 78
? × 19 = 95
? = 5
Instructions:
1. Simplify the expression inside the brackets using the order of operations (PEMDAS).
2. Simplify the expression on the left-hand side by performing the arithmetic operations in the numerator and denominator.
3. Isolate the missing value by using algebraic operations.
4. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
5. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always use the order of operations (PEMDAS) to simplify expressions.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that multiplication and division have higher precedence than addition and subtraction.
## Assistant 2:
Action: Answer("C") 
Explanation: 
[5 + ? × 19 - 15 - 7]/[13 × 13 - 156] = 6
[5 + ? × 19 - 22]/[13 × 13 - 156] = 6
[? × 19 - 17]/[169 - 156] = 6
[? × 19 - 17]/[13] = 6
? × 19 - 17 = 78
? × 19 = 95
? = 5
Therefore, the missing value is 5, which corresponds to choice C.
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
