Explanation:
I made a calculation error. I calculated 30% of the total number of matches played instead of 30% of the matches lost. 
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Percentage error
 - Misinterpretation of the problem
Solution:
The team won 20 matches.
The team lost 30% of their matches.
To find the number of matches lost, we need to calculate 30% of the total number of matches played.
30% of the total number of matches played is 0.3*(20+lost) = 6+0.3*lost.
We know that the team lost 30% of their matches, so 0.3*total_matches = lost.
0.3*total_matches = lost = 0.3*(20+lost)
0.3*total_matches = 6+0.3*lost
0.3*total_matches - 0.3*lost = 6
0.3*(total_matches - lost) = 6
total_matches - lost = 20
lost = 20 - total_matches
0.3*total_matches = 20 - total_matches
0.3*total_matches + total_matches = 20
1.3*total_matches = 20
total_matches = 20/1.3
total_matches = 15.38
The team lost 30% of their matches, which is 0.3*15.38 = 4.61, rounded to 3.
