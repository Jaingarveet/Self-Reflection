Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I made a mistake in calculating the fraction of work done by Mr.Black in a day. 
The gap in my knowledge was in calculating fractions and ratios. 
I made a calculation error while adding the fractions. 
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Fraction error
 - Ratio error
 - Addition error
Solution:
Let's first calculate the fraction of work done by each painter in a day.
Mr.Brown can paint a house in 6 days, so he can paint 1/6 of a house in a day.
Mr.Black can paint a house in 8 days, so he can paint 1/8 of a house in a day.
Mr.Blue can paint a house in 12 days, so he can paint 1/12 of a house in a day.
After 8 days, Mr.Brown has completed 8*(1/6) = 4/3 of the work.
Now, Mr.Black works for 6 days, so he completes 6*(1/8) = 3/4 of the work.
Together, Mr.Brown and Mr.Black have completed (4/3 + 3/4) = 25/12 of the work.
Thus, the remaining work is (1 - 25/12) = 7/12 of the work.
Let's assume Mr.Blue takes x days to complete the remaining work.
So, in x days, Mr.Blue can complete (1/12)*x of the work.
Now, we can set up an equation to solve for x:
(1/12)*x = 7/12
x = (7/12)/(1/12)
x = 7
Therefore, it will take Mr.Blue 7 days to complete the contract.
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and understand the problem.
2. Calculate the fraction of work done by each painter in a day.
3. Add the fractions of work done by each painter to calculate the total work done.
4. Subtract the total work done from 1 to find the remaining work.
5. Set up an equation to solve for the remaining work.
6. Solve the equation to find the time taken by the remaining painter to complete the work.
7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always calculate fractions and ratios accurately.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that adding fractions requires a common denominator.
