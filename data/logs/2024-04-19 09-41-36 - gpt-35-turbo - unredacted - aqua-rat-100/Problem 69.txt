## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Explanation:
I made a mistake in calculating the value of Both. 
I incorrectly calculated Neither as -5, which led to an incorrect value for Both. 
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Addition error
 - Subtraction error
Solution:
We can use the formula: 
Total = Group 1 + Group 2 - Both + Neither
We know that:
Group 1 (hardcover) = 30
Group 2 (fiction) = 20
Total = 45
We need to find Both (hardcover and fiction)
Neither = Total - (Group 1 + Group 2) = 45 - (30 + 20) = 45 - 50 = 0
We can now solve for Both:
Both = Group 1 + Group 2 - Total + Neither = 30 + 20 - 45 + 0 = 5
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and understand the problem.
2. Identify the groups and the total number of items.
3. Use the formula Total = Group 1 + Group 2 - Both + Neither.
4. Solve for Neither by subtracting the sum of Group 1 and Group 2 from the Total.
5. If Neither is negative, set it to zero.
6. Solve for Both by rearranging the formula to Both = Group 1 + Group 2 - Total + Neither.
7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember to use the correct formula for the problem.
 - Be careful when subtracting or adding numbers.

We can use the formula:

We know that:
Group 1 (hardcover) = 30
Group 2 (fiction) = 20
Total = 45
We need to find Both (hardcover and fiction)
Neither = Total - (Group 1 + Group 2) = 45 - (30 + 20) = 45 - 50 = 0
We can now solve for Both:
Both = Group 1 + Group 2 - Total + Neither = 30 + 20 - 45 + 0 = 5
Action: Answer("A")
