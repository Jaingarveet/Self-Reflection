  A: 50 m
  B: 75 m
  C: 100 m
  D: 125 m
  E: 150 m

Explanation:
I correctly calculated the speed of the space shuttle and the distance it traveled during the 5 seconds. However, I made a mistake in calculating the length of the space shuttle. I subtracted the distance traveled during the 5 seconds from the total distance traveled during the 40 seconds, which is incorrect. The distance traveled during the 5 seconds is the distance of the space shuttle itself, not the distance it traveled. To find the length of the space shuttle, we need to subtract the distance it traveled during the 40 seconds from the total distance it traveled during the 40 seconds.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Subtraction error
 - Misinterpretation of the problem
Solution:
We can use the formula: distance = speed x time
We need to find the speed of the space shuttle first.
The space shuttle travels 700m in 40 seconds, so its speed is 700/40 = 17.5 m/s.
We also know that it takes 5 seconds to pass a point, so the distance it covers during this time is 5 x 17.5 = 87.5 m.
To find the length of the space shuttle, we need to subtract the distance it traveled during the 40 seconds from the total distance it traveled during the 40 seconds.
Total distance = 700 m
Distance traveled during 40 seconds = 40 x 17.5 = 700 m
Length of space shuttle = Total distance - Distance traveled during 40 seconds = 700 - 700 = 0 m
The length of the space shuttle is 0 m, which means that the space shuttle is a point in space.
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and understand the problem.
2. Identify the given information and what needs to be found.
3. Use the appropriate formula to solve the problem.
4. Double-check your calculations and final answer.
5. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always identify the given information and what needs to be found.
 - Always use the appropriate formula to solve the problem.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that the distance traveled during a certain time is not the same as the distance of the object itself.
