## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Choices:
  A: 80°
  B: 130°
  C: 140°
  D: 160°
  E: 220°
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I made an error in my understanding of the problem. 
I incorrectly assumed that the measure of minor arc AB is equal to the measure of minor arc BC. 
The correct assumption is that the measure of minor arc AB is half the measure of minor arc AC. 
Error Keywords:
 - Misunderstanding the problem
 - Incorrect assumption
 - Misinterpreting the question
Solution:
If B bisects minor arc AC, then the measure of minor arc AB is half the measure of minor arc AC.
The measure of minor arc AC is 160°, so the measure of minor arc AB is 80°.
The measure of minor arc BD is 150°.
The sum of the measures of minor arc AC and minor arc BD is equal to the circumference of the circle.
Let x be the measure of minor arc AD.
Then, x + 80° + 150° = 360° (the circumference of the circle)
Solving for x, we get x = 130°.
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and understand the problem.
2. Identify the given information and what needs to be solved.
3. Draw a diagram to visualize the problem.
4. Identify any relevant theorems or formulas.
