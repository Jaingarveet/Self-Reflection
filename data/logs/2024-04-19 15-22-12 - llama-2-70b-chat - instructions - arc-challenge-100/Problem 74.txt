# Model: llama-2-70b-chat | Agent: instructions | Exam: arc-challenge-100 | Problem 74 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Science.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Choices:
  A: sound energy
  B: radiant energy
  C: thermal energy
  D: chemical energy
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:

1. Review the types of energy: kinetic, potential, sound, radiant, thermal, chemical.
2. Understand the definition of potential energy: energy an object has due to its position or state.
3. Identify the type of energy that is stored in the bonds of atoms and molecules: [REDACTED].
4. Choose the answer that matches the correct type of energy: [REDACTED] - [REDACTED].

Answer: D

Explanation:

1. Kinetic energy is the energy of motion, potential energy is energy stored in an object due to its position or state. Sound energy and radiant energy are types of kinetic energy. Thermal energy is the energy of motion of particles in a substance, it's also a type of kinetic energy. Chemical energy is the energy stored in the bonds of atoms and molecules, it's a type of potential energy.
2. The definition of potential energy is energy an object has due to its position or state. Chemical energy is the energy stored in the bonds of atoms and molecules, it's a type of potential energy because it's energy that can be released when the bonds are broken or formed.
3. The type of energy that is stored in the bonds of atoms and molecules is chemical energy.
4. The answer that matches the correct type of energy is D: chemical energy.

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, I chose C: thermal energy. But thermal energy is a type of kinetic energy, not potential energy. Chemical energy is the type of energy that is stored in the bonds of atoms and molecules, and it's a type of potential energy. I realized my mistake and corrected it.
## Result:
