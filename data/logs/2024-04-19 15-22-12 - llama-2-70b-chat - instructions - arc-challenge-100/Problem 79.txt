## Assistant 2:
  Topic: Science
Question: Which of these indicates a physical change that occurs during the process of digestion?
Choices:
  A: the addition of acids to create a ball of food
  B: the secretion of pepsin to change proteins to peptides
  C: the breakdown of food substances by digestive juices
  D: the squeezing of food through the intestines

Reflection:
In my previous response, I incorrectly answered this question. I chose option A, which is incorrect. After reflecting on the question, I realized that option C is the correct answer. Physical change refers to a change in the physical state of a substance, such as breaking down large molecules into smaller ones. Option C, "the breakdown of food substances by digestive juices," accurately describes a physical change that occurs during digestion. Therefore, the correct answer is option C.

Action: Answer("C")
