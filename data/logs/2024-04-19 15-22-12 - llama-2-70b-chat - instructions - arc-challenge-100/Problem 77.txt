## System:
You are an expert in Science.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: Sheep Challenge Evolution A species of sheep lives on the Scottish island of Hirta. Hirta has plenty of grass for the sheep to eat, and no natural predators of the sheep live on the island. Some sheep have dark wool, and some have light wool. The sheep with dark wool tend to be much larger and stronger than the sheep with light wool. However, researchers have found that in the last 20 years, the sheep with light wool have increased in number. Usually, strength and size help animals survive and breed. A new sheep predator is introduced to the island. Which change to the sheep population will most likely occur first?
Choices:
  A: a decrease in the population of sheep with dark wool
  B: a decrease in the population of sheep with light wool
  C: an increase in the population of sheep with dark wool
  D: an increase in the population of sheep with light wool

2. Consider the effect of a new predator on the sheep population.
3. Evaluate the advantage of smaller size in escaping predators.
4. Choose the answer that reflects the likely change in the sheep population.

Answer: B

Explanation:

1. The relationship between the traits of the sheep and their ability to survive and breed is that larger, stronger sheep with dark wool have an advantage in terms of survival and breeding.
2. The introduction of a new predator to the island will likely have a negative impact on the sheep population as a whole.
3. Smaller sheep with light wool may have an advantage in escaping predators due to their smaller size and agility.
4. Given the introduction of a new predator, the population of sheep with light wool is likely to increase as they are better able to escape predation. Therefore, the answer is B: a decrease in the population of sheep with dark wool.

Reflection:

In my previous answer, I incorrectly chose option A, a decrease in the population of sheep with dark wool. I realized that my mistake was due to not considering the effect of the new predator on the sheep population. I did not take into account that the introduction of a predator would likely lead to a decrease in the population of both dark and light wool sheep, with the smaller, lighter sheep having an advantage in escaping predation. Therefore, I have reevaluated my answer and chosen option B, a decrease in the population of sheep with light wool, as the correct answer.
## Result:
Agent Answer: None
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
