  Topic: Science
Question: The skin is the largest organ in the human body. Why is skin considered to be an organ?
Choices:
  A: It is made of cells.
  B: It acts as a barrier.
  C: It is made of tissues.
  D: It is part of an organism.

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly. I chose answer A, "It is made of cells," because I thought that the question was asking about the basic composition of the skin. However, the correct answer is C, "It is made of tissues." The skin is composed of multiple layers of epithelial, connective, and muscle tissues, which work together to perform various functions such as protection, regulation, and sensation.

Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
