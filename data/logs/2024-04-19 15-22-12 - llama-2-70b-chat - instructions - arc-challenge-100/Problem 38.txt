## System:
You are an expert in Science.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: Red-clay bricks have a density of approximately 2000 kg/m^3. Air has a density of 1 kg/m^3. Which of the following has the lowest mass?
Choices:
  A: 2 m^3 of bricks
  B: 4 m^3 of bricks
  C: 6000 m^3 of air
  D: 10,000 m^3 of air
Reflection:

Question: Red-clay bricks have a density of approximately 2000 kg/m^3. Air has a density of 1 kg/m^3. Which of the following has the lowest mass?
Choices:
  A: 2 m^3 of bricks
  B: 4 m^3 of bricks
  C: 6000 m^3 of air
  D: 10,000 m^3 of air
Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly.
I reflected on the problem, my solution, and the correct answer.
I realized that I made a mistake in my calculations.
I misunderstood the density of air and bricks.
I calculated the mass of bricks correctly.
I calculated the mass of air incorrectly.
I used the wrong density for air.
I used the density of bricks instead of air.
I should have used 1 kg/m^3 as the density of air.
I should have used 2000 kg/m^3 as the density of bricks.
Now, let's recalculate the mass of air.
6000 m^3 of air x 1 kg/m^3 = 6000 kg
10,000 m^3 of air x 1 kg/m^3 = 10,000 kg
Action: Answer("C")

The correct answer is C: 6000 m^3 of air.
The mass of 6000 m^3 of air is 6000 kg, which is lower than the mass of 2 m^3 of bricks (4000 kg) and 4 m^3 of bricks (8000 kg).
Therefore, the answer is C: 6000 m^3 of air.
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
