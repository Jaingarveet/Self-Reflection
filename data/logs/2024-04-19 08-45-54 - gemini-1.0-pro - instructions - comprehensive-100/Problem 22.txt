## Self-Reflection
**Previous Incorrect Answer:** C
**Reasoning:** I incorrectly assumed that Nina's report on Wednesday would automatically trigger Helen and Irving's reports on Thursday, regardless of the day Nina's report was given.
**Correct Answer:** E
**Reasoning:**
1. **Students giving reports:** George, Nina, and Robert.
2. **Days for reports:** Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.
3. **Constraints:**
    - George: Tuesday only.
    - Olivia and Robert: Not in the afternoon.
    - If Nina gives a report, then Helen and Irving must both give reports the next day, unless Nina's report is on Wednesday.
4. **Rules:**
    - Two reports per day.
    - One report in the morning and one in the afternoon.
5. **Exceptions:**
    - Nina's report on Wednesday does not trigger Helen and Irving's reports on Thursday.
6. **Applying the rules and exceptions:**
    - Since George can only give a report on Tuesday, he must give the morning report.
    - Since Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports, they must give the morning reports on Monday and Wednesday.
    - This leaves the afternoon report on Monday and the morning report on Tuesday open for Nina and Robert.
    - If Nina gives the afternoon report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday, which is not possible because George is already giving a report on Tuesday.
    - Therefore, Nina must give the morning report on Tuesday.
    - This leaves the afternoon report on Monday open for Robert.
7. **Conclusion:**
    - George gives the morning report on Tuesday.
    - Nina gives the morning report on Tuesday.
    - Robert gives the afternoon report on Monday.
    - Olivia gives the morning report on Wednesday.
8. **Double-checking:**
    - All constraints and rules are satisfied.
    - Each student gives a report on a different day.
    - The order of the reports follows the rules.
9. **Answer:** E: Robert gives a report on Wednesday.
