Context: There are two kinds of horror stories: those that describe a mad scientist's experiments and those that describe a monstrous beast. In some horror stories about monstrous beasts, the monster symbolizes a psychological disturbance in the protagonist. Horror stories about mad scientists, on the other hand, typically express the author's feeling that scientific knowledge alone is not enough to guide human endeavor. However, despite these differences, both kinds of horror stories share two features: they describe violations of the laws of nature and they are intended to produce dread in the reader.
Question: If the statements above are true, which one of the following would also have to be true?
Choices:
  A: All descriptions of monstrous beasts describe violations of the laws of nature.
  B: Any story that describes a violation of a law of nature is intended to invoke dread in the reader.
  C: Horror stories of any kind usually describe characters who are psychologically disturbed.
  D: Most stories about mad scientists express the author's antiscientific views.
  E: Some stories that employ symbolism describe violations of the laws of nature.

## Assistant 2:
## Self-reflection on previous incorrect answer:
**Mistake:** I incorrectly chose answer A in the previous attempt. This was due to a misinterpretation of the passage. I focused on the statement about monstrous beasts violating the laws of nature and mistakenly assumed that all descriptions of such creatures would involve such violations.
**Learning:** I need to pay closer attention to the specific wording of the passage and avoid making assumptions that go beyond the information provided. 
## Applying the learnings to the current attempt:
**Key points:**
* Horror stories about monstrous beasts can symbolize psychological disturbances.
* Horror stories about mad scientists express concerns about the limitations of scientific knowledge.
* Both types of stories involve violations of natural laws and aim to evoke dread.
**Question:** Which of the following must be true based on the passage?
**Analysis of answer choices:**
* **A:** Not necessarily true. The passage only mentions some stories about monstrous beasts violating natural laws, not all.
* **B:** Not necessarily true. The passage only mentions that both types of horror stories involve violations of natural laws, not that all stories with such violations aim to evoke dread.
* **C:** Not necessarily true. The passage only mentions that some horror stories about monstrous beasts symbolize psychological disturbances, not all horror stories in general.
* **D:** Not necessarily true. The passage mentions that horror stories about mad scientists express concerns about the limitations of scientific knowledge, not necessarily anti-scientific views.
* **E:** True. The passage mentions that both types of horror stories involve violations of natural laws, and some stories that employ symbolism can involve such violations.
**Conclusion:**
Based on the analysis, the only answer choice that must be true is E. 
**Action:** Answer("E")
