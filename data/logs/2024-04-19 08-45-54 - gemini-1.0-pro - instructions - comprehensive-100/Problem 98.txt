# Model: gemini-1.0-pro | Agent: instructions | Exam: comprehensive-100 | Problem 98 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Medicine.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:
Topic: Geography
Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Medicine
Subtopic: Biochemistry
Question: Aminoacyl t-RNA is not require for ?
Choices:
  A: Proline
  B: Lysine
  C: Hydroxylysine
  D: Methionine
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and identify the amino acid in question.
2. Recall your knowledge of amino acid biosynthesis and post-translational modifications.
3. Determine if the amino acid is directly translated from mRN[REDACTED] or formed by post-translational modification.
4. If the amino acid is directly translated from mRN[REDACTED], choose the answer that indicates aminoacyl t-RN[REDACTED] is required.
5. If the amino acid is formed by post-translational modification, choose the answer that indicates aminoacyl t-RN[REDACTED] is not required.
6. Double-check your answer to ensure it aligns with your reasoning.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
1. The question asks about the amino acid that does not require aminoacyl t-RNA.
2. Aminoacyl t-RNA is required for the translation of amino acids from mRNA into proteins.
3. Proline, lysine, and methionine are all directly translated from mRNA.
4. Hydroxylysine is not directly translated from mRNA but is formed by post-translational modification of lysine.
5. Therefore, aminoacyl t-RNA is not required for hydroxylysine.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
