Question: In 2015 the populations of City $\mathrm{X}$ and City $\mathrm{Y}$ were equal. From 2010 to 2015, the population of City X increased by $20 \%$ and the population of City $\mathrm{Y}$ decreased by $10 \%$. If the population of City $\mathrm{X}$ was 120,000 in 2010, what was the population of City Y in 2010 ?
Choices:
  A: 60,000
  B: 90,000
  C: 160,000
  D: 240,000

## Assistant 2:
## Reflection on previous incorrect answer:
My previous answer was incorrect because I did not correctly calculate the population of City X in 2015. I incorrectly added the 20% increase to the 2010 population, resulting in an inflated population for City X in 2015. This led me to choose an incorrect answer for the population of City Y in 2010.
## Step-by-step solution:
1. **Define variables:**
    - Let $X_{2010}$ be the population of City X in 2010.
    - Let $Y_{2010}$ be the population of City Y in 2010.
2. **Translate the problem into equations:**
    - We know that $X_{2015} = Y_{2015}$ (populations were equal in 2015).
    - We also know that $X_{2015} = 1.2X_{2010}$ (population of City X increased by 20%).
    - Finally, we know that $Y_{2015} = 0.9Y_{2010}$ (population of City Y decreased by 10%).
3. **Solve the equations:**
    - Since $X_{2015} = Y_{2015}$, we can substitute the second equation into the third equation:
        - $1.2X_{2010} = 0.9Y_{2010}$
    - We are given that $X_{2010} = 120,000$:
        - $1.2(120,000) = 0.9Y_{2010}$
    - Solving for $Y_{2010}$:
        - $Y_{2010} = \frac{1.2 \times 120,000}{0.9}$
        - $Y_{2010} = 160,000$
4. **Double-check:**
    - Verify that the calculated population of City Y in 2010 is consistent with the given information and the population growth/decline rates.
## Action: Answer("C") 
The population of City Y in 2010 was 160,000. 
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
