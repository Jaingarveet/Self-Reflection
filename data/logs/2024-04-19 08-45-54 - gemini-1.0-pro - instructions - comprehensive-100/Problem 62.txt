## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Assistant 2:
## Self-Reflection
**Previous Incorrect Answer:** $(9,-6)$
**Reasoning for Incorrect Answer:**
* I incorrectly identified the system of equations to be solved.
* I chose the wrong variable to solve for using substitution.
* I made a calculation error when solving for the remaining variable.
**Corrected Approach:**
1. **Identify the system of equations:**
$$\begin{array}{r}3 x+4 y=-23 \\2 y-x=-19\end{array}$$
2. **Choose a variable to solve for using substitution:**
Let's solve for $x$ in terms of $y$ from the second equation:
$$2y - x = -19$$
$$x = 2y + 19$$
3. **Substitute the solved expression for $x$ into the other equation:**
$$3(2y + 19) + 4y = -23$$
$$6y + 57 + 4y = -23$$
$$10y + 57 = -23$$
$$10y = -80$$
$$y = -8$$
4. **Substitute the value of the solved variable back into the equation from step 3 to solve for $x$:**
$$x = 2(-8) + 19$$
$$x = -16 + 19$$
$$x = 3$$
5. **Double-check all calculations and substitutions:**
All calculations and substitutions are correct.
6. **Choose the answer that matches the calculated values of $x$ and $y$:**
The solution $(x, y)$ is $(3, -8)$.
**Action:** Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
