Self-reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly by selecting choice D, which is not relevant to the question being asked. The question is asking for the most likely completion to the text on how to care for your skin when you travel. After reading the text carefully, I realized that the correct answer is choice A. This is because the text provides advice on how to pack the basic skin care products you use every day when traveling. The substeps in choice A provide additional advice on what hygiene products to bring and how to keep your skin soft and fresh after a long trip. This information is most helpful in completing the step and answering the question.
