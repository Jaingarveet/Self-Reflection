## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The passage states that housing prices continued to rise in the first quarter of 2005 despite government measures to suppress them.
Option A and B provide specific examples of rising housing prices and land prices in major cities, which support the assertion.
Option C and D offer opinions from real estate company chairmen, which may or may not be accurate.
Option C suggests a direct correlation between land development costs and house prices, but it doesn't necessarily mean that rising land prices are the sole cause of soaring housing prices.
Option D attributes rising housing prices to supply and demand, which is a common explanation but doesn't directly address the assertion about land prices being the chief culprit.
