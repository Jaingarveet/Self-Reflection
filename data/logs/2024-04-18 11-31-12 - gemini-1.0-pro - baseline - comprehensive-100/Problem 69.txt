# Model: gemini-1.0-pro | Agent: baseline | Exam: comprehensive-100 | Problem 69 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:
Topic: Geography
Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: $$\begin{aligned}& 2 x-3 y=-14 \\& 3 x-2 y=-6\end{aligned}$$If $(x, y)$ is a solution to the system of equations above, what is the value of $x-y$ ?
Choices:
  A: -20
  B: $\quad-8$
  C: -4
  D: 8
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
We can solve for $x$ and $y$ using elimination. 
Multiply the top equation by 2 and the bottom equation by 3:
$$\begin{aligned}& 4 x-6 y=-28 \\& 9 x-6 y=-18\end{aligned}$$
Subtract the bottom equation from the top equation:
$$-5x=-10$$
$$x=2$$
Plug in $x=2$ to the top equation:
$$2(2)-3y=-14$$
$$4-3y=-14$$
$$-3y=-18$$
$$y=6$$
Therefore, $x-y=2-6=-4$.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
