## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Question: If $(a x+2)(b x+7)=15 x^{2}+c x+14$ for all values of $x$, and $a+b=8$, what are the two possible values for $c$ ?
Choices:
  A: 3 and 5
  B: 6 and 35
  C: 10 and 21
  D: 31 and 41
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Expanding the left side of the equation gives $abx^2 + (7a+2b)x + 14$.
Comparing coefficients, we have $ab=15$, $7a+2b=c$, and $14=14$.
Since $a+b=8$, we can solve for $a$ and $b$ using substitution or elimination.
Using substitution, we can solve for $b$ in terms of $a$: $b=8-a$.
Substituting this into the equation $ab=15$, we get $a(8-a)=15$, which simplifies to $a^2-8a+15=0$.
Factoring, we get $(a-3)(a-5)=0$, so $a=3$ or $a=5$.
If $a=3$, then $b=5$, and $c=7a+2b=31$.
If $a=5$, then $b=3$, and $c=7a+2b=41$.
Action: Answer("D")
