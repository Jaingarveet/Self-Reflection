## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: In planning maintenance for a city's infrastructure, a civil engineer estimates that, starting from the present, the population of the city will decrease by 10 percent every 20 years. If the present population of the city is 50,000, which of the following expressions represents the engineer's estimate of the population of the city $t$ years from now?
Choices:
  A: $50,000(0.1)^{20 t}$
  B: $50,000(0.1)^{\frac{t}{20}}$
  C: $50,000(0.9)^{20 t}$
  D: $50,000(0.9)^{\frac{t}{20}}$
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The population decreases by 10% every 20 years, which means it retains 90% of its population every 20 years.
We can model this decrease using the formula for exponential decay:
$P(t) = P_0 \cdot (1 - r)^t$
where:
* $P(t)$ is the population after $t$ years
* $P_0$ is the initial population (50,000 in this case)
* $r$ is the rate of decrease (10% or 0.1)
* $t$ is the number of years that have passed
Since the population decreases every 20 years, we need to adjust the formula to reflect this:
$P(t) = P_0 \cdot (1 - r)^{\frac{t}{20}}$
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
