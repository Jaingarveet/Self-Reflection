Context: Prince Lima in Li Na's mind is tall, handsome and doctor.She knew four men, Wang Wei, Wu Gang, Li Qiang, and Liu Dawei, and one of them met all the conditions she required.(1) Among the 4 men, there are 3 tall men, 2 doctors, and 1 is handsome; (2) Wang Wei and Wu Gang are both doctors; (3) Liu Dawei and Li Qiang are the same height; (4) Li Qiang and Wang Wei Not all are tall.
Question: Who can meet all the requirements of Li Na?
Choices:
  A: Liu Dawei
  B: Li Qiang
  C: Wu Gang
  D: Wang Wei
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
1. There are 3 tall men, 2 doctors, and 1 is handsome.
2. Wang Wei and Wu Gang are both doctors.
3. Liu Dawei and Li Qiang are the same height.
4. Li Qiang and Wang Wei are not all tall.
Based on the information provided, we can deduce the following:
* Wang Wei and Wu Gang are both doctors, but we don't know if they are tall or handsome.
* Liu Dawei and Li Qiang are the same height, but we don't know if they are tall, handsome, or doctors.
* Li Qiang and Wang Wei are not both tall, so one of them must be tall and the other must not be tall.
Since we know that there are 3 tall men, and Li Qiang and Wang Wei are not both tall, then either Liu Dawei or Li Qiang must be tall.
Now, let's consider the information about the handsome man. We know that there is only 1 handsome man among the 4 men. Since Wang Wei and Wu Gang are both doctors, they cannot be the handsome man. This leaves Liu Dawei and Li Qiang as possibilities for the handsome man.
Therefore, the only man who can meet all of Li Na's requirements is the one who is tall, handsome, and a doctor. Based on the information we have, this man can only be **Liu Dawei**.
Action: Answer("A")
