Question: A straight picket fence is composed of x pickets each of which is 1/2 inch wide. If there are 6 inches of space between each pair of pickets, which of the following represents the length of fence in feet?
Choices:
  A: 13x/2
  B: 13x/2 - 6
  C: 13x/24
  D: (13x+1)/24
  E: (13x-12)/24
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The width of each picket is 1/2 inch.
The space between each pair of pickets is 6 inches.
Therefore, the total width of each pair of pickets and the space between them is 1/2 + 6 + 1/2 = 7 inches.
There are x pickets, so there are x-1 spaces between them.
The total length of the fence is the sum of the widths of all the pickets and spaces, which is x*(1/2) + (x-1)*7.
To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12.
Action: Answer("E")
