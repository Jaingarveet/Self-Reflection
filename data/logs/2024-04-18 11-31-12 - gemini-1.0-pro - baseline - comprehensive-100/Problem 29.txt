Let's analyze each choice:
A: No Russian novels and exactly one play are selected. This is possible. The organizer could select three French novels, one French play, and one Russian play.
B: Exactly one Russian novel and both French plays are selected. This is possible. The organizer could select two French novels, one Russian novel, and both French plays.
C: Exactly two French novels and the Russian play are selected. This is possible. The organizer could select two French novels, the Russian play, and two other works (either French novels or Russian novels).
D: Exactly two French novels and exactly two plays are selected. This is possible. The organizer could select two French novels, both French plays, and one Russian novel.
E: Exactly two Russian novels and exactly one play are selected. This is not possible. If two Russian novels are selected, then at least three novels are selected. However, the organizer can only select at most four novels. Therefore, this choice violates the requirement that at least three but no more than four novels are selected.
