Question: If the following item is true, can the argument be strengthened most?
Choices:
  A: The cost and selling price of "Inferno" are lower than that of "Harbour".
  B: The above advertisers who refused to renew their contracts have not affected the benefits after switching to other publications.
  C: Readers of family magazines are generally not interested in violent and pornographic content.

## Reflection on Previous Error:
**Error Keywords:** [REDACTED]
**Solution:**
The key to strengthening the argument is to find an option that further emphasizes the advertisers' ethical stance and the negative impact of "Inferno"'s content change.
**Instructions:**
Focus on the ethical responsibility aspect and the consequences of the content shift.
**Advice:**
- Eliminate options that don't directly relate to the advertisers' ethical concerns or the impact of the content change.
- Look for an option that reinforces the negative perception of "Inferno"'s new content and its effect on advertisers' decisions. 
## Answering the Question:
**Analysis of Choices:**
*   A: This focuses on the economic aspect, not the ethical concerns.
*   B: This doesn't strengthen the argument as it suggests the advertisers didn't face negative consequences.
*   C: **This strengthens the argument by highlighting the inappropriateness of the new content and explaining why advertisers would be ethically opposed to it.**
*   D: This weakens the argument as it suggests other advertisers are comfortable with the new content.
**Action: Answer("C")**
