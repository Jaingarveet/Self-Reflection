## Assistant 2:
Thought:
We know one professor got both parts of their statement right, one got both parts wrong, and one got one part right and one part wrong. 
*   If Professor Zhao is right, then both Tsinghua and Zhejiang are out, meaning USTC must be the winner. But then Professor Qian would also be right, which violates the given condition. So, Professor Zhao must be wrong.
*   If Professor Zhao is wrong, then the winner is either Tsinghua or Zhejiang. This means Professor Sun, who claims Tsinghua is the winner, must be the one with the completely correct statement. 
Therefore, the winner is Tsinghua University Team.
Action: Answer("A")
