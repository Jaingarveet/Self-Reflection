# Model: mistral-large | Agent: retry | Exam: comprehensive-100 | Problem 78 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Science.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:
Topic: Geography
Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Science
Question: Which of these indicates a physical change that occurs during the process of digestion?
Choices:
  A: the addition of acids to create a ball of food
  B: the secretion of pepsin to change proteins to peptides
  C: the breakdown of food substances by digestive juices
  D: the squeezing of food through the intestines

## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Physical changes involve changes in physical properties such as shape, size, and state of matter, without changing the chemical composition of the substance.
Chemical changes involve changes in chemical composition, resulting in the formation of new substances.
The addition of acids to create a ball of food (choice A) is a physical change because it does not change the chemical composition of the food.
The secretion of pepsin to change proteins to peptides (choice B) is a chemical change because it involves breaking down proteins into smaller peptides.
The breakdown of food substances by digestive juices (choice C) is a chemical change because it involves breaking down complex molecules into simpler ones.
The squeezing of food through the intestines (choice D) is a physical change because it involves changing the shape and position of the food without changing its chemical composition.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
