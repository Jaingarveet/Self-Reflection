Thought:
To solve this problem, we need to expand the equation $(a x+2)(b x+7)$ and compare it to $15 x^{2}+c x+14$.
Expanding the equation gives us $a b x^{2}+7 a x+2 b x+14$.
Comparing the coefficients of $x^{2}$ on both sides of the equation, we get $a b=15$.
Comparing the coefficients of $x$ on both sides of the equation, we get $7 a+2 b=c$.
We know that $a+b=8$, so we can rewrite the equation for $c$ as $7 a+2(8-a)=c$, which simplifies to $c=56-5 a$.
We have two equations and two unknowns, so we can solve for $a$ and $b$ using substitution or elimination.
Substituting $a=\frac{15}{b}$ into the equation $a+b=8$ gives us $\frac{15}{b}+b=8$, which simplifies to $b^{2}-8 b+15=0$.
Factoring this equation gives us $(b-3)(b-5)=0$, so the possible values for $b$ are $3$ and $5$.
Substituting these values back into the equation $a=\frac{15}{b}$ gives us $a=5$ and $a=3$, respectively.
Substituting these values into the equation $c=56-5 a$ gives us $c=3$ and $c=21$, respectively.
Action: Answer("C")
