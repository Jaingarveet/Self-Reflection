## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.

## Assistant 2:
Thought:
To solve for z, I need to isolate z on one side of the equation.
First, I'll subtract z from both sides of the equation:
2z - z = 1 - z
z = 1 - z
Next, I'll add z to both sides of the equation:
z + z = 1
2z = 1
Finally, I'll divide both sides of the equation by 2:
z = 1/2
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: B
