## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: Which of the following is an equation of a circle in the $x y$-plane with center $(0,4)$ and a radius with endpoint $\left(\frac{4}{3}, 5\right) ?$
Choices:
  A: $x^{2}+(y-4)^{2}=\frac{25}{9}$
  B: $x^{2}+(y+4)^{2}=\frac{25}{9}$
  C: $x^{2}+(y-4)^{2}=\frac{5}{3}$
  D: $x^{2}+(y+4)^{2}=\frac{3}{5}$

Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
The distance between the center $(0,4)$ and the point $\left(\frac{4}{3}, 5\right)$ is the radius of the circle.
Using the distance formula, we find that the radius is $\sqrt{\left(\frac{4}{3}-0\right)^2+(5-4)^2}=\sqrt{\frac{16}{9}+1}=\sqrt{\frac{25}{9}}=\frac{5}{3}$.
The equation of a circle with center $(h,k)$ and radius $r$ is $(x-h)^2+(y-k)^2=r^2$.
The center of the circle is $(0,4)$, and the radius is $\frac{5}{3}$.
Therefore, the equation of the circle is $(x-0)^2+(y-4)^2=\left(\frac{5}{3}\right)^2$, which simplifies to [REDACTED].
