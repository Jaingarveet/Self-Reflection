## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: $$0.10 x+0.20 y=0.18(x+y)$$Clayton will mix $x$ milliliters of a $10 \%$ by mass saline solution with $y$ milliliters of a $20 \%$ by mass saline solution in order to create an $18 \%$ by mass saline solution. The equation above represents this situation. If Clayton uses 100 milliliters of the $20 \%$ by mass saline solution, how many milliliters of the $10 \%$ by mass saline solution must he use?
Choices:
  A: 5
  B: 25
  C: 50
  D: 100
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
The equation can be simplified to $0.10x+0.20y=0.18x+0.18y$.
Combining like terms, we get $0.02x=0.02y$.
Dividing both sides by 0.02, we get $x=y$.
Since Clayton uses [REDACTED] milliliters of the $20 \%$ by mass saline solution, he must also use [REDACTED] milliliters of the $10 \%$ by mass saline solution.
However, the correct answer is [REDACTED]: 2[REDACTED].
This is because the equation $x=y$ only tells us that the amount of the $10 \%$ solution is equal to the amount of the $20 \%$ solution, but it does not tell us the actual value of x or y.
To find the actual value of x, we can substitute y=[REDACTED] into the equation $0.10x+0.20y=0.18(x+y)$.
This gives us $0.10x+0.20([REDACTED])=0.18(x+[REDACTED])$.
Simplifying this equation, we get $0.10x+20=0.18x+18$.
Combining like terms, we get $0.08x=2$.
Dividing both sides by 0.08, we get $x=2[REDACTED]$.
Therefore, Clayton must use 2[REDACTED] milliliters of the $10 \%$ by mass saline solution.
