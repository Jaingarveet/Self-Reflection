Topic: Math
Question: $$h=-16 t^{2}+v t+k$$The equation above gives the height $h$, in feet, of a ball $t$ seconds after it is thrown straight up with an initial speed of $v$ feet per second from a height of $k$ feet. Which of the following gives $v$ in terms of $h, t$, and $k$ ?
Choices:
  A: $v=h+k-16 t$
  B: $v=\frac{h-k+16}{t}$
  C: $v=\frac{h+k}{t}-16 t$
  D: $v=\frac{h-k}{t}+16 t$

## Self-Reflection
**Previous Incorrect Answer:**
I previously answered this question incorrectly, selecting option A as the answer. This was incorrect because I misinterpreted the formula and did not correctly isolate $v$.
**Reflection on the Problem:**
The problem asks for an expression for $v$ in terms of $h$, $t$, and $k$. This means we need to manipulate the given equation to solve for $v$.
**Reflection on My Solution:**
My initial approach was to simply rearrange the terms in the equation. However, this did not lead to an expression for $v$ in terms of the other variables.
**Reflection on the Correct Answer:**
The correct answer is option B: $v=\frac{h-k+16}{t}$. This can be obtained by following these steps:
1. Move the constant term $k$ to the right side of the equation: $h-k = -16t^2 + vt$
2. Factor out $v$ from the right side: $h-k = v(-16t + t)$
3. Isolate $v$ by dividing both sides by $-16t + t$: $v = \frac{h-k}{-16t + t}$
4. Simplify the denominator: $v = \frac{h-k}{t-16}$
**Key Learnings:**
* It is important to carefully analyze the problem and identify what is being asked for.
* When solving for a variable, it is crucial to isolate that variable on one side of the equation.
* It is helpful to check the units of the answer to ensure they are consistent with the variable being solved for.
## Applying Learnings to the Current Question:
With the insights gained from my reflection, I am now confident in answering the question correctly.
