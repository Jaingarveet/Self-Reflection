## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: $$\begin{aligned}& y<-x+a \\& y>x+b\end{aligned}$$In the $x y$-plane, if $(0,0)$ is a solution to the system of inequalities above, which of the following relationships between $a$ and $b$ must be true?
Choices:
  A: $a>b$
  B: $b>a$
  C: $|a|>|b|$
  D: $a=-b$
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
If $(0,0)$ is a solution, then both inequalities must be satisfied when $x=0$ and $y=0$.
The first inequality becomes $0<-0+a$, which simplifies to $a>0$.
The second inequality becomes $0>0+b$, which simplifies to $b<0$.
Since $a$ is positive and $b$ is negative, $a$ must be greater than $b$.
