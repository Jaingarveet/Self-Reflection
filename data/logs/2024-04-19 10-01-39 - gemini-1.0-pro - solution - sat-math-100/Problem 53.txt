## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: A line in the $x y$-plane passes through the origin and has a slope of $\frac{1}{7}$. Which of the following points lies on the line?
Choices:
  A: $(0,7)$
  B: $(1,7)$
  C: $(7,7)$
  D: $(14,2)$
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
The slope of the line is $\frac{1}{7}$.
This means that for every 1 unit increase in the $x$ coordinate, the $y$ coordinate increases by $\frac{1}{7}$ units.
Starting from the origin $(0,0)$, we can move 14 units to the right to get to the point $(14,0)$.
To get to a point on the line, we need to move $\frac{1}{7}$ units up from $(14,0)$.
Therefore, the point [REDACTED] lies on the line.
