Question: At its maximum speed, a space shuttle can travel 700m high in 40 seconds. It will also take 5 seconds to pass a point. What then is the length of the space shuttle?
Choices:
  A: 50 m
  B: 75 m
  C: 100 m
  D: 125 m
  E: 150 m
## Assistant 2:
  Thought: To find the length of the space shuttle, we need to use the information given in the question.

The space shuttle can travel 700m high in 40 seconds, which means it can cover a distance of 700m x 40 = 28,000m in one minute.

Also, it will take 5 seconds to pass a point, which means it can cover a distance of 5 x 28 = 140m in one minute.

Now, we can use the formula: Distance = Speed x Time, where Speed = Distance / Time.

So, the length of the space shuttle is:
Length = Speed x Time
= 28,000 m / 60 s
= 466.67 m

Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
