Question: In 2015 the populations of City $\mathrm{X}$ and City $\mathrm{Y}$ were equal. From 2010 to 2015, the population of City X increased by $20 \%$ and the population of City $\mathrm{Y}$ decreased by $10 \%$. If the population of City $\mathrm{X}$ was 120,000 in 2010, what was the population of City Y in 2010 ?

## Assistant 2:
  Thought: Let's analyze the information given in the question.

We know that the population of City X increased by $20 \%$ from 2010 to 2015, which means the population of City X in 2015 was:

Population of City X in 2015 = 120,000 x 1.20 = 144,000

We also know that the population of City Y decreased by $10 \%$ from 2010 to 2015, which means the population of City Y in 2010 was:

Population of City Y in 2010 = 120,000 x 0.90 = 108,000

Now, we have to choose the correct answer from the options given.

Action: Answer("B")
