## Assistant 2:
  Great, let's solve this problem step by step!

If $(a x + 2)(b x + 7) = 15 x^2 + c x + 14$ for all values of $x$, and $a + b = 8$, we can start by simplifying the equation:

$$(ax + 2)(bx + 7) = 15x^2 + cx + 14$$

Now, we can see that $a x + 2$ and $b x + 7$ are both factors of the expression inside the parentheses, so we can rewrite the equation as:

$$(a x + 2)(b x + 7) = (15x^2 + cx + 14)(a x + 2)$$

Now, we can see that $a x + 2$ and $b x + 7$ are both factors of the expression inside the parentheses, so we can rewrite the equation as:

$$15x^2 + cx + 14 = (a x + 2)(b x + 7)$$

Now, we can solve for $c$ by subtracting $15x^2$ from both sides of the equation:

$$cx + 14 = (a x + 2)(b x + 7) - 15x^2$$

Now, we can simplify the equation by multiplying both sides by $a x + 2$:

$$ac = (b x + 7)(a x + 2) - 15x^2$$

Now, we can simplify the equation further by multiplying both sides by $b x + 7$:

$$ac = (b x + 7)^2 - 15x^2$$

Now, we can see that $c$ must be an integer, since the left-hand side is a perfect square. Therefore, the possible values for $c$ are:

$$c = 0, 1, 15, 35$$

So, the two possible values for $c$ are $3$ and $5$.

Therefore, the answer is (A): $c = 3$ or $c = 5$.
