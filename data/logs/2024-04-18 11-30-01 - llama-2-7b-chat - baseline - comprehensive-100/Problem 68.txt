  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: In the $x y$-plane, the line determined by the points $(2, k)$ and $(k, 32)$ passes through the origin. Which of the following could be the value of $k$ ?
Choices:
  A: 0
  B: 4
  C: 8
  D: 16
## Assistant 2:
  Thought: The line passing through the points $(2, k)$ and $(k, 32)$ in the $x y$-plane is a straight line. Since the line passes through the origin, we can write the equation of the line as $y = mx + b$, where $m = \frac{32}{2} = 16$.

Now, we need to find the value of $k$ that satisfies the equation.

Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
