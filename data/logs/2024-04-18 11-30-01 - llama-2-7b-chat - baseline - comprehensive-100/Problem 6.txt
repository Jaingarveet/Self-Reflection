## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: R, S, T, and U are points on a line, and U is the midpoint of line segment ST. If the lengths of line segments RS, RT, and ST are 5, 17, and 22, respectively. What is the length of line segment RU?
Choices:
  A: 6
  B: 7
  C: 8
  D: 9
  E: 10
## Assistant 2:
  Great, let's solve this problem step by step!

We know that U is the midpoint of line segment ST, so we can write:

U = (RS + ST) / 2

We also know that the length of line segment RS is 5, and the length of line segment ST is 22. So, we can write:

U = (5 + 22) / 2

Simplifying, we get:

U = 27 / 2

Therefore, the length of line segment RU is 13.5.

So, the correct answer is (D) 13.5.
