1. Greyhounds are featured on day 1.
2. No breed is featured on any two consecutive days.

4. Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.
5. Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.

Now, let's consider each of the possible choices:

This cannot be true because, according to the problem, Greyhounds are featured on day 1, and Siamese are not featured on day 2.

B: Greyhounds and Himalayans are both featured on day 7.

This cannot be true because, according to the problem, Greyhounds are not featured on day 7, and Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.

C: Rottweilers and Himalayans are both featured on day 4.

This cannot be true because, according to the problem, Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, and Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.

D: Rottweilers and Manx are both featured on day 5.

This cannot be true because, according to the problem, Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, and Manx are not featured on any of the days mentioned in the problem.

E: Newfoundlands and Manx are both featured on day 6.

This cannot be true because, according to the problem, Newfoundlands are not featured on any of the days mentioned in the problem.
