Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation: I chose benzoyl peroxide as it is a well-known over-the-counter treatment for mild acne. However, the correct answer is retinoids, which are a class of vitamin A derivatives that are highly effective in treating comedonal acne by normalizing skin cell turnover and reducing the formation of comedones. 

Error Keywords:
- Treatment selection error
- Acne treatment error
- Benzoyl peroxide error

Solution: Comedonal acne is a form of acne characterized by the presence of comedones (blackheads and whiteheads). Retinoids are the first-line treatment for this type of acne. While benzoyl peroxide is a valid treatment option for inflammatory acne, retinoids are preferred for comedonal acne due to their ability to normalize skin cell turnover and prevent the formation of comedones. 

Instructions: 
1. Identify the type of acne mentioned in the question (comedonal acne).
2. Recall the standard first-line treatment for this specific type of acne (retinoids). 
3. Recognize that while benzoyl peroxide is effective for inflammatory acne, it is not the primary treatment for comedonal acne. 
4. Choose the answer option that reflects the correct first-line treatment (retinoids). 

Advice: 
- Familiarize yourself with the standard first-line treatments for common dermatological conditions, such as acne. 
- Understand the mechanisms of action and specific indications for different acne treatments, including retinoids and benzoyl peroxide. 
- Consider the specific type of acne mentioned in the question and select the treatment that is most appropriate for that type. 
- Avoid jumping to conclusions based on general knowledge of acne treatments; instead, tailor your answer to the specific condition presented.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: Reflection indicates that retinoids are the first-line treatment for comedonal acne as they can normalise skin cell turnover and prevent the formation of comedones.
Action: Answer("C")
