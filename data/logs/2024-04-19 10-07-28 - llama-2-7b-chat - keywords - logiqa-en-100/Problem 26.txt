Context: The late famous logician Jin Yuelin of China heard the words "Money is like dung" and "Friends are worth a thousand dollars" when he was a child, and found that there are logical problems because they can lead to the absurd conclusion of "friends are like dung".
Question: Since the conclusion of "friends like dung" is not true, it can be logically derived?
Choices:
  A: The expression "money is like dung" is false.
  B: If a friend is indeed worth a lot of money, then money is not like dung.
  C: The statement that "friends are valuable" is true.
  D: The words "Money is like dung" and "Friends are worth a thousand dollars" are either true or false.

## Assistant 2:
  Thought: 
Jin Yuelin heard the statements "Money is like dung" and "Friends are worth a thousand dollars" as a child, and he realized that these statements can lead to a logical contradiction.
Action: Answer("C")

Self-reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly by selecting option A, which states that the expression "money is like dung" is false. However, this answer does not address the logical contradiction that arises from the combination of these two statements.

To resolve this contradiction, we need to consider the meaning of the statements "Money is like dung" and "Friends are worth a thousand dollars." If we assume that these statements are true, then we can deduce that money is not like dung, as friends are worth more than money.

Therefore, the correct answer is option C, which states that the statement "friends are valuable" is true. This answer resolves the logical contradiction and is consistent with the original statements.
