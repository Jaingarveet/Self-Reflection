Context: Zhang Shan received a higher bonus than Li Si. After learning that Wang Wu's bonus was higher than Miao Xiaoqin, Zhang Shan's bonus was also higher than Miao Xiaoqin.

Question: The following assumptions can make the above inference hold, except:

Choices:

A: Wang Wu's bonus is higher than Li Si's.

Reflection:

I previously answered this question incorrectly. My reasoning was as follows:

I assumed that if Wang Wu's bonus was higher than Miao Xiaoqin's, then Zhang Shan's bonus must be higher than Miao Xiaoqin's as well. However, this is not necessarily true.

The correct answer is (B) Li Si's bonus is higher than Miao Xiaoqin's.

Explanation:

The statement "Wang Wu's bonus was higher than Miao Xiaoqin's" provides no information about the bonuses of Li Si and Zhang Shan. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Zhang Shan's bonus is higher than Miao Xiaoqin's based on this statement alone.

The correct answer is (B) Li Si's bonus is higher than Miao Xiaoqin's, as this is the only assumption that allows us to conclude that Zhang Shan's bonus is higher than Miao Xiaoqin's.
