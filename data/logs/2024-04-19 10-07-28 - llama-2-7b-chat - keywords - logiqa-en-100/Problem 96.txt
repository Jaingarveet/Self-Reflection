Most people think that advertisers do whatever they can to attract customers.But advertisers are not always like this.Recently, in order to expand sales, a family magazine called "Bay" was renamed "Inferno", which mainly published violent and pornographic content.As a result, some perennial advertisers from the original "Bay" magazine refused to renew the contract and turned to other publications.This shows that these advertisers not only consider economic benefits, but also take into account their ethical responsibilities.
Question: If the following item is true, can the argument be strengthened most?
Choices:
  A: The cost and selling price of "Inferno" are lower than that of "Harbour".

## Assistant 2:
  Thought: Upon further reflection, I realize that the key to strengthening the argument is to provide evidence that the advertisers' ethical considerations go beyond mere economic benefits.

Action: Answer("C")

Explanation: The statement "advertisers are not always like this" implies that there are instances where advertisers prioritize ethical considerations over economic benefits. The example of the family magazine "Bay" being renamed "Inferno" and featuring violent and pornographic content, and the subsequent decision of some advertisers to refuse renewal of their contracts, provides evidence that advertisers are willing to take ethical stances even if it means sacrificing some economic benefits. This strengthens the argument that advertisers are not always driven solely by economic considerations.
