Context: A survey of traffic accidents has found that the incidence of traffic accidents is actually similar in cities where drunk driving is strictly investigated and those who do not.However, most experts believe that strict investigation of drunk driving can indeed reduce the occurrence of traffic accidents.
Question: Which of the following is most helpful in eliminating this inconsistency?
Choices:
  A: Severe investigations of drunk driving have occurred in urban traffic accidents.
  B: The city that implements strict investigation of drunk driving has not eliminated drunk driving.
  C: It is more important to improve drivers' traffic safety awareness than strict management.
  D: In addition to strict investigation of drunk driving, other traffic violations should also be stopped.

## Assistant 2:
  Thought: I previously answered this question incorrectly, and upon reflection, I realized that I overlooked an important factor. The inconsistency between the survey findings and the experts' beliefs can be explained by the fact that the city that implements strict investigation of drunk driving may have a different population of drivers than the cities where drunk driving is not strictly investigated. Therefore, the incidence of traffic accidents may be similar in both groups, despite the difference in drunk driving enforcement.

Action: Answer("C") - It is more important to improve drivers' traffic safety awareness than strict management. The survey findings suggest that the incidence of traffic accidents is similar in both groups, which implies that the difference in drunk driving enforcement may not be the sole factor contributing to the reduction in accidents. Therefore, it is more important to focus on improving drivers' safety awareness, rather than solely relying on strict investigation of drunk driving.
