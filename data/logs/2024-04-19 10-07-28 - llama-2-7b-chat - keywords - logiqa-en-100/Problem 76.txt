  Topic: Logic
Question: Which of the following reasoning clearly shows that the above argument is not valid?

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and after reflecting on my solution and the correct answer, I realized that I made a mistake. Here is my self-reflection:

I mistakenly chose option A, which is not a valid argument to refute the given argument. The argument being made is that all people under the jurisdiction of the People's Republic of China are Chinese, and Taiwanese are not under the jurisdiction of the People's Republic of China, therefore Taiwanese are not Chinese.

To refute this argument, we need to provide a logical reasoning that shows that the premise is false or that the conclusion does not follow from the premise.

Option B is not a valid argument, as it does not address the premise of the argument being made.

Option C is also not a valid argument, as it does not provide any logical reasoning to refute the argument.

Option D is a valid argument, as it provides a logical reasoning to refute the argument being made. By pointing out that not all criminal behaviors are illegal behaviors, and that violations should not be condemned by society, we can show that the argument being made is false.

Therefore, the correct answer is option D.

Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
