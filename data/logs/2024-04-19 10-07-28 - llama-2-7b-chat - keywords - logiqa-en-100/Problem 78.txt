I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I realize now that I miscounted the number of guests Mr.Chen invited.

Mr.Chen invited his father's brother-in-law, his brother-in-law's father, his brother's mother-in-law, and his brother-in-law's brother.

* His father's brother-in-law = 1 guest
* His brother-in-law's father = 1 guest
