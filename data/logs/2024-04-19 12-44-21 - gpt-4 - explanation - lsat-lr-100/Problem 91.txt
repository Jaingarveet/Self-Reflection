## User 2:
Topic: Law
Context: People who are allergic to cats are actually allergic to certain proteins found in the animals' skin secretions and saliva; which particular proteins are responsible, however, varies from allergy sufferer to allergy sufferer. Since all cats shed skin and spread saliva around their environment, there is no such thing as a cat incapable of provoking allergic reactions, although it is common for a given cat to cause an allergic reaction in some-but not all-people who are allergic to cats.
Question: Which one of the following statements is most strongly supported by the information above?
Choices:
  A: Any particular individual will be allergic to some breeds of cat but not to others.
  B: No cat is capable of causing an allergic reaction in all types of allergy sufferers.
  C: Not all cats are identical with respect to the proteins contained in their skin secretions and saliva.
  D: The allergic reactions of some people who are allergic to cats are more intense than the allergic reactions of other allergy sufferers.
  E: There is no way to predict whether a given cat will produce an allergic reaction in a particular allergy sufferer.
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misinterpreted the information provided in the passage. I focused on the variability of allergic reactions among individuals, rather than considering the variability of proteins among cats.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The passage states that the proteins responsible for allergies vary from person to person, and all cats shed skin and spread saliva, which can provoke allergic reactions. However, it does not specify that the proteins in different cats' skin secretions and saliva are identical or different. Therefore, the statement that is most strongly supported by the information is that no cat is capable of causing an allergic reaction in all types of allergy sufferers, as the proteins causing the allergy vary from person to person.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
