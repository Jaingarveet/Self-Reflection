# Model: gpt-4 | Agent: explanation | Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Problem 94 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Law.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")

Topic: Law
Context: Most auto mechanics have extensive experience. Furthermore, most mechanics with extensive experience understand electronic circuits. Thus, most auto mechanics understand electronic circuits.
Question: The pattern of flawed reasoning in which one of the following arguments is most similar to that in the argument above?
Choices:
  A: During times of the year when automobile traffic increases, gas prices also increase. Increases in gas prices lead to increases in consumer complaints. Thus, increased automobile traffic causes increased consumer complaints.
  B: The most common species of birds in this region are migratory. Moreover, most migratory birds have left this region by the end of November. Hence, few birds remain in this region during the winter.
  C: It is not surprising that most speeding tickets in this region are issued to drivers of sports cars. After all, most drivers who are not interested in driving fast do not buy sports cars.
  D: Most nature photographers find portrait photography boring. Moreover, most portrait photographers especially enjoy photographing dignitaries. Thus, most nature photographers find photographing dignitaries especially boring.
  E: Most snow-removal companies run lawn-care services during the summer. Also, most companies that run lawn-care services during the summer hire additional workers in the summer. Thus, most snow-removal companies hire additional workers in the summer.

Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misunderstood the flawed reasoning in the original argument. The flaw lies in the assumption that two overlapping groups (auto mechanics with extensive experience and mechanics who understand electronic circuits) represent the majority of all auto mechanics. I incorrectly identified the flaw as not accounting for other possible causes, which led me to choose the wrong answer.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The flawed reasoning in the original argument is that it assumes that because most auto mechanics have extensive experience and most mechanics with extensive experience understand electronic circuits, then most auto mechanics understand electronic circuits. This is a flawed assumption because the two groups (auto mechanics with extensive experience and mechanics who understand electronic circuits) might not represent the majority of all auto mechanics. 
The argument that most closely follows this flawed reasoning is choice A. It assumes that because automobile traffic increases lead to gas price increases and gas price increases lead to consumer complaints, then automobile traffic increases cause consumer complaints. This is a flawed assumption because the two groups (times when automobile traffic increases and times when gas prices increase) might not represent all times when consumer complaints increase.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: E
