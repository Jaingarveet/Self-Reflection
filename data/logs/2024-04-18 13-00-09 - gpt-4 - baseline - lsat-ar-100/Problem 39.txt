## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The organizer has already selected three French novels. According to the requirements, no more than four French works can be selected, at least three but no more than four novels can be selected, and at least as many French novels as Russian novels must be selected. If both French plays are selected, then the Russian play is not selected.
Let's analyze the options:
A: one Russian novel - This would make a total of four novels, which is within the limit. It also maintains the balance between French and Russian novels. This is a possible option.
B: two French plays - This would make a total of five French works, which exceeds the limit. This option is not possible.
C: one Russian novel, one Russian play - This would make a total of four novels, which is within the limit. It also maintains the balance between French and Russian novels. However, it adds a Russian play, which is not restricted. This is a possible option.
D: one Russian novel, two French plays - This would make a total of four novels, which is within the limit. It also maintains the balance between French and Russian novels. However, it adds two French plays, which would make a total of five French works, exceeding the limit. This option is not possible.
E: two Russian novels, one French play - This would make a total of five novels, which exceeds the limit. This option is not possible.
