Context: On each of exactly seven consecutive days (day 1 though day 7), a pet shop features exactly one of three breeds of kitten—Himalayan, Manx, Siamese—and exactly one of three breeds of puppy—Greyhound, Newfoundland, Rottweiler. The following conditions must apply: Greyhounds are featured on day 1. No breed is featured on any two consecutive days. Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7. Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1. Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.
Question: If Himalayans are not featured on day 7, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Greyhounds are featured on days 3 and 5.
  B: Newfoundlands are featured on day 3.
  C: Rottweilers are featured on day 6.
  D: Rottweilers are featured only on day 3.
  E: Rottweilers are featured on exactly three days.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Given the conditions, Greyhounds cannot be featured on days 3 and 5 because no breed is featured on any two consecutive days. So, option A is incorrect. 
Newfoundlands can be featured on day 3, as there is no restriction on them. So, option B could be true. 
Rottweilers cannot be featured on day 6 because they cannot be featured on any day that features Himalayans, and since Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, they could be featured on day 6. So, option C is incorrect. 
Rottweilers cannot be featured only on day 3 because they are also featured on day 1. So, option D is incorrect. 
There is no restriction on the number of days Rottweilers can be featured, so option E could be true. However, since we have already found a possible true statement (option B), we do not need to consider option E. 
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
