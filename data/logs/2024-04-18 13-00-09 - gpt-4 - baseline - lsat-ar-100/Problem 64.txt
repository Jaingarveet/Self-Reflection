Topic: Law
Context: A software company employs exactly seven sales representatives—Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall—to work in its three sales zones—Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3. Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Question: If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Kim works in Zone 2.
  B: Mahr works in Zone 1.
  C: Parra works in Zone 3.
  D: Stuckey works in Zone 2.
  E: Tiao works in Zone 1.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Given that Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, and Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone, it means that Mahr, Stuckey, and Udall all work in the same zone. Since there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, these three must work in Zone 3. 
Since either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2, and we know Udall is in Zone 3, Tiao must work in Zone 2. 
Since either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, and we know Tiao is in Zone 2, Parra must work in Zone 1. 
Since Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone, Quinn must also work in Zone 1. 
This leaves only Kim and Zone 2, so Kim must work in Zone 2.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
