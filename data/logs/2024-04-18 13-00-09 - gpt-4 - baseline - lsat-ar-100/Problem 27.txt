Topic: Law
Context: For the school paper, five students—Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, Megregian, and O'Neill—each review one or more of exactly three plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation, but do not review any other plays. The following conditions must apply: Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
Question: Which one of the following could be an accurate and complete list of the students who review Tamerlane?
Choices:
  A: Jiang, Kramer
  B: Kramer, O'Neill
  C: Kramer, Lopez, O'Neill
  D: Kramer, Megregian, O'Neill
  E: Lopez, Megregian, O'Neill
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
From the conditions, we know that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Therefore, any option that does not include both Kramer and O'Neill is incorrect. This eliminates option A. 
We also know that neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Since Jiang is not mentioned as reviewing Tamerlane, this does not eliminate any options. 
However, we know that Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. This means that Megregian cannot review Tamerlane, as that would mean she reviews the same number of plays as Kramer and O'Neill. This eliminates options D and E. 
Therefore, the only remaining options are B and C. Since exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other, and we know that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, this means that no other student can review Tamerlane. This eliminates option C. 
Therefore, the only remaining option is B. 
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
