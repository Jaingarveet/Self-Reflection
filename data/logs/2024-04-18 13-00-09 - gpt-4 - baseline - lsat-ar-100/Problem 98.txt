Context: A realtor will show a prospective buyer seven houses—J, K, L, M, N, 0, and P—during a single day. The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning; the third, fourth, and fifth houses to be shown will be shown in the afternoon; the sixth and seventh houses to be shown will be shown in the evening. The houses will be shown according to the following rules: J must be shown in the evening. K cannot be shown in the morning. L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
Question: Which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: K is shown at some time after J is shown.
  B: L is shown at some time after J is shown.
  C: P is shown at some time after J is shown.
  D: Both N and O are shown at some time after M is
  E: Both N and P are shown at some time after K is
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
J must be shown in the evening, which means it can only be the 6th or 7th house shown. 
K cannot be shown in the morning, so it can be shown in the afternoon or evening, but it must be shown before L and L must be shown before M. 
So, K cannot be the last house shown, and neither can L. 
M can be shown last, but if it is, then N and O cannot be shown after it, ruling out option D. 
Similarly, if K is shown first in the afternoon, then N and P cannot be shown after it, ruling out option E. 
J being shown in the evening means it is either the 6th or 7th house shown, so P could potentially be shown after J if it is the 7th house shown, making option C a possibility. 
Options A and B cannot be true because K and L must be shown before J.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
