Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Law
Context: Exactly five witnesses—Franco, Garcia, Hong, Iturbe, and Jackson—are to be scheduled to testify at a hearing that is to take exactly three days of one week—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Each witness testifies on exactly one day of the hearing. The schedule must meet the following conditions: Franco does not testify on the same day that Garcia testifies. Iturbe testifies on Wednesday. Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday. Hong does not testify on Monday. At least one witness testifies on Monday.
Question: Which one of the following CANNOT be true of the schedule?
Choices:
  A: Franco is the only witness scheduled to testify on Monday.
  B: Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Iturbe.
  C: Garcia and Hong are both scheduled to testify on Tuesday.
  D: Garcia is the only witness scheduled to testify on Monday and Hong is one of two witnesses scheduled to testify on Wednesday.
  E: Jackson is scheduled to testify on Tuesday and two witnesses are scheduled to testify on Monday.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The conditions state that Franco does not testify on the same day as Garcia, Iturbe testifies on Wednesday, exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday, Hong does not testify on Monday, and at least one witness testifies on Monday. 
Given these conditions, let's evaluate each choice:
A: Franco is the only witness scheduled to testify on Monday. This can be true as it doesn't violate any conditions.
B: Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Iturbe. This can be true as Franco can testify on Wednesday with Iturbe.
C: Garcia and Hong are both scheduled to testify on Tuesday. This can be true as two witnesses are allowed to testify on Tuesday.
D: Garcia is the only witness scheduled to testify on Monday and Hong is one of two witnesses scheduled to testify on Wednesday. This can be true as it doesn't violate any conditions.
E: Jackson is scheduled to testify on Tuesday and two witnesses are scheduled to testify on Monday. This cannot be true because if two witnesses testify on Monday and two on Tuesday, then only one can testify on Wednesday. But we know that Iturbe testifies on Wednesday and at least one other witness (Franco or Garcia) must also testify on Wednesday because they can't testify on the same day. So, this would mean more than five witnesses in total, which is not possible.
Action: Answer("E")
## Result:
Agent Answer: E
Correct Answer: E
Score: 1
