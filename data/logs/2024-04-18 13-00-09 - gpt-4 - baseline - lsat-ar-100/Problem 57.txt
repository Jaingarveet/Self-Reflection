Topic: Law
Context: Of the eight students—George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert—in a seminar, exactly six will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
Question: Which one of the following is a pair of students who, if they give reports on the same day as each other, must give reports on Wednesday?
Choices:
  A: George and Lenore
  B: Helen and Nina
  C: Irving and Robert
  D: Kyle and Nina
  E: Olivia and Kyle
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
From the conditions, we know that George can only give a report on Tuesday. This means that George cannot give a report on the same day as any other student on Wednesday. So, option A is not possible. 
Nina's report triggers Helen and Irving to give reports on the next day. If Nina and Helen give reports on the same day, it cannot be Wednesday because then Helen and Irving would not be able to give reports on the next day (Thursday is not an option). So, option B is the correct answer.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
