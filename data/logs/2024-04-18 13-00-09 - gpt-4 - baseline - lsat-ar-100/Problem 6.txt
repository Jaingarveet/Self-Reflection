Context: For the school paper, five students—Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, Megregian, and O'Neill—each review one or more of exactly three plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation, but do not review any other plays. The following conditions must apply: Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
Question: Which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Jiang reviews more of the plays than Lopez does.
  B: Megregian reviews more of the plays than Jiang does.
  C: Megregian reviews more of the plays than O'Neill does.
  D: O'Neill reviews more of the plays than Jiang does.
  E: O'Neill reviews more of the plays than Kramer does.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
From the conditions, we know that Megregian reviews more plays than Kramer and Lopez. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. This means Jiang must review a different play, and since Megregian reviews more plays, it's possible that Megregian reviews more plays than Jiang. 
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
