Context: A bakery makes exactly three kinds of cookieâ€”oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar. Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day. The following conditions apply: No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
Question: If the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday, then each of the following could be true EXCEPT:
Choices:
  A: Two different kinds of cookie have their first batch made on Monday.
  B: Two different kinds of cookie have their first batch made on Tuesday.
  C: Two different kinds of cookie have their second batch made on Wednesday.
  D: Two different kinds of cookie have their second batch made on Thursday.
  E: Two different kinds of cookie have their third batch made on Friday.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday. According to the conditions, the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. So, the second batch of oatmeal cookies is also made on Tuesday. This means that the first batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Monday. 
The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday. This means that the first batch of sugar cookies must be made on either Monday or Tuesday. 
Given these conditions, it is not possible for two different kinds of cookies to have their first batch made on Tuesday (Choice B) because the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Monday and the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday. The first batch of sugar cookies cannot be made on Tuesday because that would mean the second batch of sugar cookies would have to be made on Wednesday, which contradicts the condition that the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
Action: Answer("B")
