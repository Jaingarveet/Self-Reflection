Context: On each of exactly seven consecutive days (day 1 though day 7), a pet shop features exactly one of three breeds of kitten—Himalayan, Manx, Siamese—and exactly one of three breeds of puppy—Greyhound, Newfoundland, Rottweiler. The following conditions must apply: Greyhounds are featured on day 1. No breed is featured on any two consecutive days. Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7. Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1. Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.
Question: Which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Greyhounds and Siamese are both featured on day 2.
  B: Greyhounds and Himalayans are both featured on day 7.
  C: Rottweilers and Himalayans are both featured on day 4.
  D: Rottweilers and Manx are both featured on day 5.
  E: Newfoundlands and Manx are both featured on day 6.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The conditions state that no breed is featured on any two consecutive days, so Greyhounds cannot be featured on day 2 (eliminating choice A). 
Himalayans cannot be featured on day 7 (eliminating choice B). 
Rottweilers cannot be featured on any day that features Himalayans (eliminating choice C). 
Rottweilers cannot be featured on day 7, but the question does not specify that they cannot be featured on day 5 (leaving choice D as a possibility). 
The conditions do not specify any restrictions for Newfoundlands and Manx on day 6, but since we already have a possible answer, we don't need to consider choice E. 
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
