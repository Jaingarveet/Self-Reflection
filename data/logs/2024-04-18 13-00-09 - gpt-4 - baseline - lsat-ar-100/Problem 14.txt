Context: At a concert, exactly eight compositions—F, H, L, O, P, R, S, and T—are to be performed exactly once each, consecutively and one composition at a time. The order of their performance must satisfy the following conditions: T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R. At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F. O is performed either first or fifth. The eighth composition performed is either L or H. P is performed at some time before S. At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
Question: If T is performed fifth and F is performed sixth, then S must be performed either
Choices:
  A: fourth or seventh
  B: third or sixth
  C: third or fourth
  D: second or seventh
  E: first or fourth
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Given that T is performed fifth and F is performed sixth, it means that T is performed immediately before F. This satisfies the first condition. 
Since T is performed fifth and F is performed sixth, there are four compositions before T and F, and two compositions after them. This satisfies the second condition. 
O cannot be performed fifth because T is performed fifth, so O must be performed first. This satisfies the third condition. 
The eighth composition can be either L or H, this doesn't affect S's position. 
P is performed at some time before S, so S cannot be performed first, second, third, or fourth because P must be performed before it and O is already performed first. 
At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O. Since O is performed first, there must be at least one composition performed after O and before S. So, S cannot be performed second. 
Therefore, S must be performed either seventh or eighth. But since the eighth composition is either L or H, S must be performed seventh. 
Action: Answer("D")
