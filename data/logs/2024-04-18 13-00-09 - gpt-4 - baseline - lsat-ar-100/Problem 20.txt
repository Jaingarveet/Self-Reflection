Context: Of the eight students—George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert—in a seminar, exactly six will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
Question: If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, could be given by
Choices:
  A: Helen, George, and Nina
  B: Irving, Robert, and Helen
  C: Nina, Helen, and Olivia
  D: Olivia, Robert, and Irving
  E: Robert, George, and Helen
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Given the conditions, we know that:
1. George can only give a report on Tuesday.
2. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report, so they can only report in the morning.
3. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, could be given by:
A: Helen, George, and Nina - This is not possible because if Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports. But Helen has already given a report on Monday.
B: Irving, Robert, and Helen - This is not possible because Robert cannot give a report in the afternoon.
C: Nina, Helen, and Olivia - This is possible. Nina gives a report on Monday, Helen and Irving give reports on Tuesday (Helen in the morning and Irving in the afternoon), and Olivia gives a report on Wednesday morning.
D: Olivia, Robert, and Irving - This is not possible because Robert cannot give a report in the afternoon.
E: Robert, George, and Helen - This is not possible because Robert cannot give a report in the afternoon.
