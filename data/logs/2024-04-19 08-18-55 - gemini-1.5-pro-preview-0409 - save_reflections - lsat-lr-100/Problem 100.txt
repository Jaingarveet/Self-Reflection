## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:** I focused too narrowly on finding an option that directly compared the harm of theft and bribery, overlooking the broader context of proportionality in sentencing.
**Error Keywords:**
*   Narrow focus
*   Misinterpretation of argument
*   Overlooking context
## Step-by-Step Solution
1.  **Understand the Argument:** The argument claims that identical penalties for theft and bribery suggest lawmakers view their harms as equal.
2.  **Analyze Options:**
    *   **A:** This option strengthens the argument by establishing a general principle of proportionality in sentencing, which supports the idea that equal penalties imply equal harm.
    *   **B, C, D, E:** These options are irrelevant or don't directly support the argument's claim about the equivalence of harm based on equal penalties.
## Instructions for Future Similar Problems
1.  **Identify the Conclusion:** Clearly understand the main point the argument is trying to make.
2.  **Analyze the Reasoning:** Examine how the evidence supports the conclusion.
3.  **Consider the Context:** Think about the broader principles or assumptions underlying the argument.
4.  **Evaluate Options Holistically:** Look for options that strengthen the reasoning or provide additional support for the conclusion, considering the context.
5.  **Avoid Narrow Focus:** Don't get fixated on finding options that directly mirror the conclusion; consider options that support the underlying logic.
## General Advice
*   **Read Carefully:** Pay close attention to the nuances of the argument and the answer choices.
*   **Think Critically:** Analyze the reasoning and evidence, and consider alternative perspectives.
*   **Consider the Bigger Picture:** Understand the context and underlying assumptions of the argument.
*   **Practice:** Regularly engage with similar problems to improve your analytical skills.
