## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:** I incorrectly focused on the change in commute time rather than the reason why employees would choose a longer commute. The key was to identify the assumption that would force employees to accept the longer commute despite the affordability issue.
**Error Keywords:**
*   Misinterpretation of argument
*   Focus on the wrong aspect of the argument 
*   Ignoring the role of assumptions in logical reasoning
## Solving the Problem
1. **Identify the Conclusion:** Most Acme employees will have a longer commute after the move.
2. **Identify the Evidence:** Most Acme employees cannot afford housing near Ocean View.
3. **Identify the Gap:** What would make employees accept a longer commute despite the cost?
4. **Analyze the answer choices:**
    *   A and C are irrelevant to the affordability issue.
    *   B focuses on the chairperson's motives, not the employees' situation.
    *   D is the trap I fell into, focusing on the current commute time.
    *   **E provides the missing link:** If there's no significant pay raise, employees might have to accept the longer commute due to financial constraints.
## Instructions for Future Problems
1. **Identify the conclusion and evidence in the argument.**
2. **Pinpoint the gap between the evidence and conclusion.**
3. **Analyze each answer choice to see which one bridges the gap and is essential for the argument to hold.**
4. **Be wary of answer choices that seem related but focus on the wrong aspect or entity in the argument.**
## General Advice
*   **Pay close attention to the role of assumptions in logical reasoning.** 
*   **Consider all factors influencing the decision or outcome mentioned in the argument.**
*   **Don't get sidetracked by information that is not directly relevant to the core of the argument.**
*   **Practice identifying assumptions in various logical reasoning scenarios.**
