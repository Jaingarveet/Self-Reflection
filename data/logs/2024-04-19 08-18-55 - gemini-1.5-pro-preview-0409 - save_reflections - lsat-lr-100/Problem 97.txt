## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:** I incorrectly categorized the statement about cell phone use being more upsetting on airplanes as a premise indirectly supporting the main conclusion. I failed to recognize its direct role in supporting the main conclusion and its own status as a sub-conclusion with supporting premises.
**Error Keywords:**
*   Logical reasoning error
*   Argument structure misinterpretation
*   Premise/conclusion misidentification
**Step-by-Step Solution:**
1.  **Identify the main conclusion:** The editorial argues that proposals to allow cell phone use on airplanes are ill-advised.
2.  **Analyze the statement's role:** The statement claims cell phone use would be more upsetting on airplanes than on buses or trains. This directly supports the idea that allowing cell phones on airplanes is a bad idea (the main conclusion).
3.  **Identify support for the statement:** The editorial provides reasons why cell phone use would be more upsetting on airplanes: passengers are packed tightly and have limited ability to move away from disruptive seatmates.
4.  **Determine the statement's function:** The statement acts as a sub-conclusion, supported by the reasons mentioned above, and in turn, directly supports the main conclusion.
**Instructions for Future Problem Solving:**
1.  **Identify the main conclusion of the argument.**
2.  **Analyze each statement's relationship to the main conclusion.**
3.  **Look for supporting evidence or reasons provided for each statement.**
4.  **Distinguish between premises (supporting statements) and conclusions (statements being supported).**
5.  **Pay attention to the hierarchical structure of arguments, including sub-conclusions.**
**General Advice for Similar Problems:**
*   **Practice identifying argument structures in various texts.**
*   **Focus on the logical flow of reasoning and how statements connect.**
*   **Be mindful of different types of support (direct/indirect, premise/sub-conclusion).**
*   **Consider the author's purpose and intended audience.** 
*   **Review basic logical fallacies to avoid misinterpreting arguments.**
