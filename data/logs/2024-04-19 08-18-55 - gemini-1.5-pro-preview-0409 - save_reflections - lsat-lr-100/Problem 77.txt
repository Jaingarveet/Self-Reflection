## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:** I focused on the supporting example of irrationality rather than the counselor's main point about the inevitability of personal conflicts. I failed to grasp the broader context and the counselor's core argument.
**Error Keywords:**
*   Misinterpretation of argument
*   Focus on supporting detail
*   Ignoring main conclusion
*   Lack of contextual understanding
**Step-by-Step Solution:**
1.  **Identify the topic:** The counselor discusses personal conflicts.
2.  **Identify the counselor's position:** They argue against the assumption that personal conflicts are inevitable.
3.  **Analyze the reasoning:** The counselor claims irrationality leads to conflicts, but the main point is that conflicts are not unavoidable.
4.  **Evaluate answer choices:** 
    *   A and E are premises, not conclusions.
    *   B and C are examples of irrationality, not the main conclusion.
    *   **D directly reflects the counselor's argument against the inevitability of conflicts.**
**Instructions for Future:**
1.  **Identify the main topic and scope of the argument.**
2.  **Distinguish between premises, supporting examples, and the main conclusion.**
3.  **Focus on the overall claim rather than specific details.**
4.  **Ensure the chosen answer directly addresses the main point of the argument.**
**General Advice:**
*   **Read the entire passage carefully before analyzing answer choices.**
*   **Pay attention to transition words and phrases that indicate conclusions (e.g., therefore, thus, hence).**
*   **Consider the author's purpose and intended audience.**
*   **Practice identifying conclusions in various argumentative texts.**
