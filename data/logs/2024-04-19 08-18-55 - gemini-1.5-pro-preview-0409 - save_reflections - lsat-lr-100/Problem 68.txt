## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:**
My reasoning was flawed because I focused on the concentration of cocker spaniels within Flynn Heights compared to other breeds, but the key issue is whether the registration data accurately reflects the actual dog population.  The argument's validity hinges on the assumption that most dogs in Flynn Heights are licensed, which option E directly addresses.
**Error Keywords:**
*   Misinterpretation of argument
*   Focus on irrelevant information
*   Neglecting key assumption
## Step-by-Step Solution
1.  **Identify the Conclusion:** The argument concludes that a stray cocker spaniel found near Flynn Heights likely belongs to someone in that neighborhood.
2.  **Identify the Evidence:** The evidence is that more cocker spaniels are registered in Flynn Heights than in all other neighborhoods combined.
3.  **Identify the Assumption:** The argument assumes that the registration data accurately reflects the actual dog population in Flynn Heights.
4.  **Evaluate Answer Choices:** We need information that assesses the validity of the assumption. Option E directly addresses this by questioning the licensing rate in Flynn Heights compared to other neighborhoods.
## Instructions for Future Similar Problems
1.  **Identify the conclusion and evidence of the argument.**
2.  **Pinpoint the underlying assumptions connecting the evidence to the conclusion.**
3.  **Analyze each answer choice to see which one directly addresses the validity of the assumptions or provides alternative explanations for the conclusion.**
4.  **Prioritize information that strengthens or weakens the argument's core logic.**
## General Advice
*   **Focus on the structure of the argument and the logical connections between evidence and conclusion.**
*   **Identify any unstated assumptions that the argument relies upon.**
*   **Consider alternative explanations or counterexamples that could weaken the argument.**
*   **Be wary of focusing solely on the content of the argument and neglecting the underlying reasoning.**
