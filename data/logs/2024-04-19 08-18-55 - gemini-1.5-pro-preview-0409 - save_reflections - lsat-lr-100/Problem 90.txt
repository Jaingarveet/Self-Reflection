## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:** I focused on the presence of lithium as the defining characteristic and overlooked the distinction between stars and brown dwarfs based on the functionality of their nuclear furnaces. This led me to misinterpret the relationship between lithium presence and object type.
**Error Keywords:**
*   Misinterpretation 
*   Overlooking key information
*   Focusing on a single characteristic
## Step-by-Step Solution
1.  **Identify key information:** Brown dwarfs have lithium and lack fully functional nuclear furnaces. Stars with less mass than the sun have no lithium due to complete mixing in their nuclear furnaces.
2.  **Analyze options based on key information:**
    *   Option A is incorrect because brown dwarfs also lack lithium.
    *   Option B is incorrect because it refers to incomplete mixing, which is specific to certain stars, not all objects with lithium.
    *   **Option C is correct** because brown dwarfs, by definition, have lithium and are not stars.
    *   Option D is incorrect because some stars with lithium can have less mass than the sun.
    *   Option E is incorrect because brown dwarfs themselves have less mass than some stars and possess lithium.
