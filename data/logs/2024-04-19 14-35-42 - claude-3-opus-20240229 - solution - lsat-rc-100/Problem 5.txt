Topic: Law
Context: During Dostoyevsky's time there were two significant and opposing directions in Russian literary criticism. One position maintained that art stood high above the present and the everyday, while the radical view maintained that art had a right to exist only if it found its sources in concrete reality, and, through the exposure of want and injustice, it contributed to the creation of a new society; literature, in other words, should be useful. Dostoyevsky took a third position. As a realist, he never doubted that reality was literature's crucial source. But his understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics, since for Dostoyevsky there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality, and reality was far more than the merely tangible. The radical critics' demand that reality be depicted "as it is" was meaningless for Dostoyevsky; reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it: what may not be reality for you may be reality for me. The task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world. Within perceptible "reality" exists another sphere, the fantastic, which is not in any way superfluous to a writer's concerns: "The fantastic must be so intimately bound up with the real that one almost believes in it." The radical critics' insistence that art must serve a particular political view was for Dostoyevsky the equivalent of assigning to art "a shameful destiny." A literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit," he explained. The utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck Dostoyevsky as a contradiction in terms. Only fully realized artistic works could fulfill their goals. But what does it mean to say that a work is "artistic" ? Dostoyevsky defined it thus: "To say that a novelist is 'artistic'means that he possesses a talent to express his thoughts in characters and images so that when the reader has finished the novel, he has fully understood the author's thoughts. Therefore, artistry is quite simply the ability to write well." The radical critics' requirement that art must at all costs be "useful" to people and society seemed to Dostoyevsky unsatisfactory. How can we know what will show itself to be useful? Can we say with assurance how useful the Iliad has been to humankind? No, Dostoyevsky believed, when it comes to this we encounter breadths that cannot be measured with any precision; sometimes a work of art may appear to deviate from reality and serve no useful purpose because we cannot see clearly what paths it may take to become useful.

Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
1. The passage introduces two opposing positions in Russian literary criticism:
   a) Art should stand above everyday reality (not elaborated in detail)
   b) Art should be grounded in concrete reality and be useful to society (radical view)
2. Dostoyevsky's third position is then introduced and elaborated in detail:
   - Reality was literature's crucial source, but his understanding of reality was deeper
   - No distinction between fantasy and reality; reality shaped by the experiencer
   - Writer's task is to explode boundaries of the so-called real world
   - Art should be judged on "artistic merit", not political utility
   - Artistic merit means expressing thoughts well in characters and images
   - Usefulness of art can't always be precisely measured
3. Dostoyevsky's position is differentiated in detail primarily from the second, radical position. The first position is not significantly elaborated on.
Therefore, the passage presents three positions, and the third (Dostoyevsky's) is differentiated from the second radical position in detail.
## Assistant 2:
You're right, upon further reflection, the passage does present three positions on the role of art and literature, but focuses primarily on differentiating Dostoyevsky's third view from the second, more radical view. The first view that art should be above everyday reality is mentioned but not elaborated on in detail.
Dostoyevsky's perspective is explained at length - that reality is literature's source but reality is more than the tangible, that art should be judged on artistic merit rather than political utility, and that art's usefulness can't always be precisely measured. This is contrasted point-by-point with the radical view that art must depict concrete reality "as it is" and serve a clear sociopolitical purpose to be valuable.
So in summary, while three positions are introduced, the passage focuses on fleshing out Dostoyevsky's view and specifically differentiating it from the second radical perspective. The first view is more of a brief setup and not dwelled upon.
