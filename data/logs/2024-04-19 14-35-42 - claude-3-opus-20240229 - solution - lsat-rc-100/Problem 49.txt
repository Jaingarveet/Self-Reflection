Context: Mexican Americans share with speakers of Spanish throughout the world a rich and varied repertoire of proverbs as well as a vital tradition of proverb use. The term "proverb" refers to a self-contained saying that can be understood independent of a specific verbal context and that has as its main purpose the carrying of a message or piece of wisdom. The great majority of Spanish-language proverbs reached Mexico from peninsular Spain, though they did not all originate there. Many belong, in fact, to the common proverb tradition of Europe and have exact equivalents in English-language proverbial speech. Each use of a proverb is an individual act whose meaning varies depending on the individual speaker and the particular social context in which the use occurs. Nonetheless, it is important to recognize that proverb use is also shaped by the larger community with which the individual interacts. The fact that proverbs often serve a didactic purpose points us to one important function that proverbs serve in Mexican American communities: the instruction of the young. In fact, this function seems to be much more prominent in Mexican tradition in general than in English-speaking traditions. Adolescents of Mexican descent in the United States consistently report the frequent use of proverbs by their parents as a teaching tool, in areas ranging from the inculcation of table manners to the regulation of peer-group relationships. The latter area is a particularly frequent focus of proverb use within Mexican American communities: one of the most frequently used proverbs, for example, translates roughly as, "Tell me who you run with and I'll tell you who you are." Perhaps this emphasis on peer-group relations derives from a sense that traditional, community-approved norms are threatened by those prevalent in the surrounding society, or from a sense that, in dealing with older children especially, parents need to appeal to traditional wisdom to bolster their authority. Another dimension of proverb use within Mexican American communities is that proverbs often serve to foster a consciousness of ethnicity, that is, of membership in a particular ethnic group possessing features that distinguish it from other groups within a multiethnic environment. Even those Mexican American proverbs that do not have an explicitly didactic purpose nevertheless serve as a vehicle for the transmission of both the Spanish language and Mexican culture. It is in these sayings that links to folklore and other aspects of Mexican culture are established and maintained. Proverbs thus provide a means of enhancing Mexican American young people's familiarity with their heritage, thereby strengthening their ties to Mexican tradition.
Question: Which one of the following is most strongly implied by the passage?
Choices:
  A: If a proverb is used to inculcate table manners, then its primary purpose is to maintain ties to an ethnic tradition.
  B: The frequent use of proverbs within any community functions, at least in part, to convey a sense of their ethnicity to children within that community.
  C: The ways in which Mexican Americans use Spanish-language proverbs are typical of the ways in which Spanish speakers throughout the world use those proverbs.
  D: There are some sayings that do not require a verbal context to be understood but whose meaning for each particular use depends on the social context in which that use occurs.
  E: The emphasis within Mexican American communities on teaching children about peer-group relationships distinguishes those communities from other communities within the United States.

Solution:
The passage states: "The term 'proverb' refers to a self-contained saying that can be understood independent of a specific verbal context and that has as its main purpose the carrying of a message or piece of wisdom." It then goes on to say: "Each use of a proverb is an individual act whose meaning varies depending on the individual speaker and the particular social context in which the use occurs."
Taken together, these two statements most strongly imply choice [REDACTED]: "[REDACTED]" This is a direct restatement of the key definitional points made about proverbs in the passage.
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
The passage discusses several key points about proverbs and their use in Mexican American communities:
1. Proverbs are self-contained sayings that carry wisdom or a message, and can be understood independent of specific verbal context. 
2. However, the meaning of each proverb use varies based on the individual speaker and social context.
3. Proverb use in Mexican American communities often serves a didactic purpose, especially in instructing youth.
4. Proverbs help foster ethnic consciousness and maintain ties to Mexican culture and tradition.
Looking at the answer choices:
A is incorrect. The passage does not state or imply that proverbs used for table manners have the primary purpose of maintaining ethnic ties.
B is tempting, but too broad. While the passage says proverbs can enhance familiarity with Mexican heritage, it does not say frequent proverb use in any community necessarily conveys ethnicity to children.
C is not supported. The passage focuses on Mexican American proverb use and does not compare it to use by other Spanish speakers worldwide.
D matches the key points from the first two paragraphs - proverbs are self-contained and understood independent of verbal context, but their meaning in each use depends on the social context. This is most strongly implied by the passage.
E is unsupported. While the passage notes an emphasis on peer relationships, it does not say this distinguishes Mexican American communities from others in the US.
Therefore, the best answer is D.
