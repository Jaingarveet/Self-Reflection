## User 2:
Topic: Law
Context: Of the eight students—George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert—in a seminar, exactly six will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
Question: If Helen, Kyle, and Lenore, not necessarily in that order, give the three morning reports, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Helen gives a report on Monday.
  B: Irving gives a report on Monday.
  C: Irving gives a report on Wednesday.
  D: Kyle gives a report on Tuesday.
  E: Kyle gives a report on Wednesday.

Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I apologize for my mistake in the previous answer. After reevaluating the problem, I realized that my initial answer was incorrect.

The correct answer is indeed [REDACTED]: [REDACTED]

Here's my thought process:

* We know that George can only give a report on Tuesday.
* We also know that neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
* Therefore, the only possible options for Monday are Irving and Helen.
* Since we know that Nina's report is not on Wednesday, Helen and Irving must both give reports on Wednesday if Nina gives a report.
* Therefore, the only option that satisfies all the conditions is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED]

I apologize for any confusion caused by my previous response, and I hope this explanation clarifies the correct answer.
