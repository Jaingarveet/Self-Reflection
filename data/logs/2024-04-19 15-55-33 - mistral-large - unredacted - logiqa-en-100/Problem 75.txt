Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I misunderstood the question prompt.

Error Keywords:

Solution:
The statement in the context is that people can satisfy their pursuit of material life through online shopping, even in regions with low economic development levels.
The option that most questions this view is the one that suggests that online shopping may not be able to fully satisfy people's material needs, specifically in regions with low economic development levels.
Option D suggests that people's satisfaction with the pursuit of material life depends only on the level of economic development in the region, implying that online shopping may not be able to fully satisfy people's material needs in regions with low economic development levels.
