Context: From the end of the 1980s to the beginning of the 1990s, a total of 134 in-service staff died in 7 research institutes of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Peking University in a five-year period.Some people collected this data and concluded that the average age of death of intellectuals in Zhongguancun is 53.34 years, which is lower than Beijing â€™s average life expectancy of 73 years in 1990 and 5.18 years lower than the 58.52 years surveyed 10 years ago.
Question: Which of the following most accurately points out the fallacy of this statistical reasoning?
Choices:
  A: The actual situation is that 143 in-service personnel died, and the sample data is unreliable.
  B: If the sample size is too small, data on the deaths of in-service personnel from other research institutions and universities in Zhongguancun should be added.
  C: This is equivalent to the surprising conclusion after surveying the average age of death of college students is 22 years? people with college education have an average life expectancy of more than 50 years less than others.
  D: This statistical reasoning does not distinguish between types of intellectuals in Zhongguancun.
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I incorrectly identified the fallacy in the statistical reasoning.
The gap in my knowledge was not in understanding the fallacy but in identifying the correct fallacy from the given options.
I knew that the sample size was small and biased, but I failed to recognize that the fallacy was a form of selection bias, not a problem with the sample size.

Error Keywords:
 - Fallacy identification error
 - Selection bias error
 - Sample size error

Solution:
The fallacy in this statistical reasoning is that it is based on a biased sample of intellectuals who died while in service, and it does not take into account the overall population of intellectuals in Zhongguancun.
The conclusion that the average age of death of intellectuals in Zhongguancun is lower than Beijing's average life expectancy is not valid because it is based on a biased sample.
This is equivalent to the surprising conclusion after surveying the average age of death of college students is 22 years? people with college education have an average life expectancy of more than 50 years less than others.

Instructions:
1. Identify the fallacy in the statistical reasoning.
2. Determine whether the fallacy is related to the sample size, sample selection, or some other factor.
3. Compare the given options to the identified fallacy.
4. Choose the option that most accurately describes the identified fallacy.
5. Double-check your answer to ensure that it accurately describes the identified fallacy.

Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your answer to ensure that it accurately describes the identified fallacy.
 - Remember that fallacies can be subtle and require careful analysis to identify.
 - Be aware of common fallacies and their characteristics to help you identify them more easily.
