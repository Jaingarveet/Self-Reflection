## System:
You are an expert in Logic.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Topic: Logic
Context: All landscape rooms can see the landscape, but Li Wenbing's family can't see the landscape.Therefore, Li Wenbing's family is not a landscape room.
Question: Which of the following is most similar to the above argument?
Choices:
  A: Kind people will be respected by the villagers, Chenggong who is kind and charitable will be respected by the villagers, so Chenggong is a kind person
  B: Vegetables in Dongdun Market are very cheap.This basket of vegetables is not bought in Dongdun Market.Therefore, this basket of vegetables is not cheap
  C: Employees of Jiutian Company can speak English, Lin Yingrui is an employee of Jiutian Company, therefore, Lin Yingrui can speak English

Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I focused too much on the direct negation of a property rather than the negation of a condition.

Error Keywords:
 - Focusing on direct negation of property
 - Overlooking negation of condition
 - Misinterpreting argument structure

Solution:
The original argument follows the structure:
All A are B, C is not B, therefore C is not A.
We need to find an argument with a similar structure.

Option A: Kind people will be respected by the villagers, Chenggong who is kind and charitable will be respected by the villagers, so Chenggong is a kind person.
This argument follows the structure: All A are B, C is B, therefore C is A. This is not similar to the original argument.

Option B: Vegetables in Dongdun Market are very cheap. This basket of vegetables is not bought in Dongdun Market. Therefore, this basket of vegetables is not cheap.
This argument follows the structure: All A are B, C is not A, therefore C is not B. This is similar to the original argument but not the most similar.

Option C: Employees of Jiutian Company can speak English, Lin Yingrui is an employee of Jiutian Company, therefore, Lin Yingrui can speak English.
This argument follows the structure: All A are B, C is A, therefore C is B. This is not similar to the original argument.

Option D: Anyone who meets the basic conditions can apply for a small loan. Sun Wen did not apply for a small loan. Therefore, Sun Wen did not meet the basic conditions.
This argument follows the structure: All A are B, C is not B, therefore C is not A. This is the most similar to the original argument.

Instructions:
1. Identify the structure of the original argument.
2. Compare the structure of each option to the original argument.
3. Focus on the negation of conditions rather than the direct negation of properties.
4. Choose the option that most closely matches the structure of the original argument.

Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your answer against the original argument structure.
 - Remember that the negation of a condition is not the same as the direct negation of a property.

Thought:
The original argument follows the structure: All A are B, C is not B, therefore C is not A.
Option A follows the structure: All A are B, C is B, therefore C is A. This is not similar to the original argument.
Option B follows the structure: All A are B, C is not A, therefore C is not B. This is similar to the original argument but not the most similar.
Option C follows the structure: All A are B, C is A, therefore C is B. This is not similar to the original argument.
Option D follows the structure: All A are B, C is not B, therefore C is not A. This is the most similar to the original argument.
Action: Answer("D")
