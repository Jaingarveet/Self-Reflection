Context: Based on the following questions? Most people think that advertisers do whatever they can to attract customers.But advertisers are not always like this.Recently, in order to expand sales, a family magazine called "Bay" was renamed "Inferno", which mainly published violent and pornographic content.As a result, some perennial advertisers from the original "Bay" magazine refused to renew the contract and turned to other publications.This shows that these advertisers not only consider economic benefits, but also take into account their ethical responsibilities.
Question: If the following item is true, can the argument be strengthened most?
Choices:
  A: The cost and selling price of "Inferno" are lower than that of "Harbour".
  B: The above advertisers who refused to renew their contracts have not affected the benefits after switching to other publications.
  C: Readers of family magazines are generally not interested in violent and pornographic content.
  D: Some clients who advertise in other family magazines and so on turn to "Inferno" magazine.

Explanation:
I misunderstood the argument and the type of evidence needed to strengthen it.
The gap in my knowledge was in understanding the argument's main point and the type of evidence needed to support it.
I chose an answer that weakened the argument instead of strengthening it.
Error Keywords:
 - Misunderstanding the argument
 - Misinterpreting the evidence
 - Choosing an answer that weakens the argument
Solution:
The argument is that advertisers consider ethical responsibilities, not just economic benefits.
The item that strengthens this argument would show that the advertisers' decision to leave "Inferno" was based on ethical concerns, not economic ones.
Choice D suggests that other advertisers turned to "Inferno" despite its violent and pornographic content, which implies that the advertisers who left were motivated by ethical concerns.
Instructions:
1. Identify the argument's main point.
2. Determine the type of evidence needed to support the argument.
3. Evaluate each answer choice to see if it provides the necessary evidence.
4. Choose the answer that best supports the argument.
5. Double-check your answer to ensure that it strengthens the argument, not weakens it.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the argument.
 - Always identify the type of evidence needed to support the argument.
 - Always evaluate each answer choice to see if it provides the necessary evidence.
 - Never choose an answer that weakens the argument.
 - Always double-check your answer to ensure that it strengthens the argument.
