Explanation:
I apologize for the mistake in my previous response. I misunderstood the format required for the answer. Thank you for pointing it out.

To answer the question, we can start by analyzing the conditions given in the problem:

1. None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
2. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
3. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.

From condition 1, we know that all clients' website targets must be shorter than or equal to their voicemail targets.

From condition 2, we know that Image's voicemail target is the shortest among all clients.

From condition 3, we know that Solide's website target is shorter than Truvest's website target.

Now, let's consider the choices:

A: Image's website target is shorter than Solide's. - False. Both Image and Solide have a website target of 1 day.

B: Solide's website target is shorter than Image's. - False. Both Image and Solide have a website target of 1 day.

C: Solide's voicemail target is shorter than Truvest's. - True. Solide's voicemail target is 1 day, while Truvest's voicemail target is 2 days.

D: Truvest's website target is shorter than Image's. - False. Truvest's website target is 2 days, while Image's website target is 1 day.

E: Truvest's voicemail target is shorter than Solide's. - False. Truvest's voicemail target is 2 days, while Solide's voicemail target is 1 day.

Therefore, the correct answer is "C: Solide's voicemail target is shorter than Truvest's."
