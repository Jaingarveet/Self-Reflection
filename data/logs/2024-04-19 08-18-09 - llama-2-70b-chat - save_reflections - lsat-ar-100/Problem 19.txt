## Get Reflection:
  Explanation:
I apologize for my mistake in the previous answer. After reevaluating the problem, I realized that my initial answer was incorrect.

The correct answer is indeed B: Irving gives a report on Monday.

Here's my thought process:

* We know that George can only give a report on Tuesday.
* We also know that neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
* Therefore, the only possible options for Monday are Irving and Helen.
* Since we know that Nina's report is not on Wednesday, Helen and Irving must both give reports on Wednesday if Nina gives a report.
* Therefore, the only option that satisfies all the conditions is B: Irving gives a report on Monday.

I apologize for any confusion caused by my previous response, and I hope this explanation clarifies the correct answer.
