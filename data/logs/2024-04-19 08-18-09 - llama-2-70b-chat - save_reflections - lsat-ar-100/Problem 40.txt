## Get Reflection:
  Explanation:
I made a mistake in my reasoning and incorrectly placed the optometrist in space 5.
The correct placement of the optometrist is in space 4, as it must be next to the pharmacy.
The veterinarian should be placed in space 5.
Error Keywords:
- Reasoning error
- Placement error
- Adjacency error

Solution:
Given that the shoe store is in space 2, we can start by placing the pharmacy in space 1, as it must be at one end of the row. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, so we can place one of them in space 3 and the other in space 6. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, so we can place the optometrist in space 4 and the veterinarian in space 5. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so we can place it in space 7.

Instructions:
1. Identify the businesses that must be at the ends of the row.
2. Place the pharmacy in space 1.
3. Place one of the restaurants in space 3.
4. Place the other restaurant in space 6.
5. Place the optometrist in space 4.
6. Place the veterinarian in space 5.
7. Place the toy store in space 7.

Advice:
- Always draw a diagram to visualize the problem.
- Always consider all the constraints and rules given in the problem.
- Always place the businesses in the correct order based on their constraints.
- Never make assumptions or jump to conclusions.
- Always double-check your placements to ensure they meet all the constraints.
- Remember that the optometrist must be next to the pharmacy, not the other way around.
