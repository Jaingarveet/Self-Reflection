## Get Reflection:
  Action: Answer("E")

Explanation:
I apologize for the mistake in my previous response. After re-reading the question, I realized that I misunderstood the format of the answer.

The correct answer is indeed E: #1: Souza; #2: Togowa; #3: Young; #4: Robertson; #5: Xu; #6: Vaughn

This answer choice satisfies all the rules given in the question:

1. Young is assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
2. Xu is assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
3. Robertson is assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
4. Robertson is assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.

I apologize for any confusion caused by my previous response, and I hope this clears up any confusion. Thank you for bringing this to my attention.
