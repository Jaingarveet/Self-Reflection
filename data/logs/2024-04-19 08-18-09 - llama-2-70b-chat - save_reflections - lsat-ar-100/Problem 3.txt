## Get Reflection:
  Explanation:
I made a mistake in my reasoning by not considering all possible scenarios. 
I incorrectly assumed that Young must be assigned parking space #2, which led me to choose answer B. 
However, Young could have been assigned parking space #1, which would have allowed Souza to be assigned parking space #4.
Error Keywords:
 - Logical reasoning error
 - Insufficient information
 - Overlooked possibility
Solution:
1. Assign parking space #1 to Young.
2. Assign parking space #2 to Togowa.
3. Assign parking space #3 to Robertson.
4. Assign parking space #4 to Souza.
5. Assign parking space #5 to Vaughn.
6. Assign parking space #6 to Xu.
Instructions:
1. List all possible assignments of parking spaces to employees.
2. Check if each assignment satisfies all the rules given in the problem.
3. Choose the answer that corresponds to the correct assignment.
Advice:
 - Always consider all possible scenarios and outcomes.
 - Don't make assumptions or jump to conclusions.
 - Take your time to carefully evaluate each possibility.
 - Use a systematic approach to solve the problem.
 - Double-check your work to ensure accuracy.
