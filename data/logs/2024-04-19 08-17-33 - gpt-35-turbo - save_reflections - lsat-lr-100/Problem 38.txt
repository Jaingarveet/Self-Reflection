## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I incorrectly chose answer choice B, which states that the journalist assumes that anyone associated with a company that manufactures a drug is unable to fairly weigh evidence concerning possible dangerous side effects of that drug. However, the journalist's argument is more specific than that; it assumes that the physician who critiqued the book is biased because he is employed by the company that manufactures the drug. Answer choice D correctly identifies this vulnerability in the journalist's argument.
Error Keywords:
 - Overgeneralization
 - Misinterpretation
 - Assumption
Solution:
The journalist argues that the critique of the book does not provide legitimate grounds to reject the book's claims about the drug's side effects because the physician is employed by the company that manufactures the drug. This argument assumes that the physician is biased and unable to fairly weigh evidence concerning possible dangerous side effects of that drug. However, it is possible that someone who has personal reasons to deny a claim may nonetheless provide legitimate grounds for denying that claim. Therefore, the journalist's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it fails to address adequately the possibility that someone who has personal reasons to deny a claim may nonetheless provide legitimate grounds for denying that claim.
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and understand the argument being made.
2. Identify the vulnerability in the argument.
3. Evaluate each answer choice carefully.
4. Choose the answer choice that correctly identifies the vulnerability in the argument.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the argument being made.
 - Be specific in your evaluation of the argument.
 - Evaluate each answer choice carefully and eliminate those that are clearly incorrect.
 - Choose the answer choice that correctly identifies the vulnerability in the argument.
