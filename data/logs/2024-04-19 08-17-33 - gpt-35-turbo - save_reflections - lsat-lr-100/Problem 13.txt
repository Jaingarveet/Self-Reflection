## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I chose answer choice B, which states that any company that wishes to hurt a competitor by refusing to accept coupons issued by that competitor will refuse to accept them even when accepting them would cost nothing and would satisfy its potential customers. However, this assumption is too specific and does not cover all possible scenarios. 
The correct answer is A, which states that any company that refuses to accept coupons issued by a competitor when doing so would satisfy some of the company's potential customers is motivated solely by the desire to hurt that competitor. This assumption covers all possible scenarios and supports the conclusion that Checkers's motive in refusing to accept the coupons was simply to hurt Marty's Pizza.
Error Keywords:
 - Specific assumption
 - Narrow assumption
 - Misreading the question
