## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I incorrectly chose answer choice B, which states that any story that describes a violation of a law of nature is intended to invoke dread in the reader. This statement is too broad and not supported by the passage. The passage only states that horror stories, which describe violations of the laws of nature, are intended to produce dread in the reader. 
The correct answer is E, which states that some stories that employ symbolism describe violations of the laws of nature. This statement is true based on the passage, which states that horror stories about monstrous beasts may symbolize a psychological disturbance in the protagonist. 
Error Keywords:
 - Overgeneralization
 - Misinterpretation
 - Unsupported assumption
Solution:
The passage states that both kinds of horror stories describe violations of the laws of nature and are intended to produce dread in the reader. It also mentions that horror stories about monstrous beasts may symbolize a psychological disturbance in the protagonist. Therefore, it is possible for some stories that employ symbolism to describe violations of the laws of nature. 
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and identify the key information in the passage.
2. Eliminate answer choices that are too broad or not supported by the passage.
3. Choose the answer choice that is most directly supported by the passage.
4. Double-check your answer choice to ensure that it is a logical conclusion based on the information in the passage.
