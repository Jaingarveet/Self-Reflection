## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I misinterpreted the statement "Prints of all of the latter works are available in the museum store" to mean that all prints in the museum store are of works in the museum's permanent collection. 
The correct interpretation is that all prints of works in the museum's permanent collection are available in the museum store. 
Error Keywords:
 - Misinterpretation
 - Assumption
 - Logical error
Solution:
The museum displays only twentieth-century works.
The works are either on loan from private collectors or in the museum's permanent collection.
Prints of all of the latter works are available in the museum store.
The museum store also sells prints of some works that are not part of the museum's permanent collection, such as Hopper's Nighthawks.
Therefore, prints of works that are displayed in the museum and not on loan from a private collector are available in the museum store.
