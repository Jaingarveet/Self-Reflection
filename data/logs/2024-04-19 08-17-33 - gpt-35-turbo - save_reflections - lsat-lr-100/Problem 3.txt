## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
My answer is incorrect because I did not consider the overall argument of the editorial. While Option B is a reasonable statement, it does not logically complete the editorial's argument. The editorial argues that education is like painting in that proper preparation is important. Therefore, the editorial is likely to suggest that a similar approach should be taken in education. Option E is the most logical choice to complete the editorial's argument because it states that the success of a student's overall educational experience depends upon that student's initial educational experience. This statement supports the idea that proper preparation is important in education, just as it is in painting.
Error Keywords:
 - Misunderstanding the overall argument
 - Focusing on a single detail
