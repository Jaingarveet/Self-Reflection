## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I incorrectly chose answer choice C, which states that it is not wrong to use someone's property without their permission if they have used your property without your permission. However, this principle does not directly support Mike's reasoning that it would not be wrong for him to use Tom's computer without his permission. Answer choice D, on the other hand, states that it is permissible to treat people in a way that is similar to the way in which they have treated others. This principle directly supports Mike's reasoning that it would not be wrong for him to use Tom's computer without his permission because Tom used Mary's bicycle without her permission. 
Error Keywords:
 - Misinterpretation of the question
 - Incorrect application of principle
 - Logical error
Solution:
Mike is trying to justify his use of Tom's computer without his permission by citing Tom's use of Mary's bicycle without her permission. The principle that would most help to justify Mike's reasoning is the one that supports the idea that it is permissible to treat people in a way that is similar to the way in which they have treated others. Answer choice D is the correct answer because it directly supports Mike's reasoning that it would not be wrong for him to use Tom's computer without his permission because Tom used Mary's bicycle without her permission. 
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and understand the problem.
2. Identify the principle that would most help to justify the reasoning.
3. Evaluate each answer choice against the principle and the reasoning.
