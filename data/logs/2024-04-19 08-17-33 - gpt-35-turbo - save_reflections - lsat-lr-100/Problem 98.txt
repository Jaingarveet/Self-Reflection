## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I chose answer choice B, which is incorrect. The argument does not assume that technology beneficial to society as a whole cannot be commercially viable. Instead, it claims that those responsible for technological advances are motivated by personal gain rather than societal benefit. 
The correct answer is D because the argument assumes that an action is unlikely to produce a certain outcome unless it is motivated by a desire to produce that outcome. This is not necessarily true, as people may unintentionally produce outcomes that they did not desire. 
Error Keywords:
 - False assumption
 - Misinterpretation
 - Logical error
Solution:
The argument claims that technological innovation is rarely in the interest of society as a whole because those responsible for it are motivated by personal gain rather than societal benefit. This assumes that an action is unlikely to produce a certain outcome unless it is motivated by a desire to produce that outcome. This is not necessarily true, as people may unintentionally produce outcomes that they did not desire.
