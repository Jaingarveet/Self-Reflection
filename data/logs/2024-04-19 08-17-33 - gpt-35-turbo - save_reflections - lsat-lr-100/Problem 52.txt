## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I chose answer choice E because it presents an alternative reason for why a tire may wear out prematurely. However, the flawed pattern of reasoning in the argument above is that it assumes a necessary condition is also a sufficient condition. Specifically, the argument assumes that the only reason a bird feeder will not attract many birds is that it lacks a protective cover. Answer choice B has the same flawed pattern of reasoning. It assumes that the only reason a tire will wear out prematurely is that the car owner neglects to check the tire pressure regularly. 
Error Keywords:
 - Necessary vs. sufficient condition
 - Flawed pattern of reasoning
 - Assumption of a necessary condition as a sufficient condition
Solution:
The argument above assumes that a necessary condition is also a sufficient condition. Specifically, it assumes that the only reason a bird feeder will not attract many birds is that it lacks a protective cover. The argument ignores other possible reasons. Answer choice B has the same flawed pattern of reasoning. It assumes that the only reason a tire will wear out prematurely is that the car owner neglects to check the tire pressure regularly. The argument ignores other possible reasons for premature tire wear. 
Instructions:
1. Identify the necessary and sufficient conditions in the argument.
2. Determine if the argument assumes that the necessary condition is also a sufficient condition.
3. Identify any other possible reasons for the conclusion.
4. Evaluate each answer choice to determine if it has the same flawed pattern of reasoning.
5. Choose the answer choice that has the same flawed pattern of reasoning.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always identify the necessary and sufficient conditions in the argument.
 - Always evaluate whether the argument assumes that the necessary condition is also a sufficient condition.
 - Always consider other possible reasons for the conclusion.
 - Always evaluate each answer choice to determine if it has the same flawed pattern of reasoning.
 - Remember that a necessary condition is not always a sufficient condition.
