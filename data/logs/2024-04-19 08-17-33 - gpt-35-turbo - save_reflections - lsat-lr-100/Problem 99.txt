## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that the argument was about the relationship between freedom of thought and intellectual discipline. However, the argument was about the failure of the argument for freedom of thought. 
The gap in my knowledge was in understanding the argument structure and the conclusion. 
The correct answer is C because it supports the idea that societies that protect freedom of thought may lack intellectual discipline, which is necessary for intellectual progress. 
Error Keywords:
 - Misunderstanding the argument structure
 - Incorrect assumption
 - Lack of attention to the conclusion
Solution:
The conclusion drawn by the professor follows logically if we assume that in societies that protect freedom of thought, thinkers invariably lack intellectual discipline. This assumption supports the idea that intellectual discipline is necessary for intellectual progress, and that freedom of thought alone is not sufficient. 
Instructions:
1. Read the argument carefully and identify the conclusion.
2. Identify the premises that support the conclusion.
3. Understand the relationship between the premises and the conclusion.
4. Identify the assumption that is necessary for the conclusion to follow logically.
5. Choose the answer that supports the assumption.
6. Double-check your answer to ensure that it is consistent with the argument.
Advice:
 - Always read the argument carefully and understand the conclusion.
 - Pay attention to the structure of the argument and the relationship between the premises and the conclusion.
 - Identify the assumption that is necessary for the conclusion to follow logically.
 - Choose the answer that supports the assumption.
 - Double-check your answer to ensure that it is consistent with the argument.
