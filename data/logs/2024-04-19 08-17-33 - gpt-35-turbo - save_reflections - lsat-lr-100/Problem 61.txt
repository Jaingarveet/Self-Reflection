## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I incorrectly identified option D as the least helpful in establishing the conclusion. However, option B is the least helpful because it does not relate to memory or the ability to remember to make a telephone call at a specified time. 
My error was in not carefully considering each option and its relevance to the conclusion. 
Error Keywords:
 - Careless mistake
 - Misreading the question
 - Not considering all options
Solution:
The conclusion is that at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages, based on the fact that Group A (composed of persons sixty-five to seventy-five years old) performed better than Group B (composed of college students) in remembering to make a telephone call precisely at a specified time.
Option B is the least helpful in establishing the conclusion because it does not relate to memory or the ability to remember to make a telephone call at a specified time.
