## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I misinterpreted the journalist's statements. The journalist explains that brown dwarfs are identified by their mass and whether or not lithium is present in their atmospheres. The journalist also explains that stars with less mass than the Sun have no lithium because the element has been fully mixed into their nuclear furnaces and consumed. However, the journalist does not state that no celestial object less massive than a brown dwarf has lithium in its atmosphere. 
Error Keywords:
 - Misinterpretation
 - Overgeneralization
 - Logical fallacy
Solution:
The journalist explains that brown dwarfs are identified by their mass and whether or not lithium is present in their atmospheres. The journalist also explains that stars with less mass than the Sun have no lithium because the element has been fully mixed into their nuclear furnaces and consumed. However, the journalist does not state that no celestial object less massive than a brown dwarf has lithium in its atmosphere. The journalist also does not state that any celestial object with lithium in its atmosphere has a nuclear furnace that has incompletely mixed the object's elements. The journalist does state that no celestial object that has no lithium in its atmosphere is a brown dwarf. Therefore, the correct answer is C.
