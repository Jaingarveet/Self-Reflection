## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I did not read the options carefully and did not think through each option's implications. 
I chose option C because it seemed to make sense, but it did not directly explain the study's findings. 
The correct answer is A because it directly explains why the levels of nicotine found in the blood of smokers who smoke one pack of cigarettes per day are identical at the end of a day's worth of smoking, whatever the level of nicotine in the cigarettes they smoke. 
Error Keywords:
 - Careless reading
 - Insufficient analysis
 - Incorrect reasoning
Solution:
The study found that the levels of nicotine found in the blood of smokers who smoke one pack of cigarettes per day are identical at the end of a day's worth of smoking, whatever the level of nicotine in the cigarettes they smoke. 
Option A explains that blood cannot absorb more nicotine per day than that found in the smoke from a package of the lowest-nicotine cigarettes available. This means that even if a smoker smokes high-nicotine cigarettes, they will absorb the same amount of nicotine as a smoker who smokes low-nicotine cigarettes, resulting in the same level of nicotine in the blood.
