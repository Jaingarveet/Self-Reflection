## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I chose answer choice B because it presents a similar pattern of flawed reasoning, which is generalization from a sample to a population. However, the correct answer is E because it presents a similar pattern of flawed reasoning, which is assuming that two things that are often associated are necessarily causally related. 
Error Keywords:
 - Generalization error
 - Causation error
 - Association error
Solution:
The argument presents a flawed reasoning pattern of assuming that two things that are often associated are necessarily causally related. The fact that most auto mechanics have extensive experience and understand electronic circuits does not necessarily mean that most auto mechanics understand electronic circuits because of their extensive experience.
