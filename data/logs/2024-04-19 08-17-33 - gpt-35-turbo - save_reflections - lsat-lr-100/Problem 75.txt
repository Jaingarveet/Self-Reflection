## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I incorrectly chose answer choice D because it emphasizes the prevention of any further environmental damage and does not allow for different degrees of harm already done by different nations. However, this principle does not support the Figorian Development Commission's position because it does not address the issue of Figoria's right to govern its own resources. Answer choice C is the correct answer because it supports the Figorian Development Commission's position by suggesting that regulation should only be implemented when a reduction of populations of endangered species by commercial development has been found. This principle implies that Figoria should be allowed to develop wetlands for growth unless there is evidence that endangered species are being harmed.
Error Keywords:
 - Misinterpretation of the question
 - Incorrect assumption
 - Incorrect reasoning
Solution:
The Figorian Development Commission believes that Figoria should be allowed to develop wetlands for growth, and that they have the right to govern their own resources. Therefore, the principle that would most strongly support their position would be one that emphasizes the right of individual nations to govern their own resources. Answer choice C is the correct answer because it supports the Figorian Development Commission's position by suggesting that regulation should only be implemented when a reduction of populations of endangered species by commercial development has been found. This principle implies that Figoria should be allowed to develop wetlands for growth unless there is evidence that endangered species are being harmed.
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and understand the positions of both sides.
2. Identify the principle that would most strongly support the Figorian Development Commission's position.
3. Consider each answer choice and evaluate whether it supports the Figorian Development Commission's position.
4. Eliminate answer choices that do not support the Figorian Development Commission's position.
5. Choose the answer choice that most strongly supports the Figorian Development Commission's position.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the positions of both sides.
 - Always evaluate each answer choice in relation to the question and the positions of both sides.
 - Never assume that an answer choice is correct without evaluating it carefully.
 - Always eliminate answer choices that do not support one side or the other.
 - Remember that the correct answer is the one that most strongly supports one side or the other.
