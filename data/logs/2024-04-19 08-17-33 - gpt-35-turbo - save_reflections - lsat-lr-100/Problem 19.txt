## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I incorrectly chose answer choice D because it mentions that the computer was typically used in the operation of a business, which is one of the conditions mentioned by the lawyer. However, the customs officials' action was not justified because there were no reasonable grounds for believing that the computer contained data usable as evidence in a legal proceeding against the importer. Answer choice B is the correct answer because it mentions that the police department investigators accessed the electronic accounting files of the central computer owned by a consulting firm that was on trial for fraudulent business practices without seeking permission from the firm's owners. The investigators had reasonable grounds for believing that the computer contained data usable as evidence in a legal proceeding against the consulting firm, which justifies their action.
Error Keywords:
 - Misapplication of the lawyer's principles
 - Incorrect interpretation of the conditions
 - Failure to consider all the conditions
