## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I incorrectly chose answer choice C because I focused on the fact that the argument did not consider other technological innovations that may have affected the way people live. However, the argument's reasoning is questionable because it infers that the current geography of modern cities resulted only from the use of personal automobiles, without considering other possible causes. 
Error Keywords:
 - Misunderstanding the argument's main point
 - Ignoring the argument's assumptions
 - Focusing on a minor detail instead of the main point
Solution:
The argument suggests that personal automobiles have had a significant impact on the geography of modern cities. However, the argument assumes that personal automobiles are the only cause of the current geography of modern cities, without considering other possible causes. Therefore, the argument's reasoning is questionable because it infers from the idea that the current geography of modern cities resulted from a particular cause that it could only have resulted from that cause. 
Instructions:
1. Identify the main point of the argument.
2. Identify the assumptions made by the argument.
3. Evaluate whether the argument's reasoning is valid based on its assumptions.
4. Choose the answer that best describes the flaw in the argument's reasoning.
5. Double-check your answer to ensure that it addresses the main point of the argument.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Identify the main point and assumptions of the argument.
 - Evaluate the reasoning of the argument based on its assumptions.
 - Choose the answer that best describes the flaw in the argument's reasoning.
 - Double-check your answer to ensure that it addresses the main point of the argument.
 - Remember that the correct answer is the one that best describes the flaw in the argument's reasoning, not necessarily the one that is completely true or false.
