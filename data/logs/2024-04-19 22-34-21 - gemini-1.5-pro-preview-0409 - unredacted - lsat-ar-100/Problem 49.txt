Topic: Law
Context: A shopping center has exactly seven spaces—space 1 through space 7—arranged in a straight row. Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
Question: Which one of the following could be the order of the businesses in spaces 1 through 7 respectively?
Choices:
  A: pharmacy, optometrist, shoe store, restaurant, veterinarian, toy store, restaurant
  B: pharmacy, veterinarian, optometrist, shoe store, restaurant, toy store, restaurant
  C: restaurant, shoe store, veterinarian, pharmacy, optometrist, toy store, restaurant
  D: restaurant, toy store, optometrist, restaurant, veterinarian, shoe store, pharmacy
  E: restaurant, optometrist, toy store, restaurant, shoe store, veterinarian, pharmacy

Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:** My error stemmed from a misinterpretation of the constraint "The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian." I incorrectly assumed this meant the pharmacy had to be directly adjacent, overlooking the possibility of another business separating them while still fulfilling the "next to" condition.
**Error Keywords:**
*   Misinterpretation 
*   Logical error
*   Constraint misunderstanding
## Step-by-Step Solution
1.  **Identify Ends:** We need a pharmacy at one end and a restaurant at the other. Options C and D violate this, leaving A, B, and E.
2.  **Restaurant Separation:** The two restaurants need at least two businesses between them. Option D violates this, leaving A, B, and E.
3.  **Pharmacy Proximity:** The pharmacy should be next to (not necessarily directly adjacent to) the optometrist or veterinarian. Option B violates this as the toy store separates them, leaving A and E.
4.  **Toy Store Placement:** The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian. Option A violates this, leaving only option E as the valid arrangement.
## Instructions for Future Problem Solving
1.  **Carefully analyze each constraint:** Pay close attention to the wording and consider all possible interpretations.
2.  **Break down constraints:** Divide complex constraints into simpler parts for easier evaluation.
3.  **Eliminate options systematically:** Rule out choices that violate any of the constraints.
4.  **Double-check remaining options:** Ensure the final choice satisfies all constraints without exception.
## General Advice for Similar Problems
*   **Read actively and critically:** Don't skim; understand the nuances of the language used.
*   **Visualize the problem:** Draw diagrams or use other visual aids to represent the scenario.
*   **Consider all possibilities:** Don't jump to conclusions; explore different interpretations and arrangements.
*   **Practice logical reasoning:** Strengthen your ability to analyze information and draw valid conclusions.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Based on the reflection, I need to carefully analyze each constraint and consider all possibilities. 
The key is to remember that "next to" doesn't necessarily mean directly adjacent.
