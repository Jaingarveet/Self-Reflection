## System:
You are an expert in Law.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## User 2:
Topic: Law
Context: An administrator must assign parking spaces to six new employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young. Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
Question: For how many of the six new employees is the assignment of a parking space limited to one of only two possible spaces?
Choices:
  A: none
  B: two
  C: three
  D: four
  E: five
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:** My error stemmed from overlooking the constraints placed on Souza and Togowa by the given rules. While I correctly identified Young's limitation to two spaces (#2 or #3), I failed to recognize that Souza and Togowa were also restricted in their possible assignments due to their relationships with Xu and Young, respectively.
**Error Keywords:**
*   Logic error
*   Constraint oversight
*   Relationship misinterpretation 
## Step-by-Step Solution
1. **Robertson's Constraint:** Robertson must be in one of #1-4. This leaves #5 and #6 for the remaining employees.
2. **Young's Constraint:** Young must be higher than Togowa and lower than Robertson. Since Robertson is limited to #1-4, Young can only be in **#2 or #3**.
3. **Xu's Constraint:** Xu must be higher than Souza. This means Souza cannot be in #6 (as there's no higher space) and is limited to **#1-5**.
4. **Togowa's Constraint:** Togowa must be lower than Young. Since Young can only be in #2 or #3, Togowa is limited to **#1 or #2**.
5. **Souza and Xu's Remaining Options:** With Togowa and Young potentially occupying #1 and #2, and Robertson occupying one of #1-4, Souza is further restricted to **#4 or #5**. Consequently, Xu can only be in **#5 or #6**.
Therefore, four employees (Young, Togowa, Souza, and Xu) have only two possible parking space assignments each. 
## Instructions for Future Problem Solving
1. **Identify all individual constraints:**  List each employee and their specific limitations based on the given rules.
2. **Analyze relationships between constraints:**  Understand how the limitations of one employee impact the options for others.
3. **Eliminate impossible options:**  Cross out parking spaces that become unavailable due to the established constraints.
4. **Iteratively refine possibilities:**  As you determine limitations for one employee, revisit the options for others to see if their possibilities are further reduced.
5. **Count employees with only two options:**  Once all constraints are applied, identify the number of employees with only two remaining parking space possibilities.
## General Advice for Similar Problems
*   **Visualize the problem:**  Consider using diagrams or tables to represent the relationships and constraints between elements.
*   **Work systematically:**  Avoid jumping to conclusions and instead follow a logical step-by-step process.
*   **Consider all possibilities:**  Don't overlook any potential scenarios or constraints, even if they seem unlikely at first.
*   **Review and revise:**  Double-check your reasoning and ensure you haven't missed any crucial details or made any logical errors.
