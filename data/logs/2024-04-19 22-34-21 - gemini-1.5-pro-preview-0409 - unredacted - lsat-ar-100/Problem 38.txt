## System:
You are an expert in Law.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:
Topic: Geography
Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Law
Context: Exactly eight books—F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O—are placed on a bookcase with exactly three shelves—the top shelf, the middle shelf, and the bottom shelf. At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.
Question: If G is placed on the top shelf, then which one of the following could be a complete and accurate list of the books placed on the middle shelf?
Choices:
  A: H, I
  B: I, L
  C: H, I, L
  D: I, K, L
  E: F, I, M
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:** My error was assuming that because F and M were together, they could not be on the middle shelf with K above them. I neglected the possibility of F and M being on the bottom shelf with K on the middle shelf.
**Error Keywords:**
*   Logic error
*   Assumption error
*   Placement constraint misinterpretation 
## Step-by-Step Solution
1.  **Top Shelf:** G is placed here, leaving space for only one more book due to the constraint.
2.  **Middle Shelf:** I is placed here. We need to find two more books that can fit.
3.  **Bottom Shelf:** This shelf must have more books than the top shelf, so at least 3 books will be placed here.
4.  **Analyzing Remaining Books:**
    *   F and M must be together.
    *   K must be above F.
    *   O must be above L.
5.  **Possible Arrangements:**
    *   **Top Shelf:** G, H  
    *   **Middle Shelf:** I, K, L 
    *   **Bottom Shelf:** F, M, O 
This arrangement satisfies all conditions. 
## Instructions for Future Similar Problems
1.  **Identify Constraints:** List all conditions and restrictions given in the problem.
2.  **Start with Fixed Placements:** Place the books with specific shelf assignments first.
3.  **Analyze Remaining Books:** Group books that must be together and consider their placement restrictions relative to others.
4.  **Consider Shelf Capacity:** Remember the constraint about the number of books on each shelf.
5.  **Explore Possibilities:** Try different arrangements that satisfy all conditions.
6.  **Eliminate Invalid Options:** Rule out choices that violate any of the constraints.
7.  **Verify the Solution:** Double-check that the final arrangement satisfies all conditions.
## General Advice for Similar Problems
*   **Read Carefully:** Pay close attention to each constraint and avoid making assumptions.
*   **Visualize:**  Try drawing a diagram or using a table to represent the shelves and book placements.
*   **Be Systematic:** Work through the problem step-by-step, considering all possibilities.
*   **Check for Consistency:** Ensure that the final solution does not contradict any of the given conditions. 
*   **Practice:** The more you practice solving logic puzzles, the better you will become at identifying patterns and avoiding errors.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
We know I must be on the middle shelf. We need to find two more books that can join I.
*  F and M are together, but with K above F, they cannot be on the middle shelf.
*  O being above L doesn't restrict L from being on the middle shelf.
*  K can be on the middle shelf as long as F is on the bottom shelf.
