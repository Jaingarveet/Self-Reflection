Context: An administrator must assign parking spaces to six new employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young. Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
Question: If Robertson is assigned parking space #3, then which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Souza is assigned parking space #4.
  B: Togowa is assigned parking space #2.

## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:** My reasoning was flawed because I focused on the most likely scenario rather than the absolute certainty required by the word "must." While my deductions were logical, they didn't account for all possible valid arrangements.
**Error Keywords:**
*   Logic error
*   Assumption error
*   Misinterpretation of "must"
## Step-by-Step Solution
1.  **Robertson in #3:** This implies Young must be in #4, #5, or #6 (Robertson > Young).
2.  **Remaining spaces:** This leaves #1, #2, and one of #4, #5, or #6 for Souza, Togowa, Xu, and Vaughn.
3.  **Xu and Souza:** The rule Xu > Souza doesn't provide specific placement yet.
4.  **Young and Togowa:** Since Young > Togowa and Young is in #4, #5, or #6, Togowa can be in #1 or #2.
5.  **Crucial deduction:**  **If Togowa is in #1, then Young MUST be in #2** to satisfy Young > Togowa. This is the only option that guarantees a "must be true" condition.
## Instructions for Future
1.  **Identify fixed placements:** Start with rules that directly assign spaces (like Robertson).
2.  **Analyze relative placements:** Deduce the order of other employees based on given rules (Young > Togowa, Xu > Souza).
3.  **Consider all possibilities:** Don't focus on the most likely scenario; explore all valid arrangements.
4.  **Focus on "must":**  Identify the option that holds true in every possible valid arrangement, not just the most likely one.
## General Advice
*   **Read carefully:** Pay close attention to keywords like "must," "could," or "cannot."
*   **Logic over assumptions:** Base deductions on given rules, not assumptions about likelihood.
*   **Consider all cases:** Explore all valid scenarios before drawing conclusions.
*   **Review and revise:** Double-check your reasoning and ensure it aligns with the question's requirements.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Given Robertson is in #3, Young must be in #4, #5, or #6.  If Togowa is in #1, then Young MUST be in #2 to satisfy the rule Young > Togowa. This is the only option that guarantees a "must be true" condition.
