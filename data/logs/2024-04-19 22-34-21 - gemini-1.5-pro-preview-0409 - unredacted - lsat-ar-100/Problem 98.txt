Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:** My error stemmed from misinterpreting the "could be true" nature of the question. I focused on finding a scenario where option B was always true, overlooking the possibility of other scenarios where it might not be.
**Error Keywords:**
*   Misinterpretation 
*   Logic error
*   Overlooking possibilities
## Step-by-Step Solution
1. **Analyze Constraints:**
    *   J is in the evening.
    *   K is afternoon or evening.
    *   L is after K and before M, so both are afternoon or evening.
    *   N, O, P fill remaining slots (one afternoon, two evening).
2. **Evaluate Options for Possibility:**
    *   A: Possible if K is afternoon and J is last.
    *   B: Possible if L is afternoon and J is last, but not guaranteed.
    *   **C: Always possible as P can be either of the two evening slots, one of which will be after J.**
    *   D: Impossible as only one slot remains after M.
    *   E: Possible but not guaranteed depending on the order. 
## Instructions for Future
1. **Carefully analyze the question's intent.** Pay attention to keywords like "could," "must," or "cannot."
2. **Consider all possible scenarios**, not just the ones that immediately come to mind.
3. **Focus on the constraints** given in the problem and how they limit the options.
4. **Eliminate options that are impossible** based on the constraints.
5. **For remaining options, determine if they are always true, sometimes true, or never true** given the constraints.
## General Advice
*   **Avoid jumping to conclusions** based on initial assumptions.
*   **Consider multiple perspectives and interpretations** of the problem.
*   **Practice logical reasoning and critical thinking skills** to improve your ability to analyze complex scenarios.
*   **Review your answers carefully** before finalizing them.
