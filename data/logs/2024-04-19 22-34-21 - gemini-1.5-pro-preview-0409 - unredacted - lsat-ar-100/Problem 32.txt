Topic: Law
Context: A maintenance company that takes service requests from three clients—Image, Solide, and Truvest—plans to set targets for its average service response times. Service targets will be set at 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day. Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail. The six targets are set according to the following conditions: None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
Question: If none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days, then each of the following must be true EXCEPT:
Choices:
  A: Image's website target is 1 day.
  B: Solide's website target is 2 days.
  C: Solide's voicemail target is 2 days.
  D: Truvest's website target is 2 days.
  E: Truvest's voicemail target is 2 days.

You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:** My error stemmed from a misinterpretation of the third condition ("Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target"). I assumed this meant Solide's website target had to be one day less than Truvest's, leading to the incorrect deduction that Solide's website target must be 2 days.
**Error Keywords:**
*   Logical reasoning error
*   Misinterpretation of constraints
*   Incorrect deduction
## Step-by-Step Solution
1.  **Image's Targets:** Following the initial reasoning, Image's voicemail target is 1 day, and consequently, its website target is also 1 day. (Option A is true)
2.  **Truvest's Targets:** Since Image's voicemail is 1 day, and no voicemail target is 3 days, Truvest's voicemail target must be 2 days. This leaves Truvest's website target to be 1 day due to the first condition. (Options D and E are true)
3.  **Solide's Targets:** We know Solide's voicemail target is 2 days. Now, considering the third condition and the fact that Truvest's website target is already 1 day, Solide's website target **can be either 1 day or 2 days**. The problem doesn't provide enough information to definitively determine which.
Therefore, the statement that is NOT necessarily true is **B: Solide's website target is 2 days**.
## Instructions for Future Problem Solving
1.  **Carefully analyze each condition/constraint:** Pay close attention to the exact wording and avoid making assumptions beyond what is stated.
2.  **Consider all possibilities:** Don't jump to conclusions based on initial deductions. Explore different scenarios that fit the given conditions.
3.  **Work step-by-step:** Break down the problem into smaller parts and analyze each part individually.
4.  **Verify deductions:** Ensure each conclusion logically follows from the given information and previously established facts.
5.  **Identify necessary vs. possible outcomes:** Differentiate between statements that must be true based on the conditions and those that could be true but aren't guaranteed.
## General Advice for Similar Problems
*   **Practice logical reasoning:** Engage in exercises that involve interpreting information and drawing conclusions based on given rules or conditions.
*   **Develop critical thinking skills:** Learn to analyze information objectively, identify potential biases, and avoid making assumptions.
*   **Pay attention to detail:** Small nuances in wording or conditions can significantly impact the outcome of a problem. 
*   **Review and learn from mistakes:** Analyze incorrect answers to understand the reasoning errors and avoid repeating them in the future.
