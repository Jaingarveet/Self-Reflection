Context: Aptripa Cave is located near the bay of Dilos in the Peninsula of Maina, and is as large as four football fields.This cave dates back to the Neolithic Age, but was not accidentally discovered by a man walking a dog until the 1950s.After decades of scientific research work, archaeologists excavated tools, pottery, obsidian, silver and copper utensils from the cave, and thus believed that hundreds of people had lived in the cave.
Question: Which of the following, if true, can best refute the above argument?
Choices:
  A: The cave inspired the description of hell in Greek mythology
  B: The cave is actually an ancient cemetery and funeral venue
  C: There is no prehistoric village in Europe that has been found earlier than the cave
  D: The entrance to the cave collapsed 5000 years ago
Reflection:

Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
My answer was incorrect because I failed to consider the possibility that the cave could have been used for a different purpose other than residential.
The correct answer, [REDACTED], states that the cave is actually an ancient cemetery and funeral venue, which would explain the presence of various tools and artifacts without necessarily implying that hundreds of people lived in the cave.
Error Keywords:
- Assumption

- Incomplete information
Solution:
1. Identify the argument made by the archaeologists.
2. Consider alternative explanations for the presence of tools and artifacts in the cave.
3. Evaluate the strength of the alternative explanation.
4. If the alternative explanation is strong, refute the original argument.
Instructions:
1. Always consider alternative explanations for the evidence presented.
2. Evaluate the strength of each explanation.
3. Refute the original argument if an alternative explanation is strong.
Advice:
- Look for hidden assumptions in the argument.
