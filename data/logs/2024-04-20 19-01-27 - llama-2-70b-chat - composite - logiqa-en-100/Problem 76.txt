Topic: Logic
Context: Some Taiwan independence elements argue that all people under the jurisdiction of the People ’s Republic of China are Chinese, and Taiwanese are not under the jurisdiction of the People ’s Republic of China.Therefore, Taiwanese are not Chinese.
Question: Which of the following reasoning clearly shows that the above argument is not valid?
Choices:
  A: All successful people have to eat in clothes.I am not a successful person now, so I do n’t have to eat in clothes.
  B: Commodities have use value, and air certainly has use value, so air is of course a commodity.
  C: All technical backbones study hard.Xiao Zhang is a technical backbone.Therefore, Xiao Zhang is a hard-working person.
  D: Criminal behaviors are illegal behaviors, and violations should be condemned by the society, so all criminal behaviors should be condemned by the society.
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
The argument "Taiwanese are not Chinese" is based on a false premise. The fact that Taiwanese people are not under the jurisdiction of the People's Republic of China does not mean they are not Chinese. Chinese refers to a person's ethnicity, culture, or nationality, which is not determined by their political status or jurisdiction.

The closest analogy to this argument is choice [REDACTED], which argues that air is a commodity because it has use value. However, air is not a commodity in the classical sense, as it is not something that can be bought or sold. Similarly, the argument that Taiwanese are not Chinese because they are not under the jurisdiction of the People's Republic of China is also flawed, as it is based on a faulty premise.

Therefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED].
