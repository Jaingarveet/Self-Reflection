Explanation:
I made a mistake in my calculation. I misunderstood the formula for simple interest and calculated the total amount instead of the simple interest.
## Assistant 2:
  Thought: 
The formula for simple interest is:
Simple Interest = Principal x Rate x Time

In this case, the principal is Rs. 500, the rate is 6% per annum, and the time is 4 years.

So, the simple interest will be:
Simple Interest = 500 x 6% x 4 = 1200

Now, the total amount that Rahul needs to pay to clear the debt is the principal plus the simple interest:
Total Amount = Principal + Simple Interest = 500 + 1200 = 1700

Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
