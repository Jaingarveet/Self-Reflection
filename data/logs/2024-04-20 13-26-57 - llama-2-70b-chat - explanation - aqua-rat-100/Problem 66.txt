Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I misunderstood the pattern of the ages of the members in the club. I incorrectly assumed that the pattern was increasing by 3 months for each member, when in fact, the pattern was increasing by 3 years for each member.
## Assistant 2:
  Thought: 
The youngest member is 7 years old, and the sum of the ages of all members is 250.
Let the number of members be x.
The oldest member's age will be 7 + (x - 1) \* 3 = 250.
I can solve for x by solving the equation:
7 + (x - 1) \* 3 = 250

Reflection:
I previously misunderstood the pattern of the ages of the members, thinking it was increasing by 3 months for each member. However, the pattern is actually increasing by 3 years for each member. Therefore, the oldest member's age will be 7 + (x - 1) \* 3.

Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
