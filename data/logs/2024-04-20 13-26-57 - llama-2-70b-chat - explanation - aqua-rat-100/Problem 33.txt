## Assistant 2:
  Sure, I'll do my best to answer the question.

Here's my reflection on the previous answer:

I previously answered this question incorrectly. I made a mistake in my calculation of the area of the remaining paper. I mistakenly calculated the area of the full circle instead of the semi-circle.

Here's my corrected solution:

The semi-circles are drawn on opposite sides of the square paper, so they have the same radius. Let's call the radius "r".

The area of a semi-circle is given by:

Area = (1/2)πr^2

Since there are two semi-circles, the total area of the semi-circles is:

Total Area = 2(1/2)πr^2 = πr^2

Now, we need to find the area of the remaining paper. We can do this by subtracting the area of the semi-circles from the area of the original square paper.

The area of the original square paper is:

Area = side^2 = 20^2 = 400

So, the area of the remaining paper is:

Area = 400 - πr^2

Now, we need to find the value of "r". We know that the diameter of the semi-circle is 20 cm, so the radius is half of that:

r = 20/2 = 10 cm

Now we can plug in the value of "r" into the equation for the area of the remaining paper:

Area = 400 - π(10)^2 = 400 - 100π = 300π

So, the area of the remaining paper is 300π.

Now, let's check the choices:

A: 8.75
B: 8.79
C: 8.75
D: 8.71
E: 8.72

None of the choices match the answer we got, 300π.

So, the correct answer is:

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
