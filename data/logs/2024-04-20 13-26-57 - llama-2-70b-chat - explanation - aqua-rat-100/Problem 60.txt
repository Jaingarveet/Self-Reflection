## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: Points A, B, C, D lie in this order on the circumference of a circle. Minor arc AC is 160°, and minor arc BD is 150°. If B bisects minor arc AC, then what is the measure of minor arc AD?
Choices:
  A: 80°
  B: 130°
  C: 140°
  D: 160°
  E: 220°
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I made a mistake in my reasoning. I correctly identified that [REDACTED] bisects minor arc A[REDACTED], but I incorrectly concluded that the measure of minor arc A[REDACTED] is [REDACTED].
## Assistant 2:
  I apologize for my mistake. Let's analyze the problem again.
Points A, B, C, D lie in this order on the circumference of a circle. Minor arc AC is 160°, and minor arc BD is 150°. We know that B bisects minor arc AC.
We can draw a line from point B to the midpoint of arc AC, and label it as point M.
Since B bisects minor arc AC, we know that:
Angular distance ABM = Angular distance CMB

We can also see that:
Angular distance ABM = (Angular distance AC) / 2
Angular distance CMB = (Angular distance BC) / 2

Now, we can set up a proportion:
(Angular distance AC) / 2 = (Angular distance BC) / 2
160° / 2 = 150° / 2
80° = 75°

Since the measure of minor arc AD is equal to the difference between the measures of minor arcs AC and BC, we have:
Minor arc AD = 160° - 150° = 10°

Therefore, the correct answer is:
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
