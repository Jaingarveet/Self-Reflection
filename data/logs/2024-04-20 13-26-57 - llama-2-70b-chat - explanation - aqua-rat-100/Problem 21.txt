Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I misunderstood the problem.
I thought the question was asking for the ratio of work done by x men to work done by y men, but it's actually asking for the ratio of work done by x men in x days to work done by y men in y days.
My mistake was not taking into account the time factor in the problem.
## Assistant 2:
  Action: Answer("D")

Explanation:
The correct answer is D: y2/x2 units.
The problem is asking for the ratio of work done by x men in x days to work done by y men in y days.
Since the number of days is different, we need to use the fact that the work done is directly proportional to the number of days.
So, the ratio of work done by x men in x days to work done by y men in y days is y2/x2.
