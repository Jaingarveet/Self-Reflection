Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Question: Kevin drove from A to B at a constant speed of 70 mph. Once he reached B, he turned right around with pause, and returned to A at a constant speed of 90 mph. Exactly 3 hours before the end of his trip, he was still approaching B, only 70 miles away from it. What is the distance between A and B?
Choices:
  A: 180
  B: 90
  C: 270
  D: 360
  E: None of the above
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I made a mistake in my calculation of the distance traveled by Kevin.
I incorrectly calculated the distance traveled as 420 miles, when in fact it was [REDACTED] miles.
This mistake was due to a misapplication of the formula:

Distance = Time x Speed

I applied this formula incorrectly, using the speed of 70 mph for both the distance traveled to [REDACTED] and the distance traveled back to [REDACTED].
However, the correct speed for the distance traveled back to [REDACTED] should have been [REDACTED] mph.
## Assistant 2:
  Action: Answer("E")

Reflection:
I have reflected on the problem, my previous solution, and the correct answer.
I realized that my mistake was in the calculation of the distance traveled by Kevin.
I incorrectly used the speed of 70 mph for both the distance traveled to B and the distance traveled back to B.
However, the correct speed for the distance traveled back to B should have been 90 mph.
Therefore, the correct answer for the distance between A and B is None of the Above (E).
## Result:
Agent Answer: E
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
