Let's analyze the problem step by step:
1. Each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew.
2. Each son receives five times as much as each nephew.
3. There are 4 daughters and 2 nephews.

Now, let's calculate the total amount each daughter receives:
Total amount = (4/5) x 8600 = 7760

Since each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, each daughter receives 7760/4 = 1940.

Action: Answer("B")
