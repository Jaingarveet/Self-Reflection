## Assistant 2:
  Action: Answer("B")

Explanation:
I made a mistake in my calculation. I misunderstood the question and thought that the number of friends who attended the picnic was x - 4, instead of x.
Let's analyze the problem step by step:
The total amount spent on eatables was Rs. 96.
Since four friends did not turn up, the number of friends who attended the picnic is x - 4.
Each of the remaining friends had to contribute an extra Rs. 4, so the total amount spent by them is (x - 4) x 4 = 4x - 16.
Since the total amount spent on eatables is Rs. 96, we can set up the equation:
4x - 16 = 96
Solving for x, we get:
4x = 96 + 16
4x = 112
x = 112/4
x = 28
Therefore, the number of friends who attended the picnic is 28.
The correct answer is B: 12.
I apologize for my previous mistake and I'm confident in my new answer.
