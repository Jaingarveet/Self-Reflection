Question: X and Y are two alloys which were made by mixing zinc and copper in the ratio 6:9 and 7:11, respectively. If 40 grams of alloy X and 60 grams of alloy Y are melted and mixed to form alloy Z, what is the ratio of zinc and copper in the alloy Z ?
Choices:
  A: 69:91
  B: 59:91
  C: 59:90
  D: 59:91
  E: 69:101

## Assistant 2:
  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that!

Here's my reflection on the previous answer:

"I previously answered this question incorrectly. I made a mistake in my calculation. I misunderstood the question and thought that the ratio of zinc and copper in the resulting alloy Z would be the same as the ratio of zinc and copper in the two alloys X and Y. However, this is not the case. The correct way to approach this problem is to use the weighted average formula to find the ratio of zinc and copper in the resulting alloy Z.

The weighted average formula is:
(Zinc in Z) / (Copper in Z) = (Zinc in X) / (Copper in X) + (Zinc in Y) / (Copper in Y)

Using this formula, we can plug in the values given in the problem:
(Zinc in Z) / (Copper in Z) = (40 grams Zinc in X) / (60 grams Copper in X) + (60 grams Zinc in Y) / (90 grams Copper in Y)

Simplifying and solving for the ratio of zinc and copper in alloy Z, we get:
(Zinc in Z) / (Copper in Z) = 59/91

Therefore, the correct answer is choice B: 59:91."

Now, let's answer the question again using the corrected solution:
