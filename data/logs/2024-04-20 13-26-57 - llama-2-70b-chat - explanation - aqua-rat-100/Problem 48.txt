Explanation:
I made a mistake in my calculation. I misunderstood the question and calculated the percentage of students who are members of both the chess club and the swim team instead of the percentage of students who are members of the swim team.
## Assistant 2:
  Thought: 
Let's say the total number of students at Daifu University is x.
The number of students who are members of both the chess club and the swim team is 24% of x.
The number of students who are not members of the chess club but are members of the swim team is 20% of x.
We need to find the total number of students who are members of the swim team, which is the sum of the two groups mentioned above.

Action: Answer("C") 40%
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
