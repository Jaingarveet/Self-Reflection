## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: Suppose you want to arrange your English, Hindi, Mathematics, History, Geography and Science books on a shelf. In how many ways can you do it ?
Choices:
  A: 520
  B: 720
  C: 920
  D: None
  E: Cannot be determined

Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I misunderstood the formula for calculating permutations.
I used the formula n! (read as n factorial) to calculate the number of ways to arrange the books, but I forgot to account for the fact that the books are distinct objects.
In this case, we have 7 distinct books, and we need to calculate the number of ways to arrange them in a row, taking into account that each book is different from the others.
The correct formula to use in this case is 7! / (7 - 1)!, which is equal to 7! / 6!.
7! / 6! = 7 x 6 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 / 6 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = [REDACTED]
