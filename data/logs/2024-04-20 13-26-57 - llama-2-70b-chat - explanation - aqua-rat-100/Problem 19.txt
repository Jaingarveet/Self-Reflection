Explanation:
I made a mistake in my calculation. I misunderstood the question and calculated the distance traveled by the jeep in the return journey instead of the total distance traveled.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The jeep travels a certain distance taking 6 hours in the forward journey.
2. During the return journey, it increased its speed by 12km/hr and took 4 hours.

We need to find the total distance traveled by the jeep. We can let the distance traveled in the forward journey be x km. Then, the distance traveled in the return journey would be x + 12 km (since the speed is increased by 12 km/hr).

The total distance traveled by the jeep is the sum of the distances traveled in both journeys:
Total distance = x + (x + 12) = 2x + 12

We know that the jeep took 6 hours to travel the distance in the forward journey, so the speed in the forward journey is:
Speed = Distance / Time = x / 6

Similarly, the speed in the return journey is:
Speed = Distance / Time = (x + 12) / 4

Since the jeep travels at a constant speed in both journeys, we can set up the equation:
x / 6 = (x + 12) / 4

Solving for x, we get:
x = 144 km

Therefore, the total distance traveled by the jeep is:
Total distance = 2x + 12 = 2(144) + 12 = 288 km + 12 km = 300 km

The correct answer is B: 144 km.

I hope this explanation helps clarify my mistake and the correct solution to the problem.
