Explanation:
I made a mistake in my calculation. I misunderstood the question and calculated the area of the square instead of the length of each side.
## Assistant 2:
  Thought: 
The wire is bent to form a square, so the length and breadth of the rectangle must be equal.
Let's call the length of each side x.
The area of the rectangle is given by the product of the length and breadth, which is 27 cm x 17 cm = 469 cm^2.
Since the wire is bent to form a square, the area of the square must be equal to the area of the rectangle.
The area of the square is given by x^2, where x is the length of each side.
Equating the two expressions, we get:
x^2 = 469

Now, I'll solve for x:
x = sqrt(469)
x = 21

So, the length of each side of the square is 21 cm.
Action: Answer("E") 31
