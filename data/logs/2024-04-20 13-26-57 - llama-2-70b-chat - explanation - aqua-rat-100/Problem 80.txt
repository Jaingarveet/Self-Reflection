Explanation:
I made a mistake in my calculation. I misunderstood the problem and wrote an incorrect equation.
I incorrectly assumed that the cost of each white sharpeners was 1 rupee more than the cost of each brown sharpeners, when in fact, the cost of each white sharpeners was 1 rupee more than the cost of each brown sharpeners.
## Assistant 2:
  Action: Answer("B")

Explanation:
I made a mistake in my previous answer, and I appreciate the opportunity to correct it.
The correct answer is indeed B: 9,8.
The cost of each white sharpener is 1 rupee more than the cost of each brown sharpener.
Therefore, if Jack paid 100 rupees for 18 sharpeners, he paid 10 rupees for each white sharpener and 9 rupees for each brown sharpener.
So, he bought 9 brown sharpeners and 9 white sharpeners.
I apologize for any confusion caused by my previous response, and I hope this answer is helpful.
