## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Choices:
  A: 50 m
  B: 75 m
  C: 100 m

Explanation:
I made a mistake in my calculation of the length of the space shuttle.
I incorrectly used the formula L = vht, where vh is the horizontal speed and t is the time it takes to pass a point.
Instead, I should have used the formula L = vt, where v is the total speed and t is the time it takes to pass a point.
The total speed of the space shuttle is the square root of the sum of the squares of its horizontal and vertical speeds: v = sqrt(140^2 + 17.5^2) = 195 m/s.
Therefore, the length of the space shuttle is L = 195 m/s x 5 s = 9[REDACTED].

Explanation:
I made a mistake in my calculation of the length of the space shuttle.
I incorrectly used the formula L = vht, where vh is the horizontal speed and t is the time it takes to pass a point.
Instead, I should have used the formula L = vt, where v is the total speed and t is the time it takes to pass a point.
The total speed of the space shuttle is the square root of the sum of the squares of its horizontal and vertical speeds: v = sqrt(140^2 + 17.5^2) = 195 m/s.
Therefore, the length of the space shuttle is L = 195 m/s x 5 s = 97.5 m.
The correct answer is (C) 100 m.
