## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: The greatest common factor of two positive integers is 11. The least common multiple of these two integers is 7700. If one of the integers is 350, what is the other?
Choices:
  A: 242
  B: 308
  C: 352
  D: 412
  E: 456
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I made a mistake in my calculation.
I correctly identified the GCF and LCM of 350 and 7700, but I made a mistake in factoring 7700 to find the other integer.
I mistakenly factored 7700 as 2 x 2 x 5 x 5 x 7, when in reality, it can also be factored as 2 x 3 x 3 x 5 x 7.
This mistake led me to choose [REDACTED] as the other integer, when in reality, it should have been [REDACTED].
## Assistant 2:
  Action: Answer("B")

Explanation:
I have reflected on my previous answer and realized that I made a mistake in my calculation. I correctly identified the GCF and LCM of 350 and 7700, but I made a mistake in factoring 7700 to find the other integer. I mistakenly factored 7700 as 2 x 2 x 5 x 5 x 7, when in reality, it can also be factored as 2 x 3 x 3 x 5 x 7.

Therefore, the other integer is 308, which is the product of 2, 3, and 5.

Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
