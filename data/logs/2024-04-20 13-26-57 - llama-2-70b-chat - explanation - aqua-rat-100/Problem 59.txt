Explanation:
I made a mistake in my calculation of the total number of marbles in the bag.
I incorrectly calculated the number of black marbles in the bag and therefore arrived at the wrong total.

Let's break this down step by step:

1. Initially, there were 20 marbles pulled out of the bag, painted black, and put back in.
2. Then, another 20 marbles were pulled out, and 1 was black.
3. The percentage of black marbles pulled out the second time represents their percentage in the bag.

From step 3, we can infer that the percentage of black marbles in the bag is 1/20 or 5%.

Now, let's calculate the total number of marbles in the bag:

Total number of marbles = Number of black marbles + Number of white marbles

We know that the number of black marbles is 5% of the total number of marbles, so we can calculate it as follows:

Number of black marbles = 5% of total number of marbles

Substituting the value of 5% for the percentage, we get:

Number of black marbles = 5/100 x total number of marbles

Now, we can solve for the total number of marbles:

Total number of marbles = Number of black marbles / 5/100

Simplifying, we get:

Total number of marbles = 100 x Number of black marbles

Since there are 20 black marbles, we can substitute this value:

Total number of marbles = 100 x 20

Total number of marbles = 2000

Therefore, the correct answer is B: 2000.

Action: Answer("B")
