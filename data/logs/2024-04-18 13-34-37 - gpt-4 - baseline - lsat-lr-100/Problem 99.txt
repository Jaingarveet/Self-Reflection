Topic: Law
Context: Professor: It has been argued that freedom of thought is a precondition for intellectual progress, because freedom of thought allows thinkers to pursue their ideas, regardless of whom these ideas offend, in whatever direction they lead. However, it is clear that one must mine the full implications of interrelated ideas to make intellectual progress, and for this, thinkers need intellectual discipline. Therefore, this argument for freedom of thought fails.
Question: The conclusion drawn by the professor follows logically if which one of the following is assumed?
Choices:
  A: Thinkers who limit their line of thought to a particular orthodoxy are hindered in their intellectual progress.
  B: Thinkers can mine the full implications of interrelated ideas only in the context of a society that values intellectual progress.
  C: In societies that protect freedom of thought, thinkers invariably lack intellectual discipline.
  D: Freedom of thought engenders creativity, which aids the discovery of truth.
  E: Without intellectual discipline, thinkers can have no freedom of thought.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The professor's argument is that freedom of thought alone is not sufficient for intellectual progress because thinkers also need intellectual discipline. The assumption that would make this argument logically sound is that in societies that protect freedom of thought, thinkers invariably lack intellectual discipline. This assumption would directly support the professor's conclusion that freedom of thought alone is not enough for intellectual progress.
Action: Answer("C")
