Topic: Law
Context: In a recent study, each member of two groups of people, Group A (composed of persons sixty-five to seventy-five years old) and Group B (composed of college students), was required to make a telephone call to a certain number at a specified time. The time when each call was initiated was recorded electronically. Group A proved far better at remembering to make a telephone call precisely at a specified time than did Group B. There were fourteen lapses in Group B but only one lapse in Group A. Clearly, at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages.
Question: Which one of the following, if all of them are true, is LEAST helpful in establishing that the conclusion above is properly drawn?
Choices:
  A: There was the same number of people in each group.
  B: The same group of researchers answered the calls made by the callers in both study groups.
  C: Among the college students there were no persons more than forty years old.
  D: Both groups had unrestricted access to telephones for making the required calls.
  E: The members of the two groups received their instructions approximately the same amount of time before they were to make their telephone calls.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The conclusion drawn in the context is that at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages. This conclusion is based on the performance of two groups in a memory task. The options that would be helpful in establishing this conclusion would be those that ensure that the conditions for both groups were the same, thereby making the comparison valid. 
Option A: This ensures that the size of the groups did not influence the results. 
Option C: This ensures that there were no older individuals in the college student group that could have skewed the results. 
Option D: This ensures that both groups had the same opportunity to complete the task. 
Option E: This ensures that both groups had the same amount of time to remember the task. 
Option B: The group of researchers answering the calls does not directly impact the memory abilities of the participants. Therefore, this is the least helpful in establishing the conclusion.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
