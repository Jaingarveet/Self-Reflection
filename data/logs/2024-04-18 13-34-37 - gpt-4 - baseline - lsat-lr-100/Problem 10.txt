Context: Mike: Tom did not tell me that I could use his computer, but it would not be wrong for me to use it anyway. Last week Tom used Mary's bicycle even though she had not told him he could use it.
Question: Which one of the following principles, if valid, would most help to justif Y Mike's reasoning?
Choices:
  A: Using the possessions of others without their permission is not always theft.
  B: Generally one should tell the truth, but there are cases in which it is permissible not to.
  C: If people have used your property without your permission, it is not wrong for you to use their property without their permission.
  D: It is permissible to treat people in a way that is siruilar to the way in which they have treated others.
  E: Using another person's property is wrong if the person is harmed by that use.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Mike's reasoning is based on the idea that since Tom used Mary's bicycle without her permission, it is okay for Mike to use Tom's computer without his permission. This reasoning aligns most closely with the principle stated in choice D: "It is permissible to treat people in a way that is similar to the way in which they have treated others."
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
