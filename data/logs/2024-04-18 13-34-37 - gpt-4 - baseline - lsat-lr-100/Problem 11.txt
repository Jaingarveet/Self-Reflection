Topic: Law
Context: To accommodate the personal automobile, houses are built on widely scattered lots far from places of work and shopping malls are equipped with immense parking lots that leave little room for wooded areas. Hence, had people generally not used personal automobiles, the result would have to have been a geography of modern cities quite different from the one we have now.
Question: The argument's reasoning is questionable because the argument
Choices:
  A: infers from the idea that the current geography of modern cities resulted from a particular cause that it could only have resulted from that cause
  B: infers from the idea that the current geography of modern cities resulted from a particular cause that other facets of modern life resulted from that cause
  C: overlooks the fact that many technological innovations other than the personal automobile have had some effect on the way people live
  D: takes for granted that shopping malls do not need large parking lots even given the use of the personal automobile
  E: takes for granted that people ultimately want to live without personal automobiles
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The argument suggests that the widespread use of personal automobiles has shaped the geography of modern cities. It does not consider that other factors could have also contributed to the current city layout. Therefore, the argument is making an assumption that the current city geography could only have resulted from the use of personal automobiles.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
