For example, the colon cancer rate in Western countries is much higher than in many non-Western countries where people eat more fther-rich foods, such as fruits aod vegetables. Furthermore, in Scandinavia it has been conclusively shown that the higher the colon cancer rate in a given area, the lower the consumption in that area of cereals, which, like fruits and vegetables, are high in fther. All of this shows that insufficient consumption of fther causes colon cancer, and sufficient consumption of fther prevents it.
