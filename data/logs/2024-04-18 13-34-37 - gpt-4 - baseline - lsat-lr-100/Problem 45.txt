Context: Art critic: The Woerner Journalism Award for criticism was given to Nan Paulsen for her reviews of automobiles. This is inappropriate. The criticism award should be given for criticism, which Paulsen's reviews clearly were not. After alL cars are utilitarian things, not works of art. And objects that are not works of art do not reveal important truths about the culture that produced them.
Question: Which one of the following principles, if valid, most helps to justiJY the reasoning in the art critic's argument?
Choices:
  A: The Woemer Journalism Award for criticism should not be given to a writer who portrays utilitarian objects as works of art.
  B: Reviews of objects cannot appropriately be considered to be criticism unless the objects reveal important truths about the culture that produced them.
  C: Unless a review is written for the purpose of revealing important truths about the writer's culture, that review should not be considered to be criticism.
  D: The Woerner JournalismAward for criticism should not be given to writers who do not consider themselves to be critics.
  E: All writing that reveals important truths about a culture should be considered to be criticism.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The art critic's argument is based on the idea that criticism should be about works of art that reveal important truths about the culture that produced them. This aligns most closely with choice B, which states that reviews of objects cannot be considered criticism unless the objects reveal important truths about the culture that produced them.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
