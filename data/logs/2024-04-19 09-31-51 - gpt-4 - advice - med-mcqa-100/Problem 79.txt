## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The average gain in length for a child in 4 years is approximately 20 cm per year for the first year, and then slows to about 12.5 cm per year for the next three years. Therefore, the total gain in length over 4 years would be approximately 20 cm + 3*12.5 cm = 57.5 cm. The closest answer to this is 50 cm.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
