## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
An unstable lie refers to a situation where the baby's position in the womb changes frequently. This can be due to several reasons. Oligohydramnios (A) refers to a condition where there is less amniotic fluid around the baby in the womb, which can cause the baby to move around more. A pelvic tumor (C) or uterine anomalies (D) could also potentially cause an unstable lie by altering the shape or size of the uterus. Placenta Previa (B) is a condition where the placenta covers the cervix, but it doesn't typically cause an unstable lie. 
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
