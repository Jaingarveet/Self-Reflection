## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Post-radiation skin lesions like desquamation are typically managed conservatively. The goal is to keep the area clean and moisturized to promote healing. Petroleum jellies are often used for this purpose. Observation alone may not be sufficient, especially if the patient is experiencing discomfort. Surgery is not typically the first line of treatment for these lesions. Antibiotic coverage may be necessary if there is a secondary infection, but it is not the primary treatment for the lesion itself.
Action: Answer("A")
