- Remember that not all investigations are equally useful for all conditions.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Spondylolisthesis is a condition where one vertebra slips forward over the one below it. It is diagnosed and evaluated using imaging studies. Anteroposterior and lateral view X-rays can show the alignment of the vertebrae and the degree of slippage. CT and MRI can provide more detailed images of the spine and can show if there are any nerve roots being compressed. Therefore, all the options listed are useful investigations for Spondylolisthesis. However, the question asks for the investigation that is NOT useful, which is not applicable in this case as all the options are useful. 
Action: This question seems to have an error as all the options provided are useful investigations for Spondylolisthesis.
