## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Senescent RBCs are old red blood cells. In the context of malaria, different species of Plasmodium (the parasite that causes malaria) have preferences for different stages of red blood cells. Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium ovale prefer to infect young red blood cells, while Plasmodium malariae (which causes Quartan malaria) is known to prefer older, senescent red blood cells.
