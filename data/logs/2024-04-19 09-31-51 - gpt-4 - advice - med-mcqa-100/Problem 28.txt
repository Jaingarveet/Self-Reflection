Islet cell transplantation for Diabetes mellitus involves transplanting islet cells into the liver of the patient. However, the cells are not directly placed into the liver tissue. Instead, they are injected into the portal vein, which carries them to the liver. So, the site of transplantation is the portal vein, not the liver itself.
