## System:
You are an expert in Logic.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:
Topic: Geography
Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Logic
Context: A laboratory has three types of robots, A.B, and C.Type A can recognize colors, type B can recognize shapes, and type C can neither recognize colors nor shapes.The laboratory experimented with robots 1 and 2 with red balls, blue balls, red squares, and blue squares, and ordered them to pick up the red balls, but number 1 picked up the red squares, and number 2 picked up the blue balls.
Question: Based on the above experiment, which of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Both No.1 and No.2 are type C.
  B: Only one of No.1 and No.2 is C type.
  C: No.1 is type A and No.2 is type B.
  D: No.1 is not Type B and No.2 is not Type A.

Explanation:
I made an error in my reasoning about the robot types based on their behavior in the experiment. I incorrectly assumed that picking up the wrong objects meant the robots could recognize either color or shape, when in fact it could also mean they recognize neither.
## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. Robot 1 picked up the red squares instead of the red balls. This means it cannot distinguish shapes (not type B). It either recognizes color (type A) or neither color nor shape (type C).
2. Robot 2 picked up the blue balls instead of the red balls. This means it cannot distinguish colors (not type A). It either recognizes shape (type B) or neither color nor shape (type C). 
3. If Robot 1 was type A, it would have picked up the red balls correctly. Since it didn't, it must be type C.
4. Similarly, if Robot 2 was type B, it would have picked up the red balls (the correct shape). Since it didn't, it must also be type C.
5. Therefore, the only possibility consistent with the experiment results is that both Robot 1 and Robot 2 are type C - they can recognize neither color nor shape.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
