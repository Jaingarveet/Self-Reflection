Topic: Logic
Context: The football game in the "Master Cup 2003 China Robot Competition" is in progress.Three professors predicted the final result? Professor Zhao said? "The champion is not the Tsinghua University team nor the Zhejiang University team." Professor Qian said ? "The champion is not the Tsinghua University team, but the University of Science and Technology of China." Professor Sun said? "The champion is not the China University of Science and Technology team, but the Tsinghua University team.The results of the competition showed that only one of them judged both, one 'S judgment is one-to-one wrong, the other one is wrong.
Question: According to the above situation, we know that the winner is
Choices:
  A: Tsinghua University Team
  B: China University of Science and Technology Team
  C: Zhejiang University Team
  D: Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I made an error in my logical reasoning. I correctly identified that only one professor could be fully correct, one half correct, and one fully incorrect. However, I incorrectly concluded that Professor Qian's statement was the only one consistent with this constraint. In fact, Professor Sun's statement is the only one that fits.
## Assistant 2:
Thought process:
Based on the problem statement, we know:
- Only one professor judged both statements correctly
- One professor got one statement right and one wrong
- One professor got both statements wrong
Looking at each professor's statements:
Prof Zhao: "The champion is not Tsinghua nor Zhejiang" 
- This implies the champion is either USTC or another team. 
Prof Qian: "The champion is not Tsinghua, but USTC"
- This directly states USTC is the champion.
Prof Sun: "The champion is not USTC, but Tsinghua" 
- This directly states Tsinghua is the champion.
If Prof Sun is correct (Tsinghua wins):
- Prof Zhao is half correct (Tsinghua didn't win, but he's wrong about Zhejiang)  
- Prof Qian is fully incorrect
This matches the criteria of the problem.
The other scenarios don't work:
If Prof Qian is correct (USTC wins), the other two are both fully wrong.
If Prof Zhao is correct (not Tsinghua or Zhejiang), the other two are both fully wrong.
If another team wins, all three are wrong.
Therefore, the only possibility is that Prof Sun's statement is fully correct and Tsinghua University is the champion.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
