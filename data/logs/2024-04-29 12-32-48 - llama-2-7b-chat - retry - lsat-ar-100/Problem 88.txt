Question: It is fully determined which of the shelves each of the books is placed on if which one of the following is true?

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly. Upon reflection, I realized that I made a mistake in my reasoning. I will use my self-reflection to help me answer this question correctly.

The correct answer is (D) M and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.

Explanation:
From the given conditions, we know that I is placed on the middle shelf, and K is placed on a higher shelf than F. We also know that O is placed on a higher shelf than L.

If M and H are placed on the same shelf, then we can determine which shelf each book is placed on. For example, if M is placed on the top shelf and H is placed on the middle shelf, then the books on the bottom shelf would be F, L, K, and O.

Therefore, the answer is (D) M and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.
