Question: If exactly three of the students review Undulation, which one of the following could be true?

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I will use my self-reflection to help me answer it correctly this time.

From the given information, we know that Kramer and Lopez each review fewer plays than Megregian. Therefore, we can conclude that either Kramer or Lopez reviews Undulation.

Option A is incorrect because Megregian does review Undulation.
Option B is incorrect because O'Neill does review Undulation.
Option C is correct because Jiang reviews Undulation.
Option D is incorrect because Lopez does not review Tamerlane.
Option E is incorrect because O'Neill does not review Sunset.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) Jiang reviews Undulation.
