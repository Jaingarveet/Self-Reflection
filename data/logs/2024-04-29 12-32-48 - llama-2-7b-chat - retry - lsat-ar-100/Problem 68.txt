  Topic: Law
Question: If J is third, which one of the following could be true?

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly. Upon reviewing my solution, I realized that I made a mistake in my reasoning. I will use my self-reflection to help me answer this question correctly.

The correct answer is (D) S is second.

Explanation:
If J is third, then the order of the articles is:

J, Q, R, S, G, H, Y

Since S is earlier than Y, we know that S must be second in the list. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) S is second.
