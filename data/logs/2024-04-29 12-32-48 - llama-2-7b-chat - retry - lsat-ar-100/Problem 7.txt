## Assistant 2:
  Topic: Law
Question: If Jackson is the only witness scheduled to testify on Monday, which one of the following must be true of the schedule?

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly. Upon reviewing my solution, I realized that I made a mistake in my reasoning. I will use my self-reflection to help me answer this question correctly.

From the given conditions, we can deduce that Franco does not testify on the same day as Garcia. This means that Franco cannot testify on Tuesday, as Garcia testifies on that day.

Hong does not testify on Monday, so Hong must testify on Tuesday or Wednesday. Since Jackson is the only witness scheduled to testify on Monday, it must be true that Hong testifies on the same day as Jackson.

Therefore, the correct answer is (E) Garcia is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong.
