Context: A software company employs exactly seven sales representatives—Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall—to work in its three sales zones—Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3. Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.

There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

## Assistant 2:
  Topic: Law
Question: If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then which one of the following could be true?

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly. Upon reviewing my solution, I realized that I made a mistake in my reasoning. I will now use my self-reflection to answer the question correctly.

From the given conditions, we can deduce that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, the statement "C: Parra works in Zone 3" cannot be true.

We also know that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Since Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other, it means that Parra must work in Zone 1.

Now, we are left with the following options:

A: Kim works in Zone 2. [REDACTED]
B: Mahr works in Zone 1. [REDACTED]
C: Parra works in Zone 3. [REDACTED]
D: Stuckey works in Zone 2. [REDACTED]
E: Tiao works in Zone 1. [REDACTED]

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) Mahr works in Zone 1.
