The following conditions must apply: Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.

Question: If Jiang does not review Tamerlane, then which one of the following must be true?

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly. Upon reviewing my solution, I realized that I made a mistake in my reasoning. I will now use my self-reflection to help me answer the question correctly.

From the given conditions, we can deduce that:

1. Kramer and Lopez each review fewer plays than Megregian.
2. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play that Jiang reviews.
3. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.

Now, let's analyze the possible combinations of plays that Jiang could review:

1. Jiang does not review Tamerlane, so he must review either Sunset or Undulation.
2. If Jiang reviews Sunset, then Lopez must review Undulation, as neither of them reviews Tamerlane.
3. If Jiang reviews Undulation, then Megregian must review Tamerlane, as neither of them reviews Sunset.

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) Megregian reviews Tamerlane.
## Result:
Agent Answer: None
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
