Context: A shopping center has exactly seven spaces—space 1 through space 7—arranged in a straight row. Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.

Question: If the shoe store is in space 4, which one of the following must be true?

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly. Upon reviewing my solution and the correct answer, I realized that I made a mistake in my reasoning.

To solve this problem, we need to use the constraints provided in the question. The pharmacy must be at one end of the row, and one of the restaurants must be at the other end. This means that the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.

If the shoe store is in space 4, then the restaurants must be separated by at least three other businesses. This means that the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, as it would be in the same row as one of the restaurants.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) A restaurant is next to the toy store.
