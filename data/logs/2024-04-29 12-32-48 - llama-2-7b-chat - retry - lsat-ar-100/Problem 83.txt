Question: If Julio and Kevin both lead morning sessions, then any of the following could be true EXCEPT:

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly. Upon reviewing my solution, I realized that I made a mistake in my reasoning. I incorrectly assumed that Lan's session would meet on the same day as Julio and Kevin's sessions, when in fact, Lan's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's session. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) Olivia's session meets Thursday morning.

Action: Answer("D")
