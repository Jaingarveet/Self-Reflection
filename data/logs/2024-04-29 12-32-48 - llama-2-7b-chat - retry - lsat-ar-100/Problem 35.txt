Question: If one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, then which one of the following could be false?

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly. Upon reviewing my solution, I realized that I made a mistake in my reasoning. I incorrectly assumed that the conditions given in the problem were mutually exclusive, when in fact, they are not.

To answer the question correctly, I will use the information provided in the problem:

* No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
* At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
* The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
* The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.

From these conditions, we can deduce that:

* At least one batch of cookies is made on each of the five days (Monday to Friday).
* Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday (since at least one batch is made on Monday and no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day).
* Exactly two batches of cookies are made on Wednesday (since at least two batches of cookies are made on Wednesday and no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day).

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) Exactly two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday.
## Result:
