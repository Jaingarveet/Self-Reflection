Context: On the first day of a two-day study for a cycling magazine, four riders—Reynaldo, Seamus, Theresa, and Yuki—will each test one of four bicycles—F, G, H, and J. Each rider will then test a different one of the bicycles on the second day. Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day. The assignment of riders to bicycles is subject to the following conditions: Reynaldo cannot test F. Yuki cannot test J. Theresa must be one of the testers for H. The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
Question: If Theresa tests G on the second day, then which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Reynaldo tests H on the first day.
  B: Reynaldo tests J on the first day.
  C: Theresa tests H on the second day.
  D: Theresa tests J on the first day.
  E: Yuki tests H on the second day.

Question: If Theresa tests G on the second day, then which one of the following must be true?

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly. Upon reviewing my solution, I realized that I made a mistake in my reasoning. I will now use my self-reflection to help me answer the question correctly.

From the given conditions, we can deduce the following:

1. Reynaldo cannot test F, so he must test a different bicycle.
2. Yuki cannot test J, so he must test a different bicycle on the first day.
3. Theresa must be one of the testers for H, so she must test either H or J on the second day.

Now, let's consider the possible combinations of bicycles that each rider can test:

Day 1:

* Reynaldo: F, G, H, or J
* Yuki: F, G, H, or J
* Theresa: H or J

Day 2:

* Reynaldo: H or J
* Yuki: H or J
* Theresa: G or J

From the above combinations, we can see that if Theresa tests G on the second day, then the only possible combination is:

Day 1:

* Reynaldo: F
* Yuki: G
* Theresa: H

Day 2:

* Reynaldo: J
* Yuki: H
* Theresa: G

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) Theresa tests J on the first day.
