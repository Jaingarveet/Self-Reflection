Question: If four of the scientists selected are F, L, Q, and R, which one of the following must be the fifth scientist selected?

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand the mistake now. Let's analyze the problem again:

The conditions for selection are:

1. The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types (botanist, chemist, and zoologist).
2. If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
3. K and M cannot both be selected.
4. If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.

From the given options, the only possible combination that satisfies all the conditions is:

F, L, Q, R, and P

Therefore, the fifth scientist selected must be P.

Action: Answer("E")
