Question: The organizer must at least select

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I have reflected on my solution and the correct answer.

To solve this problem, I will use the given constraints to determine the minimum number of works the organizer must select.

1. No more than four French works are selected, so the organizer must select at least five works.
2. At least three but no more than four novels are selected, so the organizer must select either three novels or four novels.
3. At least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected, so if the organizer selects three novels, they must select at least two Russian novels.
4. If both French plays are selected, then the Russian play is not selected, so the organizer must select either one French play or one Russian play.

Based on these constraints, the organizer must select at least the following works:

* One French novel
* One French play (if both French plays are selected)
* Two Russian novels (if the organizer selects three novels)

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) one Russian novel and one French play.
