Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
The ages of the members are in an arithmetic progression ([REDACTED].P.) with a common difference of 3 months (or 1/4 year).
The youngest member is 7 years old, so the first term (a) of the [REDACTED].P. is 7.
The sum of the ages of all the members is [REDACTED]0 years.
To find the number of members (n), we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic progression:
Sum = n * (2a + (n - 1) * d) / 2
where Sum is the sum of the ages ([REDACTED]0), a is the first term (7), d is the common difference (1/4), and n is the number of terms (members).
We can rearrange the formula to solve for n:
n = (Sum * 2) / (2a + (n - 1) * d)
Substituting the given values:
n = ([REDACTED]0 * 2) / (2 * 7 + (n - 1) * 1/4)
We can simplify and solve for n:
n = 500 / (14 + (n - 1) * 1/4)
n = 500 / (14 + n/4 - 1/4)
n = 500 / (13 + n/4)
4n = [REDACTED]00 / (13 + n/4)
4n(13 + n/4) = [REDACTED]00
52n + n^2 = [REDACTED]00
n^2 + 52n - [REDACTED]00 = 0
Factoring the quadratic equation:
(n - [REDACTED])(n + 80) = 0
The possible values for n are [REDACTED] and -80. Since the number of members cannot be negative, the number of members is [REDACTED].

The youngest member is 7 years old, so the first term (a) of the A.P. is 7.

To find the number of members (n), we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic progression:

We can rearrange the formula to solve for n:
n = (Sum * 2) / (2a + (n - 1) * d)
Substituting the given values:
n = (250 * 2) / (2 * 7 + (n - 1) * 1/4)
We can simplify and solve for n:
n = 500 / (14 + (n - 1) * 1/4)
n = 500 / (14 + n/4 - 1/4)
n = 500 / (13 + n/4)
4n = 2000 / (13 + n/4)
4n(13 + n/4) = 2000
52n + n^2 = 2000
n^2 + 52n - 2000 = 0
Factoring the quadratic equation:
(n - 20)(n + 80) = 0
The possible values for n are 20 and -80. Since the number of members cannot be negative, the number of members is 20.
