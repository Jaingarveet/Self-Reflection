You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
The initial ratio of boys to girls is 64:40, which simplifies to 4:2.5.
The new ratio of boys to girls is 4:3.
Let x be the number of boys and girls who joined the group.
Since the same number of boys and girls joined the group, the number of boys who joined is x and the number of girls who joined is also x.
The new number of boys is 64 + x and the new number of girls is 40 + x.
The new ratio can be written as (64 + x)/(40 + x) = 4/3.
Solving for x, we get x = 24.
So, 24 boys and 24 girls joined the group.
The total number of members now is 64 + 40 + 24 + 24 = [REDACTED].

So, 24 boys and 24 girls joined the group.
The total number of members now is 64 + 40 + 24 + 24 = 152.
Action: Answer("E") (since 152 is not an option, the closest option is 168, which is choice E)

Reflection:
I made an error in my previous calculation of the total number of members. I added the initial number of boys and girls twice, which resulted in an incorrect total. To avoid this mistake in the future, I will double-check my calculations and make sure I am adding the correct numbers. Additionally, I will make sure to carefully read the question and understand the given options before selecting an answer.
## Result:
