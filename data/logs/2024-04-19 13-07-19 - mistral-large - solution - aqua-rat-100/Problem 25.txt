Question: A car is being driven, in a straight line and at a uniform speed, towards the base of a vertical tower. The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower?
Choices:
  A: 5(√3 + 1)
  B: 6(√3 + √2)

## Assistant 2:
Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly by not considering the relationship between the angles of elevation and the distance traveled by the car.

To solve this problem, I need to use trigonometry and the properties of similar triangles.

Let's denote the height of the tower as h, the initial distance from the car to the tower as d1, and the distance from the car to the tower when the angle of elevation is 60° as d2.

Since the angle of elevation changes from 45° to 60° in 10 minutes, we can write the following equations using the tangent function:

tan(45°) = h/d1
tan(60°) = h/(d1 - d), where d is the distance traveled by the car in 10 minutes.

We can simplify these equations as follows:

d1 = h
d1 - d = h/√3

Subtracting the second equation from the first, we get:

d = h - h/√3 = h(1 - 1/√3) = h(√3 - 1)/√3

Now, we need to find the time it takes for the car to travel the remaining distance d2, which is equal to d1 - d = h/√3.

Since the car is traveling at a uniform speed, we can write the following proportion:

d/10 = d2/t, where t is the time it takes for the car to travel the remaining distance d2.

Solving for t, we get:

t = 10 \* d2/d = 10 \* (h/√3) / (h(√3 - 1)/√3) = 10 \* √3 / (√3 - 1) = 5(√3 + 1)
