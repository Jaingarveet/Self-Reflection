## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
To find the least possible number of students in the school, we need to find the smallest number that satisfies both percentages.
20% of the students took physics, so the number of students must be a multiple of 5 (since 20% is equivalent to 1/5).
28% of the students took math, so the number of students must be a multiple of 7 (since 28% is equivalent to 2/7).
The smallest number that is a multiple of both 5 and 7 is 35.
However, the question states that there are more than 501 students in the school.
Therefore, the least possible number of students in the school is 525 (which is a multiple of both 5 and 7 and greater than 501).
## Assistant 2:
Reflection:
I made an error in my previous response by not considering the condition that there are more than 501 students in the school.

Solution:
To find the least possible number of students in the school, we need to find the smallest number that satisfies both percentages and is greater than 501.
20% of the students took physics, so the number of students must be a multiple of 5 (since 20% is equivalent to 1/5).
28% of the students took math, so the number of students must be a multiple of 7 (since 28% is equivalent to 2/7).
The smallest number that is a multiple of both 5 and 7 and greater than 501 is 700.
