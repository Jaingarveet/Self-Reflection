## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Topic: Math
Question: Points A, B, C, D lie in this order on the circumference of a circle. Minor arc AC is 160°, and minor arc BD is 150°. If B bisects minor arc AC, then what is the measure of minor arc AD?
Choices:
  A: 80°
  B: 130°
  C: 140°
  D: 160°
  E: 220°

Solution:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
Iowa State University is located in the state of Iowa.
The city name "Ames" contains 4 letters.
The state name "Iowa" contains 4 letters.
The product of 4*4 is 16.
## Assistant 2:
Reflection:
The previous answer was incorrect because it was not related to the given question. The question is about the measure of a minor arc in a circle, not about the location of a university or the number of letters in a city or state name.

Thought:
Since B bisects minor arc AC, minor arc AB and minor arc BC are equal. Minor arc AC is given as 160°, so minor arc AB and minor arc BC are each 80°. Minor arc BD is given as 150°, so minor arc AD is equal to minor arc AB + minor arc BD = 80° + 150° = 230°. However, this is the measure of the major arc AD. To find the measure of the minor arc AD, we subtract the measure of the major arc AD from 360°: 360° - 230° = 130°.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
