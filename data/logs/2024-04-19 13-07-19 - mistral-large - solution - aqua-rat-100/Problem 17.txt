The city name "Ames" contains 4 letters.
The state name "Iowa" contains 4 letters.
The product of 4*4 is 16.
## Assistant 2:
Reflection:
The previous question was about geography, and I incorrectly answered it by confusing the capital of Maryland with the location of Johns Hopkins University. However, this question is about math, and the previous reflection is not relevant to this question.

Thought:
To find the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee a yearly profit of at least $626,400, we need to first calculate the total production cost for the year. The company produces 420 units per month, and the production cost per unit is $110. Therefore, the monthly production cost is 420 \* $110 = $46,200. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total production cost for the year is $46,200 \* 12 = $554,400.

To guarantee a yearly profit of at least $626,400, the total revenue from sales must be at least $554,400 + $626,400 = $1,180,800. The company sells 420 units per month, so the total number of units sold in a year is 420 \* 12 = 5,040. Therefore, the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee a yearly profit of at least $626,400 is $1,180,800 / 5,040 = $234.

However, the closest answer choice to $234 is $240.

Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: B
