Context: In studying the autobiographies of Native Americans, most scholars have focused on as-told-to life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators—that emerged from "bicultural composite authorship." Limiting their studies to such written documents, these scholars have overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history. In addition, they have failed to address the cultural constructs of the highly diverse Native American peoples, who prior to contact with nonindigenous cultures did not share with Europeans the same assumptions about self, life, and writing that underlie the concept of an autobiography— that indeed constitute the English word's root meaning. The idea of self was, in a number of pre-contact Native American cultures, markedly inclusive: identity was not merely individual, but also relational to a society, a specific landscape, and the cosmos. Within these cultures, the expression of life experiences tended to be oriented toward current events: with the participation of fellow tribal members, an individual person would articulate, reenact, or record important experiences as the person lived them, a mode of autobiography seemingly more fragmented than the European custom of writing down the recollections of a lifetime. Moreover, expression itself was not a matter of writing but of language, which can include speech and signs. Oral autobiography comprised songs, chants, stories, and even the process whereby one repeatedly took on new names to reflect important events and deeds in one's life. Dance and drama could convey personal history; for example, the advent of a vision to one person might require the enactment of that vision in the form of a tribal pageant. One can view as autobiographical the elaborate tattoos that symbolized a warrior's valorous deeds, and such artifacts as a decorated shield that communicated the accomplishments and aspirations of its maker, or a robe that was emblazoned with the pictographic history of the wearer's battles and was sometimes used in reenactments. Also autobiographical, and indicative of high status within the tribe, would have been a tepee painted with symbolic designs to record the achievements and display the dreams or visions of its owner, who was often assisted in the painting by other tribal members. A tribe would, then, have contributed to the individual's narrative not merely passively, by its social codes and expectations, but actively by joining in the expression of that narrative. Such intercultural collaboration may seem alien to the European style of autobiography, yet any autobiography is shaped by its creator's ideas about the audience for which it is intended; in this sense, autobiography is justly called a simultaneous individual story and cultural narrative. Autobiographical expressions by early Native Americans may additionally have been shaped by the cultural perspectives of the people who transmitted them.

Explanation: I misinterpreted the meaning of "bicultural composite authorship." I focused too narrowly on the editing and revision aspects and overlooked the oral communication and collaboration mentioned in the passage. 

Error Keywords: 
- Misinterpretation

- Insufficient analysis

Solution: 
The phrase "bicultural composite authorship" refers to the collaboration between Native Americans and non-Native Americans in creating autobiographies. It involves the oral communication of personal stories and the cultural context of self and identity. 

Choice A is incorrect because it mentions artifacts and oral traditions, which are not specifically part of the authorship process described. 

Choice B is incorrect because it suggests equal contribution from two individuals, which is not the case. The process involves multiple cultural perspectives, but the focus is on the collaboration between Native Americans and non-Native Americans. 

Choice C is incorrect because it emphasizes the anonymity of the writers rather than the cultural collaboration. 

Choice D is incorrect. While it mentions editing and revision, it does not capture the oral communication aspect, which is central to the concept of "bicultural composite authorship." 

Choice E is correct. It accurately conveys the collaboration between individuals from different cultures, with one culture providing the oral communication and the other contributing to the written form.
