Topic: Law
Context: Professor: It has been argued that freedom of thought is a precondition for intellectual progress, because freedom of thought allows thinkers to pursue their ideas, regardless of whom these ideas offend, in whatever direction they lead. However, it is clear that one must mine the full implications of interrelated ideas to make intellectual progress, and for this, thinkers need intellectual discipline. Therefore, this argument for freedom of thought fails.
Question: The conclusion drawn by the professor follows logically if which one of the following is assumed?
Choices:
  A: Thinkers who limit their line of thought to a particular orthodoxy are hindered in their intellectual progress.
  B: Thinkers can mine the full implications of interrelated ideas only in the context of a society that values intellectual progress.
  C: In societies that protect freedom of thought, thinkers invariably lack intellectual discipline.
  D: Freedom of thought engenders creativity, which aids the discovery of truth.
  E: Without intellectual discipline, thinkers can have no freedom of thought.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The professor argues that freedom of thought is not enough for intellectual progress, and that intellectual discipline is also necessary. The professor's conclusion is that the argument for freedom of thought fails because it does not take into account the need for intellectual discipline.

To make the professor's conclusion follow logically, we need to assume that intellectual discipline is incompatible with freedom of thought. This is because the professor's argument is that freedom of thought is not enough for intellectual progress, and that intellectual discipline is also necessary. If intellectual discipline is compatible with freedom of thought, then the argument for freedom of thought would not necessarily fail.

Choice E assumes that intellectual discipline is necessary for freedom of thought, which is the opposite of what we need to assume to make the professor's conclusion follow logically. Choice D assumes that freedom of thought leads to creativity, which is not necessarily incompatible with intellectual discipline. Choice B assumes that intellectual progress can only occur in a society that values it, which is not necessarily incompatible with freedom of thought. Choice A assumes that limiting one's line of thought hinders intellectual progress, which is not necessarily incompatible with freedom of thought.

Choice C assumes that thinkers in societies that protect freedom of thought invariably lack intellectual discipline, which is what we need to assume to make the professor's conclusion follow logically.
