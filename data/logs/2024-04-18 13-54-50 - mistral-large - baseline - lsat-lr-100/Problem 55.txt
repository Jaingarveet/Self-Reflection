Topic: Law
Context: Ethicist: Only when we know a lot about the events that led to an action are we justified in praising or blaming a person for that actionâ€”as we sometimes are. We must therefore reject Tolstoy's rash claim that if we knew a lot about the events leading up to any action, we would cease to regard that action as freely performed.
Question: Which one of the following, if assumed, enables the conclusion of the ethicist's argument to be properly drawn?
Choices:
  A: People should not be regarded as subject to praise or blame for actions that were caused by conditions beyond their control.
  B: Whether an act is one for which the person doing it is genuinely responsible is not determined by how much information others possess about that act.
  C: We can be justified in praising or blaming a person for an action only when we regard that action as freely performed.
  D: The responsibility a person bears for an action is not a matter of degree; however, our inclination to blame or praise whoever performed the action varies with the amount of information available.
  E: If we do not know much about the events leading up to any given action, we will regard that action as freely performed.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The ethicist's argument is that we can only praise or blame a person for an action if we know a lot about the events that led to it. The conclusion is that we must reject Tolstoy's claim that if we knew a lot about the events leading up to any action, we would cease to regard that action as freely performed.

To properly draw this conclusion, we need to assume that knowing a lot about the events leading up to an action does not necessarily mean that we would cease to regard that action as freely performed. Instead, it would allow us to determine whether the action was freely performed and, therefore, whether the person is responsible for it.

Choice C aligns with this assumption, as it states that we can only praise or blame a person for an action if we regard it as freely performed. This implies that knowing a lot about the events leading up to an action would allow us to determine whether it was freely performed, rather than necessarily leading us to regard it as not freely performed.

Action: Answer("C")
