Context: People who are allergic to cats are actually allergic to certain proteins found in the animals' skin secretions and saliva; which particular proteins are responsible, however, varies from allergy sufferer to allergy sufferer. Since all cats shed skin and spread saliva around their environment, there is no such thing as a cat incapable of provoking allergic reactions, although it is common for a given cat to cause an allergic reaction in some-but not all-people who are allergic to cats.
Question: Which one of the following statements is most strongly supported by the information above?
Choices:
  A: Any particular individual will be allergic to some breeds of cat but not to others.
  B: No cat is capable of causing an allergic reaction in all types of allergy sufferers.
  C: Not all cats are identical with respect to the proteins contained in their skin secretions and saliva.
  D: The allergic reactions of some people who are allergic to cats are more intense than the allergic reactions of other allergy sufferers.
  E: There is no way to predict whether a given cat will produce an allergic reaction in a particular allergy sufferer.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The information provided states that different allergy sufferers are allergic to different proteins found in cats' skin secretions and saliva. It also states that all cats shed skin and spread saliva around their environment, so there is no such thing as a cat incapable of provoking allergic reactions. However, it is common for a given cat to cause an allergic reaction in some-but not all-people who are allergic to cats.

Based on this information, we can infer that no cat is capable of causing an allergic reaction in all types of allergy sufferers, since different allergy sufferers are allergic to different proteins. We can also infer that not all cats are identical with respect to the proteins contained in their skin secretions and saliva, since some cats may cause an allergic reaction in some allergy sufferers but not in others. However, we cannot infer that any particular individual will be allergic to some breeds of cat but not to others, since the information does not mention breeds specifically. We also cannot infer that the allergic reactions of some people who are allergic to cats are more intense than the allergic reactions of other allergy sufferers, since the information does not mention the intensity of allergic reactions. Finally, we cannot infer that there is no way to predict whether a given cat will produce an allergic reaction in a particular allergy sufferer, since the information does not mention prediction specifically.
