Topic: Law
Context: Only a minority of those who engage in political action do so out of a sense of social justice. Therefore, some people who have a sense of social justice do not engage in political action.
Question: Which one of the following uses flawed reasoning most similar to that used in the argument above?
Choices:
  A: Most scholars are not motivated by a desire to win prestigious academic prizes. Thus, some of those who want to win prestigious academic prizes are not scholars.
  B: Only foolish politicians disregard the wishes of most voters. Thus, most voters deserve to be represented by foolish politicians.
  C: Some corporations only feign a concern for the environment when they advertise a product as environmentally friendly. Thus, no corporation has a genuine concern for the environment.
  D: Some parents show no interest in the curricula used in the schools that their children attend. Thus, some of the decisions regarding school curricula should be made without regard for the wishes of the children's parents.
  E: Only a small percentage of the profits that companies make are directly attributable to good management decisions. Thus, even companies that are managed badly will usually turn a profit.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The flawed reasoning in the original argument is that it assumes that because a minority of people who engage in political action do so out of a sense of social justice, some people who have a sense of social justice do not engage in political action. This is a fallacy of the undistributed middle, where the argument assumes that because one group (those who engage in political action out of a sense of social justice) is a subset of another group (those who engage in political action), some members of the larger group must not belong to the smaller group.

Choice A uses similar flawed reasoning. It assumes that because most scholars are not motivated by a desire to win prestigious academic prizes, some of those who want to win prestigious academic prizes are not scholars. This is also a fallacy of the undistributed middle.

Choices B, C, D, and E do not use similar flawed reasoning.

Action: Answer("A")

Agent Answer: A
