Context: Teacher: Participating in organized competitive athletics may increase a child's strength and coordination. As critics point out, however, it also instills in those children who are not already well developed in these respects a feeling of inferiority that never really disappears. Yet, since research has shown that adults with feelings of inferiority become more successful than those free of such anxieties, funding for children's athletic programs should not be eliminated.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes the role played in the teacher's argument by the assertion that participating in organized competitive athletics may increase a child's strength and coordination?
Choices:
  A: It is mentioned as one possible reason for adopting a policy for which the teacher suggests an additional reason.
  B: It is a claim that the teacher attempts to refute with counterarguments.
  C: It is a hypothesis for which the teacher offers additional evidence.
  D: It is cited as an insufficient reason for eliminating funding for children's athletic programs.
  E: It is cited as an objection that has been raised to the position that the teacher is supporting.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The teacher's argument is that funding for children's athletic programs should not be eliminated, despite the fact that it may instill feelings of inferiority in some children. The assertion that participating in organized competitive athletics may increase a child's strength and coordination is mentioned as a possible benefit of such programs, but it is not the primary reason given for supporting them.
Action: Answer("A")
