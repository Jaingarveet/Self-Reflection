# Model: gemini-1.5-pro-preview-0409 | Agent: instructions | Exam: sat-math-100 | Problem 35 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:
Topic: Geography
Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: $$\sqrt{4 x}=x-3$$What are all values of $x$ that satisfy the given equation?I. 1II. 9
Choices:
  A: I only
  B: II only
  C: I and II
  D: Neither I nor II
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Solve the equation algebraically, keeping in mind that squaring both sides might introduce extraneous solutions.
2. Once you have potential solutions, substitute each one back into the original equation.
3. Verify if the equation holds true for each potential solution.
4. Discard any solution that does not satisfy the original equation.
5. Select the answer choice that includes only the valid solutions.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Following the instructions:
1. **Solve algebraically:**
Squaring both sides: $(\sqrt{4x})^2 = (x-3)^2$
This simplifies to: $4x = x^2 - 6x + 9$
Rearranging: $x^2 - 10x + 9 = 0$
Factoring: $(x-1)(x-9) = 0$
Potential solutions: $x=1$ and $x=9$
2. **Substitute and verify:**
- For $x=1$: $\sqrt{4(1)} = 2$, but $1-3 = -2$. So, $x=1$ is NOT a solution (extraneous). 
- For $x=9$: $\sqrt{4(9)} = 6$, and $9-3 = 6$. So, $x=9$ IS a solution.
3. **Valid solution:** Only $x=9$
Action: Answer("B") 
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
