## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The argument assumes that a specific outcome (decreased inflation) would have occurred if the party's theories were correct. Since the opposite happened (increased inflation), it concludes the theories must be wrong. This is similar to assuming a cause-effect relationship and then using the absence of the effect to deny the cause.
