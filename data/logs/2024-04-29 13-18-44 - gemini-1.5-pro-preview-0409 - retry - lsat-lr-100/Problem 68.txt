  B: whether there are more cocker spaniels registered to addresses in Flynn Heights than any other breed of dog
  C: whether the city's animal control officers find more stray dogs in and around Flynn Heights than in any other part of the city

## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The argument assumes that finding a cocker spaniel near Flynn Heights means it likely belongs to someone there because most registered cocker spaniels are from that neighborhood. To evaluate this, we need to know if the higher number of cocker spaniels in Flynn Heights is simply due to a higher overall dog population there.
