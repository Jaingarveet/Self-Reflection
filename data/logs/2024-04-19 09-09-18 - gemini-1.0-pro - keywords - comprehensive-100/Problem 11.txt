## Self-Reflection
**Error:** I previously answered this question incorrectly.
**Reasoning:** My initial approach was flawed. I focused on the specific numbers provided for land price increases in different cities, neglecting the broader context and the overall trend of rising housing prices.
**Solution:** To improve my accuracy, I will:
1. **Consider the overall context:** Analyze the information provided about government measures to suppress housing price growth and the continued rise despite these efforts.
2. **Focus on the relationship between land prices and housing prices:** While land prices are a factor, they are not the sole determinant of housing prices. Other factors like supply and demand, government policies, and speculation also play a significant role.
3. **Evaluate the statements based on their consistency with the overall context and the relationship between land and housing prices.**
## Applying the Improved Approach
**Statement A:** Shanghai's housing prices increased significantly while land prices rose moderately. This suggests that other factors besides land prices might be driving the increase in housing prices.
**Statement B:** Beijing's housing prices increased at a lower rate than land prices. This contradicts the claim that rising land prices are the sole culprit for soaring housing prices.
**Statement C:** The chairman of Huayuan Real Estate believes that rising land development costs will lead to higher housing prices. This statement aligns with the general understanding that land costs are a factor in housing prices, but it doesn't address other potential factors.
**Statement D:** The chairman of Yongtai Development Company attributes the skyrocketing housing prices to insufficient supply. This statement aligns with the overall context of government measures to suppress housing price growth and the continued rise despite these efforts. It suggests that supply-side factors might be playing a significant role.
**Conclusion:** Based on the improved approach, Statement D appears to be the most doubtful of the assertion that rising land prices are the chief culprit in soaring housing prices.
**Action:** Answer("D")
