## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
In 2010, the population of City X was 120,000.
The population of City X increased by 20% from 2010 to 2015.
The population of City Y decreased by 10% from 2010 to 2015.
In 2015, the populations of City X and City Y were equal.
Let's denote the population of City Y in 2010 as $y$.
In 2015, the population of City X was 120,000 * 1.2 = 144,000.
In 2015, the population of City Y was $y$ * 0.9.
Since the populations of City X and City Y were equal in 2015, we have the equation:
$y$ * 0.9 = 144,000
Solving for $y$, we get:
$y$ = 144,000 / 0.9 = 160,000
Action: Answer("C")
