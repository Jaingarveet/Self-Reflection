## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation of the problem
- Incorrect application of speed formula
- Confusion between distance and time
## Assistant 2:
I understand. I will use my self-reflection to answer this question correctly.
**Self-reflection:**
* **Misinterpretation of the problem:** I initially misinterpreted the problem by focusing on the time it takes the space shuttle to pass a point instead of the time it takes to reach its maximum height.
* **Incorrect application of speed formula:** I used the incorrect formula to calculate the speed of the space shuttle. The correct formula is speed = distance / time.
* **Confusion between distance and time:** I confused the distance traveled by the space shuttle with the time it takes to travel that distance.
**Corrected solution:**
* The distance traveled by the space shuttle is 700 meters.
* The time it takes to travel that distance is 40 seconds.
* The speed of the space shuttle is 700 meters / 40 seconds = 17.5 meters per second.
* The length of the space shuttle is the distance it travels in 5 seconds.
* The distance traveled in 5 seconds is 17.5 meters per second * 5 seconds = 87.5 meters.
Therefore, the length of the space shuttle is 87.5 meters.
**Action: Answer("E")**
