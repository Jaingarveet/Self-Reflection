## Self-Reflection on Previous Incorrect Answer:
**Error:** My previous answer was incorrect because I made a calculation error in the arithmetic series formula. I used the wrong value for the number of terms (n) in the series, which led to an inaccurate result.
**Corrected Approach:**
1. **Identify the given information:**
    - Youngest member's age (a) = 7 years
    - Common difference (d) = 3 months = 0.25 years
    - Sum of ages of all members (S) = 250 years
2. **Find the number of terms (n):**
    - Use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: S = n/2 [2a + (n-1)d]
    - Substitute the given values: 250 = n/2 [2(7) + (n-1)(0.25)]
    - Simplify and solve for n: 500 = n(14 + 0.25n) --> n^2 + 56n - 2000 = 0
    - Factor the quadratic equation: (n-20)(n+100) = 0
    - Since the age cannot be negative, n = 20
3. **Therefore, the number of members in the club is 20.**
**Action:** Answer("B")

Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: C
