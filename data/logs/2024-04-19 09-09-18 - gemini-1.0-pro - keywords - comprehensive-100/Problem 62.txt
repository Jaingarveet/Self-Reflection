## Assistant 2:
Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly because I made a calculation error when solving for $x$. I substituted the incorrect value for $x$ into the second equation, which led to an incorrect solution.
To avoid making the same mistake again, I will carefully check my calculations and make sure that I am substituting the correct values into the equations.
Action: Answer("A")

Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: B
