Context: Of the eight students—George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert—in a seminar, exactly six will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.

Choices:
  A: Helen, George, and Nina
  B: Irving, Robert, and Helen
  C: Nina, Helen, and Olivia
  D: Olivia, Robert, and Irving
  E: Robert, George, and Helen
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Since Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, the remaining students who can give reports are George, Helen, Irving, Nina, Olivia, and Robert.
Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report, so he must give the morning report on Tuesday.
Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report, so they cannot give a morning report either, since there is only one report per time slot.
If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. Since Nina cannot give a report on Wednesday (since she cannot give an afternoon report), if she gives a report on Monday morning, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday afternoon and Wednesday morning, respectively.
Action: Answer("A")
