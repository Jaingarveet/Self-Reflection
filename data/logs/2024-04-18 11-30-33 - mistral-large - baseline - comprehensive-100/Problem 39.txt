Context: There are two kinds of horror stories: those that describe a mad scientist's experiments and those that describe a monstrous beast. In some horror stories about monstrous beasts, the monster symbolizes a psychological disturbance in the protagonist. Horror stories about mad scientists, on the other hand, typically express the author's feeling that scientific knowledge alone is not enough to guide human endeavor. However, despite these differences, both kinds of horror stories share two features: they describe violations of the laws of nature and they are intended to produce dread in the reader.
Question: If the statements above are true, which one of the following would also have to be true?
Choices:
  A: All descriptions of monstrous beasts describe violations of the laws of nature.
  B: Any story that describes a violation of a law of nature is intended to invoke dread in the reader.
  C: Horror stories of any kind usually describe characters who are psychologically disturbed.
  D: Most stories about mad scientists express the author's antiscientific views.
  E: Some stories that employ symbolism describe violations of the laws of nature.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The statements indicate that both kinds of horror stories (mad scientist and monstrous beast) share two features: they describe violations of the laws of nature and they are intended to produce dread in the reader.
The answer must be consistent with these two features.

Option A is too specific and only refers to monstrous beasts, not both kinds of horror stories.
Option B is too broad and suggests that any story that describes a violation of a law of nature is intended to invoke dread, which is not necessarily true.
Option C is too specific and only refers to horror stories of any kind, not both kinds of horror stories.
Option D is too specific and only refers to mad scientist stories, not both kinds of horror stories.
Option E is consistent with the two features shared by both kinds of horror stories.

Action: Answer("E")
