Topic: Law
Context: Exactly eight books—F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O—are placed on a bookcase with exactly three shelves—the top shelf, the middle shelf, and the bottom shelf. At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.
Question: If G is placed on the top shelf, then which one of the following could be a complete and accurate list of the books placed on the middle shelf?
Choices:
  A: H, I
  B: I, L
  C: H, I, L
  D: I, K, L
  E: F, I, M
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Since G is placed on the top shelf, there must be at least one more book on the top shelf to meet the condition that at least two books are placed on each shelf. Therefore, the top shelf can have a maximum of three books.
Since more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, the bottom shelf must have at least four books.
Since I is placed on the middle shelf, there must be at least one more book on the middle shelf to meet the condition that at least two books are placed on each shelf. Therefore, the middle shelf can have a maximum of three books.
Since K is placed on a higher shelf than F, and F is placed on the same shelf as M, K cannot be placed on the middle shelf with F and M.
Since O is placed on a higher shelf than L, L cannot be placed on the middle shelf with O.
Therefore, the only possible complete and accurate list of the books placed on the middle shelf is H, I.
Action: Answer("A")

Agent Answer: A
