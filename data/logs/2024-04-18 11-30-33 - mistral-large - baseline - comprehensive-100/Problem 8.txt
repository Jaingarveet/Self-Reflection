Question: Two cars start at the same time from opposite ends of a highway that is 50 miles long. One car is riding at 12 mph and the second car is riding at 13 mph. How long after they begin will they meet?
Choices:
  A:  1
  B:  1.25
  C:  1.50
  D:  1.75
  E:  2
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The two cars are moving towards each other, so their speeds are added together.
The combined speed of the two cars is 12 mph + 13 mph = 25 mph.
To find the time it takes for them to meet, we can use the formula time = distance/speed.
The distance between the two cars is 50 miles.
So, time = 50 miles / 25 mph = 2 hours.
Action: Answer("E")
## Result:
Agent Answer: E
Correct Answer: E
Score: 1
