## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: $$\begin{array}{r}3 x+4 y=-23 \\2 y-x=-19\end{array}$$What is the solution $(x, y)$ to the system of equations above?
Choices:
  A: $(-5,-2)$
  B: $(3,-8)$
  C: $(4,-6)$
  D: $(9,-6)$
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
To solve the system of equations, we can use substitution or elimination method.
Let's use the elimination method.
Multiply the second equation by 2 and add it to the first equation:
$$\begin{array}{r}3 x+4 y=-23 \\4 y-2 x=-38\end{array}$$
Adding the two equations, we get:
$$x+8 y=-61$$
Now, we can solve for $y$ in terms of $x$:
$$y=-\frac{61}{8}-\frac{1}{8} x$$
Substitute this expression for $y$ into the second equation:
$$2\left(-\frac{61}{8}-\frac{1}{8} x\right)-x=-19$$
Simplifying, we get:
$$-\frac{122}{8}-\frac{1}{4} x-x=-19$$
Multiplying both sides by 4, we get:
$$-122-x-4 x=-76$$
Combining like terms, we get:
$$-5 x=46$$
Dividing both sides by $-5$, we get:
$$x=-9.2$$
Substituting $x=-9.2$ into the expression for $y$, we get:
$$y=-\frac{61}{8}-\frac{1}{8}(-9.2)=-7.6-1.15=-8.75$$
Therefore, the solution to the system of equations is $(-9.2,-8.75)$.
However, this is not one of the given choices.
Let's check each of the given choices to see if they satisfy both equations.
A: $(-5,-2)$
Substituting $x=-5$ and $y=-2$ into the first equation, we get:
$$3(-5)+4(-2)=-15-8=-23$$
Therefore, $(-5,-2)$ satisfies the first equation.
Substituting $x=-5$ and $y=-2$ into the second equation, we get:
$$2(-2)-(-5)=-4+5=1$$
Therefore, $(-5,-2)$ does not satisfy the second equation.
B: $(3,-8)$
Substituting $x=3$ and $y=-8$ into the first equation, we get:
$$3(3)+4(-8)=9-32=-23$$
Therefore, $(3,-8)$ satisfies the first equation.
Substituting $x=3$ and $y=-8$ into the second equation, we get:
$$2(-8)-(3)=-16-3=-19$$
Therefore, $(3,-8)$ satisfies the second equation.
C: $(4,-6)$
Substituting $x=4$ and $y=-6$ into the first equation, we get:
$$3(4)+4(-6)=12-24=-12$$
Therefore, $(4,-6)$ does not satisfy the first equation.
D: $(9,-6)$
Substituting $x=9$ and $y=-6$ into the first equation, we get:
$$3(9)+4(-6)=27-24=3$$
Therefore, $(9,-6)$ does not satisfy the first equation.
Action: Answer("B")
