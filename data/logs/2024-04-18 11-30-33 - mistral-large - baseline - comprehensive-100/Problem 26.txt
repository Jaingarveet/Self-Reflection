Topic: Law
Context: A shopping center has exactly seven spaces—space 1 through space 7—arranged in a straight row. Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
Question: If the shoe store is in space 2, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: The optometrist is in space 5.
  B: The pharmacy is in space 1.
  C: A restaurant is in space 3.
  D: The toy store is in space 6.
  E: The veterinarian is in space 4.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The pharmacy must be at one end of the row, so it can only be in space 1 or space 7. Since the shoe store is in space 2, the pharmacy cannot be in space 1. Therefore, the pharmacy must be in space 7.
The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, so they cannot be in spaces 3 and 4. Since the pharmacy is in space 7, one of the restaurants must be in space 1.
The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, so the optometrist or the veterinarian must be in space 6.
The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so if the veterinarian is in space 6, the toy store cannot be in space 5.
Action: Answer("A")
