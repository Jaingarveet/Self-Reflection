Question: On a map, the length of the road from Town F to Town G is measured to be 20 inches. On this map, 1/4 inch represents an actual distance of 10 miles. What is the actual distance, in miles, from Town F to Town G along this road?
Choices:
  A: 800
  B: 720
  C: 960
  D: 1140
  E: 1160
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
To find the actual distance, we need to convert the map distance to the actual distance using the given scale.
The scale is 1/4 inch = 10 miles.
So, 1 inch = 10 miles * 4 = 40 miles.
The map distance is 20 inches, so the actual distance is 20 inches * 40 miles/inch = 800 miles.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
