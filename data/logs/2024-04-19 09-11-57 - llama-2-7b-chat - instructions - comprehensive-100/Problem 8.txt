## Assistant 2:
  Thought: 
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand the mistake. The correct solution involves using the formula:
distance = speed x time

For the first car, the distance traveled is 50 miles x 12 mph = 600 miles.
For the second car, the distance traveled is 50 miles x 13 mph = 650 miles.

To find when they will meet, we need to find the time it takes for the first car to travel 600 miles and the second car to travel 650 miles.

Time = distance / speed

For the first car, time = 600 miles / 12 mph = 50 hours.
For the second car, time = 650 miles / 13 mph = 50.77 hours.

Since they start at the same time, they will meet after 50 hours.

Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: E
Score: 0
