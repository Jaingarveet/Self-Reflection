Question: A club consists of members whose ages are in A.P. The common difference being 3 months. If the youngest member of the club is just 7 years old and the sum of the ages of all the members is 250, then number of members in the club are :

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I realized that I made a mistake in my calculation. Here is my reflection:

I misunderstood the problem and thought that the ages were in arithmetic progression (A.P.) with a common difference of 3 months. However, the problem states that the ages are in A.P. with a common difference of 3 months, which means that the ages are not necessarily consecutive.

To solve the problem correctly, I should have calculated the sum of the ages of all the members and then divided it by the common difference to find the number of members in the club.

Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
