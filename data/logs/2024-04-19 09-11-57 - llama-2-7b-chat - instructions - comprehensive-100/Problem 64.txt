## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: In planning maintenance for a city's infrastructure, a civil engineer estimates that, starting from the present, the population of the city will decrease by 10 percent every 20 years. If the present population of the city is 50,000, which of the following expressions represents the engineer's estimate of the population of the city $t$ years from now?
Choices:
  A: $50,000(0.1)^{20 t}$
  B: $50,000(0.1)^{\frac{t}{20}}$
  C: $50,000(0.9)^{20 t}$
  D: $50,000(0.9)^{\frac{t}{20}}$
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:

1. Identify the pattern in the engineer's estimate of the population of the city $t$ years from now.
2. Choose the correct formula to represent the population growth model.
3. Plug in the value of t (20 years from the present) to find the estimated population.
4. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
5. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
## Assistant 2:
  Reflection:

I previously answered this question incorrectly, and upon reflection, I realized that the engineer's estimate of the population of the city $t$ years from now can be represented by the formula:

$P(t) = P(0) \times (1 - 0.1)^t$

Where $P(0)$ is the present population of the city, which is 50,000.

To find the estimated population $P(20)$ (20 years from the present), I plugged in the value of $t = 20$ into the formula:

$P(20) = 50,000 \times (1 - 0.1)^20$

$P(20) = 50,000 \times 0.88$

$P(20) = 44,000$

Therefore, the correct answer is (C): $50,000(0.9)^{20 t} = 44,000$.
