Context: A bakery makes exactly three kinds of cookieâ€”oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar. Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day. The following conditions apply: No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
Question: If the number of batches made on Friday is exactly one, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: The first batch of sugar cookies is made on Monday.
  B: The first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Tuesday.
  C: The third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Friday.

Solution:
The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, so the first batch of sugar cookies cannot be made on Monday, as there must be at least one batch made on Monday and no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies, so they cannot both be made on Tuesday.
Since only one batch is made on Friday, it cannot be the same kind of cookie as the ones made on Thursday. Therefore, the third batch of oatmeal cookies and the third batch of peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Friday.
The first batch of sugar cookies can be made on Monday, as it does not violate any of the given conditions.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The first batch of sugar cookies cannot be made on Monday, as the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, and no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
The first batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Tuesday, as the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies, and they cannot both be made on Tuesday.
The third batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Friday, as only one batch is made on Friday, and it cannot be the same kind of cookie as the ones made on Thursday.
The first batch of peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Wednesday, as the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies, and they cannot both be made on Wednesday.
The second batch of peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Tuesday, as the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies, and they cannot both be made on Tuesday.
Therefore, the only option left is that the first batch of sugar cookies is made on Monday.
Action: Answer("A")

I will make sure to thoroughly analyze each option and consider all the given conditions before selecting an answer in the future.
