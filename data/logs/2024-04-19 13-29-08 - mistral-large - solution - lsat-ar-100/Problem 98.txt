Solution:
The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning, but J must be shown in the evening, so J cannot be the first or second house.
K cannot be shown in the morning, so K cannot be the first or second house either.
L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown, so L cannot be the first house.
Therefore, the first two houses must be chosen from L, M, N, O, and P.
Since J must be shown in the evening, it must be either the sixth or seventh house.
If J is the sixth house, then K, L, M, N, and O must be shown before it, but this is not possible since L must be shown after K and before M.
Therefore, J must be the seventh house, and K, L, M, N, O, and P must be shown before it.
Since L must be shown after K and before M, K cannot be the last house shown before J, so it must be one of the first five houses.
Therefore, K could not be shown at some time after J is shown.
P could be shown at some time after J is shown if it is the sixth house shown.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Since J must be the seventh house shown, and K cannot be shown in the morning, K must be one of the first five houses shown. Therefore, K cannot be shown at some time after J is shown.
Since L must be shown after K and before M, L cannot be the first house shown. Therefore, L could be shown at some time after J is shown if it is the sixth house shown.
Since P could be any of the first six houses shown, P could be shown at some time after J is shown if it is the sixth house shown.
Since N and O must be shown before J, they cannot be shown at some time after M is shown.
Since K could not be shown at some time after J is shown, and N and O cannot be shown at some time after M is shown, the only possible answer is that P is shown at some time after J is shown.
