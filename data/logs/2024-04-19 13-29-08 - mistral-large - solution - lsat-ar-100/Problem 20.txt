Topic: Law
Context: Of the eight students—George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert—in a seminar, exactly six will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
Question: If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, could be given by
Choices:
  A: Helen, George, and Nina
  B: Irving, Robert, and Helen
  C: Nina, Helen, and Olivia
  D: Olivia, Robert, and Irving

Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
Since Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, the remaining students who can give reports are George, Helen, Irving, Nina, Olivia, and Robert.
Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report, so he must give the morning report on Tuesday.
Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report, but they can give a morning report.
If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. Since Nina cannot give a report on Wednesday (since she cannot give an afternoon report), if she gives a report on Monday morning, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday afternoon and Wednesday morning, respectively. However, this would mean that Olivia and Robert cannot give reports, which contradicts the conditions. Therefore, Nina cannot give a report on Monday morning.
The only remaining option for Monday morning is Olivia.
Since Olivia cannot give an afternoon report, Irving must give the afternoon report on Monday.
Since Helen and Irving must both give reports if Nina gives a report, and Nina cannot give a report on Monday or Tuesday, Nina must give the afternoon report on Wednesday.
Therefore, the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, could be given by [REDACTED].
## Assistant 2:
Reflection:
I made an error in my previous solution by assuming that Nina cannot give a report on Wednesday because she cannot give an afternoon report. However, the condition states that Nina cannot give an afternoon report unless her report is given on Wednesday, which means that she can give a morning report on Wednesday.

Solution:
Since Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, the remaining students who can give reports are George, Helen, Irving, Nina, Olivia, and Robert.
Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report, so he must give the morning report on Tuesday.
Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report, but they can give a morning report.
If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. Since Nina cannot give a report on Monday morning (as explained in my previous solution), the only remaining option for Monday morning is Helen.
Since Olivia cannot give an afternoon report, Irving must give the afternoon report on Monday.
Since Helen gave a report on Monday morning, Nina cannot give a report on Tuesday (because Helen and Irving must both give reports if Nina gives a report, and Irving already gave a report on Monday afternoon). Therefore, Robert must give the afternoon report on Tuesday.
Since Nina can give a morning report on Wednesday, and Helen and Irving must both give reports if Nina gives a report, the morning report on Wednesday could be given by Nina.
