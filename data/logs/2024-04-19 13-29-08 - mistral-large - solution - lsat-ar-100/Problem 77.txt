Topic: Law
Context: An administrator must assign parking spaces to six new employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young. Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
Question: For how many of the six new employees is the assignment of a parking space limited to one of only two possible spaces?
Choices:
  A: none
  B: two
  C: three
  D: four
  E: five
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
Let's analyze the rules given:

1. Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
2. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
3. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
4. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.

From rule 4, we know that Robertson can only be assigned one of the [REDACTED] lower-numbered spaces. Since Robertson must have a higher-numbered space than Young, Young can only be assigned one of the [REDACTED] remaining lower-numbered spaces (#1, #2, or #3).

Now, since Young must have a higher-numbered space than Togowa, Togowa can only be assigned one of the [REDACTED] remaining lower-numbered spaces (#1 or #2).

However, we must also consider rule 2. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered space than Souza. Since Robertson can only occupy one of the [REDACTED] lower-numbered spaces, and Young and Togowa must occupy [REDACTED] of the remaining [REDACTED] lower-numbered spaces, Souza can only be assigned the remaining lower-numbered space (#1, #2, or #3). This means that Xu can only be assigned one of the [REDACTED] remaining higher-numbered spaces (#5 or #6).
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Based on the rules given, we can analyze the possible parking space assignments for each employee:

1. Robertson can only be assigned one of the lower-numbered spaces (#1, #2, #3, or #4).
2. Young must have a higher-numbered space than Togowa, so Young can only be assigned one of the remaining lower-numbered spaces (#1, #2, or #3).
3. Togowa can only be assigned one of the remaining lower-numbered spaces (#1 or #2).
4. Souza can only be assigned the remaining lower-numbered space (#1, #2, or #3).
5. Xu must have a higher-numbered space than Souza, so Xu can only be assigned one of the remaining higher-numbered spaces (#5 or #6).

From this analysis, we can see that Togowa, Souza, and Xu are limited to one of only two possible spaces.
