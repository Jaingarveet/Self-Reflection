Context: For the school paper, five students—Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, Megregian, and O'Neill—each review one or more of exactly three plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation, but do not review any other plays. The following conditions must apply: Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
Question: If exactly three of the students review Undulation, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Megregian does not review Undulation.
  B: O'Neill does not review Undulation.
  C: Jiang reviews Undulation.
  D: Lopez reviews Tamerlane.
  E: O'Neill reviews Sunset.

Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
We know that exactly three of the students review Undulation.
Since neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews, Jiang must be one of the three students who review Undulation.
Since Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, they cannot both review Undulation as well, since they each review fewer plays than Megregian.
However, Megregian could review all three plays, so it is possible that Megregian reviews Undulation.
Since exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other, and Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, O'Neill must review Sunset as well.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Since Jiang must be one of the three students who review Undulation, choice C is possible.
Since Megregian could review all three plays, choice A is not necessarily true.
Since O'Neill must review Sunset as well as Tamerlane, choice B is not possible.
Since Lopez reviews fewer plays than Megregian, and Megregian could review all three plays, it is possible that Lopez reviews Tamerlane.
Since O'Neill must review Sunset as well as Tamerlane, choice E is not possible.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: E
Score: 0
