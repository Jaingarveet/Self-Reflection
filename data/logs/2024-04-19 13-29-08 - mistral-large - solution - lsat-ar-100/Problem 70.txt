Context: A maintenance company that takes service requests from three clients—Image, Solide, and Truvest—plans to set targets for its average service response times. Service targets will be set at 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day. Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail. The six targets are set according to the following conditions: None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
Question: If Solide's voicemail target is shorter than Truvest's website target, which one of the following targets could be 2 days?

2. [REDACTED] must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
3. [REDACTED] must be shorter than [REDACTED].

2. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
3. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.

From condition 4, we know that Solide's voicemail target is shorter than Truvest's website target. Since none of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target, Truvest's voicemail target must also be shorter than Truvest's website target. Therefore, Truvest's website target cannot be 2 days.

From condition 2, Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Since Solide's voicemail target is shorter than Truvest's website target, Image's voicemail target must be shorter than 2 days. Therefore, Image's voicemail target cannot be 2 days.

From condition 3, Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target. Since Solide's voicemail target is shorter than Truvest's website target, Solide's website target must be shorter than 2 days. Therefore, Solide's website target cannot be 2 days.

Since none of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target, Image's website target must be shorter than or equal to Image's voicemail target. Therefore, Image's website target could be 2 days.
