Context: A shopping center has exactly seven spaces—space 1 through space 7—arranged in a straight row. Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.

Choices:
  A: The optometrist is in space 2.
  B: The pharmacy is in space 7.

Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
The pharmacy must be at one end of the row, so it can only be in space 1 or space 7.
Since the veterinarian is in space 5, the pharmacy cannot be next to it, so it must be in space 1.
The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, so they cannot be in spaces 2 and 3, or spaces 6 and 7.
Since the pharmacy is in space 1, the only possible spaces for the restaurants are spaces 3 and 7, or spaces 4 and 6.
Since the veterinarian is in space 5, the only possible spaces for the restaurants are spaces 2 and 6, or spaces 3 and 7.
However, since the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, it cannot be in space 4 or space 6.
Therefore, the only possible space for the toy store is space 3, and the only possible space for one of the restaurants is space 4.
