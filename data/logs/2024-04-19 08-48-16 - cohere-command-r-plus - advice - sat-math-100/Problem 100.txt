## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Topic: Math
Context: $$.a=1,052+1.08 t.$$.The speed of a sound wave in air depends on the air temperature. The formula above shows the relationship between $a$, the speed of a sound wave, in feet per second, and $t$, the air temperature, in degrees Fahrenheit $\left({ }^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\right)$.
Question: At which of the following air temperatures will the speed of a sound wave be closest to 1,000 feet per second?
Choices:
  A: $-46^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$
  B: $-48^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$
  C: $-49^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$
  D: $-50^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$

## Assistant 2:
Reflection: I made a calculation error the first time I attempted this problem. I correctly set up the equation $1,052 + 1.08t = 1,000$ but made a mistake in isolating $t$. I divided by 1.08 on both sides, but I incorrectly calculated that $t \approx 44$, when in fact, $t \approx -44$. This led me to choose answer option C: $-49^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$, which was incorrect.

To get the correct answer, I should have simply noticed that subtracting 1.08 times from 1,052 would result in a negative temperature, and the closest option to 0 is $-46^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$, which is choice A.

Thought: Taking into account my reflection, I now understand that I need to find the temperature that makes the speed of sound closest to 1,000, even if it's not exactly 1,000. Setting up the equation $1,052 + 1.08t = 1,000$, I can see that as $1.08t$ increases, the value moves further away from 1,000. So, the smallest possible value of $t$ will give the closest value to 1,000. Therefore, the answer is $-46^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$, choice A.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: B
