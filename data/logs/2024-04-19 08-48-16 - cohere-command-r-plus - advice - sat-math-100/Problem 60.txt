## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: Mr. Kohl has a beaker containing $n$ milliliters of solution to distribute to the students in his chemistry class. If he gives each student 3 milliliters of solution, he will have 5 milliliters left over. In order to give each student 4 milliliters of solution, he will need an additional 21 milliliters. How many students are in the class?
Choices:
  A: 16
  B: 21
  C: 23
  D: 26
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Advice:
 - Take the time to understand the problem and identify the relevant variables. 
 - Clearly define your variables and equations. 
 - Solve one equation at a time, and then substitute to find the final answer. 
 - Always double-check your solution by plugging your answer back into the original equations. 
 - Be careful with algebraic manipulations and ensure each step is valid.
## Assistant 2:
Reflection: I made a mistake in interpreting the word problem. I incorrectly assumed that the additional 21 milliliters of solution would result in a total of 26 milliliters for each student, which led me to calculate an incorrect number of students. 

Solving simultaneously yields the correct answer:
Let $x$ be the number of students. 

The first scenario: $3x + 5 = n \implies 3x = n - 5$.

The second scenario: $4x = n \implies 4x + 21 = n + 21$.

Now, we can substitute: $4x + 21 = (3x + 5) + 21 = 3x + 26$.

This gives: $x = \frac{26}{3} = 8\frac{2}{3}$, so there are $\boxed{26}$ milliliters required for each student in the class.
Action: Answer("D")
