## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: A television with a price of $\$ 300$ is to be purchased with an initial payment of $\$ 60$ and weekly payments of $\$ 30$. Which of the following equations can be used to find the number of weekly payments, $w$, required to complete the purchase, assuming there are no taxes or fees?
Choices:
  A: $300=30 w-60$
  B: $300=30 w$
  C: $300=30 w+60$
  D: $300=60 w-30$
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Advice:
 - Always identify the given values and the relationships between them. 
 - Form equations directly based on the relationships, ensuring that all values are accounted for correctly. 
 - Double-check that the formed equation aligns with the problem's context. 
 - Simplify and solve the equation step-by-step, checking each step for accuracy. 
 - Ensure you correctly isolate the unknown variable. 
 - Verify that your final answer makes sense in the context of the problem.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The total cost of the television $T$ is given by the sum of the initial payment $I$ and the weekly payments $w$ multiplied by the cost of each weekly payment $p$:
$T = I + wp$
We are given $T = 300, I = 60, w = ?$ and $p = 30$.
Plugging in these values and simplifying gives:
$300 = 60 + 30w$
$240 = 30w$
$8 = w$
So the correct answer is $w = 8$ weeks.

This can be found using the equation $300 = 60 + 30w \implies 30w = 240 \implies w = 8$.

Choice A subtracts $60$ from the weekly payments instead of adding it, which doesn't make sense in the context of the problem.
Choice B ignores the initial payment, which is incorrect.
Choice D has the wrong values for the coefficients of $w$ and should be rejected.

Therefore, the correct answer is Choice C.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
