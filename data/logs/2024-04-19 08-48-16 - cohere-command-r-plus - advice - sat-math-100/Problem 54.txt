## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: For a polynomial $p(x)$, the value of $p(3)$ is -2 .Which of the following must be true about $p(x)$ ?
Choices:
  A: $x-5$ is a factor of $p(x)$.
  B: $x-2$ is a factor of $p(x)$.
  C: $x+2$ is a factor of $p(x)$.
  D: The remainder when $p(x)$ is divided by $x-3$ is -2 .

Advice:

- Take the time to understand the question and identify the relevant mathematical concepts. 
- Be cautious when interpreting the question, especially when dealing with factors, remainders, and related concepts. 
- Familiarize yourself with theorems and their applications to avoid confusion. 
- Practice similar problems to reinforce your understanding and application of these concepts.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Given that $p(3) = -2$, we can substitute $x = 3$ into each factor option to see which one equals $-2$.

For choice A, $x-5 = 3-5 = -2$.

For choice B, $x-2 = 3-2 = 1$.

For choice C, $x+2 = 3+2 = 5$.

Thus, choice A is the correct answer.

It's important to note that the question asks for a factor of $p(x)$, not the remainder when $p(x)$ is divided by a specific value. This precision in interpreting the question is crucial in mathematics.
Action: Answer("A")
