Question: $$h=-4.9 t^{2}+25 t$$The equation above expresses the approximate height $h$, in meters, of a ball $t$ seconds after it is launched vertically upward from the ground with an initial velocity of 25 meters per second. After approximately how many seconds will the ball hit the ground?
Choices:
  A: 3.5
  B: 4.0
  C: 4.5
  D: 5.0
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the context. 
 - Pay attention to the signs and square root calculations when using the quadratic formula. 
 - Consider the physical meaning of the solutions and choose the one that makes sense in the given context. 
 - Double-check your calculations and the interpretation of the results. 
 - Approximate carefully and only when necessary, keeping in mind the level of precision required.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The ball is launched upward with an initial velocity, and gravity will pull it back down. 
The quadratic term in the equation represents the effect of gravity, which is negative as it pulls the ball down. 

The ground is at height $h = 0$ meters, so I need to solve for $t$ when $h=0$:
$0=-4.9t^2 + 25t$
$4.9t^2 - 25t = 0$
$t = 0$ or $t = \frac{25}{4.9} \approx 5.1$ seconds

The negative root, $t=0$, doesn't make sense in this context as time can't be negative. The positive root, approximately $5.1$ seconds, represents the time it takes for the ball to hit the ground.

I should choose the answer that is the closest to this value, which is 5.0 seconds.
Action: Answer("D")
