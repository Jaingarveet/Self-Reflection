Question: Alan drives an average of 100 miles each week. His car can travel an average of 25 miles per gallon of gasoline. Alan would like to reduce his weekly expenditure on gasoline by $\$ 5$. Assuming gasoline costs $\$ 4$ per gallon, which equation can Alan use to determine how many fewer average miles, $m$, he should drive each week?
Choices:
  A: $\frac{25}{4} m=95$
  B: $\frac{25}{4} m=5$
  C: $\frac{4}{25} m=95$
  D: $\frac{4}{25} m=5$

## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Alan wants to reduce his weekly expenditure on gasoline by $\$5$.
His car's mileage is 25 miles per gallon, and gasoline costs $\$4$ per gallon. 

First, I calculate the current weekly expenditure:
$\$4$ per gallon * 25 miles/gallon = $\$100$ per 100 miles 

Now, to reduce the expenditure by $\$5$, the new expenditure should be $\$100 - \$5 = \$95$. 

I can set up a proportion to find the new amount of gasoline needed:
$\$95$ for 100 miles :: $\$4$ for $m$ miles 

This gives the equation: $\frac{\$95 \times m}{100} = \$4$,
$95m = 400$,
$m = \frac{400}{95} = 4.21$ miles.

So, Alan needs to drive $4.21$ fewer miles, and the equation he can use is: $\frac{25}{4}m = 95$.

Action: Answer("A")
