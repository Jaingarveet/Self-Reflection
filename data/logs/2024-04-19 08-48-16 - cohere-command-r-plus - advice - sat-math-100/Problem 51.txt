# Model: cohere-command-r-plus | Agent: advice | Exam: sat-math-100 | Problem 51 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:
Topic: Geography
Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: $$\begin{aligned}& 2 x-3 y=-14 \\& 3 x-2 y=-6\end{aligned}$$If $(x, y)$ is a solution to the system of equations above, what is the value of $x-y$ ?
Choices:
  A: -20
  B: $\quad-8$
  C: -4
  D: 8
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Advice:
- Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
- Pay close attention to the specifics of the question. In this case, we are asked to find the value of $x - y$, not just $x$ or $y$ individually.
- Take your time and avoid rushing through the problem, especially when performing calculations.
## Assistant 2:
Reflection: I made a mistake in my previous attempt. I correctly solved for $x$ and $y$ but forgot to find the value of $x-y$ as the question asked. By substituting the values I found for $x$ and $y$ into the equation $x-y$, I can now get the correct answer.

Thought: 
First, I solve the system of equations:

$$
\begin{aligned}
2x-3y &=-14 \\
3x-2y &=-6
\end{aligned}
$$

Multiplying the first equation by 3 and the second equation by 2, we get:

$$
\begin{aligned}
6x-9y &=-42 \\
6x-4y &=-12
\end{aligned}
$$

Now, add the two equations:

$$
10x - 13y = -54 \implies x - y = \frac{-54}{13} = -4.15
$$

So, $x - y = -4.15$, which is closest to choice C: -4.

Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
