## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

- Double-check your calculations and ensure they align with the problem's context.
- Be cautious when dealing with percentages, and ensure you apply them correctly.
## Assistant 2:
Reflection: I made a mistake in interpreting the problem. I incorrectly assumed that the width decreased by 12%, which led me to an erroneous solution. In reality, it was the area that decreased by 12%, and I should have calculated the percentage change in width accordingly.

Solution:
Let $x$ be the original length of the rectangle and $y$ be the original width.

After the alteration, the new length is $1.1x$ (increased by 10%), and the new width is $y(1 - p/100)$ (decreased by $p$%).

The original area, $A_1$, is given by:
$$A_1 = xy$$

The new area, $A_2$, is given by:
$$A_2 = 1.1xy(1 - p/100)$$

We know that the new area is 12% less than the original area:
$$A_2 = 0.88A_1$$

Equating the two expressions for $A_2$, we get:
$$1.1xy(1 - p/100) = 0.88xy$$

Simplifying the equation:
$$1.1 - p/100 = 0.88$$

Solving for $p$, we get:
$$p = 22$$

So, the correct answer is $D: 22$.
Action: Answer("D")
