# Model: cohere-command-r-plus | Agent: advice | Exam: sat-math-100 | Problem 17 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:

Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Advice:
- Always simplify algebraic expressions step-by-step, checking each step for accuracy.
- Be cautious when canceling out factors; ensure you're not eliminating information that should be used in subsequent steps.
- Double-check your calculations and final answer.
- Remember that fractions can be simplified by canceling common factors in the numerator and denominator.
## Assistant 2:
Reflection: Last time, I incorrectly chose answer 'B'. I canceled out $a$ in the numerator and denominator of the given expression without considering that it might be needed later. This led to an incorrect simplification and, ultimately, the wrong answer. To find the right solution, I should remember that $a \neq 0$ because it is a denominator in the given expression.

Thought: 
Given $\frac{a}{b}=2$, we can solve for $a$ to find $a=2b$.
Now, we can plug this value into the expression $\frac{4b}{a}$ to get $\frac{4b}{2b}$.
This simplifies to $\frac{4}{2}$, which equals $2$.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
