## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

## Assistant 2:
Reflection: I made a mistake in simplifying the equation and should have distributed the multiplication in the second equation to get $2y + 6 = 2x + 6$. Subtracting $6$ from both sides and dividing by $2$ gives $y = x$. Substituting $y = x^2$ and $y = x$ gives $x^2 = x$, which simplifies to $x^2 - x = 0$. This factors to $(x)(x - 1) = 0$, so $x = 0$ or $x = 1$. Given $x$ is positive, $x = 1$. Then, $xy = 1 * 1 = 1$. Therefore, the final answer is $A: 1$.

Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
