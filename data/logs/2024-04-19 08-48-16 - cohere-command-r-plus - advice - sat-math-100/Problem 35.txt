# Model: cohere-command-r-plus | Agent: advice | Exam: sat-math-100 | Problem 35 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:
Topic: Geography
Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math

Choices:
  A: I only
  B: II only
  C: I and II
  D: Neither I nor II
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Advice:

- Always check your solutions in the original equation, not just simplified forms. 
- Be cautious when squaring equations; the direction of the equality is crucial. 
- Understand the difference between solutions to a quadratic equation and valid solutions to the original problem. 
- Take care when applying the quadratic formula, ensuring accurate substitution of coefficients.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
$\sqrt{4x}= x-3$ implies $4x = (x-3)^2 = x^2 -6x +9$.
This simplifies to $3x^2 -6x +9 =0 \implies x^2 -2x +3=0$.
Using the quadratic formula, we get $x = \frac{2 \pm \sqrt{-4}}{2} = 1 \pm i$ or $x =9$.
Checking these values in the original equation, we find that $x=9$ is a valid solution, but $x=1$ is not.
Therefore, the answer is **II only**.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
