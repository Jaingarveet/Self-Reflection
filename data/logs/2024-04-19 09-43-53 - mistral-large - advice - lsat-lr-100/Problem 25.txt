Topic: Law
Context: When presented with the evidence against him, Ellison freely admitted to engaging in illegal transactions using company facilities. However, the company obtained the evidence by illegally recording Ellison's conversations. Therefore, although the company may demand that he immediately cease, it cannot justifiably take any punitive measures against him.
Question: Which one of the following judgments best illustrates the principle illustrated by the argument above?
Choices:
  A: After Price confessed to having stolen money from Long over a period of several years, Long began stealing from Price. Despite Price's guilt, Long was not justified in taking illegal action against him.
  B: Shakila's secretary has admitted that he is illegally receiving cable television without paying for it. Shakila would not be justified in reporting him, though, since she once did the same thing.
  C: After Takashi told Sarah's parents that he had seen her at the movies on Tuesday, Sarah confessed to sneaking out that day. On Monday, however, Takashi had violated the local curfew for minors. Hence Sarah's parents cannot justifiably punish her in this case.
  D: After a conservation officer discovered them, Kuttner admitted that he had set the illegal animal traps on his land. But, because she was trespassing at the time, the conservation officer cannot justifiably punish Kuttner in this case.
  E: Ramirez was forced by the discovery of new evidence to admit that she lied about her role in managing the chief of staff's financial affairs. Nevertheless, the board of directors cannot justifiably take action against Ramirez, because in past instances it has pardoned others guilty of similar improprieties.

## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The principle illustrated by the argument is that even if someone admits to engaging in illegal activities, they cannot be justifiably punished if the evidence against them was obtained illegally.

Let's apply this principle to each choice:

A: Long is taking illegal action against Price, which is not justified even if Price stole money from him. This choice illustrates the principle.

B: Shakila is not justified in reporting her secretary because she once did the same thing, not because the evidence was obtained illegally. This choice does not illustrate the principle.

C: Takashi violated the local curfew, but it is not clear if Sarah's parents obtained the evidence illegally. This choice does not illustrate the principle.

D: The conservation officer cannot justifiably punish Kuttner because she was trespassing at the time, not because the evidence was obtained illegally. This choice does not illustrate the principle.

E: The board of directors cannot take action against Ramirez because they have pardoned others guilty of similar improprieties in the past, not because the evidence was obtained illegally. This choice does not illustrate the principle.

Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
