Context: Patricia: During Japan's Tokugawa period, martial arts experts known as ninjas were trained for the purposes of espionage and assassination. Yet at that time there was actually very little ninja activity in Japan, and most Japanese did not fear ninjas. Tamara: That is not true. Many wealthy Japanese during the Tokugawa period had their houses constructed with intentionally squeaky floors so that they would receive warning if a ninja were in the house.
Question: Of the following, which one, if true, is the strongest counter Patricia can make to Tamara's objection?
Choices:
  A: Many poor Japanese during the Tokugawa period also had houses constructed with intentionally squeaky floors.
  B: As part of their secret training, ninjas learned to walk on squeaky floors without making a sound.
  C: The wealthy made up a small portion of Japan's population during the Tokugawa period.
  D: The fighting prowess of ninjas was exaggerated to mythic proportions in the years following the Tokngawa period.
  E: There were very few ninjas at any time other than during the Tokugawa period.

## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The original argument is that there was very little ninja activity in Japan during the Tokugawa period, and most Japanese did not fear ninjas. Tamara's objection is that many wealthy Japanese had their houses constructed with intentionally squeaky floors to receive warning if a ninja were in the house.
The strongest counter to Tamara's objection would be a statement that weakens the link between the squeaky floors and the fear of ninjas.
Choice B is the strongest counter because it suggests that the squeaky floors were not an effective deterrent against ninjas, and therefore, their presence in wealthy Japanese homes does not necessarily indicate a fear of ninjas.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
