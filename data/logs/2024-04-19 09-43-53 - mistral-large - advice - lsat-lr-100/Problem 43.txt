## User 2:
Topic: Law
Context: Ethicist: Marital vows often contain the promise to love "until death do us part." If "love" here refers to a feeling, then this promise makes no sense, for feelings are not within one's control, and a promise to do something not within one's control makes no sense. Thus, no one—including those making marital vows—should take "love" in this context to be referring to feelings.
Question: The ethicist's conclusion follows logically if which one of the following is assumed?
Choices:
  A: None of our feelings are within our control.
  B: People should not make promises to do something that is not within their control.
  C: "Love" can legitimately be taken to refer to something other than feelings.
  D: Promises should not be interpreted in such a way that they make no sense.
  E: Promises that cannot be kept do not make any sense.

## Assistant 2:
Reflection:
In my previous answer, I focused too much on the subject matter of the argument, which is about the meaning of "love" in marital vows. I incorrectly assumed that the ethicist's conclusion was based on the assumption that "love" can legitimately be taken to refer to something other than feelings. However, upon reflection, I realized that the ethicist's conclusion is not about the meaning of "love" but about the logicality of making a promise to do something that is not within one's control.

Thought:
The ethicist's argument is that a promise to do something not within one's control makes no sense. Therefore, no one should take "love" in marital vows to be referring to feelings, as feelings are not within one's control. The assumption required for this conclusion to follow logically is that people should not make promises to do something that is not within their control.

Action: Answer("B")
