## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The given statements only tell us that most of the films that won prizes at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival also won prizes at international film festivals. It does not provide any information about the total number of Canadian films produced this year, the number of Canadian films shown at international film festivals, or whether every film that won a prize at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival was also shown at an international film festival.

However, we can infer that some of the films that won prizes at international film festivals this year were Canadian films, since most of the films that won prizes at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival (which only shows Canadian films) also won prizes at international film festivals.

Action: Answer("C")

Reflection:
Previously, I may have incorrectly assumed that the statement "most of the films that won prizes at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival also won prizes at international film festivals" meant that every film that won a prize at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival was also shown at an international film festival. However, upon careful reflection, I realized that this assumption was not supported by the given statements.

To avoid making similar mistakes in the future, I will always read the question carefully and consider all possible scenarios before selecting an answer. I will also use logical reasoning and critical thinking to infer the correct answer, and double-check my inferences and final answer before submitting it.
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
