## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
My thought process and solution were correct. However, I made a calculation error. The product of 3, 4, 1, and 3 is 36, not 24.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Multiplication error
Solution:
The number of ways to travel from M to Q is the product of the number of ways to travel from M to N, from N to O, from O to P, and from P to Q.
From M to N, there are 3 buses.
From N to O, there are 4 buses.
From O to P, there is 1 bus.
From P to Q, there are 3 buses.
The total number of ways to travel from M to Q is 3 x 4 x 1 x 3 = 36.
Instructions:
1. Identify the number of buses from M to N.
2. Identify the number of buses from N to O.
3. Identify the number of buses from O to P.
4. Identify the number of buses from P to Q.
5. Multiply the number of buses from M to N by the number of buses from N to O by the number of buses from O to P by the number of buses from P to Q.
6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.
7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them.
