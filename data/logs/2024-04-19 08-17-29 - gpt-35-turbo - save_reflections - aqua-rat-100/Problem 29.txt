# Model: gpt-35-turbo | Task: save_reflection | Exam: aqua-rat-100 | Problem 29 of 100
## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I made a calculation error in my solution. 
The frog jumps 3m up and falls 2m down, so it covers a net distance of 1m each day.
The frog needs to cover a total distance of 30m to come out of the well.
To cover 30m with 1m per day, it will take 30 days.
However, the frog will not need to jump on the last day since it will already be out of the well.
Therefore, it will take 29 days for the frog to come out of the well.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Arithmetic error
 - Addition error
