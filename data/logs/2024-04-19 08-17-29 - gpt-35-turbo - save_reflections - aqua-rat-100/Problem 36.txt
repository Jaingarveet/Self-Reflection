## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I made a calculation error. I calculated the percentage of chocolates that are not squashed instead of the percentage of chocolates that are both vanilla flavored and not squashed.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Percentage error
 - Misinterpretation of the problem
Solution:
Let's assume there are 100 chocolates in the store.
10% of the chocolates are cocoa flavored, which means 10 chocolates are cocoa flavored.
The remaining chocolates are vanilla flavored.
90% of the remaining chocolates (90 chocolates) are squashed, which means 10% of the remaining chocolates (10 chocolates) are not squashed.
We need to find the percentage of chocolates that are both vanilla flavored and not squashed.
10 chocolates are not squashed and vanilla flavored.
The percentage of chocolates that are both vanilla flavored and not squashed is 10/100 = 10%.
