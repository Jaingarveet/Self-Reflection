Explanation:
I calculated the reduction percent incorrectly. 
The formula for reduction percent is (reduction amount / original amount) x 100.
I calculated the reduction percent as (reduction amount / reduced amount) x 100.
Error Keywords:

Solution:
The reduction amount is 120 - 96 = 24.
The original amount is 120.
The reduction percent is (reduction amount / original amount) x 100.
Substituting the values, we get (24 / 120) x 100 = 20%.
Instructions:
1. Identify the original amount and the reduced amount.
2. Calculate the reduction amount by subtracting the reduced amount from the original amount.
