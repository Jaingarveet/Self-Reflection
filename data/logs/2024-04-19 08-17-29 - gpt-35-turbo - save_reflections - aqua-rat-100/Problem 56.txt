## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I made a calculation error while calculating the interest rate. 
I calculated the interest rate as 5% instead of 5.00%.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Formatting error
 - Percentage error
Solution:
The total amount paid back in 12 monthly installments = 12 x 31.50 = Rs. 378
The interest paid = 378 - 360 = Rs. 18
The interest rate can be calculated using the formula: 
Interest Rate = (Interest / Principal) x 100
Interest Rate = (18 / 360) x 100 = 5.00%
Instructions:
1. Identify the principal amount borrowed.
2. Identify the total amount paid back.
3. Calculate the interest paid by subtracting the principal from the total amount paid back.
4. Use the formula: Interest Rate = (Interest / Principal) x 100 to calculate the interest rate.
5. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.
6. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
7. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
