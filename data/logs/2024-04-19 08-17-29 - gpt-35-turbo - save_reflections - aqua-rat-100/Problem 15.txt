## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I used the correct method to add two numbers with different signs, but I made a calculation error.
The correct answer is +15 because we subtract the smaller absolute value from the larger absolute value and keep the sign of the larger number.
The absolute value of +45 is larger than the absolute value of -30.
So, we subtract 30 from 45 and keep the sign of +45, which is positive.
The result is +15.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Addition error
 - Sign error
Solution:
To add +45 and -30, we subtract the smaller absolute value from the larger absolute value and keep the sign of the larger number.
The absolute value of +45 is larger than the absolute value of -30.
So, we subtract 30 from 45 and keep the sign of +45, which is positive.
The result is +15.
Instructions:
1. Identify the two numbers to be added.
2. Determine the sign of each number.
