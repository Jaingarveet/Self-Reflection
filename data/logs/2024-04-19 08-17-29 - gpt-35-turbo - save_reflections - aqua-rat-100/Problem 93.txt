## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I made an error in the order of operations. I should have multiplied first before adding or subtracting. 
Error Keywords:
 - Order of operations error
 - Arithmetic error
 - Algebraic error
Solution:
[5 + ? × 19 - 15 - 7]/[13 × 13 - 156] = 6
[5 + ? × 19 - 22]/[13 × 13 - 156] = 6
[? × 19 - 17]/[169 - 156] = 6
[? × 19 - 17]/[13] = 6
? × 19 - 17 = 78
? × 19 = 95
? = 5
Instructions:
1. Simplify the expression inside the brackets using the order of operations (PEMDAS).
2. Simplify the expression on the left-hand side by performing the arithmetic operations in the numerator and denominator.
3. Isolate the missing value by using algebraic operations.
4. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
5. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always use the order of operations (PEMDAS) to simplify expressions.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that multiplication and division have higher precedence than addition and subtraction.
