Topic: Logic
Context: Aptripa Cave is located near the bay of Dilos in the Peninsula of Maina, and is as large as four football fields.This cave dates back to the Neolithic Age, but was not accidentally discovered by a man walking a dog until the 1950s.After decades of scientific research work, archaeologists excavated tools, pottery, obsidian, silver and copper utensils from the cave, and thus believed that hundreds of people had lived in the cave.
Question: Which of the following, if true, can best refute the above argument?
Choices:
  A: The cave inspired the description of hell in Greek mythology
  B: The cave is actually an ancient cemetery and funeral venue
  C: There is no prehistoric village in Europe that has been found earlier than the cave
  D: The entrance to the cave collapsed 5000 years ago
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I incorrectly chose option [REDACTED] as the best refutation, but the correct answer is [REDACTED]. I was drawn to [REDACTED] because it seemed to provide strong evidence against people living in the cave by making it inaccessible. However, I failed to consider that the collapse happened 5000 years ago, while the evidence of habitation (tools, pottery, etc.) dates back to the much older Neolithic period. So a later collapse doesn't actually refute people living there earlier.
In contrast, [REDACTED] directly contradicts the claim of the cave being a living space. If it was a cemetery and funeral venue, that suggests it was used for burial practices, not as a dwelling for hundreds of people. I overlooked the straightforward logical contradiction between living space and burial site.
