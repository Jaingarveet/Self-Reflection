Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I made an error in my logical reasoning. I correctly deduced that Li was in Tianshu, and Zhao and Liu were in the same unit but not Tianshu. However, I failed to properly consider the implications of the fourth condition: "If Zhang was hired by Tianxuan, then Wang was hired by Tianxuan." This means that either both Zhang and Wang are in Tianxuan, or neither of them are. I incorrectly thought that Zhang could be in Tianji while Wang was in Tianxuan.
