Context: Xiao Chen? At present, part of the orbit of Comet 1996D3 is far from the sun, but recently it can be found to emit flickering light through the solar telescope.In the past, people never observed such flashes of comets far away from the sun, so this flicker must be an unusual scene.Xiao Wang? Normally people don't observe comets far away from the sun.The 1996D3 comet flicker light discovered this time was obtained by continuous and careful tracking observation.
Question: Which of the following most accurately summarizes the method Xiao Wang used to refute Xiao Chen's views?
Choices:
  A: Point out that the key concepts used by Xiao Chen are ambiguous.
  B: pointed out that Xiao Chen's argument is clearly lacking in persuasion.
  C: pointed out that Xiao Chen's arguments contradict themselves.
  D: Disagree with Xiao Chen's conclusion, and put forward another explanation for Xiao Chen's argument.E.Agree with Xiao Chen's conclusion, but put forward another explanation for Xiao Chen's argument.

Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
Upon further reflection, I realize I misinterpreted the question and Xiao Wang's rebuttal. The question asks about the method Xiao Wang used to refute Xiao Chen, not the content of the rebuttal itself.
Xiao Wang did not directly disagree with Xiao Chen's conclusion or provide an alternative explanation. Rather, Xiao Wang pointed out that Xiao Chen's argument lacked persuasion and jumped to conclusions without sufficient evidence. Just because people don't normally observe distant comets flickering doesn't necessarily mean this instance is unusual - it could simply be due to lack of continuous, careful observation in the past.
