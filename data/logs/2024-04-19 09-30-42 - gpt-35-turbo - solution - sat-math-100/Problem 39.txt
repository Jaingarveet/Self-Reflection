## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: $$\begin{aligned}& -3 x+y=6 \\& a x+2 y=4\end{aligned}$$In the system of equations above, $a$ is a constant. For which of the following values of $a$ does the system have no solution?
Choices:
  A: -6
  B: -3
  C: 3
  D: 6
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
We can solve the system of equations using elimination method.
If we multiply the first equation by $2$ and add it to the second equation, we get $ax+2y=4$ and $[REDACTED]x+4y=12$.
Simplifying the second equation, we get $[REDACTED]x+2y=4$.
Comparing this equation with the first equation, we see that they are not the same.
This means that the two equations represent two different lines and have either one solution or no solution.
For the system to have no solution, the two equations must represent parallel lines.
This happens when the coefficients of $x$ and $y$ in the two equations are proportional but the constant terms are not.
So, we need to find the value of $a$ such that $\frac{[REDACTED]}{a} = \frac{2}{4}$.
Simplifying, we get $[REDACTED] = a$.
