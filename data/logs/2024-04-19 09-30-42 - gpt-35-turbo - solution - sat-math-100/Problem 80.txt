## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: $$\begin{aligned}& k x-3 y=4 \\& 4 x-5 y=7\end{aligned}$$In the system of equations above, $k$ is a constant and $x$ and $y$ are variables. For what value of $k$ will the system of equations have no solution?
Choices:
  A: $\frac{12}{5}$
  B: $\frac{16}{7}$
  C: $-\frac{16}{7}$
  D: $-\frac{12}{5}$
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
We can use elimination method to solve the system of equations.
Multiplying the first equation by 4 and the second equation by $k$, we get:
$$\begin{aligned}& 4k x-12 y=16 \\& 4 x-5ky=7k\end{aligned}$$
Subtracting the first equation from the second, we get:
$$4x-5ky=7k-4kx+12y$$
$$4x+12y=(7k+5k)x$$
$$x=\frac{4+3k}{3k+5}$$
Substituting $x$ in the first equation, we get:
$$k\left(\frac{4+3k}{3k+5}\right)-3y=4$$
Simplifying, we get:
$$3k^2-16k+20=0$$
$$(3k-10)(k-2)=0$$
$k=\frac{10}{3}$ or $k=2$
If $k=\frac{10}{3}$, then the system of equations has a unique solution.
If $k=2$, then the system of equations has no solution.
