Question: The number of states that joined the United States between 1776 and 1849 is twice the number of states that joined between 1850 and 1900. If 30 states joined the United States between 1776 and 1849 and $x$ states joined between 1850 and 1900 , which of the following equations is true?
Choices:
  A: $30 x=2$
  B: $2 x=30$
  C: $\frac{x}{2}=30$
  D: $x+30=2$

Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
Let $y$ be the number of states that joined between 1850 and 1900.
We know that $30+x=2y$ and $y=2(30-x)$.
Simplifying the second equation, we get $y=60-2x$.
Equating the two expressions for $y$, we get $60-2x=30+x$.
Solving for $x$, we get $x=30$.
Therefore, the correct equation is $2x=60$, which simplifies to $x=30$.
