# Model: gpt-35-turbo | Agent: solution | Exam: sat-math-100 | Problem 48 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")

Topic: Math
Question: $$\begin{aligned}& 3 x+b=5 x-7 \\& 3 y+c=5 y-7\end{aligned}$$In the equations above, $b$ and $c$ are constants.If $b$ is $c$ minus $\frac{1}{2}$, which of the following is true?
Choices:
  A: $x$ is $y$ minus $\frac{1}{4}$.
  B: $x$ is $y$ minus $\frac{1}{2}$.
  C: $x$ is $y$ minus 1 .
  D: $x$ is $y$ plus $\frac{1}{2}$.
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
$b=c-\frac{1}{2}$
$b=-4x+7$
$c=-2y+7$
$c-\frac{1}{2}=-4x+7$
$c=-4x+\frac{15}{2}$
$3x+b=5x-7$
$3x+(-4x+7)=5x-7$
$3x-4x+7=5x-7$
$x=-7$
$3y+c=5y-7$
$3y+(-2y+7)=5y-7$
$3y-2y+7=5y-7$
$y=7$
$x-y=-14$
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
We are given two equations and two constants $b$ and $c$.
We are also given that $b=c-\frac{1}{2}$.
We need to find the relationship between $x$ and $y$.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
