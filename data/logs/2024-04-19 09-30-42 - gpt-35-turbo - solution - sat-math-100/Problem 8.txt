Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
Let's assume the original price of the laptop is $x$.
Alma got a 20% discount, so she paid 80% of the original price.
The price after the discount is $(0.8)x$.
The sales tax on the discounted price is 8% of $(0.8)x$.
The total amount Alma paid is $(0.8)x + 0.08(0.8)x = 0.88x$.
We need to express $x$ in terms of $p$.
$0.88x = p$
$x = \frac{p}{0.88}$
