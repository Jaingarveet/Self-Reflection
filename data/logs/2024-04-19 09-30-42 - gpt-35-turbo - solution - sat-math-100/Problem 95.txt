Question: $$H=1.88 L+32.01$$The formula above can be used to approximate the height $H$, in inches, of an adult male based on the length $L$, in inches, of his femur. What is the meaning of 1.88 in this context?
Choices:
  A: The approximate femur length, in inches, for a man with a height of 32.01 inches
  B: The approximate increase in a man's femur length, in inches, for each increase of 32.01 inches in his height
  C: The approximate increase in a man's femur length, in inches, for each one-inch increase in his height
  D: The approximate increase in a man's height, in inches, for each one-inch increase in his femur length
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
The formula is $H=1.88 L+32.01$.
The coefficient of $L$ is 1.88.
The coefficient of $L$ represents the approximate increase in a man's height, in inches, for each one-inch increase in his femur length.
Therefore, the meaning of 1.88 in this context is the approximate increase in a man's height, in inches, for each one-inch increase in his femur length.
