Question: Mr. Kohl has a beaker containing $n$ milliliters of solution to distribute to the students in his chemistry class. If he gives each student 3 milliliters of solution, he will have 5 milliliters left over. In order to give each student 4 milliliters of solution, he will need an additional 21 milliliters. How many students are in the class?
Choices:
  A: 16
  B: 21
  C: 23
  D: 26
## Assistant 2:
  Thought: Let's use the information given in the problem to find the number of students in the class.

If Mr. Kohl gives each student 3 milliliters of solution, he will have 5 milliliters left over. So, the total amount of solution he has is 5 milliliters + (n-3) milliliters, where n is the number of students.

Now, if he wants to give each student 4 milliliters of solution, he will need an additional 21 milliliters. So, the total amount of solution he needs is 5 milliliters + (n-3) milliliters + 21 milliliters = 26 milliliters.

Since he has 5 milliliters left over after giving 3 milliliters to each student, he must have had a total of 26 milliliters - 5 milliliters = 21 milliliters of solution to start with.

Therefore, the number of students in the class is 21.
