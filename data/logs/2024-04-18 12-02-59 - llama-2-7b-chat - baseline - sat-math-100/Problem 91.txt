## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: \begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|c||c|c|c|c|}\hline$n$ & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\\hline$f(n)$ & -2 & 1 & 4 & 7 \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}The table above shows some values of the linear function $f$. Which of the following defines $f$ ?
Choices:
  A: $f(n)=n-3$
  B: $f(n)=2 n-4$
  C: $f(n)=3 n-5$
  D: $f(n)=4 n-6$
## Assistant 2:
  Thought: The table provided shows the values of the linear function $f$ for different values of $n$. To determine the formula of $f$, we can analyze the pattern of the values in the table.

Action: Answer("B")

Explanation: The values of $f$ in the table are:

* $f(1) = -2$
* $f(2) = 1$
* $f(3) = 4$
* $f(4) = 7$

From the table, we can see that the formula of $f$ is $f(n) = 2n - 4$.
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
