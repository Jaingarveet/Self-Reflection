Question: The equation $\frac{24 x^{2}+25 x-47}{a x-2}=-8 x-3-\frac{53}{a x-2}$ is true for all values of $x \neq \frac{2}{a}$, where $a$ is a constant.What is the value of $a$ ?
Choices:
  A: -16
  B: -3
  C: 3
  D: 16
## Assistant 2:
  Thought: To solve for the value of $a$, we can first simplify the equation by combining like terms:

$$\frac{24 x^2 + 25 x - 47}{ax - 2} = -8x - 3 - \frac{53}{ax - 2}$$

$$\frac{24 x^2 + 25 x - 47}{a} = -8x - 3 - \frac{53}{a}$$

Now, we can see that the left-hand side of the equation is a constant times $x^2 + x - 47$, which is a quadratic expression. The solutions to this quadratic equation are $x = -3$ and $x = 2$.

So, the equation is true for all values of $x$ except when $x = \frac{2}{a}$, which means that $a$ must be a non-zero integer.

Action: Answer("C")

Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: B
