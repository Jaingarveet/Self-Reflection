Question: A rectangle was altered by increasing its length by 10 percent and decreasing its width by $p$ percent. If these alterations decreased the area of the rectangle by 12 percent, what is the value of $p$ ?
Choices:
  A: 12
  B: 15
  C: 20
  D: 22
## Assistant 2:
 Thought:
The area of a rectangle can be calculated using the formula: Area = Length x Width.
If the length of the rectangle is increased by 10%, then the new length is:
Length = Old length x 1.10

If the width of the rectangle is decreased by $p$%, then the new width is:
Width = Old width x (1 - $p$/100)

The area of the rectangle before the alterations is:
Area = Length x Width = Old length x Old width

The area of the rectangle after the alterations is:
Area = Length x Width = New length x New width

The question states that the area of the rectangle after the alterations is decreased by 12%. This means that the new area is:
New area = Old area x (1 - 0.12) = Old area x 0.88

We are given that the old area is 100 square units. Therefore, the new area is:
New area = 100 x 0.88 = 88 square units

Now, we need to find the value of $p$ that will give us an area of 88 square units after the alterations.

Area = Length x Width = New length x New width

New length = Old length x 1.10 = 1.10 x Old length
New width = Old width x (1 - $p$/100) = Old width x (1 - $p$/100)

Substituting the values, we get:

New area = (1.10 x Old length) x (Old width x (1 - $p$/100))
= 1.10 x Old area x (1 - $p$/100)

We are given that the area after the alterations is 88 square units, so we can set up the equation:
1.10 x Old area x (1 - $p$/100) = 88

Solving for $p$, we get:
$p$ = (88 / 1.10) - (Old area / Old length)
= (88 / 1.10) - (100 / Old length)
= 6.67%

Therefore, the value of $p$ that will give us an area of 88 square units after the alterations is 6.67%.
