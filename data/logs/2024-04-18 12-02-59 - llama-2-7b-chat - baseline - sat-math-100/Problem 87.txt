  Great, let's solve this problem step by step!

The parabola with equation $y = (x - 11)^2$ intersects the line with equation $y = 25$ at two points, $A$ and $B$.

We need to find the length of the line segment $\overline{A B}$.

First, let's find the coordinates of points $A$ and $B$.

The equation of the parabola is:

$$y = (x - 11)^2$$

So, the coordinates of point $A$ are:

$$A = (x_A, y_A) = (11, 25)$$

The coordinates of point $B$ are:

$$B = (x_B, y_B) = (x_A + 11, y_A + 25)$$

Now, we need to find the length of the line segment $\overline{A B}$.

The distance formula is:

$$distance = \sqrt{(x_B - x_A)^2 + (y_B - y_A)^2}$$

Substituting the coordinates of points $A$ and $B$, we get:

$$distance = \sqrt{(x_B - x_A)^2 + (y_B - y_A)^2}$$

Simplifying and calculating the distance, we get:

$$distance = \sqrt{((11 - 11)^2 + (25 - 25)^2) = 14}$$

So, the length of the line segment $\overline{A B}$ is 14 units.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B): 12.
