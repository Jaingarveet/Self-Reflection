## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: $$\begin{aligned}& 2 x-3 y=-14 \\& 3 x-2 y=-6\end{aligned}$$If $(x, y)$ is a solution to the system of equations above, what is the value of $x-y$ ?
Choices:
  A: -20
  B: $\quad-8$
  C: -4
  D: 8
## Assistant 2:
  Thought: To find the value of $x-y$, we need to solve the system of equations.

For the first equation, $2x - 3y = -14$, we can solve for $x$ by adding $3y$ to both sides:

$2x = -14 + 3y$
$2x = -11$

Now, substituting this value of $2x$ into the second equation, $3x - 2y = -6$, we get:

$3(-\11) - 2y = -6$
$3(-11) - 2y = -6$
-$33 + 2y = -6$
-$31 = -6$

So, $y = 6$.

Now, we can find the value of $x-y$ by substituting $y = 6$ into the first equation:

$2x - 3(6) = -14$
$2x - 18 = -14$
$2x = -32$

So, the value of $x-y$ is $x = -32$.

Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
