## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: $$\begin{aligned}& k x-3 y=4 \\& 4 x-5 y=7\end{aligned}$$In the system of equations above, $k$ is a constant and $x$ and $y$ are variables. For what value of $k$ will the system of equations have no solution?
Choices:
  A: $\frac{12}{5}$
  B: $\frac{16}{7}$
  C: $-\frac{16}{7}$
  D: $-\frac{12}{5}$
## Assistant 2:
  Thought: To find the value of $k$ that will result in no solution for the system of equations, we need to find a value that makes one of the equations inconsistent.

Let's solve the first equation for $x$:

$$kx - 3y = 4 \Rightarrow x = \frac{4k}{3} + \frac{7}{3}y$$

Now, substitute this expression for $x$ into the second equation:

$$4(\frac{4k}{3} + \frac{7}{3}y) - 5y = 7 \Rightarrow \frac{16k}{9} + \frac{21}{3}y = 7$$

Now, we can see that if $k = -\frac{16}{7}$, then the equation will be inconsistent, as $\frac{16k}{9} = -\frac{16}{7}$ and $\frac{21}{3}y = 7$. Therefore, the value of $k$ that will result in no solution is $k = -\frac{16}{7}$.

Action: Answer("C")
