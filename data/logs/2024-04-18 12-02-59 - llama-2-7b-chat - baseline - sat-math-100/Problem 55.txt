## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: $$y=-(x-3)^{2}+a$$In the equation above, $a$ is a constant. The graph of the equation in the $x y$-plane is a parabola. Which of the following is true about the parabola?
Choices:
  A: Its minimum occurs at $(-3, a)$.
  B: Its minimum occurs at $(3, a)$.
  C: Its maximum occurs at $(-3, a)$.
  D: Its maximum occurs at $(3, a)$.
## Assistant 2:
  Thought: The equation $y = - (x - 3)^2 + a$ is a parabola. To determine the minimum or maximum value of the parabola, we need to find the stationary points of the function.

Action: Let's find the stationary points of the function $y = - (x - 3)^2 + a$.

The stationary points of the function are the points where the derivative of the function is equal to zero.

$$\frac{dy}{dx} = -4x + 2a = 0$$

Solving for $x$, we get:

$$x = -4a/3$$

Now, we need to determine the minimum or maximum value of the parabola.

If the stationary point is a minimum, then the value of $y$ is a minimum, and if it's a maximum, then the value of $y$ is a maximum.

In this case, the stationary point is a minimum, so the minimum value of the parabola is:

$$y = - (x - 3)^2 + a = - (x - 3)^2 \times min(a)$$

Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("A: Its minimum occurs at $(-3, a)$")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
