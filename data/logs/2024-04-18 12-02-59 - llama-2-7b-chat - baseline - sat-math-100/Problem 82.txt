Topic: Math
Question: $$y=a(x-2)(x+4)$$In the quadratic equation above, $a$ is a nonzero constant. The graph of the equation in the $x y$-plane is a parabola with vertex $(c, d)$. Which of the following is equal to $d$ ?
Choices:
  A: $-9 a$
  B: $-8 a$
  C: $-5 a$
  D: $-2 a$
## Assistant 2:
  Thought: The given quadratic equation can be factored as $y = a(x-2)(x+4)$. Since the vertex of the parabola is at $(c, d)$, we can set $y = 0$ and solve for $x$.

Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
