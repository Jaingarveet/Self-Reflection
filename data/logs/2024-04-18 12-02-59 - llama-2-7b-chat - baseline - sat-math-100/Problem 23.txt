Question: A painter will paint $n$ walls with the same size and shape in a building using a specific brand of paint. The painter's fee can be calculated by the expression $n K \ell h$, where $n$ is the number of walls, $K$ is a constant with units of dollars per square foot, $\ell$ is the length of each wall in feet, and $h$ is the height of each wall in feet. If the customer asks the painter to use a more expensive brand of paint, which of the factors in the expression would change?
Choices:
  A: $h$
  B: $\ell$
  C: $K$
  D: $n$
## Assistant 2:
  Thought: The painter's fee is determined by the number of walls ($n$), the length of each wall ($\ell$), and the height of each wall ($h$), as well as a constant ($K$) that represents the painter's fee per square foot. If the customer asks the painter to use a more expensive brand of paint, the only factor that would change is the constant ($K$).

Action: Answer("C")
