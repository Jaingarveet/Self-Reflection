## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: If $3 x-y=12$, what is the value of $\frac{8^{x}}{2^{y}} ?$
Choices:
  A: $2^{12}$
  B: 4
  C: $8^{2}$
  D: The value cannot be determined from the information given.
## Assistant 2:
  Thought: To solve for the value of $\frac{8^{x}}{2^{y}}$ based on the given equation $3x - y = 12$, we need to isolate $x$ on one side of the equation and $y$ on the other side.

First, we can subtract $y$ from both sides of the equation to get:

$3x = 12 + y$

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by $3$ to get:

$x = \frac{12 + y}{3}$

Now, we can take the $y$th root of both sides of the equation to get:

$\frac{8^{x}}{2^{y}} = \frac{8}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{12 + y}{3} = \frac{8}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{12}{3} + \frac{8}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{y}{3}$

Therefore, the value of $\frac{8^{x}}{2^{y}}$ is:

Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: A
