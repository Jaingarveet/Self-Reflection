Question: $$\begin{aligned}1 \text { decagram } & =10 \text { grams } \\1,000 \text { milligrams } & =1 \text { gram }\end{aligned}$$A hospital stores one type of medicine in 2-decagram containers.

  D: 20,000
## Assistant 2:
  Thought:
We know that 1 decagram = 10 grams, and 1,000 milligrams = 1 gram.
So, if we have 2 decagrams of medicine, it means we have 20 grams of medicine.
Now, we want to know how many 1-milligram doses are in 2 decagrams of medicine.
Action: Answer("C")
