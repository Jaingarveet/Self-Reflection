Question: \begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}\cline { 2 - 3 }\multicolumn{1}{c|}{} & \multicolumn{2}{c|}{Handedness} \\\hlineGender & Left & Right \\\hline\hlineFemale &  &  \\\hlineMale &  &  \\\hline\hlineTotal & 18 & 122 \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}The incomplete table above summarizes the number of left-handed students and right-handed students by gender for the eighth-grade students atKeisel Middle School. There are 5 times as many right-handed female students as there are left-handed female students, and there are 9 times as many right-handed male students as there are left-handed male students. If there is a total of 18 left-handed students and 122 right-handed students in the school, which of the following is closest to the probability that a right-handed student selected at random is female? (Note: Assume that none of the eighth-grade students are both right-handed and left-handed.)
Choices:
  A: 0.410
  B: 0.357
  C: 0.333
  D: 0.250
## Assistant 2:
  Great, let's solve this problem step by step!

From the table, we can see that there are 18 left-handed students and 122 right-handed students in the school.

We are asked to find the probability that a right-handed student selected at random is female.

Let's use the information given in the problem to find the number of female right-handed students:

Female right-handed students = 122 - 18 = 104

Now, we can find the probability of a right-handed student being female:

Probability of a right-handed student being female = Number of female right-handed students / Total number of right-handed students
= 104 / 122
= 0.86

So, the closest answer is (B): 0.357.

Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: A
