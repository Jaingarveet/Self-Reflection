Question: The volume of a sphere is given by the formula $V=\frac{4}{3} \pi r^{3}$, where $r$ is the radius of the sphere. Which of the following gives the radius of the sphere in terms of the volume of the sphere?
Choices:
  A: $\frac{4 \pi}{3 V}$
  B: $\frac{3 V}{4 \pi}$
  C: $\sqrt[3]{\frac{4 \pi}{3 V}}$
  D: $\sqrt[3]{\frac{3 V}{4 \pi}}$
## Assistant 2:
  Thought: We are given the formula for the volume of a sphere, $V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^{3}$, where $r$ is the radius of the sphere. We want to find an expression for the radius of the sphere in terms of the volume of the sphere.

Action: Let's substitute the formula for the volume of a sphere into the given equation:

$V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^{3}$

Now, let's divide both sides of the equation by $\pi r^{3}$:

$r = \frac{3}{4} \pi V$

Therefore, the radius of the sphere is proportional to the volume of the sphere, with a constant factor of $\frac{3}{4}$.

Action: Choose the correct answer from the choices given:

A: $\frac{4 \pi}{3 V}$

Explanation: The correct answer is (A) $\frac{4 \pi}{3 V}$.
## Result:
Agent Answer: None
Correct Answer: D
