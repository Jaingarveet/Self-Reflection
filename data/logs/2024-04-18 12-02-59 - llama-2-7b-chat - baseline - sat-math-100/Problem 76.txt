Question: If $\frac{5}{x}=\frac{15}{x+20}$, what is the value of $\frac{x}{5} ?$
Choices:
  A: 10
  B: 5
  C: 2
  D: $\frac{1}{2}$
## Assistant 2:
  Thought: We are given the equation $\frac{5}{x} = \frac{15}{x+20}$. To solve for $x$, we can first simplify the left-hand side of the equation:

$$\frac{5}{x} = \frac{15}{x+20} \Rightarrow \frac{5x}{x+20} = 15$$

Now, we can isolate $x$ by dividing both sides of the equation by $\frac{5x}{x+20}$:

$$x + 20 = \frac{15}{5x} \Rightarrow x + 20 = \frac{3}{x}$$

Now, we can solve for $x$ by subtracting $20$ from both sides of the equation:

$$x = \frac{3}{3} - 20 = \frac{3}{20}$$

Therefore, the value of $x$ is $\frac{3}{20}$.

Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
