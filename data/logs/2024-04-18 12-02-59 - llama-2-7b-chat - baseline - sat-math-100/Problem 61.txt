Context: \begin{center}.\begin{tabular}{|l|c|}.\hline.\multicolumn{1}{|c|}{Planet} & Acceleration due to gravity $\left(\frac{\mathrm{m}}{\mathrm{sec}^{2}}\right)$ \\.\hline\hline.Mercury & 3.6 \\.\hline.Venus & 8.9 \\.\hline.Earth & 9.8 \\.\hline.Mars & 3.8 \\.\hline.Jupiter & 26.0 \\.\hline.Saturn & 11.1 \\.\hline.Uranus & 10.7 \\.\hline.Neptune & 14.1 \\.\hline.\end{tabular}.\end{center}.The chart above shows approximations of the acceleration due to gravity in meters per.second squared $\left(\frac{\mathrm{m}}{\sec ^{2}}\right)$ for the eight planets in our solar system. The weight of an object on a given planet can be found by using the formula $W=m g$, where $W$ is the weight of the object measured in newtons, $m$ is the mass of the object measured in kilograms, and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity on the planet measured in $\frac{m}{\sec ^{2}}$
Question: What is the weight, in newtons, of an object on Mercury with a mass of 90 kilograms?
Choices:
  A: 25
  B: 86
  C: 101
  D: 324
## Assistant 2:
  Great, let's solve this problem step by step!

The formula to find the weight of an object on a planet is:

W = mg

Where W is the weight in newtons (N), m is the mass of the object in kilograms (kg), and g is the acceleration due to gravity on the planet in meters per second squared (m/s^2).

From the table, we can see that the acceleration due to gravity on Mercury is 3.6 m/s^2.

So, to find the weight of an object on Mercury with a mass of 90 kg, we can plug in the values:

W = 90 kg x 3.6 m/s^2 = 324 N

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 324 N.
## Result:
Agent Answer: None
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
