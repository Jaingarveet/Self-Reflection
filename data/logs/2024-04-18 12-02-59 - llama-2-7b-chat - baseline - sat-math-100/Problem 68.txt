Question: $$0.10 x+0.20 y=0.18(x+y)$$Clayton will mix $x$ milliliters of a $10 \%$ by mass saline solution with $y$ milliliters of a $20 \%$ by mass saline solution in order to create an $18 \%$ by mass saline solution. The equation above represents this situation. If Clayton uses 100 milliliters of the $20 \%$ by mass saline solution, how many milliliters of the $10 \%$ by mass saline solution must he use?
Choices:
  A: 5
  B: 25
  C: 50
  D: 100
## Assistant 2:
  Great, let's solve this problem step by step!

The equation given is:

$$0.10x + 0.20y = 0.18(x + y)$$

We are given that Clayton uses 100 milliliters of the $20 \%$ by mass saline solution. To find out how much of the $10 \%$ by mass saline solution he must use, we can substitute the value of $y$ in terms of $x$.

From the equation, we have:

$$0.10x + 0.20y = 0.18(x + y)$$

Rearranging the equation to isolate $x$, we get:

$$0.10x = 0.18(x + y) - 0.20y$$

Now, we can substitute the value of $y$ in terms of $x$, which we are given:

$$0.10x = 0.18x + 0.20y - 0.20y$$

Simplifying the equation, we get:

$$0.10x = 0.18x$$

Now, we can solve for $x$ by dividing both sides of the equation by $0.10$:

$$x = 0.18x / 0.10$$

Now, we are given that Clayton uses 100 milliliters of the $20 \%$ by mass saline solution. We can substitute this value of $y$ in terms of $x$:

$$y = 100 / 0.20 = 500$$

Now, we can use the value of $x$ we just found to solve for the amount of the $10 \%$ by mass saline solution that Clayton must use:

$$x = 0.18x / 0.10 = 180$$

Therefore, the answer is (C): 500 milliliters of the $10 \%$ by mass saline solution.
