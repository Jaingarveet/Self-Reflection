Question: $$C=\frac{5}{9}(F-32)$$The equation above shows how a temperature $F$, measured in degrees Fahrenheit, relates to a temperature $C$, measured in degrees Celsius. Based on the equation, which of the following must be true?I. A temperature increase of 1 degree Fahrenheit is equivalent to a temperature increase of $\frac{5}{9}$ degree Celsius.II. A temperature increase of 1 degree Celsius is equivalent to a temperature increase of 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit.III. A temperature increase of $\frac{5}{9}$ degree Fahrenheit is equivalent to a temperature increase of 1 degree Celsius.
Choices:
  A: I only
  B: II only
  C: III only
  D: I and II only
## Assistant 2:
  Thought: Let's analyze the equation and determine which statements must be true based on the given equation.

$$C = \frac{5}{9}(F - 32)$$

We know that $C$ is measured in degrees Celsius and $F$ is measured in degrees Fahrenheit. The equation states that $C$ is equal to $\frac{5}{9}$ times the difference between $F$ and $32$.

Now, let's consider the statements:

I. A temperature increase of 1 degree Fahrenheit is equivalent to a temperature increase of $\frac{5}{9}$ degree Celsius.

From the equation, we can see that for every 1 degree increase in $F$, $C$ increases by $\frac{5}{9}$ degrees. Therefore, statement I must be true.

II. A temperature increase of 1 degree Celsius is equivalent to a temperature increase of 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit.

We can calculate the value of $\frac{5}{9}$ by dividing the number of degrees Celsius by the number of degrees Fahrenheit:

$\frac{5}{9} = \frac{1}{1.8}$

Therefore, statement II must be false.

III. A temperature increase of $\frac{5}{9}$ degree Fahrenheit is equivalent to a temperature increase of 1 degree Celsius.

From the equation, we can see that for every $\frac{5}{9}$ degree increase in $F$, $C$ increases by 1 degree. Therefore, statement III must be true.

Action: Answer("D")
