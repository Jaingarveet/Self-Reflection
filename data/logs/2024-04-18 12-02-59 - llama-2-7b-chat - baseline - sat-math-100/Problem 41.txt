## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:
Topic: Geography
Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")

Topic: Math
Question: \begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}\hline$x$ & $f(x)$ \\\hline0 & 3 \\\hline2 & 1 \\\hline4 & 0 \\\hline5 & -2 \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}The function $f$ is defined by a polynomial. Some values of $x$ and $f(x)$ are shown in the table above. Which of the following must be a factor of $f(x)$ ?
Choices:
  A: $x-2$
  B: $x-3$
  C: $x-4$
  D: $x-5$
## Assistant 2:
  Thought: The given table provides information about the values of $f(x)$ and $x$. To determine the factor of $f(x)$, we can use the following steps:

1. Identify the constant term of the polynomial: $f(0) = 3$.
2. Identify the degree of the polynomial: The degree of the polynomial is 1, since the highest power of $x$ is 1.
3. Determine the factors of the polynomial: A polynomial of degree 1 can be factored as $x - r$, where $r$ is a constant.

Using these steps, we can determine that the factor of $f(x)$ must be $x - 2$.

Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: C
