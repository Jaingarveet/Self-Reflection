Question: A book was on sale for $40 \%$ off its original price. If the sale price of the book was $\$ 18.00$, what was the original price of the book? (Assume there is no sales tax.)
Choices:
  A: $\$ 7.20$
  B: $\$ 10.80$
  C: $\$ 30.00$
  D: $\$ 45.00$
## Assistant 2:
  Great, let's solve this problem step by step!

The question states that the book was on sale for $40\%$ off its original price, so we can start by calculating the discount:

Discount = $40\%$ = $0.40$

Now, we can use the discount to find the original price of the book:

Original price = Sale price x (1 - Discount)
= $18.00$ x (1 - $0.40$)
= $18.00$ x $0.60$
= $10.80$

So, the original price of the book was $10.80$.

Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
