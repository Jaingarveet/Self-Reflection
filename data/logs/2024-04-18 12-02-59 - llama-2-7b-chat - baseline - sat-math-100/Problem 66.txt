The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: In the $x y$-plane, the graph of the function $f(x)=x^{2}+5 x+4$ has two $x$-intercepts. What is the distance between the $x$-intercepts?
Choices:
  A: 1
  B: 2
  C: 3
  D: 4
## Assistant 2:
  Thought: To find the distance between the $x$-intercepts of the graph of $f(x) = x^{2} + 5x + 4$, we need to use the formula:

Distance = âˆš(y2 - y1)

where (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are the coordinates of the two $x$-intercepts.

Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
