Context: $$.\begin{aligned}.& S(P)=\frac{1}{2} P+40 \\.& D(P)=220-P.\end{aligned}.$$.The quantity of a product supplied and the quantity of the product demanded in an economic market are functions of the price of the product. The functions above are the estimated supply and demand functions for a certain product. The function $S(P)$ gives the quantity of the product supplied to the market when the price is $P$ dollars, and the function $D(P)$ gives the quantity of the product demanded by the market when the price is $P$ dollars.
Question: Graphene, which is used in the manufacture of integrated circuits, is so thin that a sheet weighing one ounce can cover up to 7 football fields. If a football field has an area of approximately $1 \frac{1}{3}$ acres, about how many acres could 48 ounces of graphene cover?
Choices:
  A: 250
  B: 350
  C: 450
  D: 1,350
## Assistant 2:
  Great, let's solve this problem step by step!

We are given the following information:

* The quantity of a product supplied (S(P)) = $\frac{1}{2} P + 40$
* The quantity of the product demanded (D(P)) = $220 - P$
* A sheet of graphene weighing one ounce can cover up to 7 football fields

Now, we need to find out how many acres a certain amount of graphene can cover. Let's use the information given in the question:

* The area of a football field is approximately $1 \frac{1}{3}$ acres

So, we can calculate the area of one football field as follows:

Area of one football field = $1 \frac{1}{3}$ acres

Now, let's find out how many acres 48 ounces of graphene can cover:

48 ounces of graphene = ? acres

We are given that a sheet of graphene weighing one ounce can cover up to 7 football fields. So, we can calculate the area of one ounce of graphene as follows:

Area of one ounce of graphene = 7 football fields

Now, we can convert the area of one ounce of graphene to acres:

Area of one ounce of graphene in acres = $7 \times \frac{1}{3}$ acres/football field = 2.33 acres/ounce

Now, we have the information we need to find out how many acres 48 ounces of graphene can cover:

48 ounces of graphene = ? acres

48 ounces = 48 $\times$ 2.33 acres/ounce = 1,104 acres

So, 48 ounces of graphene can cover approximately 1,104 acres.

Now, let's choose the correct answer from the options given in the question:

B) 350 acres is the closest answer to the actual value of 1,104 acres.

Therefore, the answer is (B) 350 acres.
