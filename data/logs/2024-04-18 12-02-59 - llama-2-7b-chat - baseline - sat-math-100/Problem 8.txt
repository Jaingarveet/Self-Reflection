Question: Alma bought a laptop computer at a store that gave a 20 percent discount off its original price. The total amount she paid to the cashier was $p$ dollars, including an 8 percent sales tax on the discounted price. Which of the following represents the original price of the computer in terms of $p$ ?
Choices:
  A: $0.88 p$
  B: $\frac{p}{0.88}$
  C: $(0.8)(1.08) p$
  D: $\frac{p}{(0.8)(1.08)}$
## Assistant 2:
  Thought:
Alma paid $p$ dollars to the cashier, including an 8% sales tax on the discounted price. The original price of the laptop computer was 20% discounted, so the discounted price is:

Discounted price = Original price x (1 - 0.20)
= Original price x 0.80

The total amount Alma paid to the cashier is:

Total amount = Discounted price + Sales tax
= $0.80p + (0.08)p
= $0.88p

So, the original price of the laptop computer in terms of $p$ is:

Original price = $p / $0.88
= $p / (0.88)
= B: $\frac{p}{0.88}$

Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
