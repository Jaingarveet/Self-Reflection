## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: $$\begin{array}{r}3 x+4 y=-23 \\2 y-x=-19\end{array}$$What is the solution $(x, y)$ to the system of equations above?
Choices:
  A: $(-5,-2)$
  B: $(3,-8)$
  C: $(4,-6)$
  D: $(9,-6)$
## Assistant 2:
  Thought: To solve the system of equations, we need to find the values of $x$ and $y$ that make both equations true.

Action:

For the first equation, $3x + 4y = -23$, we can solve for $y$ by subtracting $3x$ from both sides: $y = -23 - 3x$.

Now, substitute this expression for $y$ into the second equation: $2y - x = -19$.

Substituting $y = -23 - 3x$, we get: $2(-23 - 3x) - x = -19$.

Expanding and simplifying, we get: $46 - 3x = -19$.

Solving for $x$, we get: $x = 27$.

Now, we can find $y$ by substituting $x = 27$ into the first equation: $3(27) + 4y = -23$.

Solving for $y$, we get: $y = -14$.

Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
