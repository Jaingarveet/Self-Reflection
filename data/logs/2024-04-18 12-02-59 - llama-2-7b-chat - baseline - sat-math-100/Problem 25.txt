The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: $$\begin{aligned}y & =x^{2} \\2 y+6 & =2(x+3)\end{aligned}$$If $(x, y)$ is a solution of the system of equations above and $x>0$, what is the value of $x y$ ?
Choices:
  A: 1
  B: 2
  C: 3
  D: 9
## Assistant 2:
  Thought:
The first equation can be rewritten as $y = x^2$.
The second equation can be rewritten as $2y + 6 = 2x + 6$.
We can solve the system of equations by substituting the expression for $y$ from the first equation into the second equation.

Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
