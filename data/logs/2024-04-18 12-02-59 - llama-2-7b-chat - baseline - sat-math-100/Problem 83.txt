Question: A retail company has 50 large stores located in different areas throughout a state. A researcher for the company believes that employee job satisfaction varies greatly from store to store. Which of the following sampling methods is most appropriate to estimate the proportion of all employees of the company who are satisfied with their job?
Choices:
  A: Selecting one of the 50 stores at random and then surveying each employee at that store
  B: Selecting 10 employees from each store at random and then surveying each employee selected
  C: Surveying the 25 highest-paid employees and the 25 lowest-paid employees
  D: Creating a website on which employees can express their opinions and then using the first 50 responses
## Assistant 2:
 Thought: To estimate the proportion of all employees of the company who are satisfied with their job, we need to use a sampling method that is representative of the entire population of employees.

Option A is not appropriate because it involves selecting only one store at random and surveying all employees at that store. This does not provide a representative sample of the entire population of employees.

Option B is also not appropriate because it involves selecting 10 employees from each store at random, which may not be representative of the entire population of employees.

Option C is also not appropriate because it involves surveying a limited number of employees (25 highest-paid and 25 lowest-paid) instead of a random sample of all employees.

Option D is also not appropriate because it involves using a website for employees to express their opinions, which may not be a reliable or representative method of sampling.

Therefore, the most appropriate sampling method is option B, which involves selecting 10 employees from each store at random and then surveying each employee selected. This method will provide a more representative sample of the entire population of employees.

Action: Answer("B")
