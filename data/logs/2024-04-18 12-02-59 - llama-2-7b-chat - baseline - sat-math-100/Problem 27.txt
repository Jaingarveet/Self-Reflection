Question: If $16+4 x$ is 10 more than 14 , what is the value of $8 x$ ?
Choices:
  A: 2
  B: 6
  C: 16

## Assistant 2:
  Thought:
If $16 + 4x$ is 10 more than $14$, then we can set up the equation:

$16 + 4x = 14 + 10$

Simplifying the equation:

$4x = 40$

Dividing both sides by $4$:

$x = 10$

Action: Answer("B")
