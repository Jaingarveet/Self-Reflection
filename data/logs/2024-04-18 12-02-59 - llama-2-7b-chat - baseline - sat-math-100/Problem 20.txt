## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Topic: Math
Question: $$\begin{aligned}& 2.4 x-1.5 y=0.3 \\& 1.6 x+0.5 y=-1.3\end{aligned}$$The system of equations above is graphed in the $x y$-plane. What is the $x$-coordinate of the intersection point $(x, y)$ of the system?
Choices:
  A: -0.5
  B: -0.25
  C: 0.8
  D: 1.75
## Assistant 2:
  Thought: To find the $x$-coordinate of the intersection point of the system of equations, we need to solve the first equation for $x$ and then substitute the solution into the second equation.

Action:

Solve the first equation for $x$:

$2.4x - 1.5y = 0.3$

$x = 0.3 / 2.4$

$x = 0.125$

Now, substitute the value of $x$ into the second equation:

$1.6x + 0.5y = -1.3$

$1.6(0.125) + 0.5y = -1.3$

$0.19 + 0.5y = -1.3$

$0.7y = -1.41$

$y = -2.02$

Now, find the $x$-coordinate of the intersection point:

$x = 0.125$

Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
