Question: $$h=3 a+28.6$$A pediatrician uses the model above to estimate the height $h$ of a boy, in inches, in terms of the boy's age $a$, in years, between the ages of 2 and 5. Based on the model, what is the estimated increase, in inches, of a boy's height each year?
Choices:
  A: 3
  B: $\quad 5.7$
  C: 9.5
  D: 14.3
## Assistant 2:
  Thought:
The model given in the question can be simplified as:

$$h = 3a + 28.6$$

To find the increase in height per year, we need to find the derivative of the function with respect to age.

Action:

$$\frac{d}{da} (3a + 28.6) = 3$$

Therefore, the estimated increase in height per year is 3 inches.

Answer: (B) $5.7$ inches.
