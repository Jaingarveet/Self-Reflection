Question: $$\begin{aligned}& b=2.35+0.25 x \\& c=1.75+0.40 x\end{aligned}$$In the equations above, $b$ and $c$ represent the price per pound, in dollars, of beef and chicken, respectively, $x$ weeks after July 1 during last summer. What was the price per pound of beef when it was equal to the price per pound of chicken?
Choices:
  A: $\$ 2.60$
  B: $\$ 2.85$
  C: $\$ 2.95$
  D: $\$ 3.35$
## Assistant 2:
  Thought: Let's solve for $b$ in terms of $x$:

$$b = 2.35 + 0.25x$$

Now, substitute the expression for $b$ into the second equation:

$$c = 1.75 + 0.40x$$

Now, solve for $x$ in terms of $c$:

$$x = \frac{c - 1.75}{0.40}$$

Now, substitute the expression for $x$ into the first equation:

$$b = 2.35 + 0.25\left(\frac{c - 1.75}{0.40}\right)$$

Now, simplify and solve for $b$ in terms of $c$:

$$b = 2.35 + 0.25\left(\frac{c - 1.75}{0.40}\right) = 2.35 + 0.25c$$

Now, compare the expressions for $b$ and $c$ when $c = b$:

$$c = b \Rightarrow 2.35 + 0.25c = 2.35 + 0.25b$$

Now, solve for $c$ in terms of $b$:

$$c = b \Rightarrow c = 2.35 + 0.25b$$

Now, substitute the expression for $c$ into the first equation:

$$b = 2.35 + 0.25\left(2.35 + 0.25b\right)$$

Now, simplify and solve for $b$ in terms of $c$:

$$b = 2.35 + 0.25c \Rightarrow b = 2.35 + 0.25\left(2.35 + 0.25b\right)$$

Now, simplify and solve for $b$ in terms of $c$:

$$b = 2.35 + 0.25c \Rightarrow b = 2.35 + 0.25\left(2.35 + 0.25b\right) \Rightarrow b = 2.35 + 0.25\left(4.75 + 0.25b\right)$$

Now, simplify and solve for $b$ in terms of $c$:

$$b = 2.35 + 0.25c \Rightarrow b = 2.35 + 0.25\left(4.75 + 0.25b\right) \Rightarrow b = 2.35 + 0.25\left(4.75 + 0.25b\right) \Rightarrow b = 6.60$$

Now, compare the expressions for $b$ and $c$ when $c = b$:

$$c = b \Rightarrow 2.35 + 0.25c = 2.35 + 0.25b \Rightarrow 2.35 + 0.25c = 6.60$$

Now, solve for $c$ in terms of $b$:

$$c = b \Rightarrow c = 2.35 + 0.25b \Rightarrow c = 2.35 + 0.25\left(6.60\right) = 8.95$$

Now, answer the question:

The price per pound of beef when it was equal to the price per pound of chicken is:

$$A: \$ 2.60$$

Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
