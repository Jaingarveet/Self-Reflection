Topic: Math
Question: The volume of right circular cylinder A is 22 cubic centimeters. What is the volume, in cubic centimeters, of a right circular cylinder with twice the radius and half the height of cylinder A?
Choices:
  A: 11
  B: 22
  C: 44
  D: 66
## Assistant 2:
  Thought: The volume of a right circular cylinder can be calculated using the formula V = Ï€r^2h, where r is the radius of the cylinder and h is its height.

If the radius of the first cylinder is twice the radius of the second cylinder, and the height of the first cylinder is half the height of the second cylinder, then we can use this information to find the volume of the second cylinder.

Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
