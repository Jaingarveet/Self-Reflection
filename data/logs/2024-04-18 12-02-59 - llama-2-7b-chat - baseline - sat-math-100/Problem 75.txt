Topic: Math
Context: $$.\begin{aligned}.& S(P)=\frac{1}{2} P+40 \\.& D(P)=220-P.\end{aligned}.$$.The quantity of a product supplied and the quantity of the product demanded in an economic market are functions of the price of the product. The functions above are the estimated supply and demand functions for a certain product. The function $S(P)$ gives the quantity of the product supplied to the market when the price is $P$ dollars, and the function $D(P)$ gives the quantity of the product demanded by the market when the price is $P$ dollars.
Question: At what price will the quantity of the product supplied to the market equal the quantity of the product demanded by the market?
Choices:
  A: $\$ 90$
  B: $\$ 120$
  C: $\$ 133$
  D: $\$ 155$
## Assistant 2:
  Great, let's solve this problem step by step!

We are given two functions: $S(P) = \frac{1}{2}P + 40$ and $D(P) = 220 - P$.

To find the price at which the quantity of the product supplied equals the quantity of the product demanded, we need to set the two functions equal to each other and solve for $P$.

So, we can write:

$$S(P) = D(P)$$

Expanding the functions, we get:

$$\frac{1}{2}P + 40 = 220 - P$$

Now, we can solve for $P$ by subtracting $40$ from both sides:

$$\frac{1}{2}P = 180$$

Dividing both sides by $\frac{1}{2}$, we get:

$$P = 180$$

Therefore, the price at which the quantity of the product supplied equals the quantity of the product demanded is $P = 180$.

So, the correct answer is (B): $\$120$.
