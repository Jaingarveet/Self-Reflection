## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")

Topic: Math
Question: The line $y=k x+4$, where $k$ is a constant, is graphed in the $x y$-plane. If the line contains the point $(c, d)$, where $c \neq 0$ and $d \neq 0$, what is the slope of the line in terms of $c$ and $d$ ?
Choices:
  A: $\frac{d-4}{c}$
  B: $\frac{c-4}{d}$
  C: $\frac{4-d}{c}$
  D: $\frac{4-c}{d}$
## Assistant 2:
  Thought: 
The slope of the line can be found using the point-slope form of a line, which is given by $y - y1 = m(x - x1)$, where (x1, y1) is a point on the line and m is the slope.

In this case, the line passes through the point $(c, d)$, so we can use this point to find the slope.

Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
