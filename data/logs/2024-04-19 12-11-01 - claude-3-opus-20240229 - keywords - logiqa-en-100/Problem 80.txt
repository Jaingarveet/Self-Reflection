## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The finance department is on the floor directly above the planning department (given).
2. The administration department is above the planning department but below the human resources department (given). 
3. The human resources department and sales department cannot be on adjacent floors (given).
4. If the finance department is directly above planning (1), and administration is above planning but below HR (2), then the order so far must be:
   Planning
   Finance 
   Administration
   Human Resources
5. The sales department can't be directly above or below HR (3). The only spot left for sales is the very top. 
6. That leaves R&D to go between HR and Sales.
So the final order from bottom to top is:
Planning Department 
Finance Department
Administration Department 
Human Resources Department
R&D Department
Sales Department
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
