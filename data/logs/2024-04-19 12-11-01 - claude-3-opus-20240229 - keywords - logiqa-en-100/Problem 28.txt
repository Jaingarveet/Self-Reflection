## System:
You are an expert in Logic.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Error Keywords:
 - Logical reasoning error
 - Incomplete analysis
 - Failure to consider all possibilities
 - Combinatorial reasoning error
## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. E or F has one person to participate, but not both. So we have two possibilities:
   - E participates, F does not
   - F participates, E does not
2. One of J or K will participate, but not both. Again, two possibilities:
   - J participates, K does not 
   - K participates, J does not
3. If J participates, then G participates. 
   - This means if we choose J in step 2, we must also choose G.
4. Unless F participates, M does not participate.
   - This means if we don't choose F in step 1, we can't choose M.
   - Conversely, if we do choose F, we can (but don't have to) choose M.
5. Now, let's look at the answer choices. We need to find a pair that, if chosen, determines the other two members.
   - Choice A: F and H. If we choose F, then we can't choose E. We can choose M. But this doesn't determine whether we choose J or K, so it's not the answer.
   - Choice B: G and J. If we choose J, we must also choose G. We can't choose K. But this doesn't determine whether we choose E or F, so it's not the answer.
   - Choice C: G and M. If we choose M, we must also choose F, and can't choose E. But this doesn't determine whether we choose J or K, so it's not the answer.
   - Choice D: H and M. If we choose M, we must also choose F, and can't choose E. We can then choose either J or K. But if we choose H, this doesn't determine any of the other choices. So this isn't the answer either.
6. After analyzing all the choices, none of them seem to uniquely determine the other two members. The question may not have enough information to be answered definitively.
