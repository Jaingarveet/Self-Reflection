## System:
You are an expert in Logic.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Topic: Logic
Context: Since 1993, sand and dust storms have frequently occurred in the Inner Mongolia region of our country, causing major economic losses.Some people think that sand and dust storms are caused by grassland degradation and desertification caused by climate drought.They are natural disasters, so they are inevitable.
Question: If the following items are true, can the above opinions be questioned, except?
Choices:
  A: In the 1950s, grass in Xilin Gol grassland in Inner Mongolia was as tall as a horse's belly, and now grass can't even cover mice.
  B: Opposite the degraded grasslands of Hulunbeier and Xilinguole in Inner Mongolia, the grasslands of Mongolian grassland are about 1 meter high.
  C: On the almost uninhabited border line of 10 kilometers wide between China and Mongolia, grass still maintains the height of the 1950s.
  D: The increase in dust storms is mainly due to human factors such as overloaded grazing and predatory management of grasslands.

## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
The given opinion states that sand and dust storms in Inner Mongolia are natural disasters caused by climate drought, grassland degradation and desertification. It claims they are inevitable.
To question this opinion, we need to find evidence that the storms are not inevitable natural disasters, but rather caused by human factors.
Choice A: The fact that grass used to be much taller in the 1950s compared to now suggests that the degradation is not purely due to natural climate change, but likely influenced by human activity over time. This choice helps question the given opinion.
Choice B: The contrast between the degraded grasslands in Inner Mongolia versus the much healthier grasslands in neighboring Mongolia also points to human influence, since the regions likely experience similar natural climate conditions. This choice helps question the opinion too.
Choice C: The fact that grass along the uninhabited border maintains its 1950s height strongly suggests that the degradation elsewhere is due to human factors, not inevitable natural changes. This choice questions the opinion.
Choice D: This choice directly states that human factors like overgrazing are the main cause of increased dust storms. It does not help to question the opinion, but rather directly refutes it.
Therefore, Choice D is the only one that does not help question the given opinion, since it outright states the opinion is incorrect rather than simply casting doubt on it.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
