## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. We are selecting 2 girls out of 3, and 3 boys out of 5, to form a 5-person group.
2. He Zhilian is not selected. So the 2 girls must be Fang Rufen and Guo Yanran.
3. Now let's consider the constraints for the boys:
   - Guo Yanran and Tang Xiaohua can't be selected together. But Guo Yanran is already selected, so Tang Xiaohua cannot be selected.
   - Peng Youwen and Song Wenkai can't be selected together. 
   - Qiu Zhijie and Tang Xiaohua can't be selected together. But Tang Xiaohua is already ruled out.
4. So among the boys, Tang Xiaohua is definitely not selected. We still need to pick 3 boys from the remaining 4, following the other constraints.
Therefore, the person who is definitely not selected is Tang Xiaohua.
Action: Answer("A")
