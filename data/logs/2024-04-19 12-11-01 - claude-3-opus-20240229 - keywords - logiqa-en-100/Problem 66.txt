Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Topic: Logic
Context: There are five volcanic islands E, F, G, H, and I in the east coast of a country.They are arranged in a straight line from north to south, and they are found? (1) F is adjacent to H and is on the north side of H.(2) I and E are adjacent.(3) G is somewhere in the north of F.
Question: If it is found that G is the northernmost island, how many possible arrangements are there for this group of islands?
Choices:
  A: 2
  B: 3
  C: 4
  D: 5

## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. We know G is the northernmost island.
2. F is adjacent to H and north of H. So the arrangement of F and H is fixed as:
   F
   H
3. I and E are adjacent, but their order could be either:
   I    OR    E
   E          I
4. Since G is the northernmost, the full arrangement must be:
   G
   F
   H
   I/E
   E/I
So there are two possible arrangements:
   G         G
   F         F
   H    OR   H
   I         E
   E         I
Therefore, there are 2 possible arrangements.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: C
