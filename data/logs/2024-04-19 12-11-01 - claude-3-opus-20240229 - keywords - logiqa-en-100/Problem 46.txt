## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step, taking into account the constraints and implications:
1. F must be in production (given). That leaves G, H, I, W, X, Y for the other departments.
2. H and Y must be together (given). So they are either both in production, both in sales, or both in PR. 
3. If X is in sales, then W must be in production (given). The contrapositive is also true: if W is not in production, then X cannot be in sales.
4. F and G cannot be together (given). Since F is in production, G must be in either sales or PR.
5. There must be 3 people in production, 3 in sales, and 1 in PR (given).
6. If G is in sales, then H and Y cannot be in sales (since there are only 3 sales spots and G would take one). 
7. If H and Y are not in sales, they must be together in either production or PR.
8. But production already has F, so adding both H and Y would exceed the 3 person limit. Therefore, H and Y cannot be in production.
9. The only remaining option is for H and Y to be in PR together. This forces G to be in sales.
Therefore, G and Y cannot be in sales together, since Y must be in PR with H.
Action: Answer("C")

Correct Answer: B
