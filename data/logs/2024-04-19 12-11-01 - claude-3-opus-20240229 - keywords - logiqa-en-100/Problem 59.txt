## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. F must be in the production department (given condition 4).
2. H and Y must be in the same department (given condition 1). 
   Since F is in production, and F and G can't be in the same department (condition 2),
   G can't be in production. So H and Y can't be in production either, as that would
   force G to be with them.
3. If X is in sales, then W must be in production (given condition 3).
   But we know from step 2 that H and Y must also be together in a non-production department.
   The only way to satisfy this is to put X in public relations, W in production, and
   H and Y in sales together.
4. That leaves I and G. We know G can't be in production with F. So G must go to sales
   with H and Y, and I goes to production with F and W.
Therefore, the final allocation is:
Public Relations: X
Production: F, I, W  
Sales: G, H, Y
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
