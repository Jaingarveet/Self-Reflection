Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.

Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Logic
Context: There must be an outside world, because if there is something outside me that can shine or reflect, shining the light into my eyes, which gives me a visual experience, I ca nâ€™t see the buildings, the crowds and the stars these things.And, not only have visual experience like me, but others also have such visual experience; book knowledge also tells us repeatedly that there is an outside world outside of us.
Question: Which of the following does not constitute doubt or rebuttal to the above argument?
Choices:
  A: To use sensory evidence to explain the existence of the external world requires presupposing the existence of the external world in the mind.
  B: How do you prove that others have similar visual experience to you?
  C: Since the visual experience is reliable, Mirage is not a so-called illusion, but a real existence.
  D: If there is no external world and natural science knowledge is not a true reflection of it, then why does natural science achieve such great success in practice?

## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
The argument is trying to prove the existence of the external world based on sensory experience (like visual perception) and the success of natural science.
Choice A points out the circular reasoning in using sensory evidence to prove the external world - this is a valid objection to the argument. Eliminated.
Choice B questions how we can know others have similar experiences. This challenges the argument's assumption and is a reasonable doubt. Eliminated. 
Choice C claims mirages are real because visual experience is reliable. However, the argument never claimed all visual experiences are veridical - just that they generally indicate an external reality. Mirages being illusions is compatible with the argument. This is not a strong objection.
Choice D asks why natural science is so successful if it's not reflecting an external reality. This actually supports the original argument rather than challenging it. The success of science is presented as evidence for an external world.
Therefore, choice C is the only option that does not present a reasonable challenge or rebuttal to the argument for an external world.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
