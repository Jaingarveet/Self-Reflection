## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) We know Li was hired by Tianshu. 
2) Li and Zhao were hired by different units. So Zhao was hired by either Tianji or Tianxuan.
3) Liu and Zhao were hired by the same unit. So Liu was also hired by either Tianji or Tianxuan.
4) If Zhang was hired by Tianxuan, then Wang was also hired by Tianxuan. 
5) Let's consider the possibilities for Zhao and Liu:
   Case 1: Zhao and Liu hired by Tianji
     - Then Zhang and Wang could have both been hired by Tianxuan, or one of them could have been hired by Tianxuan with the other at Tianshu. 
     - In this case, only Wang being hired by Tianxuan is possible (choice D).
   Case 2: Zhao and Liu hired by Tianxuan  
     - Then Zhang must have been hired by Tianji (otherwise Wang would also be at Tianxuan by the conditional).
     - And Wang must be at Tianshu since all units hired someone.
     - In this case, only Liu being hired by Tianxuan is possible (choice C).
6) Li and Liu cannot be hired by the same unit (choice A is impossible) since we know Li is at Tianshu while Liu is at either Tianji or Tianxuan.
7) Wang, Zhao and Liu also cannot all be at Tianji (choice B is impossible). If Zhao and Liu are at Tianji, Wang must be at either Tianshu or Tianxuan.
Therefore, of the given choices, only C and D are possible.
Action: Answer("C") or Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
