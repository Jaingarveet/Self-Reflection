Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.

Context: Due to recent market changes, Green Island must increase productivity by 10% over the next two years, otherwise it will go bankrupt.In fact, from the perspective of Green Island's production and management structure, if it can increase productivity by 10%, then it can achieve the goal of increasing productivity by 20%.
Question: If the above statement is true, which of the following statements must be true?
Choices:
  A: If Green Island cannot achieve its goal of increasing productivity by 20%, it will go bankrupt.
  B: In the next two years, if Green Island increases productivity by 20%, it will not go bankrupt.
  C: If the market does not change, Green Island does not need to increase productivity to prevent bankruptcy.
  D: In the next two years, Green Island may increase productivity by 10%, but it is impossible to achieve the goal of increasing by 20%.

## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The question states that Green Island must increase productivity by 10% over the next two years to avoid bankruptcy. 
2. It also states that if Green Island can increase productivity by 10%, then it can actually achieve a 20% productivity increase.
3. Looking at the answer choices:
A) This is not necessarily true. The question only states that a 10% increase is needed to avoid bankruptcy. It does not say a 20% increase is required.
B) This logically follows from the information given. If a 10% increase avoids bankruptcy, and Green Island can actually achieve a 20% increase, then a 20% increase will certainly avoid bankruptcy.
C) The question does not provide any information about what happens if the market does not change. We cannot deduce this statement from the given information.
D) This directly contradicts the information given, which states that if a 10% increase is possible, then a 20% increase is achievable.
Therefore, the only statement that must be true based on the information provided is B.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
