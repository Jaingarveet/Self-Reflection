## System:
You are an expert in Logic.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Topic: Logic
Context: The late famous logician Jin Yuelin of China heard the words "Money is like dung" and "Friends are worth a thousand dollars" when he was a child, and found that there are logical problems because they can lead to the absurd conclusion of "friends are like dung".
Question: Since the conclusion of "friends like dung" is not true, it can be logically derived?
Choices:
  A: The expression "money is like dung" is false.
  B: If a friend is indeed worth a lot of money, then money is not like dung.
  C: The statement that "friends are valuable" is true.
  D: The words "Money is like dung" and "Friends are worth a thousand dollars" are either true or false.

## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The two original statements are:
   - "Money is like dung" 
   - "Friends are worth a thousand dollars"
2. If we treat these statements as premises and combine them, it could lead to the faulty conclusion "Friends are like dung". 
3. However, just because combining the statements in a certain way leads to a false conclusion, that doesn't necessarily mean either of the original statements are false on their own.
4. Statement A is incorrect, because "Money is like dung" being false doesn't logically follow from the absurd conclusion. The statement could still be true in a metaphorical sense.
5. Statement B is correct. If we assume friends are indeed worth a lot of money (as the second premise states), then logically money cannot be like dung, otherwise it would lead to the false conclusion. So the two premises are logically incompatible.
6. While "friends are valuable" may be a true statement, it doesn't directly address the logical issue in the argument that leads to the false conclusion. So C is not the best answer.
7. D is incorrect, because the truth values of the individual statements are not the core issue. The problem is with the logical implication when combining the statements.
Therefore, the best answer is B - if we accept that friends are worth a lot of money, then it logically follows that money cannot be like dung, otherwise it results in a false conclusion.
Action: Answer("B")
