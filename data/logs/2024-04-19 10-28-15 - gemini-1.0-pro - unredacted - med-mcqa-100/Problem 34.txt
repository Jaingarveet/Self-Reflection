## System:
You are an expert in Medicine.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I incorrectly identified the type of hypersensitivity reaction associated with spring catarrh. 
I correctly identified that spring catarrh is an allergic reaction to pollen. 
However, I failed to consider that pollen allergies can also trigger type IV hypersensitivity reactions.
Error Keywords:
 - Incomplete understanding of hypersensitivity reactions
 - Failure to consider all possible types of hypersensitivity reactions
 - Misinterpretation of the question
Solution:
Spring catarrh is an allergic reaction to pollen.
Pollen allergies can trigger both type I and type IV hypersensitivity reactions.
Type I hypersensitivity reactions are immediate hypersensitivity reactions mediated by IgE antibodies.
Type IV hypersensitivity reactions are delayed hypersensitivity reactions mediated by T cells.
Instructions:
1. Identify the allergen responsible for the hypersensitivity reaction.
2. Determine the type of hypersensitivity reaction based on the allergen and the clinical presentation.
3. Consider all possible types of hypersensitivity reactions that could be triggered by the allergen.
4. Do not rely solely on the immediate or delayed nature of the reaction to determine the type of hypersensitivity.
5. Carefully read the question and ensure you are answering the correct aspect of the problem.
Advice:
 - Always consider all possible causes and mechanisms of a disease or condition.
 - Do not rely on a single piece of information to make a diagnosis.
 - Carefully read the question and ensure you are answering the correct aspect of the problem.
 - When in doubt, consult a reliable reference source or expert.
