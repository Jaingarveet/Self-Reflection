Solution:
The chest X-ray shows an "egg on a string" appearance, which is a classic finding in transposition of the great arteries ([REDACTED]).
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Transposition of the great arteries (TGA) is a congenital heart defect in which the two main arteries leaving the heart are reversed (transposed). This results in oxygen-rich blood being pumped back to the lungs and oxygen-poor blood being pumped to the rest of the body.
The "egg on a string" appearance on chest X-ray is a classic finding in TGA, which is caused by the narrowed base of the heart due to the anterior position of the aorta and the enlarged pulmonary artery.
Action: Answer("D")
