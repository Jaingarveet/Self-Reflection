Solution:
The patient is a multigravida at 34 weeks with an unstable lie. The possible causes of an unstable lie in this case are uterine anomalies, oligohydramnios, placenta previa, or a pelvic tumor. However, the most likely cause is placenta previa, as it is a more common cause of an unstable lie than uterine anomalies, and the patient has had two previous normal deliveries, making oligohydramnios less likely.
