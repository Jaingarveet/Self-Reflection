Solution:
Given the equation $3x - y = 12$, let's solve for the value of $\frac{8^x}{2^y}$.
First, simplify the expression:
$\frac{8^x}{2^y} = \frac{(2^3)^x}{2^y} = \frac{2^{3x}}{2^y} = 2^{3x-y}$
Now, we can see that the exponent $3x-y$ is the same as the left-hand side of the given equation. 
Substituting the right-hand side of the equation:
$2^{3x-y} = 2^{12}$
Therefore, the value of $\frac{8^x}{2^y}$ is [REDACTED].
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1) We are given the equation $3x - y = 12$.
2) The expression we want to evaluate is $\frac{8^x}{2^y}$. Let's simplify this:
   $\frac{8^x}{2^y} = \frac{(2^3)^x}{2^y} = \frac{2^{3x}}{2^y} = 2^{3x-y}$
3) Now, the exponent in the simplified expression, $3x-y$, is exactly the same as the left-hand side of the given equation.
4) Since $3x - y = 12$, we can substitute 12 for $3x-y$ in the simplified expression:
   $2^{3x-y} = 2^{12}$
5) Therefore, the value of $\frac{8^x}{2^y}$ is $2^{12}$.
Action: Answer("A")
