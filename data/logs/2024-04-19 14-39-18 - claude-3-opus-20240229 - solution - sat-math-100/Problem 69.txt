Question: Alan drives an average of 100 miles each week. His car can travel an average of 25 miles per gallon of gasoline. Alan would like to reduce his weekly expenditure on gasoline by $\$ 5$. Assuming gasoline costs $\$ 4$ per gallon, which equation can Alan use to determine how many fewer average miles, $m$, he should drive each week?
Choices:
  A: $\frac{25}{4} m=95$
  B: $\frac{25}{4} m=5$
  C: $\frac{4}{25} m=95$
  D: $\frac{4}{25} m=5$
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
1) Alan drives an average of 100 miles per week.
2) His car travels an average of 25 miles per gallon of gasoline.
3) Gasoline costs $4 per gallon.
4) Alan wants to reduce his weekly expenditure on gasoline by $5.
5) Let $m$ be the number of fewer miles Alan should drive each week.
6) The cost of driving these $m$ miles should be equal to the desired reduction of $5:
   - (Miles reduced / Miles per gallon) * Price per gallon = Desired reduction
   - ($m$ / 25) * $4 = $5
7) Simplify:
   - $m$ / 25 = 5 / 4
   - $m$ = 125 / 4
   - $m$ = 31.25
8) This matches the equation in choice [REDACTED]: $\frac{4}{25} m = 5$
Therefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED].
## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) We know Alan currently drives 100 miles per week on average.
2) His car gets 25 miles per gallon (mpg) on average. 
3) At $4 per gallon, for 100 miles he currently spends:
   (100 miles / 25 mpg) * $4/gal = $16 per week on gas
4) If he wants to reduce his spending by $5 to $11 per week, 
   at $4/gal that means reducing his gas consumption by:
   $5 / ($4/gal) = 1.25 gallons
5) At 25 mpg, 1.25 gallons less gas means driving:
   1.25 gal * 25 mi/gal = 31.25 miles less
6) So if $m$ is the number of miles less he should drive, 
   to save $5, this equation must be true:
   ($m$ miles / 25 mpg) * $4/gal = $5
7) Solving algebraically:
   $m$ / 25 = 5/4
   $m$ = 25 * 5/4 = 125/4 = 31.25
   
8) Rearranging the equation from step 6:
   $\frac{4}{25} m = 5$
This matches choice D.
