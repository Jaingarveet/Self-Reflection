## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: \begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}\cline { 2 - 3 }\multicolumn{1}{c|}{} & \multicolumn{2}{c|}{Handedness} \\\hlineGender & Left & Right \\\hline\hlineFemale &  &  \\\hlineMale &  &  \\\hline\hlineTotal & 18 & 122 \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}The incomplete table above summarizes the number of left-handed students and right-handed students by gender for the eighth-grade students atKeisel Middle School. There are 5 times as many right-handed female students as there are left-handed female students, and there are 9 times as many right-handed male students as there are left-handed male students. If there is a total of 18 left-handed students and 122 right-handed students in the school, which of the following is closest to the probability that a right-handed student selected at random is female? (Note: Assume that none of the eighth-grade students are both right-handed and left-handed.)
Choices:
  A: 0.410
  B: 0.357
  C: 0.333
  D: 0.250
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
My calculations for the number of left-handed female students and left-handed male students were incorrect. 
I made an error in solving the system of equations to find $f$ and $m$. 
Error Keywords:
 - Algebraic error
 - System of equations error
 - Calculation error
Solution:
Let's denote the number of left-handed female students and left-handed male students as $f$ and $m$, respectively. Then, we have:
$f + m = 18$ (total number of left-handed students)
$9m = 122 - f$ (number of right-handed male students)
$5f = 122 - 9m$ (number of right-handed female students)
Solving for $f$ and $m$, we get:
$f = \frac{610}{46}, m = \frac{170}{46}$
Now, we can find the number of right-handed female students and right-handed male students:
$5f = \frac{305}{23}$
$9m = \frac{765}{23}$
The total number of right-handed students is:
$\frac{305}{23} + \frac{765}{23} = \frac{1070}{23}$
Therefore, the probability that a right-handed student selected at random is female is:
$\frac{\frac{305}{23}}{\frac{1070}{23}} = \frac{305}{1070} \approx 0.285$
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and understand the problem.
2. Identify the given information and what needs to be found.
3. Break down the problem into smaller subproblems.
4. Use algebraic equations to solve for the unknowns.
5. Double-check your calculations and final answer.
6. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that algebraic equations can help you solve complex problems.
