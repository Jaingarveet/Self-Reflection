## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

To find the linear relationship between $x$ and $y$, we need to find the equation of the line that passes through the points $(a,0)$, $(3a,-a)$, and $(5a,-2a)$. 
We can use the point-slope form of the equation of a line, which is $y-y_1=m(x-x_1)$, where $m$ is the slope of the line and $(x_1,y_1)$ is a point on the line.
We can find the slope of the line by using any two of the given points. For example, using the points $(a,0)$ and $(3a,-a)$, we have $m=\frac{-a-0}{3a-a}=-\frac{1}{2}$.
Using the point $(a,0)$, we have $y-0=-\frac{1}{2}(x-a)$, which simplifies to $2y=-x+a$ or $x+2y=a$.
