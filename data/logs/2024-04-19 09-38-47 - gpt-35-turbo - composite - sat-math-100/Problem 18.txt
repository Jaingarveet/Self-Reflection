## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: Which of the following is equivalent to $9^{\frac{3}{4}}$ ?
Choices:
  A: $\sqrt[3]{9}$
  B: $\sqrt[4]{9}$
  C: $\sqrt{3}$
  D: $3 \sqrt{3}$
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I made an error in simplifying the expression. 
The correct way to simplify $9^{\frac{3}{4}}$ is to recognize that it is equal to $(\sqrt[4]{9})^3$. 
Then, we can simplify [REDACTED] to $3^{\frac{1}{2}}$ or [REDACTED], and then cube it to get $3\sqrt{3}$. 
Error Keywords:
 - Simplification error
 - Exponentiation error
 - Misapplication of rules
Solution:
$9^{\frac{3}{4}}$ can be written as $(\sqrt[4]{9})^3$.
[REDACTED] can be simplified to $3^{\frac{1}{2}}$ or [REDACTED].
$(\sqrt[4]{9})^3$ is equal to $(\sqrt{3})^3$.
$(\sqrt{3})^3$ is equal to $3\sqrt{3}$.
Instructions:
1. Recognize that $9^{\frac{3}{4}}$ can be written as $(\sqrt[4]{9})^3$.
2. Simplify [REDACTED] to $3^{\frac{1}{2}}$ or [REDACTED].
3. Cube the result from step 2 to get $3\sqrt{3}$.
4. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always simplify expressions step-by-step.
 - Always apply the rules of exponents carefully.
 - Always double-check your simplification and calculations.
 - Remember that $(a^b)^c$ is equal to $a^{bc}$.
