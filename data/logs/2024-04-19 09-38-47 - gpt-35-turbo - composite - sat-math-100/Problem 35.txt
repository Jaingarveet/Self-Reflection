# Model: gpt-35-turbo | Agent: composite | Exam: sat-math-100 | Problem 35 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:
Topic: Geography
Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: $$\sqrt{4 x}=x-3$$What are all values of $x$ that satisfy the given equation?I. 1II. 9
Choices:
  A: I only
  B: II only
  C: I and II
  D: Neither I nor II
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I correctly solved the equation, but I misread the question. The question asks for all values of $x$ that satisfy the equation, but [REDACTED] considered the values given in the choices. 
Error Keywords:
 - Misreading
 - Misinterpreting
 - Not considering all possible solutions
Solution:
We can solve the equation by squaring both sides and then simplifying.
$$\begin{aligned} \sqrt{4 x}&=x-3 \\ 4x&=(x-3)^2 \\ 4x&=x^2-6x+9 \\ x^2-10x+9&=0 \\ (x-1)(x-9)&=0 \end{aligned}$$
So, the solutions are $x=1$ and $x=9$.
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and understand the problem.
2. Solve the equation step-by-step.
3. Consider all possible solutions, not just the ones given in the choices.
4. Check your answer against the choices.
5. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always consider all possible solutions, not just the ones given in the choices.
 - Always double-check your answer against the choices.
 - Remember that the answer choices may not include all possible solutions.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
We can solve the equation by squaring both sides and then simplifying.
Then we can check which of the solutions satisfy the equation.
