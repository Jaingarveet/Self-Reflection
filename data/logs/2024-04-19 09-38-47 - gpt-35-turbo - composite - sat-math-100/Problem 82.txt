Explanation:
I correctly rewrote the quadratic equation in vertex form by completing the square. However, I made an error in identifying the vertex of the parabola. 
The vertex of the parabola is $(2,-8a)$, not $(2,-d)$.
To find the value of $d$, we need to substitute $2$ into the equation for $x$ and simplify.
$$y=a(2-2)(2+4)$$
$$y=0+12a$$
$$y=12a$$
Thus, $d=12a$.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Algebraic manipulation error
 - Substitution error
Solution:
The vertex form of a quadratic equation is given by $y=a(x-h)^2+k$, where $(h,k)$ is the vertex of the parabola.
We can rewrite the given equation in vertex form by completing the square.
$$y=a(x^2+2x(-2)+(-2)^2-(-2)^2-4x+8)$$
$$y=a(x-2)^2-8a$$
Thus, the vertex of the parabola is $(2,-8a)$.
To find the value of $d$, we need to substitute $2$ into the equation for $x$ and simplify.
$$y=a(2-2)(2+4)$$
$$y=0+12a$$
$$y=12a$$
Thus, $d=12a$.
Instructions:
1. Rewrite the quadratic equation in vertex form by completing the square.
2. Identify the vertex of the parabola from the vertex form.
3. Substitute the $x$-coordinate of the vertex into the equation for $x$.
4. Simplify the resulting expression to find the $y$-coordinate of the vertex.
5. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
6. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always use the correct formulae and equations for the problem.
 - Always double-check your algebraic manipulations and substitutions.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that the vertex of a parabola is given by $(h,k)$ in the vertex form $y=a(x-h)^2+k$.
