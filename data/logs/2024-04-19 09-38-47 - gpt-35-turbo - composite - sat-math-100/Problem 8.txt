Question: Alma bought a laptop computer at a store that gave a 20 percent discount off its original price. The total amount she paid to the cashier was $p$ dollars, including an 8 percent sales tax on the discounted price. Which of the following represents the original price of the computer in terms of $p$ ?
Choices:
  A: $0.88 p$
  B: $\frac{p}{0.88}$
  C: $(0.8)(1.08) p$
  D: $\frac{p}{(0.8)(1.08)}$

Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I made a calculation error while finding the original price of the laptop.
I calculated the answer based on the discounted price instead of the original price.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Discount error
 - Algebraic manipulation error
Solution:
Let's assume the original price of the laptop is $x$.
Alma got a 20% discount, so she paid 80% of the original price.
The price after the discount is $(0.8)x$.
The sales tax on the discounted price is 8% of $(0.8)x$.
The total amount Alma paid is $(0.8)x + 0.08(0.8)x = 0.88x$.
We need to express $x$ in terms of $p$.
$0.88x = p$
$x = \frac{p}{0.88}$
Instructions:
1. Identify the original price of the item.
2. Calculate the discounted price of the item.
3. Calculate the sales tax on the discounted price.
4. Add the sales tax to the discounted price to get the total amount paid.
5. Set up an equation to express the original price in terms of the total amount paid.
6. Solve the equation for the original price.
7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Remember that algebraic manipulation is a powerful tool for solving problems.
