## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I correctly translated the problem into an equation, but I made a mistake in solving for $x$. 
The correct solution is $x=[REDACTED]$, but I incorrectly chose answer choice [REDACTED], which is $8x=1[REDACTED]$. 
The correct answer is [REDACTED], which is $8x=1[REDACTED]$.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Algebraic manipulation error
 - Substitution error
Solution:
The problem can be translated into an equation: $1[REDACTED]+4x=14+10$. 
Simplifying the right side of the equation, we get $1[REDACTED]+4x=[REDACTED]4$.
Solving for $x$, we get $x=[REDACTED]$.
To find the value of $8x$, we substitute $x=[REDACTED]$ into $8x$.
$8x=8([REDACTED])=1[REDACTED]$.
Instructions:
1. Translate the problem into an equation.
[REDACTED]. Simplify the equation.
3. Solve for the variable.
4. Substitute the value of the variable into the expression.
5. Simplify the expression.
[REDACTED]. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
Advice:
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Always show your work and reasoning.
 - Always check your solution in the original problem to ensure it makes sense.
 - Remember to substitute the value of the variable into the expression to find the final answer.
