## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: Katarina is a botanist studying the production of pears by two types of pear trees. She noticed that Type A trees produced 20 percent more pears than Type B trees did. Based on Katarina's observation, if the Type A trees produced 144 pears, how many pears did the Type B trees produce?
Choices:
  A: 115
  B: 120
  C: 124
  D: 173
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I correctly identified that the number of pears produced by Type [REDACTED] trees is 20% less than Type [REDACTED] trees. However, I made a calculation error in finding the value of x. 
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Algebraic error
 - Percent decrease error
Solution:
Let's use the formula: 
percent decrease = (original number - new number) / original number x 100%
We can set up the equation as follows:
20% = (144 - x) / 144 x 100%
20% = (144 - x) / 144 x 100/1
20 = (144 - x) / 1.44
20 x 1.44 = 144 - x
28.8 = 144 - x
x = 144 - 28.8
x = [REDACTED].2
Therefore, the Type [REDACTED] trees produced [REDACTED].2 pears, which is closest to [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Identify the percent increase or decrease between the two values.
2. Use the percent decrease formula to set up the equation.
3. Solve for the unknown value using algebraic manipulation.
4. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
5. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always use the correct formula for the given problem.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that percent decrease is calculated as (original number - new number) / original number x 100%.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Type A trees produced 20% more pears than Type B trees.
If Type A trees produced 144 pears, then Type B trees produced 20% less than 144 pears.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
