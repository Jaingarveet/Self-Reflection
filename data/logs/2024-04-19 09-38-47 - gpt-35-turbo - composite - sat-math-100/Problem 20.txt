## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: $$\begin{aligned}& 2.4 x-1.5 y=0.3 \\& 1.6 x+0.5 y=-1.3\end{aligned}$$The system of equations above is graphed in the $x y$-plane. What is the $x$-coordinate of the intersection point $(x, y)$ of the system?
Choices:
  A: -0.5
  B: -0.25
  C: 0.8
  D: 1.75
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I chose the answer [REDACTED], [REDACTED], because it appeared to be the $x$-coordinate of the intersection point on the graph. However, I did not read the graph accurately, and I made an error in my visual estimation. 
Error Keywords:
 - Estimation error
 - Graphical error
 - Reading error
Solution:
To find the $x$-coordinate of the intersection point, we need to solve the system of equations. We can use elimination or substitution to solve the system. Here, we will use elimination:
$$\begin{aligned}& 2.4 x-1.5 y=0.3 \\& 1.6 x+0.5 y=-1.3\end{aligned}$$
Multiplying the second equation by $3$ and adding it to the first equation, we get:
$$\begin{aligned}2.4 x-1.5 y+4.8 x+1.5 y&=0.3-3(1.3)\\6.8 x&=-3.6\\x&=-\frac{18}{34}\\x&=-\frac{9}{17}\end{aligned}$$
Therefore, the $x$-coordinate of the intersection point is $-\frac{9}{17}$, which is answer choice $\boxed{\textbf{(A)}\ [REDACTED]}$.
Instructions:
1. Read the problem carefully and understand the question.
2. Identify the system of equations and the unknown variable.
3. Choose a method to solve the system of equations.
4. Solve the system of equations step-by-step.
5. Check your solution by substituting the values back into the original equations.
6. Read the answer choices carefully and choose the correct answer.
7. Double-check your answer to ensure accuracy.
Advice:
 - Always read the problem carefully and understand the question.
 - Always double-check your work and answer to ensure accuracy.
 - Always use a systematic approach to solve problems.
 - Always check your solution by substituting the values back into the original equations.
 - Remember that estimation is not a substitute for accurate calculation.
