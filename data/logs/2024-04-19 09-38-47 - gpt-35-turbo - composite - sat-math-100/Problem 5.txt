Question: The number of states that joined the United States between 1776 and 1849 is twice the number of states that joined between 1850 and 1900. If 30 states joined the United States between 1776 and 1849 and $x$ states joined between 1850 and 1900 , which of the following equations is true?
Choices:
  A: $30 x=2$
  B: $2 x=30$
  C: $\frac{x}{2}=30$
  D: $x+30=2$

Explanation:
I made an error in calculating the number of states that joined between 1850 and 1900. 
The correct number of states that joined between 1850 and 1900 is $2 \times 30 = 60$, not 15. 
Therefore, the correct equation is $2x=60$, which simplifies to $x=30$.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Division error
 - Misinterpretation of the problem
Solution:
Let $y$ be the number of states that joined between 1850 and 1900.
We know that $30+x=2y$ and $y=2(30-x)$.
Simplifying the second equation, we get $y=60-2x$.
Equating the two expressions for $y$, we get $60-2x=30+x$.
Solving for $x$, we get $x=30$.
Therefore, the correct equation is $2x=60$, which simplifies to $x=30$.
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and understand the problem.
2. Identify the variables and equations involved.
3. Solve for the unknown variable using the given equations.
4. Double-check your calculations and final answer.
5. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always identify the variables and equations involved.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that solving equations involves isolating the unknown variable on one side of the equation.
