Explanation:
I correctly identified the number of messages sent by each person but made an error in adding them together. 
I added the number of hours instead of the number of messages sent by each person.
Error Keywords:
 - Addition error
 - Comprehension error
 - Misreading
Solution:
Armand sent $m$ text messages each hour for 5 hours, so he sent a total of $5m$ messages.
Tyrone sent $p$ text messages each hour for 4 hours, so he sent a total of $4p$ messages.
The total number of messages sent by Armand and Tyrone is the sum of the messages sent by each person.
Therefore, the total number of messages sent is $5m+4p$.
Instructions:
1. Identify the number of messages sent by each person.
2. Calculate the total number of messages sent by each person.
3. Add the total number of messages sent by each person together.
4. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
5. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.

 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
