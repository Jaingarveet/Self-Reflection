## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: For $i=\sqrt{-1}$, what is the sum $(7+3 i)+(-8+9 i) ?$
Choices:
  A: $-1+12 i$
  B: $-1-6 i$
  C: $15+12 i$
  D: $15-6 i$ 3
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I made an error in adding the imaginary parts. 
I added $3i+9i$ to get $12i$ instead of $12i$.
Error Keywords:
 - Addition error
 - Imaginary number error
 - Complex number error
Solution:
$(7+3i)+(-8+9i)=7+(-8)+(3i+9i)=-1+12i$
Instructions:
1. Identify the real and imaginary parts of each complex number.
2. Add the real parts together.
3. Add the imaginary parts together.
4. Combine the results from steps 2 and 3 to form the sum of the two complex numbers.
5. Write the answer in the form $a+bi$.
6. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
7. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that the sum of two complex numbers is the sum of their real parts plus the sum of their imaginary parts.
