## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: $$m=\frac{\left(\frac{r}{1,200}\right)\left(1+\frac{r}{1,200}\right)^{N}}{\left(1+\frac{r}{1,200}\right)^{N}-1} P$$The formula above gives the monthly payment $m$ needed to pay off a loan of $P$ dollars at $r$ percent annual interest over $N$ months. Which of the following gives $P$ in terms of $m, r$, and $N$ ?
Choices:
  A: $P=\frac{\left(\frac{r}{1,200}\right)\left(1+\frac{r}{1,200}\right)^{N}}{\left(1+\frac{r}{1,200}\right)^{N}-1} m$
  B: $P=\frac{\left(1+\frac{r}{1,200}\right)^{N}-1}{\left(\frac{r}{1,200}\right)\left(1+\frac{r}{1,200}\right)^{N}} m$
  C: $P=\left(\frac{r}{1,200}\right) m$
  D: $P=\left(\frac{1,200}{r}\right) m$

Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I incorrectly chose answer choice [REDACTED] because I did not distribute the $P$ correctly. 
The correct answer is [REDACTED] because we need to isolate $P$ in the given formula. 
Error Keywords:
 - Distribution error
 - Algebraic manipulation error
 - Isolation error
Solution:
$$m=\frac{\left(\frac{r}{1,200}\right)\left(1+\frac{r}{1,200}\right)^{N}}{\left(1+\frac{r}{1,200}\right)^{N}-1} P$$
We need to isolate $P$ in the given formula.
First, we can multiply both sides by the denominator of the right-hand side:
$$m\left(\left(1+\frac{r}{1,200}\right)^{N}-1\right)=\left(\frac{r}{1,200}\right)\left(1+\frac{r}{1,200}\right)^{N} P$$
Next, we can distribute $m$ on the left-hand side:
$$m\left(\left(1+\frac{r}{1,200}\right)^{N}-1\right)=\left(\frac{r}{1,200}\right)\left(1+\frac{r}{1,200}\right)^{N} P$$
$$m\left(1+\frac{r}{1,200}\right)^{N}-m=\left(\frac{r}{1,200}\right)\left(1+\frac{r}{1,200}\right)^{N} P$$
Finally, we can isolate $P$ by dividing both sides by $\left(\frac{r}{1,200}\right)\left(1+\frac{r}{1,200}\right)^{N}$:
$$P=\frac{m\left(1+\frac{r}{1,200}\right)^{N}-m}{\left(\frac{r}{1,200}\right)\left(1+\frac{r}{1,200}\right)^{N}}$$
