Context: Based on the following questions? Most people think that advertisers do whatever they can to attract customers.But advertisers are not always like this.Recently, in order to expand sales, a family magazine called "Bay" was renamed "Inferno", which mainly published violent and pornographic content.As a result, some perennial advertisers from the original "Bay" magazine refused to renew the contract and turned to other publications.This shows that these advertisers not only consider economic benefits, but also take into account their ethical responsibilities.
Question: If the following item is true, can the argument be strengthened most?
Choices:
  A: The cost and selling price of "Inferno" are lower than that of "Harbour".
  B: The above advertisers who refused to renew their contracts have not affected the benefits after switching to other publications.
  C: Readers of family magazines are generally not interested in violent and pornographic content.

## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The main point of the argument is that advertisers consider ethical responsibilities, not just economic benefits.
The type of evidence needed to support the argument is evidence that shows advertisers' ethical considerations.

Evaluation of answer choices:
A: This choice is irrelevant to the argument as it focuses on the cost and selling price of the magazines, not the advertisers' ethical considerations.
B: This choice weakens the argument as it suggests that the advertisers' decision to switch to other publications did not affect their benefits, implying that they did not make the decision based on ethical considerations.
C: This choice strengthens the argument as it suggests that the advertisers' decision to not renew their contracts with "Inferno" was based on ethical considerations, as the content of the magazine was not aligned with the interests of their target audience.
D: This choice weakens the argument as it suggests that some advertisers prioritize economic benefits over ethical considerations by turning to "Inferno" magazine.
