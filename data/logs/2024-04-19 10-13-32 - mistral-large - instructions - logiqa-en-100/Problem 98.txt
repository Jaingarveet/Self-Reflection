## System:
You are an expert in Logic.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Topic: Logic
Context: Right and wrong and whether they violate the rules are two things.There may be regulations that prohibit things that are not wrong in themselves, such as laws in certain countries that prohibit criticism of the government; there may also be regulations that require things that are inherently wrong, such as laws that require apartheid in public places.And, like evaluating behavior, we can also evaluate some of the prescribed right and wrong.
Question: Which of the following does not weaken, but supports the argument in the question stem?
Choices:
  A: If we do not follow some pre-existing regulations or standards, how can we judge right and wrong?
  B: "People are doing, heaven is watching." Failure to act in accordance with ethical regulations will incur punishment from heaven.
  C: Behind the judgment of right and wrong, you can always find the rules or standards on which people judge.
  D: The basis for judgment of right and wrong lies in pushing oneself and one's moral conscience.It is common and universal; however, the moral regulations on how to act for people vary from person to person and from place to place.

Instructions:
1. Read the question stem carefully and understand the argument.
2. Identify the relationship between right and wrong and regulations in the argument.
3. Evaluate each answer choice to determine whether it supports or weakens the argument.
4. Eliminate answer choices that contradict the argument or suggest that right and wrong are not separate from regulations.
5. Choose the answer that supports the argument by suggesting that regulations can be inherently wrong or not wrong depending on the context.
## Assistant 2:
Reflection:
Upon re-reading the question stem, I realized that the argument is about the relationship between right and wrong and regulations. The argument suggests that regulations can be inherently wrong or not wrong depending on the context.

I initially chose answer choice B because it suggests that failing to act in accordance with ethical regulations will incur punishment from heaven, which could be interpreted as supporting the argument that regulations are related to right and wrong. However, upon closer examination, this answer choice weakens the argument by suggesting that regulations are always related to right and wrong, rather than acknowledging that regulations can be inherently wrong or not wrong depending on the context.

Answer choice A weakens the argument by suggesting that regulations are necessary to judge right and wrong, rather than acknowledging that regulations can be inherently wrong or not wrong depending on the context.

Answer choice C weakens the argument by suggesting that regulations are always the basis for judging right and wrong, rather than acknowledging that regulations can be inherently wrong or not wrong depending on the context.

Answer choice D supports the argument by suggesting that the basis for judgment of right and wrong lies in pushing oneself and one's moral conscience, which is common and universal, but that the moral regulations on how to act for people vary from person to person and from place to place. This answer choice acknowledges that regulations can be inherently wrong or not wrong depending on the context.

Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
