## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Condition (4) states that paper E cannot be used.
Condition (1) states that if paper E is used, then paper K must be used. Since paper E cannot be used, paper K also cannot be used.
Condition (2) states that paper G or paper H can only be used without paper J. This means that if paper J is used, neither paper G nor paper H can be used.
Condition (3) states that if paper G is not used, then paper K is also not used. Since paper K cannot be used, paper G can be used.
Therefore, the only certain conclusion that can be drawn is that paper J cannot be used.
Action: Answer("C")
