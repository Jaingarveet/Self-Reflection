The contradiction in the statement is that seals are dying from eating the contaminated fish, but some people have not been poisoned after eating the same fish.
Answer choice A does not explain the contradiction, as it only talks about the fish not being harmed by the chemical.
Answer choice C introduces a new contradiction, as it suggests that people who did not eat the fish or fish products were still poisoned.
Answer choice D does not explain the contradiction, as it only talks about the amount of contaminated fish that seals eat.
Answer choice B explains the contradiction by suggesting that the toxic chemicals are concentrated in the parts of the fish that seals eat but people do not.
