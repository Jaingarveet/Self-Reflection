Context: Xiao Chen? At present, part of the orbit of Comet 1996D3 is far from the sun, but recently it can be found to emit flickering light through the solar telescope.In the past, people never observed such flashes of comets far away from the sun, so this flicker must be an unusual scene.Xiao Wang? Normally people don't observe comets far away from the sun.The 1996D3 comet flicker light discovered this time was obtained by continuous and careful tracking observation.
Question: Which of the following most accurately summarizes the method Xiao Wang used to refute Xiao Chen's views?
Choices:
  A: Point out that the key concepts used by Xiao Chen are ambiguous.
  B: pointed out that Xiao Chen's argument is clearly lacking in persuasion.
  C: pointed out that Xiao Chen's arguments contradict themselves.
  D: Disagree with Xiao Chen's conclusion, and put forward another explanation for Xiao Chen's argument.E.Agree with Xiao Chen's conclusion, but put forward another explanation for Xiao Chen's argument.

Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:

1. Read the question carefully and pay attention to the specific words used.
2. Identify the key concepts and arguments presented by each person.
3. Determine the method used by Xiao Wang to respond to Xiao Chen's argument.
4. Evaluate whether Xiao Wang's response actually refutes Xiao Chen's argument or simply offers an alternative explanation.
5. Choose the answer that most accurately reflects the method used by Xiao Wang.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Xiao Chen's argument is that the flickering light from Comet 1996D3 is an unusual scene because it has never been observed before.
Xiao Wang's response is that the flickering light was discovered through continuous and careful tracking observation, implying that it may not be unusual, but simply not observed before.
Xiao Wang did not point out any flaws in Xiao Chen's argument, but rather offered an alternative explanation for the flickering light.
Action: Answer("E")

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly by choosing option D, which suggests that Xiao Wang disagreed with Xiao Chen's conclusion. However, upon closer examination, Xiao Wang did not actually disagree with Xiao Chen's conclusion, but rather offered an alternative explanation for the flickering light. Therefore, the correct answer is option E, which accurately reflects Xiao Wang's method of responding to Xiao Chen's argument.
## Result:
Agent Answer: E
Correct Answer: B
