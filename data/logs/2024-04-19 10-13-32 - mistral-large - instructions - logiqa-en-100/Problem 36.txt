Context: Based on the following questions?

Choices:
  A: The violent and pornographic content published in Purgatory magazine is more moderate in similar magazines.

## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The main argument is that advertisers consider ethical responsibilities, not just economic benefits, as evidenced by some advertisers refusing to renew contracts with "Bay" magazine after it changed its name to "Inferno" and began publishing violent and pornographic content.

Option A: This option weakens the argument by suggesting that the content in "Inferno" is more moderate than in similar magazines, implying that the advertisers' decision may not have been based on ethical concerns.

Option B: This option also weakens the argument by suggesting that magazines with violent and pornographic content sell well but have low credibility, implying that advertisers may have considered economic benefits and credibility, not just ethics.

Option C: This option does not necessarily weaken the argument. The type of goods the advertisers promote does not necessarily relate to their ethical considerations.

Option D: This option weakens the argument by suggesting that the advertising cost increased significantly, implying that the advertisers' decision may have been based on economic concerns rather than ethical ones.

Action: Answer("C")
