## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:** I focused on the central theme of overlooking evidence and missed the detail about recognizing dangers. While option A was relevant to the overall theme, it wasn't directly supported by the passage. The passage explicitly mentions the "dangers of working with highly radioactive materials," which aligns with option E.
**Error Keywords:**
*   Misinterpretation 
*   Focus on central theme
*   Ignoring supporting details
## Step-by-Step Solution
1.  **Identify the question's focus:** The question asks about the physics community's understanding during the 1930s.
2.  **Scan the passage for relevant information:** Look for details about the physics community's actions or beliefs during that period.
3.  **Analyze each option:**
    *   A: The passage mentions earlier theoretical developments but doesn't state they were neglected.
    *   B: There's no mention of reevaluating calculations.
    *   C: The passage describes the identification of by-products, although with difficulty.
    *   D: The passage doesn't compare the ease of splitting different atoms.
    *   E: The passage explicitly mentions recognizing the dangers of radioactive materials.
4.  **Choose the best option:** Based on the analysis, option E is the only one directly supported by the passage. 
## Instructions for Future Similar Problems
1.  **Read the question carefully:** Understand what information the question seeks.
2.  **Scan the passage for relevant sections:** Identify parts related to the question's focus.
