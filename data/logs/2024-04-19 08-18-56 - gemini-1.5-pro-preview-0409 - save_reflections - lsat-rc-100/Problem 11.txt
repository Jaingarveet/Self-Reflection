## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:**
My focus on the specific genre of "jazz" and its relation to African American literature led me astray. I failed to consider the broader implication of the author's statement, which refers to the musicality of language and narrative structure in general, not just jazz-specific elements.
**Error Keywords:**
*   Misinterpretation of scope 
*   Overemphasis on specific details
*   Ignoring broader implications
*   Misunderstanding of the challenge posed
**Step-by-Step Solution:**
1.  **Identify the author's assertion:** The author claims Toni Morrison was the first to structure a novel around a musical genre, specifically jazz.
2.  **Analyze the answer choices for a challenge to this assertion:** We need to find an option that would contradict or weaken the claim that Morrison's approach is unique.
3.  **Evaluate option D:** This option suggests that all novels possess inherent musical qualities, especially when read aloud. This directly challenges the uniqueness of Morrison's achievement by implying that musicality in literature is not exclusive to her work or jazz-inspired structures.
4.  **Conclusion:** Option D presents the most direct challenge to the author's assertion, making it the correct answer. 
## Instructions for Future Problem Solving:
1.  **Read the passage and question carefully:** Pay close attention to the author's main points and the specific claim being made.
2.  **Identify the scope of the claim:** Determine whether the claim is specific to a particular genre, style, or author, or if it has broader implications.
3.  **Analyze each answer choice:** Look for options that directly contradict, weaken, or cast doubt on the author's claim.
4.  **Consider the broader context:** Think about the general principles or ideas that the passage is discussing, not just the specific examples given.
5.  **Choose the answer that most effectively challenges the author's assertion:** This option will often present a contrasting viewpoint or evidence that undermines the claim's validity.
## General Advice for Similar Problems:
*   **Avoid focusing too narrowly on specific details:** Consider the bigger picture and the broader implications of the author's statements.
*   **Think critically about the author's claims:** Don't simply accept them at face value; analyze their validity and potential weaknesses.
*   **Consider different perspectives and interpretations:** Be open to the possibility that there may be multiple ways to understand the passage and the author's intentions.
*   **Practice active reading and critical thinking skills:** These skills are essential for accurately interpreting complex texts and identifying potential biases or limitations in the author's arguments.
