## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:** I incorrectly focused on the positive aspects of the test case strategy and its impact, overlooking the passage's emphasis on its novelty and groundbreaking nature at the time of its development.
**Error Keywords:**
*   Misinterpretation 
*   Focus on outcome over origin
*   Ignoring context
**Step-by-Step Solution:**
1.  **Identify keywords:** The question asks about the author's view of the test case strategy. 
2.  **Scan the passage for relevant information:** Look for descriptions of the strategy and its impact.
3.  **Analyze the context:**  The passage states, "during the 1940s and 1950s, ... Marshall and the NAACP, instead of simply pursuing cases as the opportunity arose, set up a predetermined legal campaign that was meticulously crafted and carefully coordinated." This suggests a novel approach at the time.
4.  **Evaluate answer choices:** 
    *   A, B, D, and E do not align with the passage's description of the strategy as innovative and influential.
    *   C, unprecedented, accurately reflects the passage's emphasis on the strategy's groundbreaking nature.
**Instructions for Future Similar Problems:**
1.  **Carefully read the question and identify keywords.**
2.  **Locate relevant information in the passage.**
3.  **Pay close attention to the context and historical setting.**
4.  **Analyze how the text describes the subject, considering both positive and negative aspects.**
5.  **Eliminate answer choices that contradict the passage's information.**
**General Advice:**
*   **Read actively and critically.**  Go beyond the surface meaning and consider the author's perspective and purpose.
*   **Pay attention to the historical context** when interpreting events or actions.
*   **Consider multiple perspectives** and avoid focusing solely on positive or negative aspects.
