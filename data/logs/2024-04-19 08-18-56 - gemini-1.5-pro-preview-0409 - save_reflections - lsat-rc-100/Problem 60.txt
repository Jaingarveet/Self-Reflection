## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:** I focused too much on the conventional imagery and overlooked the importance of the despedida as a marker of authenticity and completion. The passage highlights the despedida's role in asserting the corrido's unique identity and its adherence to tradition.
**Error Keywords:**
*   Misinterpretation of passage emphasis
*   Overlooking key details 
*   Ignoring evidence contradicting chosen answer
**Step-by-Step Solution:**
1.  **Analyze the question:** The question asks for the author's likely agreement regarding corridos.
2.  **Review the passage:** Identify key points about corridos, especially the function and significance of the despedida.
3.  **Evaluate each option:**
    *   A and D are contradicted by the passage, as it portrays ready-made lines and rhyme as enhancing the corrido tradition.
    *   B is not supported, as the passage focuses on the Lower Rio Grande Border region, not a broader comparison with other ballad forms.
    *   C is not directly addressed in the passage. 
    *   **E aligns with the passage's emphasis on the despedida as a marker of authenticity and completion.** A missing despedida would hinder the identification of a corrido and its connection to the tradition.
