## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:**
I misinterpreted the author's attitude towards the twofold obligation. I focused on the limitations it places on defending guilty clients but missed the bigger picture of how the author views this dual responsibility as a whole.
**Error Keywords:**
*   Misinterpretation 
*   Focus on specific detail
*   Missing the main idea
## Step-by-Step Solution
1.  **Identify the twofold obligation:** The passage states that defense lawyers have an obligation to both their clients and the court/society.
2.  **Analyze the author's viewpoint:** The author believes lawyers should not present false information or defend the innocence of clients they know to be guilty. However, they also emphasize that this obligation ultimately benefits the defendant by ensuring a genuine and effective defense.
3.  **Evaluate answer choices:**
    *   A is incorrect because the author acknowledges the challenges of balancing these responsibilities.
    *   B is incorrect because it only focuses on one aspect of the obligation.
    *   C is not the central point the author makes about the twofold obligation.
    *   D is not discussed in relation to the twofold obligation.
    *   **E is correct** because the author sees the dual responsibility as a necessary and beneficial aspect of the legal system, not a conflict of interest.
