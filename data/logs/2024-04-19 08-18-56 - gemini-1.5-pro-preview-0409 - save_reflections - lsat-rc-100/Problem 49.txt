## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:** I focused too much on the specific examples of proverb usage in Mexican American communities and their connection to ethnic identity. I failed to recognize the broader statement about the nature of proverbs and their dependence on context for meaning.
**Error Keywords:**
*   Misinterpretation 
*   Overemphasis on specifics
*   Ignoring broader context
## Step-by-Step Solution
1.  **Analyze the question:** The question asks for the strongest implication, meaning something that is suggested but not directly stated.
2.  **Review the passage:** Look for statements that apply to proverbs in general, not just in the context of Mexican American culture.
3.  **Identify relevant information:** The passage defines proverbs as self-contained sayings understood independently of a specific verbal context but whose meaning varies depending on the individual speaker and social context.
4.  **Match information to answer choices:** Option D directly reflects this information about proverbs requiring no verbal context but having meaning dependent on the social context of use.
## Instructions for Future Similar Problems
1.  **Read the question carefully:** Understand what it is asking for (e.g., main idea, implication, inference).
2.  **Identify the scope of the question:** Is it asking about a specific example or a general principle?
3.  **Review the passage with the question in mind:** Focus on information relevant to the question's scope.
4.  **Evaluate each answer choice:** Eliminate options that are contradicted by the passage or are too specific.
5.  **Choose the answer that best reflects the passage's overall message or the specific information asked for.**
## General Advice
*   **Avoid focusing too much on specific examples:** Look for broader principles or implications.
*   **Consider the context of the passage:** Understand the main topic and purpose.
*   **Pay attention to keywords and phrases:** They often signal important information.
*   **Read all answer choices before making a decision:** Eliminate obviously wrong options first.
*   **Practice active reading and critical thinking skills:** This will improve your ability to understand and analyze complex texts.
