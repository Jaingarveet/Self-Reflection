## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:** I incorrectly identified the relationship between the two sections of text as a disagreement over particulars within a generally agreed-upon framework. However, the passage presents two contrasting viewpoints on the defense lawyer's obligations, making it a direct opposition of opinions.
**Error Keywords:**
*   Misinterpretation of text
*   Relationship between arguments
*   Confusing contrasting viewpoints with nuanced agreement 
## Step-by-Step Solution
1. **Identify the main viewpoints:** The passage presents two main viewpoints on the defense lawyer's obligations.
2. **Analyze lines 7-11:** This section argues that lawyers should provide the best defense possible without judging the client's guilt or innocence.
3. **Analyze lines 28-31:** This section argues that lawyers should not present information they know to be false, even if it benefits their client.
4. **Compare the viewpoints:** The two sections directly contradict each other. One advocates for zealous advocacy regardless of guilt, while the other emphasizes the lawyer's ethical duty to truth and justice.
## Instructions for Future Problem Solving
