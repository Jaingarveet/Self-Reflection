## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misinterpreted the argument's main vulnerability. I focused on the assumption that commercially viable technology cannot be beneficial to society, while the argument's main flaw is that it assumes an action is unlikely to produce a certain outcome unless it is motivated by a desire to produce that outcome.
Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation
- Assumption error
- Critical reasoning error
Solution:
The argument's main vulnerability is that it assumes that unless the innovators are motivated by societal benefit, their innovations will not serve society. This is a flawed assumption because the outcome of an action (in this case, technological innovation) is not always determined by the initial motivation. Therefore, the correct answer is D.
Instructions:
1. Read the argument carefully and understand its main points.
2. Identify the assumptions made in the argument.
3. Evaluate each choice based on whether it correctly identifies a vulnerability in the argument.
4. Remember that the outcome of an action is not always determined by the initial motivation.
5. Choose the answer that best identifies a flaw in the argument's reasoning.
Advice:
- Always read the argument carefully and understand its main points.
- Identify the assumptions made in the argument.
- Evaluate each choice based on whether it correctly identifies a vulnerability in the argument.
- Remember that the outcome of an action is not always determined by the initial motivation.
- Practice critical reasoning to improve your ability to identify flaws in arguments.
