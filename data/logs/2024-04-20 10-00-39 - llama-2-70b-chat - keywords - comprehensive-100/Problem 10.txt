## Assistant 2:
  My apologies for my previous response. I made a mistake in my calculation. Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The total amount of money is Rs 8600.
2. Each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew.
3. Each son receives five times as much as each nephew.

We can start by finding the amount each nephew receives. Let's say each nephew receives x.

Each daughter receives 4x, and each son receives 5x.

The total amount of money distributed among the daughters and sons is:
4x + 5x = 9x

Since there are 4 daughters and 5 sons, the total amount distributed among them is:
9x = 8600

Now, we can solve for x:
x = 955

So, each daughter receives 4x = 4 \* 955 = 3820.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: E
Score: 0
