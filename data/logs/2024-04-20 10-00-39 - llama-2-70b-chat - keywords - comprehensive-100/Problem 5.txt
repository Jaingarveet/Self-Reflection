## Assistant 2:
  My apologies for my previous mistake. I misunderstood the pattern and made an incorrect assumption.
Let's break down the problem step by step:
The youngest member is 7 years old, so the next member's age would be 7 + 3 = 10.
The common difference is 3 months, so the next member's age would be 10 + 3 = 13.
The sum of the ages of all members is 250.
We can continue this pattern to find the next member's age: 
13 + 3 = 16
16 + 3 = 19
19 + 3 = 22
22 + 3 = 25
25 + 3 = 28
28 + 3 = 31
31 + 3 = 34
34 + 3 = 37
37 + 3 = 40
40 + 3 = 43
43 + 3 = 46
46 + 3 = 49
49 + 3 = 52
52 + 3 = 55
55 + 3 = 58
58 + 3 = 61
61 + 3 = 64
64 + 3 = 67

70 + 3 = 73
73 + 3 = 76
76 + 3 = 79
79 + 3 = 82
82 + 3 = 85
85 + 3 = 88
88 + 3 = 91
91 + 3 = 94
94 + 3 = 97
97 + 3 = 100
100 + 3 = 103
103 + 3 = 106
106 + 3 = 109
109 + 3 = 112
112 + 3 = 115
115 + 3 = 118
118 + 3 = 121
121 + 3 = 124
124 + 3 = 127
127 + 3 = 130
130 + 3 = 133
133 + 3 = 136
136 + 3 = 139
139 + 3 = 142
142 + 3 = 145
145 + 3 = 148
148 + 3 = 151
151 + 3 = 154
154 + 3 = 157
157 + 3 = 160
160 + 3 = 163
163 + 3 = 166
166 + 3 = 169
169 + 3 = 172
172 + 3 = 175
175 + 3 = 178
178 + 3 = 181
181 + 3 = 184
184 + 3 = 187
187 + 3 = 190
190 + 3 = 193
193 + 3 = 196
196 + 3 = 199
199 + 3 = 202
202 + 3 = 205
205 + 3 = 208
208 + 3 = 211
211 + 3 = 214
214 + 3 = 217
217 + 3 = 220
220 + 3 = 223
223 + 3 = 226
226 + 3 = 229
229 + 3 = 232
232 + 3 = 235
235 + 3 = 238
238 + 3 = 241
241 + 3 = 244
244 + 3 = 247
247 + 3 = 250

Therefore, the number of members in the club is 25.
