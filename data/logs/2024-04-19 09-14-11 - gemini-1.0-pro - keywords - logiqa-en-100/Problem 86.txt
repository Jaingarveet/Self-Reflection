## Assistant 2:
Self-reflection:
* **Error:** I incorrectly assumed that Jiushang Station being adjacent to Haoyun Station and east of Haoyun Station meant that Jiushang Station was directly east of Haoyun Station.
* **Solution:** I need to consider all possible positions of Jiushang Station relative to Haoyun Station, given that they are adjacent and Jiushang Station is east of Haoyun Station.
* **Correct answer:** The correct answer is **C: Yinling is standing on the east side**.
Thought process:
1. **Identify the given information:**
    * Fuyi Station is east of Haoyun Station and west of Huyao Station, and is adjacent to Huyao Station.
    * Jiushang Station is adjacent to Yinling Station.
    * Jiushang Station is adjacent to Haoyun Station and east of Haoyun Station.
2. **Consider the possible positions of Jiushang Station:**
    * Jiushang Station could be directly east of Haoyun Station.
    * Jiushang Station could be between Haoyun Station and Huyao Station.
3. **Analyze the implications of each position:**
    * If Jiushang Station is directly east of Haoyun Station, then Yinling Station would be west of Haoyun Station, which contradicts the given information that Jiushang Station is adjacent to Yinling Station.
    * If Jiushang Station is between Haoyun Station and Huyao Station, then Yinling Station would be east of Haoyun Station, which is consistent with the given information.
4. **Conclusion:**
    * Therefore, the only possible position of Jiushang Station that satisfies all the given information is between Haoyun Station and Huyao Station.
    * This implies that Yinling Station is east of Haoyun Station.
