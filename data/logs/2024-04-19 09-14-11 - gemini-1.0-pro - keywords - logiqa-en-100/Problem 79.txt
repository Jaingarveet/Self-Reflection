## User 2:
Topic: Logic
Context: There must be an outside world, because if there is something outside me that can shine or reflect, shining the light into my eyes, which gives me a visual experience, I ca nâ€™t see the buildings, the crowds and the stars these things.And, not only have visual experience like me, but others also have such visual experience; book knowledge also tells us repeatedly that there is an outside world outside of us.
Question: Which of the following does not constitute doubt or rebuttal to the above argument?
Choices:
  A: To use sensory evidence to explain the existence of the external world requires presupposing the existence of the external world in the mind.
  B: How do you prove that others have similar visual experience to you?
  C: Since the visual experience is reliable, Mirage is not a so-called illusion, but a real existence.
  D: If there is no external world and natural science knowledge is not a true reflection of it, then why does natural science achieve such great success in practice?

## Assistant 2:
## Self-Reflection on Previous Error
**Error:** I misinterpreted the argument and focused on the existence of the external world, rather than the specific claims made in the argument.
**Solution:** I need to carefully analyze the argument and identify the specific claims being made. Then, I need to evaluate each answer choice to see if it constitutes a doubt or rebuttal to those claims.
**Correct Answer:** A
**Explanation:** Choice A points out that the argument relies on circular reasoning. It assumes the existence of the external world to explain the existence of the external world. This is a valid doubt or rebuttal to the argument.
**Other Choices:**
* B: This is not a doubt or rebuttal to the argument. It simply raises a question about the nature of other people's experiences.
* C: This is not a doubt or rebuttal to the argument. It simply makes a claim about the nature of mirages.
* D: This is not a doubt or rebuttal to the argument. It simply points out the success of natural science.
## Applying Self-Reflection to Current Question
**Analysis of Argument:**
The argument claims that the existence of the external world is supported by the following evidence:
* Sensory experience (e.g., seeing buildings, crowds, and stars)
* The existence of other people with similar visual experiences
* Book knowledge
**Evaluation of Answer Choices:**
* A: This is a doubt or rebuttal because it points out a flaw in the argument's reasoning.
* B: This is not a doubt or rebuttal because it simply raises a question about the nature of other people's experiences.
* C: This is not a doubt or rebuttal because it simply makes a claim about the nature of mirages.
* D: This is not a doubt or rebuttal because it simply points out the success of natural science.
