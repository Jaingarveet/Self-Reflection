Topic: Logic
Context: There are five volcanic islands E, F, G, H, and I in the east coast of a country.They are arranged in a straight line from north to south, and they are found? (1) F is adjacent to H and is on the north side of H.(2) I and E are adjacent.(3) G is somewhere in the north of F.
Question: If it is found that G is the northernmost island, how many possible arrangements are there for this group of islands?
Choices:
  A: 2
  B: 3
  C: 4
  D: 5

## Assistant 2:
I understand. I will carefully consider all the information provided and avoid oversimplification, lack of consideration of alternative possibilities, and misinterpretation of constraints.
Here's my step-by-step analysis:
1. **Constraints:**
    - G is the northernmost island.
    - F is adjacent to H and is on the north side of H.
    - I and E are adjacent.
2. **Possible arrangements:**
    - **Case 1:** G - F - H - (I, E)
        - In this case, I and E can be arranged in either order, resulting in 2 possibilities.
    - **Case 2:** G - (I, E) - F - H
        - Similar to Case 1, I and E can be arranged in either order, resulting in 2 possibilities.
    - **Case 3:** G - (H, F) - (I, E)
        - In this case, both H and F, and I and E can be arranged in either order, resulting in 2 * 2 = 4 possibilities.
3. **Total possibilities:**
    - Adding the possibilities from all cases, we get 2 + 2 + 4 = 8.
Therefore, there are 8 possible arrangements for the group of islands.
