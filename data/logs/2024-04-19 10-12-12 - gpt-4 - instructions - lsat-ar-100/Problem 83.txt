Context: A chemistry class has six lab sessions scheduled over three days—Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday—one session heing held each morning and one each afternoon. Each session will be led by a different lab assistant—Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, or Rebecca. The assignment of lab assistants to sessions is constrained as follows: Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day. Nessa must lead an afternoon session. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.

  B: Lan's session meets Thursday afternoon.
  C: Nessa's session meets Friday afternoon.
  D: Olivia's session meets Thursday morning.

Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Understand the constraints given in the question.
2. Identify the implications of each constraint.
3. Apply the constraints to each of the answer choices.
4. Identify the answer choice that violates one or more of the constraints.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Given the constraints, we know that:
- Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions on the same day.
- Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions on the same day.
- Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
- Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
If Julio and Kevin both lead morning sessions, then:
- Julio cannot lead a session on Friday because his session must be earlier than Olivia's.
- Kevin cannot lead a session on Friday because he and Rebecca must lead sessions on the same day, and there are only two sessions per day.
Given these constraints, let's evaluate the answer choices:
A: Lan's session meets Wednesday morning. This is possible.
B: Lan's session meets Thursday afternoon. This is possible.
C: Nessa's session meets Friday afternoon. This is possible because Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
D: Olivia's session meets Thursday morning. This is possible because Olivia cannot lead a session on the same day as Lan, who could lead a session on Wednesday.
E: Olivia's session meets Friday morning. This is not possible because Julio, who must lead a session earlier than Olivia, cannot lead a session on Friday.
Action: Answer("E")
## Result:
Agent Answer: E
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
