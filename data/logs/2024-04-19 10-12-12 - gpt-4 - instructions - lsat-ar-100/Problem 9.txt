## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The rules state that Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa, Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, and Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Additionally, Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4. If Young is assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, then Souza cannot be assigned a high-numbered parking space. Therefore, Souza must be assigned a lower-numbered parking space.
