Topic: Law
Context: Of the eight students—George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert—in a seminar, exactly six will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.

Choices:
  A: Helen gives a report on Monday.
  B: Irving gives a report on Monday.
  C: Irving gives a report on Wednesday.

## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Given that Helen, Kyle, and Lenore give the three morning reports, we know that George, Irving, Nina, Olivia, and Robert will give the afternoon reports. However, neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report, so they are out. This leaves George, Irving, and Nina for the afternoon reports. But George can only give a report on Tuesday, so he must be the afternoon report on Tuesday. This means that Irving and Nina must give the afternoon reports on Monday and Wednesday. But if Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. So, Nina must give the report on Wednesday and Irving on Monday. Therefore, Irving must give a report on Monday.
Action: Answer("B")
