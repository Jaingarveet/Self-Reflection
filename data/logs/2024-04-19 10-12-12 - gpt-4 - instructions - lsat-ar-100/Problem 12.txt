Context: A realtor will show a prospective buyer seven houses—J, K, L, M, N, 0, and P—during a single day. The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning; the third, fourth, and fifth houses to be shown will be shown in the afternoon; the sixth and seventh houses to be shown will be shown in the evening.

L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.

## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
J must be shown in the evening, so it can only be the 6th or 7th house. 
K cannot be shown in the morning, so it can be the 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, or 7th house. 
L must be shown after K and before M, so it can't be the first or last house. 
Given these constraints, the only pair that cannot be shown consecutively in either order is J and K, because J must be shown in the evening and K cannot be shown in the morning, so they can't be shown consecutively.
Action: Answer("A")
