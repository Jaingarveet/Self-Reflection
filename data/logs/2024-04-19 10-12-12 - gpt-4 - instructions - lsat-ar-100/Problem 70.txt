Context: A maintenance company that takes service requests from three clients—Image, Solide, and Truvest—plans to set targets for its average service response times. Service targets will be set at 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day. Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail. The six targets are set according to the following conditions: None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
Question: If Solide's voicemail target is shorter than Truvest's website target, which one of the following targets could be 2 days?
Choices:
  A: Image's website target
  B: Image's voicemail target
  C: Solide's website target
  D: Truvest's voicemail target
  E: Truvest's website target

4. Compare the possible targets with the options given in the question.

## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The conditions are as follows:
1. None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
2. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
3. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
4. Solide's voicemail target is shorter than Truvest's website target.
From these conditions, we can infer that:
- Image's voicemail target must be 1 day (shortest possible), so Image's website target can be 1 or 2 days.
- Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target, and since Solide's voicemail target is shorter than Truvest's website target, Solide's website target must be 1 day.
- Truvest's website target must be longer than Solide's website target, so it must be 2 or 3 days. Truvest's voicemail target can be the same or longer, so it can be 2 or 3 days.
Action: Answer("A")
