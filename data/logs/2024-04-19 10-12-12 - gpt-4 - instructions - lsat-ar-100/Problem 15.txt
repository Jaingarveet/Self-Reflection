Context: A shopping center has exactly seven spaces—space 1 through space 7—arranged in a straight row. Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.

## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. This means the pharmacy and the restaurant can only be in spaces 1 and 7. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, so if the shoe store is in space 4, one restaurant must be in space 1 or 2, and the other in space 6 or 7. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, so if the pharmacy is in space 1, the optometrist or the veterinarian must be in space 2, and if the pharmacy is in space 7, the optometrist or the veterinarian must be in space 6. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so the toy store cannot be in space 3 or 5 if the veterinarian is in space 4, or in space 5 or 7 if the veterinarian is in space 6, or in space 1 or 3 if the veterinarian is in space 2. 
Action: Answer("B")
