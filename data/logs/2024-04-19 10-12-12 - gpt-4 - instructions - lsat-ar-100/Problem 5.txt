## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The conditions state that K is placed on a higher shelf than F and F is placed on the same shelf as M. Therefore, K must be placed on a shelf higher than M. However, this option is not given in the choices. The conditions also state that I is placed on the middle shelf. Since K is placed on a higher shelf than F, and F is on the same shelf as M, F and M cannot be on the top shelf. Therefore, they must be on the middle or bottom shelf. Since I is on the middle shelf, F and M must be on the bottom shelf. Therefore, I must be placed on a shelf higher than F. 
Action: Answer("C")
