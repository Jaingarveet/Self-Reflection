Topic: Law
Context: Exactly five witnesses—Franco, Garcia, Hong, Iturbe, and Jackson—are to be scheduled to testify at a hearing that is to take exactly three days of one week—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.

Instructions:
1. Understand the conditions given in the question.
2. Identify the constraints for each witness.
3. Determine the possible days each witness can testify.
4. If a condition is given (like Franco and Hong testifying on the same day), apply this to the possible days.
5. Based on the conditions and constraints, determine the necessary truth of the schedule.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Given that Franco and Hong testify on the same day, and considering the conditions that Franco does not testify on the same day as Garcia, Iturbe testifies on Wednesday, exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday, Hong does not testify on Monday, and at least one witness testifies on Monday, we can deduce the following:
- Franco and Hong cannot testify on Monday because Hong does not testify on Monday.
- Franco and Hong cannot testify on Wednesday because Iturbe testifies on Wednesday and only two witnesses can testify on Tuesday, leaving no room for Franco and Hong on Wednesday.
- Therefore, Franco and Hong must testify on Tuesday.
- Since two witnesses testify on Tuesday and those are Franco and Hong, Garcia cannot testify on Tuesday because Franco does not testify on the same day as Garcia.
- Garcia cannot testify on Wednesday because Iturbe testifies on Wednesday and Franco and Hong testify on Tuesday, leaving only Monday for Garcia.
- Therefore, Garcia must testify on Monday.
Action: Answer("B")
