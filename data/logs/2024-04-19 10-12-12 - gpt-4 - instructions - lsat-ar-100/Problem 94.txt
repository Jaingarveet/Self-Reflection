Context: A shopping center has exactly seven spaces—space 1 through space 7—arranged in a straight row. Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.

## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The veterinarian is in space 5. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. Therefore, the pharmacy must be in space 4 or 6. However, one of the restaurants must be at one end of the row, and the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. Therefore, the pharmacy cannot be in space 6, because then a restaurant would have to be in space 7, and the other restaurant would have to be in space 3 or 4, which is not possible because the pharmacy is in space 4. Therefore, the pharmacy must be in space 4, and a restaurant must be in space 7. This means that the other restaurant must be in space 1 or 2. Therefore, the optometrist cannot be in space 2, because then the pharmacy would not be next to the optometrist or the veterinarian. Therefore, the optometrist must be in space 6. Therefore, the shoe store cannot be in space 6. Therefore, the toy store cannot be in space 3, because then it would be next to the veterinarian. Therefore, the only answer that must be true is that the pharmacy is in space 4.
Action: Answer("B")
