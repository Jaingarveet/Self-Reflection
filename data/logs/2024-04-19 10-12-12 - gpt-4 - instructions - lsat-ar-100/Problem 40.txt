Context: A shopping center has exactly seven spaces—space 1 through space 7—arranged in a straight row. Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
Question: If the shoe store is in space 2, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: The optometrist is in space 5.
  B: The pharmacy is in space 1.
  C: A restaurant is in space 3.

## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Given the constraints, the pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. This means the pharmacy can only be in space 1 or 7, and the restaurants can only be in space 1, 3, 5, or 7. The shoe store is in space 2, so the pharmacy cannot be in space 1 because it must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. Therefore, the pharmacy must be in space 7. The restaurants cannot be in space 3 because they must be separated by at least two other businesses. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so it cannot be in space 6 if the veterinarian is in space 7. The optometrist cannot be in space 5 because the pharmacy is in space 7 and must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The veterinarian can be in space 6, which is not next to the toy store.
Action: Answer("E")
## Result:
