Thought: 
Let's go through each option one by one and check each condition against the option.
Option A: L, P, S, R, O, T, F, H
- T is not performed immediately before F or immediately after R.
- O is performed fifth, which is correct.
- The eighth composition performed is H, which is correct.
- P is performed before S, which is correct.
- This option fails the first condition, so it's not the correct answer.
Option B: O, T, P, F, S, H, R, L
- T is not performed immediately before F or immediately after R.
- O is performed first, which is correct.
- The eighth composition performed is L, which is correct.
- P is performed before S, which is correct.
- This option fails the first condition, so it's not the correct answer.
Option C: P, T, F, S, L, R, O, H
- T is performed immediately before F, which is correct.
- O is performed fifth, which is incorrect.
- The eighth composition performed is H, which is correct.
- P is performed before S, which is correct.
- This option fails the third condition, so it's not the correct answer.
Option D: P, T, F, S, O, R, L, H
- T is performed immediately before F, which is correct.
- O is performed fifth, which is correct.
- The eighth composition performed is H, which is correct.
- P is performed before S, which is correct.
- This option satisfies all conditions, so it could be the correct answer.
Option E: T, F, P, R, O, L, S, H
- T is performed immediately before F, which is correct.
- O is performed fifth, which is correct.
- The eighth composition performed is H, which is correct.
- P is not performed before S.
