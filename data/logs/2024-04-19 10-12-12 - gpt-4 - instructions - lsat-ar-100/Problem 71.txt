Context: A software company employs exactly seven sales representatives—Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall—to work in its three sales zones—Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3. Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
From the conditions, we know that either Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1, and either Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2. This means that Tiao cannot work in Zone 3 because Tiao must work in either Zone 1 or Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same zone, and Stuckey and Udall work in the same zone. Since there are more representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, and considering the restrictions, the only possible representatives that can work in Zone 3 are Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, and Udall.
Action: Answer("E")
