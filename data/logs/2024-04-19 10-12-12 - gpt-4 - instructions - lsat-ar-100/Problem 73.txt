Context: For the school paper, five students—Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, Megregian, and O'Neill—each review one or more of exactly three plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation, but do not review any other plays. The following conditions must apply: Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.

  A: Megregian does not review Undulation.
  B: O'Neill does not review Undulation.

## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Given the conditions, Megregian reviews more plays than Kramer and Lopez. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other. If exactly three of the students review Undulation, we can deduce the following:
- Megregian must review Undulation, as he reviews more plays than Kramer and Lopez.
- Kramer and O'Neill must review Undulation, as they both review Tamerlane and exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
- Jiang cannot review Undulation, as neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
- Lopez cannot review Tamerlane, as Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane and Lopez reviews fewer plays than Megregian.
- O'Neill can review Sunset, as there is no condition preventing him from doing so.
Action: Answer("E")
