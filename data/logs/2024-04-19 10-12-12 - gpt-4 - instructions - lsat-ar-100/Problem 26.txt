Context: During a recital, two pianists—Wayne and Zara—will perform solos. There will be five solos altogether, performed one immediately after another. Each solo will be either a modern piece or a traditional piece. The choice of pianist and type of piece for the solos must conform to the following conditions: The third solo is a traditional piece. Exactly two of the traditional pieces are performed consecutively. In the fourth solo, either Wayne performs a traditional piece or Zara performs a modern piece. The pianist who performs the second solo does not perform the fifth solo. No traditional piece is performed until Wayne performs at least one modem piece.
Question: What is the minimum number of solos in which Wayne performs a traditional piece?
Choices:
  A: zero
  B: one
  C: two
  D: three
  E: four

4. Consider all possible scenarios, not just the [REDACTED]s that seem obvious.
5. Choose the answer that fits all conditions and scenarios.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The third solo is a traditional piece. 
Exactly two of the traditional pieces are performed consecutively, which means the fourth solo is also a traditional piece. 
In the fourth solo, either Wayne performs a traditional piece or Zara performs a modern piece. Since it's a traditional piece, Wayne must perform it. 
No traditional piece is performed until Wayne performs at least one modern piece, which means Wayne must perform a modern piece before the third solo. 
The pianist who performs the second solo does not perform the fifth solo. If Wayne performs the second solo (a modern piece), he can't perform the fifth solo. But if Zara performs the second solo, Wayne can perform the fifth solo. 
So, Wayne must perform at least one modern piece and two traditional pieces. 
Action: Answer("C")
