## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The correct answer highlights the shift in perspective from purely financial metrics to a broader concept of excellence, which affects how "good" or "bad" things are evaluated within the industry.

Choice A emphasizes the transition from competition within enterprises to competition across the industry as a whole, which is a reasonable consequence of the changed perspective.

Choice B is incorrect because it focuses solely on the financial aspect, suggesting that being the best directly leads to monetary gain. This is a narrow view and doesn't consider the broader definition of 'excellence'.

Choice C is incorrect as it implies that profitability is a prerequisite for striving for excellence, which isn't necessarily true. Excellence can be pursued regardless of industry profitability, and it may even help improve profitability.

Choice D is the correct answer. It captures the essence of the changed perspective, where the evaluation of success is no longer solely based on financial metrics but on a broader set of criteria that define 'good' and 'bad' within the industry context.

Answer: D
