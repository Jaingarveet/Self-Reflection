Topic: Logic
Context: The members of the printing group and the binding group are mainly from the following seven employees-F, G, H, J, K, L and M.The members of each group must meet the following conditions? (1) Each group has at least 3 employees .(2) F and K cannot be in the same group.(3) If K is in a certain group, J must also be in this group.(4) M is at least one of the members of these two groups.(5) At least one of the same employees in both groups.
Question: If the printing group has only three members, G, H, and L, and under sufficient conditions, the two groups have as many common members as possible, then which of the following statements must be true?
Choices:
  A: The binding group and the printing group happen to have a common member.
  B: The binding group and the printing group have exactly two members in common.
  C: The number of members in the binding and printing groups is the same.
  D: The number of members of the bookbinding group is at least one more than that of the printing group.

Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:

Given that the printing group consists of G, H, and L, and conditions (2), (3), and (4) must be satisfied, we can deduce the following: 

- F and K cannot be in the same group (condition 2).
- J and K must be in the same group (condition 3).
- M must be in either the printing or binding group (condition 4). 

To maximize the number of common members between the two groups, we can assign J and K to the binding group, ensuring they are in the same group as required by condition (3). Additionally, we can place M in the binding group to satisfy condition (4). 

This results in the binding group having at least one more member than the printing group (4 members vs. 3 members), which is the statement provided in choice [REDACTED].
