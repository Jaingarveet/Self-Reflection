Context: A maintenance company that takes service requests from three clients—Image, Solide, and Truvest—plans to set targets for its average service response times. Service targets will be set at 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day. Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail. The six targets are set according to the following conditions: None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.

## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
According to the conditions, none of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. This means that the website target must be equal to or less than the voicemail target. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. This means that Image's voicemail target cannot be 2 days because it must be the shortest. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target. If Solide's voicemail target is shorter than Truvest's website target, then Solide's website target cannot be 2 days because it must be shorter than Truvest's website target. Therefore, the only possible targets that could be 2 days are Image's website target, Truvest's voicemail target, and Truvest's website target. However, since Solide's voicemail target is shorter than Truvest's website target, Truvest's website target cannot be 2 days. Therefore, the only possible targets that could be 2 days are Image's website target and Truvest's voicemail target.
