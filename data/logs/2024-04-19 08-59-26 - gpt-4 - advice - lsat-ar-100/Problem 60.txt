## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The conditions state that Greyhounds are featured on day 1, so the breed of kitten on day 1 cannot be Himalayan. Also, no breed is featured on any two consecutive days, and any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7. Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1. Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans. 
Looking at the choices, we can eliminate options A, D, and E because they have Himalayans on day 1 or day 7, which violates the conditions. 
Option B has Himalayans on two consecutive days (day 4 and day 5), which also violates the conditions. 
So, the only remaining option is C, which satisfies all the conditions. 
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: E
Score: 0
