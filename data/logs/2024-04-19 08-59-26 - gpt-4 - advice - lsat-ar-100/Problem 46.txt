Context: On the first day of a two-day study for a cycling magazine, four riders—Reynaldo, Seamus, Theresa, and Yuki—will each test one of four bicycles—F, G, H, and J. Each rider will then test a different one of the bicycles on the second day. Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day. The assignment of riders to bicycles is subject to the following conditions: Reynaldo cannot test F. Yuki cannot test J. Theresa must be one of the testers for H. The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
Question: Which one of the following CANNOT be true?
Choices:
  A: Reynaldo tests G on the second day.
  B: Seamus tests F on the first day.
  C: Theresa tests F on the second day.
  D: Reynaldo tests H on the first day.
  E: Yuki tests F on the second day.

## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The conditions state that Reynaldo cannot test F and Yuki cannot test J. Theresa must be one of the testers for H. The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day. Therefore, if Yuki tests F on the second day, it means Seamus cannot test F on the first day because Seamus has to test the bicycle that Yuki tested on the first day. This contradicts the condition that all four bicycles are tested each day.
