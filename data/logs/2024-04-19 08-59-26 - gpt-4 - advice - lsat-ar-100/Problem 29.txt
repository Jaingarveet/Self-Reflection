## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Given that L is placed on a shelf higher than H, and O is placed on a higher shelf than L, O must be on the top shelf. Since K is placed on a higher shelf than F, and F is on the same shelf as M, K cannot be on the bottom shelf. Therefore, K must be on the top shelf. Hence, K and O are on the same shelf.
