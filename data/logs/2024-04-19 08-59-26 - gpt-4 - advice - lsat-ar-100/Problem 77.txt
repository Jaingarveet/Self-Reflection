Topic: Law
Context: An administrator must assign parking spaces to six new employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young. Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
Question: For how many of the six new employees is the assignment of a parking space limited to one of only two possible spaces?
Choices:
  A: none
  B: two
  C: three
  D: four
  E: five
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Advice:
- Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
- Break down complex problems into simpler parts.
- Consider the implications of each rule or restriction individually.
- Consider how the rules or restrictions interact with each other.
- Double-check your reasoning and final answer.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The rules state that:
1. Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
2. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
3. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
4. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
From these rules, we can deduce that:
- Togowa cannot be assigned parking space #6 because Young must have a higher number.
- Young cannot be assigned parking space #1 because Robertson must have a lower number.
- Souza cannot be assigned parking space #6 because Xu must have a higher number.
- Xu cannot be assigned parking space #1 because Souza must have a lower number.
- Robertson cannot be assigned parking space #5 or #6 because he must be in #1, #2, #3, or #4.
So, the employees with only two possible spaces are:
- Togowa: can only be in #1 or #2 because Young must be higher and Robertson must be higher than Young.
- Young: can only be in #3 or #4 because Robertson must be lower and Togowa must be lower.
- Robertson: can only be in #1 or #2 because he must be lower than Young and cannot be in #5 or #6.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
