## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. This means that the pharmacy and the restaurant are in spaces 1 and 7, or vice versa. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, so the other restaurant cannot be in spaces 2, 3, 5, or 6. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, so the pharmacy cannot be next to the shoe store in space 4. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so the toy store cannot be in spaces 3 or 5. Therefore, the shoe store must be next to the toy store.
Action: Answer("D")
