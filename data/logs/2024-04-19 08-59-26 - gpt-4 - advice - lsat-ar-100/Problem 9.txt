Context: An administrator must assign parking spaces to six new employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young. Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
Question: If Young is assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Togowa is assigned parking space #1.
  B: Young is assigned parking space #2.
  C: Robertson is assigned parking space #3.
  D: Souza is assigned parking space #3.
  E: Vaughn is assigned parking space #4.

## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The rules state that Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa, Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, and Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Also, Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4. If Young is assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, then Souza cannot be assigned a high-numbered parking space. Therefore, Souza cannot be assigned parking space #3 (Choice D) because Young would then have to be assigned a higher-numbered parking space, which would conflict with the rule that Robertson (who can only be assigned parking spaces #1-#4) must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Similarly, Young cannot be assigned parking space #2 (Choice B) because Robertson would then have to be assigned parking space #1, which would conflict with the rule that Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Togowa cannot be assigned parking space #1 (Choice A) because Young would then have to be assigned a higher-numbered parking space, which would conflict with the rule that Robertson (who can only be assigned parking spaces #1-#4) must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson cannot be assigned parking space #3 (Choice C) because Young would then have to be assigned a higher-numbered parking space, which would conflict with the rule that Robertson (who can only be assigned parking spaces #1-#4) must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Therefore, the only option that could be true is that Vaughn is assigned parking space #4 (Choice E).
Action: Answer("E")
