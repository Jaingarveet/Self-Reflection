Context: At a concert, exactly eight compositions—F, H, L, O, P, R, S, and T—are to be performed exactly once each, consecutively and one composition at a time. The order of their performance must satisfy the following conditions: T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R. At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F. O is performed either first or fifth. The eighth composition performed is either L or H. P is performed at some time before S. At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
Question: If O is performed immediately after T, then F must be performed either

## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Given that O is performed immediately after T, and O is performed either first or fifth, T must be performed either first or fourth. If T is performed first, F must be performed second (since T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R, and R cannot be performed before T). If T is performed fourth, F must be performed fifth (since R cannot be performed before T). Therefore, F must be performed either second or fifth. However, this option is not available in the choices. The closest option is "second or third". 
Action: Answer("B")
