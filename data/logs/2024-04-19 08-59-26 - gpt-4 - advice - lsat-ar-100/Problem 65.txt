Context: A panel of five scientists will be formed. The panelists will be selected from among three botanists—F, G, and H—three chemists—K, L, and M—and three zoologists—P, Q, and R. Selection is governed by the following conditions: The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types. If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. F and K cannot both be selected. K and M cannot both be selected. If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
Question: If M is the only chemist selected for the panel, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: F and G are both selected.
  B: G and H are both selected.
  C: H and P are both selected.
  D: F, G, and H are all selected.
  E: P, Q, and R are all selected.

## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
If M is the only chemist selected, then both P and R must be selected according to the conditions. This means that at most one botanist can be selected because if more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. Therefore, the only option that must be true is that P and R are selected, and only one botanist is selected. 
Action: Answer("E")
## Result:
Agent Answer: E
Correct Answer: E
Score: 1
