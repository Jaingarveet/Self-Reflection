## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I misinterpreted the data in the table. I assumed that because all four pathogens were present in colonies with colony collapse disorder, this meant that all colonies were infected by all four pathogens. However, the table actually shows the percentage of colonies affected by each individual pathogen, not all four together.
Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation
- Data analysis error
- Reading comprehension error
Solution:
The table shows the percentage of colonies with colony collapse disorder that were affected by each individual pathogen and by all four pathogens together. The percentage of colonies with colony collapse disorder where the honeybees were infected by all four pathogens is listed under "All four pathogens". The correct answer is 77 percent.
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully to understand what is being asked.
2. Look at the table and identify the relevant data.
3. Understand that the percentages listed for each pathogen are for individual infections, not combined.
4. Find the data for "All four pathogens" to get the percentage of colonies where honeybees were infected by all four pathogens.
5. Choose the answer that matches the data found in the table.
Advice:
- Always read the question and data carefully.
- Understand the difference between individual and combined data.
- Don't make assumptions based on partial data.
- Always double-check your interpretation of the data and your final answer.
