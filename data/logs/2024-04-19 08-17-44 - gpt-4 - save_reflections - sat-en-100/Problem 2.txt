## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misinterpreted the authors' views in Passage 1. I assumed that the authors were comparing the skills needed to run a household and raise children to those needed to run a country or a business, which led me to choose option D. However, the authors did not make such a comparison in the passage.
Error Keywords:
- Reading comprehension error
- Inference error
- Misinterpretation
Solution:
The authors of Passage 1 suggest that women are best suited for "gentle occupations and the cares of the home" due to their "delicate constitutions, peaceful inclinations, and the many duties of motherhood." They do not suggest that these roles are rewarding for men, yield less value than men's roles, or require skills similar to those needed to run a country or a business. However, they do imply that these roles are not strenuous or onerous, which leads to the correct answer, option C: "entail very few activities that are difficult or unpleasant."
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and understand what is being asked.
2. Read the passage carefully and identify the authors' views on the topic.
3. Based on the authors' views, eliminate the options that do not align with these views.
4. From the remaining options, choose the one that best aligns with the authors' views as presented in the passage.
5. Double-check your answer to ensure it accurately reflects the authors' views.
Advice:
- Always read the question and passage carefully.
- Try to understand the authors' views and intentions in the passage.
- Do not make assumptions or inferences that are not supported by the text.
- Always double-check your answer to ensure it aligns with the authors' views.
