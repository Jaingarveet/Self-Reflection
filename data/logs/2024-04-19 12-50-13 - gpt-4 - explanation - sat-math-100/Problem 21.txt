# Model: gpt-4 | Agent: explanation | Exam: sat-math-100 | Problem 21 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Explanation:
I made a mistake in the calculation of the discriminant (b²-4ac) in the quadratic formula. I incorrectly calculated it as 12² - 4*3*6, when it should have been 12² - 4*3*2.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The quadratic formula is x = [-b ± sqrt(b² - 4ac)] / 2a.
Here, a = 3, b = 12, and c = 2.
The discriminant (b² - 4ac) is 12² - 4*3*2 = 144 - 24 = 120.
The square root of 120 is approximately 10.95.
So, the solutions are x = [-12 ± sqrt(120)] / 2*3 = -2 ± sqrt(120)/6.
Simplifying sqrt(120)/6 gives sqrt(30)/3.
So, the solutions are x = -2 ± sqrt(30)/3.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
