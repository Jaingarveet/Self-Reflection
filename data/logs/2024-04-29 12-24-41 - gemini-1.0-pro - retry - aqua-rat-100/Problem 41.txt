## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Let the number of friends who attended the picnic be x.
Then, (x - 4) * (96/x) = 96 + 4(x - 4)
=> 96 - 384/x = 96 + 4x - 16
=> 4x^2 - 112x - 288 = 0
=> x^2 - 28x - 72 = 0
=> (x - 36)(x + 2) = 0
=> x = 36 or x = -2
Since the number of friends cannot be negative, x = 36.
Action: Answer("E")
## Result:
Agent Answer: E
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
