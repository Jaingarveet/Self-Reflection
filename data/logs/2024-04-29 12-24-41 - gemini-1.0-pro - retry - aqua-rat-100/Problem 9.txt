## Assistant 2:
I apologize for the previous incorrect answer. I have reviewed the problem and my solution and have identified the error. I will now provide the correct answer.
**Thought:**
* The grocer makes a 25% profit on the selling price of each bag of flour.
* This means that the profit is 25% of $100, which is $25.
* The grocer makes a total profit of $3,000.
* To find the number of bags sold, we need to divide the total profit by the profit per bag.
**Calculation:**
```
Number of bags sold = Total profit / Profit per bag
Number of bags sold = $3,000 / $25
Number of bags sold = 120
```
**Action:** Answer("E")
## Result:
Agent Answer: E
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
