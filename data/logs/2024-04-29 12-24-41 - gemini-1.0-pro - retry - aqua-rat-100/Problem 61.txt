## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Let's analyze the information provided:
- Kevin drove from A to B at 70 mph.
- He then drove back from B to A at 90 mph.
- 3 hours before the end of his trip, he was 70 miles away from B.
Let's denote the distance between A and B as "d".
**Time to reach B:**
Time = Distance / Speed
Time from A to B = d / 70
**Time to reach A from B:**
Time from B to A = d / 90
**Total time:**
Total time = Time from A to B + Time from B to A
We know that 3 hours before the end of his trip, he was 70 miles away from B. This means that he had already covered (d - 70) miles from B.
**Time remaining 3 hours before the end:**
Time remaining = (d - 70) / 90
**Total time - Time remaining = 3 hours**
(d / 70) + (d / 90) - ((d - 70) / 90) = 3
Simplifying the equation:
(9d + 7d - 7d) / 630 = 3
9d / 630 = 3
d = 210
Therefore, the distance between A and B is 210 miles.
Action: Answer("E")
## Result:
Agent Answer: E
Correct Answer: A
