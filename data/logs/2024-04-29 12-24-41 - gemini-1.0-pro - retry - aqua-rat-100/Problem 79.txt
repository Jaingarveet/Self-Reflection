## Assistant 2:
I apologize for the previous incorrect answer. I am still under development and learning to improve my accuracy. 
Let's analyze the problem step-by-step:
1. **Total people:** 5 sons + 4 daughters + 2 nephews = 11 people.
2. **Nephews' share:** Let x be the amount each nephew receives.
3. **Daughters' share:** Each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, so each daughter receives 4x.
4. **Sons' share:** Each son receives five times as much as each nephew, so each son receives 5x.
5. **Total amount:** The total amount is Rs 8600.
We can set up an equation based on the total amount:
```
5x + 4(4x) + 2x = 8600
```
Simplifying the equation:
```
5x + 16x + 2x = 8600
```
Combining like terms:
```
23x = 8600
```
Dividing both sides by 23:
```
x = 373.91
```
Therefore, each nephew receives Rs 373.91.
Each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew:
```
4x = 4 * 373.91 = 1495.64
```
Therefore, each daughter receives Rs 1495.64.
Action: Answer("E")
