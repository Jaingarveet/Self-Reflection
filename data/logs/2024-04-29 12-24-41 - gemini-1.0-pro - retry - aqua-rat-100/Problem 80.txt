## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Let the number of white sharpeners be x and the number of brown sharpeners be y.
From the given information, we know that:
x + y = 18 (total number of sharpeners)
x - y = 1 (difference in price per sharpener)
Solving these two equations simultaneously, we get:
x = 9 and y = 9
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
