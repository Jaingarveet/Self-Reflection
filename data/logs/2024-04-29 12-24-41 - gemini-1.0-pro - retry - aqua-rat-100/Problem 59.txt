## Assistant 2:
I apologize for the previous mistake. I will try my best to answer this question correctly.
**Thought:**
* We know that 20 marbles were painted black and returned to the bag.
* We also know that 20 marbles were pulled out again, and 1 of them was black.
* The percentage of black marbles in the second draw represents the percentage of black marbles in the bag.
**Calculation:**
* The percentage of black marbles in the second draw is 1/20 = 5%.
* Therefore, the total number of marbles in the bag is Q = 20 / 0.05 = 400.
**Action:** Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
