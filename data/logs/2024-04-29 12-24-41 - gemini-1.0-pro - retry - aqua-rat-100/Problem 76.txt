## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Assistant 2:
I understand. I will try my best to answer this question correctly.
**Step 1: Simplify the expression for x.**
We can start by simplifying the expression for x:
```
x = (n^2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16) / (n + 4√n + 4)
```
```
= (n + 4√n + 4)(n - 4√n + 4) / (n + 4√n + 4)
```
```
= n - 4√n + 4
```
**Step 2: Find the minimum and maximum values of n.**
We are given that 36 ≤ n ≤ 72. Therefore, the minimum value of n is 36 and the maximum value of n is 72.
**Step 3: Find the minimum and maximum values of x.**
To find the minimum value of x, we substitute n = 36 into the expression for x:
```
x = 36 - 4√36 + 4 = 28
```
To find the maximum value of x, we substitute n = 72 into the expression for x:
```
x = 72 - 4√72 + 4 = 60
```
**Step 4: Choose the answer that satisfies the range of x.**
The range of x is 28 ≤ x ≤ 60. Therefore, the answer that satisfies this range is **D: 28 < x < 60**.
**Action: Answer("D")**
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
