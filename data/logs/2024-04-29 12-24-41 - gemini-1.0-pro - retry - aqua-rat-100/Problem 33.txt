## Assistant 2:
I understand. I will try my best to answer this question correctly.
**Thought:**
1. The area of the square paper is 20 cm * 20 cm = 400 cm².
2. The diameter of each semi-circle is 20 cm, so the radius is 10 cm.
3. The area of each semi-circle is (π * 10²)/2 = 50π cm².
4. The total area of the two semi-circles is 100π cm².
5. The area of the remaining paper is 400 cm² - 100π cm².
6. Using a calculator, we find that 400 cm² - 100π cm² ≈ 8.79 cm².
**Action:** Answer("B")

Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: C
