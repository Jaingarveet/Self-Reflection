## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: Amy is organizing her bookshelves and finds that she has 10 different types of books. She then codes each book with either a single letter or a pair of two different letters. If each type of book is uniquely represented by either a single letter or pair of letters, what is the smallest number of letters Amy will need to create the codes for all 10 types of books? (Assume the order of letters in a pair does not matter.)
Choices:
  A: 3
  B: 4
  C: 5
  D: 10
  E: 20

## Assistant 2:
I understand. I will try my best to answer this question correctly.
**Step 1: Analyze the problem.**
We need to find the smallest number of letters Amy needs to create unique codes for 10 different types of books. Each code can be either a single letter or a pair of two different letters.
**Step 2: Consider single-letter codes.**
If Amy uses only single-letter codes, she would need 10 different letters, one for each type of book. However, this is not the smallest number possible.
**Step 3: Consider two-letter codes.**
If Amy uses two-letter codes, she can create 26 * 25 = 650 unique codes (26 choices for the first letter and 25 choices for the second letter, excluding repetitions). This is more than enough to represent 10 different types of books.
**Step 4: Find the smallest number of letters for two-letter codes.**
To minimize the number of letters needed, Amy should use the first 5 letters of the alphabet for the first letter of the code and the next 5 letters for the second letter. This way, she can create 5 * 5 = 25 unique codes using only 5 different letters.
**Step 5: Conclusion.**
Therefore, the smallest number of letters Amy needs to create unique codes for 10 different types of books is 5.
**Action: Answer("C")**
