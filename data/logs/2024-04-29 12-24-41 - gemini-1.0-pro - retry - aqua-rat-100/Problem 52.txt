## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Alloy X has 6/15 zinc and 9/15 copper.
Alloy Y has 7/18 zinc and 11/18 copper.
40 grams of alloy X has 40*6/15 = 16 grams of zinc and 40*9/15 = 24 grams of copper.
60 grams of alloy Y has 60*7/18 = 20 grams of zinc and 60*11/18 = 33 grams of copper.
Alloy Z has 16+20 = 36 grams of zinc and 24+33 = 57 grams of copper.
The ratio of zinc and copper in alloy Z is 36:57 = 12:19.
Action: Answer("E")
## Result:
Agent Answer: E
Correct Answer: B
