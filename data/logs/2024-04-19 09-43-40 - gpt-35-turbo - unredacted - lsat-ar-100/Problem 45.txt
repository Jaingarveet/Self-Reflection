Topic: Law
Context: A maintenance company that takes service requests from three clients—Image, Solide, and Truvest—plans to set targets for its average service response times. Service targets will be set at 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day. Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail. The six targets are set according to the following conditions: None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
Question: If Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Image's voicemail target is 2 days.
  B: Image's website target is 2 days.
  C: Image's website target is 1 day.
  D: Solide's website target is 2 days.
  E: Solide's website target is 1 day.

Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
My mistake was in misinterpreting the condition that Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target. I assumed that Solide's website target was 1 day because Truvest's website target was 1 day. However, the correct interpretation is that Solide's website target is longer than Truvest's website target. Therefore, Solide's website target is 2 days. Since Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets, and Truvest's voicemail target is 2 days, Image's voicemail target must be 1 day. This means that Image's website target must be 2 days. 
Error Keywords:
 - Misinterpretation
 - Assumption error
 - Logical error
Solution:
If Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, then Truvest's website target is 1 day and its voicemail target is 2 days. 
Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target, so Solide's website target is 2 days. 
Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets, so Image's voicemail target is 1 day. 
Therefore, Image's website target must be 2 days.
