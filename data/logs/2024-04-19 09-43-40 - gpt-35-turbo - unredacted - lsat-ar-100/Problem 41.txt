Context: On the first day of a two-day study for a cycling magazine, four riders—Reynaldo, Seamus, Theresa, and Yuki—will each test one of four bicycles—F, G, H, and J. Each rider will then test a different one of the bicycles on the second day. Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day. The assignment of riders to bicycles is subject to the following conditions: Reynaldo cannot test F. Yuki cannot test J. Theresa must be one of the testers for H. The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
Question: If Theresa tests G on the second day, then which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Reynaldo tests H on the first day.
  B: Reynaldo tests J on the first day.
  C: Theresa tests H on the second day.
  D: Theresa tests J on the first day.
  E: Yuki tests H on the second day.

Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
My mistake was in not considering all possible scenarios. 
I assumed that Theresa would test H on the first day, but that is not necessarily true. 
If Theresa tests G on the second day, then H must be tested by Seamus on the second day. 
Reynaldo cannot test F. 
Yuki cannot test J. 
Therefore, Reynaldo must test J on the first day. 
And, Yuki must test F on the first day. 
This leaves Seamus to test H on the first day, and Theresa to test J on the second day. 
Therefore, Yuki must test H on the second day. 
Answer: E - Yuki tests H on the second day.
