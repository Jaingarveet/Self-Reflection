Context: An administrator must assign parking spaces to six new employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young. Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
Question: If Young is assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Togowa is assigned parking space #1.
  B: Young is assigned parking space #2.
  C: Robertson is assigned parking space #3.
  D: Souza is assigned parking space #3.
  E: Vaughn is assigned parking space #4.

Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that Souza must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. However, the question stem only states that if Young is assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, then which one of the following could be true. Therefore, Souza could be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. 
Error Keywords:
 - Misreading the question stem
 - Incorrect assumption
 - Misinterpretation of the rules
Solution:
Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
If Young is assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, then Souza must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
If Togowa is assigned parking space #1, then Young must be assigned parking space #2, Robertson must be assigned parking space #3, and Xu must be assigned parking space #4. Therefore, A could be true.
Instructions:
1. Read the question stem carefully and understand the problem.
2. Identify the rules that govern the assignment of parking spaces.
3. Identify any constraints or limitations on the assignment of parking spaces.
4. Consider all possible scenarios based on the given rules and constraints.
5. Eliminate any answer choices that violate the rules or constraints.
6. Choose the answer choice that could be true based on the given rules and constraints.
Advice:
 - Always read the question stem carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always identify the rules that govern the problem.
 - Always consider all possible scenarios based on the given rules and constraints.
 - Never make assumptions that are not explicitly stated in the question stem.
 - Always eliminate any answer choices that violate the rules or constraints.
 - Remember that the correct answer is not always the most obvious one.
