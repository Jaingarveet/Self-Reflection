Context: On each of exactly seven consecutive days (day 1 though day 7), a pet shop features exactly one of three breeds of kitten—Himalayan, Manx, Siamese—and exactly one of three breeds of puppy—Greyhound, Newfoundland, Rottweiler. The following conditions must apply: Greyhounds are featured on day 1. No breed is featured on any two consecutive days. Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7. Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1. Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.
Question: If Himalayans are not featured on day 7, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Greyhounds are featured on days 3 and 5.
  B: Newfoundlands are featured on day 3.
  C: Rottweilers are featured on day 6.
  D: Rottweilers are featured only on day 3.
  E: Rottweilers are featured on exactly three days.
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
My reasoning was incorrect. I assumed that Himalayans would be featured on days 2, 4, and 6, but this is not necessarily true. The question only states that Himalayans are not featured on day 1 or day 7. 
Error Keywords:
 - Incorrect assumption
 - Misreading the question
 - Logical error
Solution:
If Himalayans are not featured on day 7, then they must be featured on days 2, 4, and 6.
Greyhounds are featured on day 1, so they cannot be featured on days 2, 3, or 4.
Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, so they can be featured on days 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.
Newfoundlands can be featured on days 2, 4, 5, 6, or 7.
Based on these conditions, the only option that could be true is that Rottweilers are featured only on day 3 (option D).
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and understand the problem.
2. Identify the given conditions and constraints.
3. Make sure you understand the meaning of each condition.
4. Avoid making assumptions that are not explicitly stated in the question.
5. Use logical reasoning to eliminate options that are not possible.
6. Choose the option that satisfies all the given conditions.
7. Double-check your answer to ensure accuracy.
