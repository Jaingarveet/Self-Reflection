## System:
You are an expert in Law.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Topic: Law
Context: At a concert, exactly eight compositions—F, H, L, O, P, R, S, and T—are to be performed exactly once each, consecutively and one composition at a time. The order of their performance must satisfy the following conditions: T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R. At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F. O is performed either first or fifth. The eighth composition performed is either L or H. P is performed at some time before S. At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
Question: Which one of the following lists the compositions in an order in which they could be performed during the concert, from first through eighth?
Choices:
  A: L, P, S, R, O, T, F, H
  B: O, T, P, F, S, H, R, L
  C: P, T, F, S, L, R, O, H
  D: P, T, F, S, O, R, L, H
  E: T, F, P, R, O, L, S, H
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I misread the condition that the eighth composition performed is either L or H. 
I thought that the eighth composition could be either L or H, but it could be either L or H, not both.
Error Keywords:
 - Misreading
 - Misunderstanding
 - Misinterpreting
Solution:
We need to follow the given conditions to determine the order of compositions.
T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.
At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
O is performed either first or fifth.
The eighth composition performed is either L or H.
P is performed at some time before S.
At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
Option A does not satisfy the condition that O is performed either first or fifth.
Option B does not satisfy the condition that the eighth composition performed is either L or H.
Option C does not satisfy the condition that the eighth composition performed is either L or H.
Option D satisfies all the given conditions.
Option E does not satisfy the condition that P is performed at some time before S.
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and understand the problem.
2. Identify the given conditions and constraints.
3. Follow the given conditions and constraints to determine the order of compositions.
4. Double-check your answer to ensure that it satisfies all the given conditions and constraints.
5. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always identify the given conditions and constraints.
 - Always follow the given conditions and constraints to determine the answer.
 - Always double-check your answer to ensure that it satisfies all the given conditions and constraints.
 - Remember that each condition and constraint is important and must be satisfied.
