K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.

  A: O is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf M is placed on.
  B: K is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf G is placed on.
  C: I is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf F is placed on.

Explanation:
I misread the condition "More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf" as "More of the books are placed on the top shelf than the bottom shelf." 
This led me to eliminate option E, which is the correct answer, and choose option A instead. 
Error Keywords:
 - Misreading
 - Misinterpretation
 - Logical error
Solution:
More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
I is placed on the middle shelf.
K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
F is placed on the same shelf as M.
Option A is not necessarily true because O could be on the same shelf as M, which is not the top shelf.
Option B is not necessarily true because G could be on the same shelf as K, which is not the top shelf.
Option C is not necessarily true because F could be on the same shelf as I, which is not the top shelf.
Option D is not necessarily true because O could be on the same shelf as M, which is not the top shelf.
Option E must be true because we know that O is on a higher shelf than L, and F is on the same shelf as M. Therefore, F and L cannot be on the same shelf, and F must be on a higher shelf than L.
