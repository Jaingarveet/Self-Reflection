Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Topic: Law
Context: A panel of five scientists will be formed. The panelists will be selected from among three botanists—F, G, and H—three chemists—K, L, and M—and three zoologists—P, Q, and R. Selection is governed by the following conditions: The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types. If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. F and K cannot both be selected. K and M cannot both be selected. If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
Question: If P is the only zoologist selected, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: If K is selected, G cannot be selected.
  B: If L is selected, F cannot be selected.
  C: If exactly one chemist is selected, it must be K.
  D: If exactly two chemists are selected, F cannot be selected.
  E: If exactly two chemists are selected, G cannot be selected.
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
My mistake was in not considering all possible scenarios. 
I only considered the scenario where P is the only zoologist selected, but I did not consider the other conditions. 
I also misinterpreted the question stem. 
The question asks which statement must be true, not which statement could be true. 
Error Keywords:
 - Incomplete analysis
 - Misinterpretation
 - Insufficient consideration of conditions
Solution:
If P is the only zoologist selected, then either F, G, or H must be selected as a botanist and either K, L, or M must be selected as a chemist. 
If M is selected, then both P and R must be selected. 
If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. 
F and K cannot both be selected. 
K and M cannot both be selected. 
Statement A is not necessarily true because if G is selected, then K can still be selected. 
Statement B is not necessarily true because if H is selected, then L can still be selected. 
Statement C is not necessarily true because if L or M is selected, then K does not have to be selected. 
Statement D must be true because if two chemists are selected, and F is not one of them, then K and L or K and M must be selected. If K and M cannot both be selected, then F cannot be selected. 
Statement E is not necessarily true because if H is selected, then both K and L can still be selected. 
Instructions:
1. Read the question stem carefully and understand what is being asked.
2. Consider all possible scenarios and conditions.
3. Eliminate answer choices that are not necessarily true.
4. Determine which answer choice must be true based on the given conditions.
5. Double-check your reasoning and answer choice before submitting.
Advice:
 - Always read the question stem carefully and understand what is being asked.
 - Consider all possible scenarios and conditions before answering.
 - Eliminate answer choices that are not necessarily true.
 - Determine which answer choice must be true based on the given conditions.
 - Double-check your reasoning and answer choice before submitting.
