Context: During a recital, two pianists—Wayne and Zara—will perform solos. There will be five solos altogether, performed one immediately after another. Each solo will be either a modern piece or a traditional piece. The choice of pianist and type of piece for the solos must conform to the following conditions: The third solo is a traditional piece. Exactly two of the traditional pieces are performed consecutively. In the fourth solo, either Wayne performs a traditional piece or Zara performs a modern piece. The pianist who performs the second solo does not perform the fifth solo. No traditional piece is performed until Wayne performs at least one modem piece.
Question: What is the minimum number of solos in which Wayne performs a traditional piece?
Choices:
  A: zero
  B: one
  C: two
  D: three
  E: four

Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that Wayne must perform a traditional piece in the second or fifth solo. However, the question only asks for the minimum number of solos in which Wayne performs a traditional piece. Since the third solo is a traditional piece, Wayne can perform a modern piece in all five solos, and the minimum number of solos in which Wayne performs a traditional piece is zero.
Error Keywords:
 - Misunderstanding the question
 - Incorrect assumption
 - Misreading the problem
Solution:
The third solo is a traditional piece, and exactly two of the traditional pieces are performed consecutively. No traditional piece is performed until Wayne performs at least one modern piece. Therefore, Wayne can perform a modern piece in all five solos, and the minimum number of solos in which Wayne performs a traditional piece is zero.
