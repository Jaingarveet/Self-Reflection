The following apply: The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock. The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles. The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel. The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.

Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I correctly identified that the bay holding livestock must be in bay 2 or 3, but I did not consider all of the given information. The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce, which means that the bay holding livestock cannot be in bay 2 because that would mean the bay holding textiles would have to be in bay 1 or 3, which is not possible. Therefore, the only possible bay for livestock is bay 5.
Error Keywords:
 - Misinterpretation of information
 - Overlooking information
 - Logical error
Solution:
The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
The bay holding livestock cannot be in bay 2 because the bay holding textiles would have to be in bay 1 or 3, which is not possible.
Therefore, the only possible bay for livestock is bay 5.
