Context: An administrator must assign parking spaces to six new employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young. Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
Question: Which one of the following could be the assignment of parking spaces to the new employees?
Choices:
  A: #1: Young; #2: Souza; #3: Vaughn; #4: Robertson; #5: Togowa; #6: Xu
  B: #1: Vaughn; #2: Togowa; #3: Young; #4: Souza; #5: Robertson; #6: Xu
  C: #1: Togowa; #2: Young; #3: Xu; #4: Robertson; #5: Souza; #6: Vaughn
  D: #1: Togowa; #2: Robertson; #3: Young; #4: Souza; #5: Vaughn; #6: Xu
  E: #1: Souza; #2: Togowa; #3: Young; #4: Robertson; #5: Xu; #6: Vaughn

Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misread the rule that Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4. I thought that Robertson could not be assigned parking space #5 or #6, but I did not realize that Robertson could be assigned parking space #1, #2, or #3. 
Error Keywords:

 - Misinterpretation
 - Oversight
 - Carelessness
Solution:
Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
From the above rules, we can conclude that Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4 and Young must be assigned parking space #3, #4, #5, or #6.
Option A violates the rule that Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
Option B violates the rule that Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
Option C violates the rule that Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
Option D is a possible assignment of parking spaces to the new employees.
Option E violates the rule that Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
Therefore, the correct answer is D.
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and understand the problem.
2. Identify the rules that govern the assignment of parking spaces.
3. Identify the constraints on the assignment of parking spaces.
4. Analyze each option and eliminate the ones that violate the rules or constraints.

Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always identify the rules that govern the problem.
 - Always identify the constraints on the problem.
 - Always analyze each option and eliminate the ones that violate the rules or constraints.
 - Always double-check your reasoning and final answer.
