Context: On the first day of a two-day study for a cycling magazine, four riders—Reynaldo, Seamus, Theresa, and Yuki—will each test one of four bicycles—F, G, H, and J. Each rider will then test a different one of the bicycles on the second day. Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day. The assignment of riders to bicycles is subject to the following conditions: Reynaldo cannot test F. Yuki cannot test J. Theresa must be one of the testers for H. The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
Question: If Theresa tests J on the first day, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Reynaldo tests G on the second day.
  B: Seamus tests H on the first day.
  C: Yuki tests H on the second day.
  D: Seamus is one of the testers for J.
  E: Theresa is one of the testers for G.
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I made an incorrect assumption that Reynaldo and Seamus must test F and G, respectively. 
The correct answer is that Seamus tests H on the first day. 
Error Keywords:
 - Incorrect assumption
 - Misinterpretation of the conditions
 - Logical error
Solution:
If Theresa tests J on the first day, then Yuki cannot test J on the second day. 
Theresa must be one of the testers for H. 
Therefore, Reynaldo and Seamus must test F and G, but it is not clear which one of them tests which bicycle. 
If Seamus tests H on the first day, then Yuki must test G on the first day, and Reynaldo must test F on the first day. 
On the second day, Reynaldo tests G, Seamus tests J, Yuki tests F, and Theresa tests H.
