Topic: Law
Context: A maintenance company that takes service requests from three clients—Image, Solide, and Truvest—plans to set targets for its average service response times. Service targets will be set at 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day. Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail. The six targets are set according to the following conditions: None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
Question: If Image's website target is 2 days, which one of the following targets must also be 2 days?
Choices:
  A: Image's voicemail target
  B: Solide's website target
  C: Solide's voicemail target
  D: Truvest's website target
  E: Truvest's voicemail target

Explanation:
I incorrectly chose option C, Solide's voicemail target, as the target that must also be 2 days. However, the correct answer is option A, Image's voicemail target. This is because the question states that Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. If Image's website target is 2 days, then its voicemail target must be shorter than 2 days. Therefore, Image's voicemail target must also be 2 days to satisfy the conditions.
