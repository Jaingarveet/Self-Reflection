Context: A shopping center has exactly seven spaces—space 1 through space 7—arranged in a straight row. Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
Question: If the shoe store is in space 2, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: The optometrist is in space 5.
  B: The pharmacy is in space 1.
  C: A restaurant is in space 3.
  D: The toy store is in space 6.
  E: The veterinarian is in space 4.

Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
Let's break down the problem step by step, considering the constraints: 
1. The pharmacy must be at one end, and a restaurant must be at the other. This means spaces 1 and 7 must be occupied by the pharmacy and a restaurant. 
2. The shoe store is in space 2. 
3. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. This means that either option would satisfy this constraint: 
   - Option 1: Optometrist in space 3, Pharmacy in space 1. 
   - Option 2: Veterinarian in space 3, Pharmacy in space 1. 
4. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian. 
5. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. This means there are two possible arrangements for the remaining spaces: 
   - Arrangement 1: Spaces 4, 5, and 6 can be occupied by the toy store, veterinarian, and optometrist (or any order that satisfies the other constraints). 
   - Arrangement 2: Space 4 can be the second restaurant, and spaces 5 and 6 can be occupied by the toy store and veterinarian (or vice versa). 
6. Considering all the constraints and arrangements, we can determine that the optometrist can indeed be in space 5, making choice [REDACTED] a valid option.
