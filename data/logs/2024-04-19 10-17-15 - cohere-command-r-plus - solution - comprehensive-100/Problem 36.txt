Context: Editorial: Painting involves a sequential application of layers, each of which adheres satisfactorily only if the underlying layer has been properly applied. Education is, in this respect, like the craft of painting. Since the most important steps in painting are preparation of the surface to be painted and application of the primer coat, it makes sense to suppose that .
Question: Which one of the following most logically completes the editorial's argument?
Choices:
  A: in the educator's initial contact with a student, the educator should be as undemanding as possible
  B: students who have a secure grasp of the fundamentals of a subject are likely to make progress in that subject
  C: educators who are not achieving the goals they intended should revise their teaching methods
  D: teaching new students is rewarding but much more difficult than teaching more advanced students
  E: the success of a student's overall educational experience depends above all upon that student's initial educational experience
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
The editorial draws an analogy between painting and education, emphasizing the sequential nature of both processes. Each layer in painting, like each step in education, builds upon the previous one. The argument suggests that just as the success of a painting depends on the initial preparation, the overall educational experience's success depends primarily on the student's initial educational experience. 

Choice [REDACTED] completes the argument by explicitly making this connection between the initial educational experience and the overall outcome, mirroring the relationship between surface preparation and the final result in painting.
