Topic: Law
Context: There are two kinds of horror stories: those that describe a mad scientist's experiments and those that describe a monstrous beast. In some horror stories about monstrous beasts, the monster symbolizes a psychological disturbance in the protagonist. Horror stories about mad scientists, on the other hand, typically express the author's feeling that scientific knowledge alone is not enough to guide human endeavor. However, despite these differences, both kinds of horror stories share two features: they describe violations of the laws of nature and they are intended to produce dread in the reader.
Question: If the statements above are true, which one of the following would also have to be true?
Choices:
  A: All descriptions of monstrous beasts describe violations of the laws of nature.
  B: Any story that describes a violation of a law of nature is intended to invoke dread in the reader.
  C: Horror stories of any kind usually describe characters who are psychologically disturbed.
  D: Most stories about mad scientists express the author's antiscientific views.
  E: Some stories that employ symbolism describe violations of the laws of nature.
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
The provided statements describe two types of horror stories: those featuring mad scientists and those featuring monstrous beasts. Both types share two common features: they violate the laws of nature and evoke dread in readers.

Option [REDACTED] states: "[REDACTED]"
This option is the correct answer because it is the only one that captures the partial truth reflected in the statements. While not all horror stories employ symbolism, the statements indicate that some stories within these two subtypes do violate the laws of nature.

The other options make broader generalizations that are not supported by the provided information. They either refer to "all" stories or make assertions about the intentions or content of all stories within a specific type, which goes beyond the scope of the given statements.
