Question: At its maximum speed, a space shuttle can travel 700m high in 40 seconds. It will also take 5 seconds to pass a point. What then is the length of the space shuttle?
Choices:
  A: 50 m
  B: 75 m
  C: 100 m
  D: 125 m
  E: 150 m
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
The shuttle's speed = distance/time = 700m/40s = 17.5 m/s. This is its vertical speed. 

However, to find the length of the shuttle, we need to use a different calculation. The shuttle takes 5 seconds to pass a point, so we can find its length by using this formula: 
Length = distance/time = 700m/5s = 140m 

The length of the shuttle is 140 meters, which matches choice [REDACTED].
## Assistant 2:
Thought: The shuttle's speed = distance/time = 700m/40s = 17.5 m/s. This vertical speed calculation is correct. 

To find the length, we use the shuttle's time to pass a point: Length = distance/time = 700m/5s = 140m. 

So, the length of the shuttle is 140 meters, and the correct answer is [REDACTED].
