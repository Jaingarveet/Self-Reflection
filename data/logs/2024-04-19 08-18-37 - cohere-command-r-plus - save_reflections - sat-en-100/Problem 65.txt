## Get Reflection:
Explanation: I misinterpreted the paragraph's focus on Mr. Peters' attempts to conceal his aging as a sign of his consciousness of wealth and power symbols. I overlooked the subtle hints indicating that he was behaving like a younger man and trying to maintain a youthful image.

Error Keywords:
- Interpretation error
- Misunderstanding
- Overlooking contextual clues

Solution: The last paragraph describes Mr. Peters' awareness of his physical aging and his attempts to maintain a youthful image. It mentions his graying hair, weight loss, and attempts to use symbols of wealth and status, such as a diamond ring and manicured hands, to distract from his aging. However, the correct interpretation is that he behaves as if he were a younger version of himself, as indicated by the phrase "making him do things that were not becoming in a man of forty-five."

Instructions:
1. Read the paragraph carefully and identify the main subject: Mr. Peters.
2. Note the description of his physical decay and attempts to conceal it with symbols of wealth.
3. Recognize the presence of the young man, who represents Mr. Peters' idealized youthful self.
4. Understand that Mr. Peters' behavior is influenced by this idealized self, leading him to act younger than his age.
5. Choose the answer option that reflects this interpretation.

Advice:
- Read the paragraph thoroughly and pay attention to descriptive details and contextual clues.
- Consider the broader context of the passage and how it relates to the main character's behavior.
- Look for subtle hints and underlying themes that may not be explicitly stated.
- Avoid focusing solely on surface-level details and try to interpret the deeper meaning conveyed by the author.
- Always consider all answer options carefully before making a selection.
