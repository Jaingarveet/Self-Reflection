## Get Reflection:
Explanation: I misinterpreted the question and the text. I focused on the shift from the physical setting to character descriptions, ignoring the aspect of whose thoughts and perspective were being presented. The correct answer is "D," as the primary focus shifts from Lymie's experience of reading a book to descriptions of other people in the restaurant, as observed by Lymie and the narrator.

Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation
- Omission
- Perspective shift

Solution: The passage initially introduces the restaurant and its decor, including artwork and ferns. It then shifts to Lymie, describing his actions, thoughts, and reading material. The focus then expands to include other patrons, such as Irma, the waitress, and a party of four. The description of Mr. Peters, Lymie's father, is also from the narrator's perspective, noting his physical changes and actions. Thus, the primary focus shifts from Lymie's experience with his book to descriptions of other people in the restaurant, observed by Lymie and the narrator. 

Instructions:
1. Identify the initial focus of the passage.
2. Note the shift in focus as the passage progresses.
3. Consider whose thoughts and observations are being presented.
4. Determine if the shift is between physical setting and character traits or between a character's inner thoughts and external observations.
5. Answer the question based on a comprehensive understanding of the passage. 

Advice:
- Read the question carefully and identify the specific aspect being asked (inner thoughts, observations, setting, character traits). 
- Pay close attention to whose perspective is being presented in the text (narrator, specific character, or both). 
- Understand that shifts in focus can occur between different elements, such as setting and character traits, or between a character's inner thoughts and external observations. 
- Be mindful of the scope of the question; it may not encompass the entire passage but rather specific sections or shifts within it.
