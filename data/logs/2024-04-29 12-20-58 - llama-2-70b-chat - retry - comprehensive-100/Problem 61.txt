## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Assistant 2:
  The given equation is:

$$(a x+2)(b x+7)=15 x^{2}+c x+14$$

We know that $a+b=8$, so we can write:

$$(a x+2)(b x+7)=15 x^{2}+c x+14$$

Expanding the left-hand side, we get:

$$(a x+2)(b x+7)=ab x^{2}+(a+b)x+7x+14$$

Since $a+b=8$, we can simplify the expression as:

$$(a x+2)(b x+7)=ab x^{2}+8x+7x+14$$

Comparing with the right-hand side, we see that $c=7$.

Therefore, the two possible values for $c$ are:

$$c=7$$

So, the correct answer is:

$$\boxed{B: 6 and 35}$$
