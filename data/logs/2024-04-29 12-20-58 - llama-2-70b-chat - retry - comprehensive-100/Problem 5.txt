## Assistant 2:
  My apologies, I don't have any reflection information to provide for this question. However, I can try to solve the problem using the given information:
The youngest member is 7 years old, and the common difference between the ages is 3 months.
Let the number of members be x.
The sum of their ages is 250.
The first member's age is 7 + (x-1) \* 3 = 7 + 3(x-1)
The last member's age is 7 + 3(x-1) + 3 = 7 + 3x
The sum of their ages is:
7 + 3(x-1) + 7 + 3x = 250

Combine like terms:
4 + 3x + 3(x-1) = 250

Simplify:
3x + 3x - 3 = 250

6x - 3 = 250

Add 3 to both sides:
6x = 253

Divide by 6:
x = 42

Therefore, the number of members in the club is 42.
Action: Answer("B")

Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: C
