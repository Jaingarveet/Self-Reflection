## Assistant 2:
  My apologies, I don't have any information to provide for reflection on this question. However, I can provide a solution to the problem.

Let's analyze the given information:

* The length of the road from Town F to Town G on the map is 20 inches.
* 1/4 inch on the map represents an actual distance of 10 miles.

Now, let's create a proportion to solve for the actual distance:

Map distance : Actual distance
20 inches : x miles

We know that 1/4 inch on the map represents 10 miles, so we can set up the following equation:

1/4 inch = 10 miles

Now, we can cross-multiply and simplify:

20 inches = 10 miles x (1/4 inch)
20 inches = 10 miles x 0.25
20 inches = 2.5 miles

Therefore, the actual distance from Town F to Town G along this road is 2.5 miles.

Action: Answer("B")
