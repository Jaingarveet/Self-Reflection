Explanation:
I calculated the reduction percent incorrectly. 
The formula for reduction percent is (reduction amount / original amount) x 100.
I calculated the reduction percent as (reduction amount / reduced amount) x 100.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The reduction amount is 120 - 96 = 24.
The original amount is 120.
Using the formula for reduction percent, the answer is (24 / 120) x 100 = 20%.
