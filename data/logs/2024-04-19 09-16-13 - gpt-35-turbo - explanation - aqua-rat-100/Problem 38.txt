You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I made a calculation error when finding the number of smaller cubes that make up the outer surface. 
I used the formula for the volume of the outer surface instead of the formula for the surface area of the outer surface.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The outer surface of the cube is made up of 3 layers of 25 smaller cubes each, for a total of 75 smaller cubes.
The inner surface of the hollow part of the cube is made up of 3 layers of 3x3 smaller cubes each, for a total of 27 smaller cubes.
So, the total number of smaller cubes that remain unpainted is 125 - 75 - 27 = 23.
Action: Answer("None of the Above") [The correct answer is not one of the given choices. The correct answer is 23.]
