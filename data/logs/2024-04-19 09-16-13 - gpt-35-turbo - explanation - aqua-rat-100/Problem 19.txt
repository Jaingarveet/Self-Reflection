## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I made an error in equating the two equations. 
The equation for the forward journey is correct, but the equation for the return journey is incorrect. 
The correct equation for the return journey is [REDACTED] = (S+12) x 4, not [REDACTED] = (S-12) x 4.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let's use the formula: distance = speed x time.
Let S be the speed of the jeep.
Let D be the distance travelled by the jeep.
From the problem, we know that:
D = S x 6 (forward journey)
D = (S+12) x 4 (return journey)
We can solve for S by equating the two equations:
S x 6 = (S+12) x 4
6S = 4S + 48
2S = 48
S = 24
Substituting S = 24 into one of the equations, we can solve for D:
D = S x 6
D = 24 x 6
D = 144
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
