Explanation:
I incorrectly calculated the diagonal of the rectangular solid. 
The gap in my knowledge was in visualizing the rectangular solid and its diagonal. 
I used the wrong formula to calculate the diagonal of the rectangular solid.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The diameter of the sphere is equal to the diagonal of the rectangular solid.
The diagonal of the rectangular solid can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem.
The diagonal of the rectangular solid is √(3² + 4² + 15²) = √250.
The diameter of the sphere is equal to the square root of two times the diagonal of the rectangular solid.
The diameter of the sphere is 2√250 = 10√10.
Action: Answer("E")
