Explanation:
I made an error in the order of operations. I should have multiplied first before adding or subtracting.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Using the order of operations, we need to solve the expression inside the brackets first. 
[5 + ? × 19 - 15 - 7] = [? × 19 - 17]
Then, we can substitute this expression into the original equation and simplify.
[? × 19 - 17] / [13 × 13 - 156] = 6
[? × 19 - 17] / 119 = 6
[? × 19 - 17] = 714
[? × 19] = 731
? = 731/19
? ≈ 38.47
Action: Answer("E")
## Result:
Agent Answer: E
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
