Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
The yearly profit should be at least $626,400, which is the sum of the production cost and the desired profit.
The production cost is 420 x $110 x 12 = $554,400.
The desired profit is $626,400 - $554,400 = $72,000.
The revenue from selling 5040 units at the minimum selling price per component is 5040 x P, where P is the minimum selling price per component.
We need to find P such that 5040P >= $1,180,800, which is the sum of the production cost and the desired profit.
P >= $1,180,800 / 5040 = $234.
Therefore, the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee that the yearly profit will be at least $626,400 is $234.
The closest answer choice is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED], which is not the exact answer but is the closest to the correct answer.
