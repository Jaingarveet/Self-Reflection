Explanation:
I made a mistake in calculating the total journey duration. I added the time taken to cover the first quarter of the distance and the time taken to cover the remaining distance, but I forgot to add the time taken during the rain.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The total distance is 100 x 10 = 1000 miles.
The distance covered before the rain is 1000/4 = 250 miles.
The time taken to cover the first 250 miles is 250/100 = 2.5 hours.
The remaining distance is 1000 - 250 = 750 miles.
The time taken to cover the remaining 750 miles at 75 miles/hour is 750/75 = 10 hours.
The time taken during the rain is 10 - 2.5 = 7.5 hours.
The total journey duration is 2.5 + 10 + 7.5 = 20 hours.
Action: Answer("None of the Above") [The correct answer is not listed. The correct answer is 20 hours.]
