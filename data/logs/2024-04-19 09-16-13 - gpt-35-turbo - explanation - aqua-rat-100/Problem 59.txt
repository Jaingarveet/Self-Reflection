Question: 20 marbles were pulled out of a bag of only white marbles, painted black, and then put back in. Then, another 20 marbles were pulled out, of which 1 was black, after which they were all returned to the bag. If the percentage of black marbles pulled out the second time represents their percentage in the bag, how many marbles in total Q does the bag currently hold?

Explanation:
I made a calculation error while calculating the total number of marbles in the bag.
I correctly calculated the percentage of black marbles in the bag but made an error in calculating the total number of marbles.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
If 1 black marble represents [x]% of the bag, then there are 100/x black marbles in the bag.
Let's assume there are [y] white marbles in the bag.
After the first 20 marbles were pulled out, there were [y+20] marbles in the bag, all of which were painted black.
So, the number of black marbles in the bag became [100/(100+x)] * (y+20).
After the second 20 marbles were pulled out, there were [y+40] marbles in the bag, of which 1 was black.
So, the number of black marbles in the bag became [100/(y+40)].
Equating the two expressions for the number of black marbles in the bag, we get:
[100/(100+x)] * (y+20) = [100/(y+40)]
Solving for y, we get:
y = 380
The total number of marbles in the bag is [y+20] = 400.
Action: Answer("D")
