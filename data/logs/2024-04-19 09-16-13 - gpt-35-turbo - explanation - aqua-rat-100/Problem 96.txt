Explanation:
My calculation was incorrect. 
I did not use the correct ratio of investments to calculate the share of profit for each person.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let's first calculate the ratio of investments of A, B, and C.
A invested for 12 months, B invested for 10 months, and C invested for x months.
So, the ratio of their investments will be (40,000 x 12) : (60,000 x 10) : (120,000 x x) = 4:6:3x
Let's assume the total profit is divided into 13 parts (4+6+3x).
So, C's share will be 3x/13 of the total profit.
We know that C's share is Rs.150,000.
So, 3x/13 = 150,000
Solving for x, we get x = 65/3 months.
C joined after B, so the time difference between their joining will be (65/3 - 2) months.
Action: Answer("B")
