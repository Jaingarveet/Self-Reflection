Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I made an error in my calculation when I substituted t1 and t2 into the third equation. 
I also made an error in my understanding of the problem. 
I assumed that Kevin had driven the same distance from [REDACTED] to [REDACTED] as he had from [REDACTED] to [REDACTED], which is not necessarily true.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let's call the distance between A and B "d". 
We know that Kevin drove from A to B at a constant speed of 70 mph, and then from B to A at a constant speed of 90 mph. 
Let's call the time it took Kevin to drive from A to B "t1", and the time it took him to drive from B to A "t2". 
We also know that exactly 3 hours before the end of his trip, he was still approaching B, only 70 miles away from it. 
This means that at time (t1 + t2 - 3), Kevin was 70 miles away from B. 
Using the formula distance = rate x time, we can set up two equations: d = 70t1 and d = 90t2. 
We can also set up a third equation using the fact that at time (t1 + t2 - 3), Kevin was 70 miles away from B: 
d - 70 = 90(t1 + t2 - 3). 
Now we have three equations and three unknowns (d, t1, and t2), which we can solve for. 
Simplifying the third equation, we get d - 70 = 90t1 + 90t2 - 270. 
Substituting d = 70t1 and d = 90t2 into this equation, we get: 
70t1 - 70 = 90t1 + 90t2 - 270. 
Simplifying this equation, we get: 
20t1 - 90t2 = 200. 
We also know that t1 + t2 = (total time of trip) - 3. 
Let's call the total time of the trip "T". 
We know that distance = rate x time, so we can set up another equation: 
d = 70t1 + 90t2. 
Substituting d = 70t1 and d = 90t2 into this equation, we get: 
d = 70t1 + 90t2 = 70t1 + 70t2 + 20t2 = 70(t1 + t2) + 20t2 = 70(T - 3) + 20t2. 
Now we have four equations and four unknowns (d, t1, t2, and T), which we can solve for. 
Simplifying the last equation, we get: 
d = 70(T - 3) + 20t2 = 70T - 210 + 20t2. 
Substituting this into the second equation (d = 90t2), we get: 
90t2 = 70T - 210 + 20t2. 
Simplifying this equation, we get: 
70t2 = 70T - 210. 
Substituting this into the first equation (20t1 - 90t2 = 200), we get: 
20t1 - (70T - 210) = 200. 
Simplifying this equation, we get: 
20t1 - 70T + 210 = 200. 
Subtracting 210 from both sides, we get: 
20t1 - 70T = -10. 
Dividing both sides by 10, we get: 
2t1 - 7T = -1. 
We also know that t1 + t2 = T - 3, so we can substitute t2 = T - 3 - t1 into the equation 90t2 = 70T - 210 to get: 
90(T - 3 - t1) = 70T - 210. 
Simplifying this equation, we get: 
90T - 270 - 90t1 = 70T - 210. 
Subtracting 70T from both sides, we get: 
20T - 270 - 90t1 = -210. 
Adding 270 to both sides, we get: 
20T - 90t1 = 60. 
Multiplying both sides by 2, we get: 
40T - 180t1 = 120. 
Now we have two equations and two unknowns (2t1 - 7T = -1 and 40T - 180t1 = 120), which we can solve for. 
Multiplying the first equation by 20, we get: 
40t1 - 140T = -20. 
Adding this to the second equation (40T - 180t1 = 120), we get: 
-40t1 = 100. 
Dividing both sides by -40, we get: 
t1 = -2.5. 
Substituting this into the equation 2t1 - 7T = -1, we get: 
2(-2.5) - 7T = -1. 
Simplifying this equation, we get: 
-5 - 7T = -1. 
Adding 5 to both sides, we get: 
-7T = 4. 
Dividing both sides by -7, we get: 
T = -4/7. 
This is a negative value, which doesn't make sense in the context of the problem. 
Therefore, there must be no solution to this problem.
