## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:
Topic: Geography
Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: Points A, B, C, D lie in this order on the circumference of a circle. Minor arc AC is 160°, and minor arc BD is 150°. If B bisects minor arc AC, then what is the measure of minor arc AD?
Choices:
  A: 80°
  B: 130°
  C: 140°
  D: 160°
  E: 220°
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I made an error in my understanding of the problem. 
I incorrectly assumed that the measure of minor arc A[REDACTED] is equal to the measure of minor arc B[REDACTED]. 
The correct assumption is that the measure of minor arc A[REDACTED] is half the measure of minor arc A[REDACTED].
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The measure of minor arc AC is 160°, so the measure of minor arc AB is 80°.
Since B bisects minor arc AC, the measure of minor arc BC is also 80°.
The measure of minor arc BD is 150°, so the measure of minor arc CD is 30°.
Since the sum of the measures of minor arcs AD and CD is equal to the measure of minor arc AC, we have:
measure of minor arc AD + 30° = 160°
measure of minor arc AD = 130°
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
