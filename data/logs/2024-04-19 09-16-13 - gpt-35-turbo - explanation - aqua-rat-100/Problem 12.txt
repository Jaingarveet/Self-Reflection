Explanation:
I correctly solved for x, but I made an error in calculating 50% of x. 
I multiplied x by 50% instead of dividing it by 2.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let's solve for x first.
x - 30 = x/3
Multiplying both sides by 3 gives:
3x - 90 = x
2x = 90
x = 45
Now, let's solve for 50% of x.
50% of x = (50/100) * x = x/2
Substituting x = 45, we get:
50% of 45 = 45/2 = 22.5
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
