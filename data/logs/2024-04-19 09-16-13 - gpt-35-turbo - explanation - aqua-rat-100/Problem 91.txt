## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that the distance travelled towards south and north would cancel each other out, and the distance travelled towards east and west would cancel each other out. However, this is not true because the distances travelled towards south and north are not equal, and the distances travelled towards east and west are not equal.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
To find the distance from home, we need to find the net displacement of A.
The net displacement can be found by finding the horizontal and vertical components of the displacement and then using the Pythagorean theorem.
The horizontal component is the displacement towards east minus the displacement towards west, which is 5 km - 2 km = 3 km towards east.
The vertical component is the displacement towards north minus the displacement towards south, which is 3 km - 0 km = 3 km towards north.
Using the Pythagorean theorem, the net displacement is sqrt((3 km)^2 + (3 km)^2) = sqrt(18) km.
Action: Answer("E")
## Result:
Agent Answer: E
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
