Explanation:
I made a calculation error. I calculated the percentage of chocolates that are not squashed instead of the percentage of chocolates that are both vanilla flavored and not squashed.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let's assume there are 100 chocolates in the store.
10% of the chocolates are cocoa flavored, which means 90 chocolates are vanilla flavored.
90% of the vanilla chocolates are squashed, which means 9 chocolates are both vanilla flavored and not squashed.
Therefore, the percentage of chocolates that are both vanilla flavored and not squashed is 9/100 = 9%.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
