## Get Reflection:
Explanation: 
I misinterpreted the analogy and focused on the idea that each step builds upon the last, rather than emphasizing the importance of the initial step. I failed to make the connection between the initial educational experience and the overall outcome. 

Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation
- Analogy error
- Emphasis on process over initial step

Solution: 
The editorial draws an analogy between painting and education, emphasizing the sequential nature of both processes. Each layer in painting, like each step in education, builds upon the previous one. The argument suggests that just as the success of a painting depends on the initial preparation, the overall educational experience's success depends primarily on the student's initial educational experience. 

Choice E completes the argument by explicitly making this connection between the initial educational experience and the overall outcome, mirroring the relationship between surface preparation and the final result in painting. 

Instructions: 
1. Understand the analogy drawn between painting and education. 
2. Identify the key relationship: sequential steps building upon each other. 
3. Recognize that the argument emphasizes the initial steps in both processes. 
4. Choose the answer option that reflects the impact of the initial educational experience on the overall outcome. 
5. Avoid choices that focus solely on the process without connecting it to the outcome. 

Advice: 
- Understand analogies by identifying the underlying relationships and parallels. 
- Look for keywords and phrases that indicate emphasis, such as "since," "most important," and "above all." 
- Ensure that your interpretation of the analogy aligns with the specific relationship being drawn. 
- Avoid making assumptions or drawing conclusions that go beyond the scope of the analogy. 
- Always choose the answer option that best completes the argument's logical progression.
