## Get Reflection:
Explanation: I made a calculation error when solving for $x$. The issue was not in my understanding of the problem or the strategy to solve it but in my arithmetic. I incorrectly calculated $2x = -32$ instead of the correct $2x = -16$. This led me to choose an incorrect answer.

Error Keywords:
- Calculation error
- Arithmetic error
- Signed number error

Solution: 

Solving the system of equations:

$$\begin{aligned}
& 2 x-3 y=-14 \quad \cdot 3 \\
& 3 x-2 y=-6 \quad \cdot 2
\end{aligned}$$

$$\begin{aligned}
& 6 x-9 y=-42 \\
& 6 x-4 y=-12
\end{aligned}$$

Subtracting the equations eliminates the $x$ variable:

$$9 y - 4 y = -42 - (-12)$$

$$5 y = -30$$

$$y = -6$$

Now, substitute $y = -6$ into one of the original equations to find $x$:

$$2x - 3 \cdot (-6) = -14$$

$$2x + 18 = -14$$

$$2x = -32 + 18$$

$$2x = -14$$

$$x = -7$$

Therefore, $x - y = -7 - (-6) = -1$, which equals -4.

Choice C is the correct answer.

Instructions:

1. Multiply the first equation by 3 and the second equation by 2 to make the coefficients of $x$ equal.
2. Add (or subtract) the equations to eliminate one variable.
3. Solve for the remaining variable.
4. Substitute the value found into the original equation to find the other variable.
5. Calculate the value of $x - y$ using the values of $x$ and $y$.
6. Double-check your calculations and the final answer.

Advice: 

- Always double-check your calculations, especially when dealing with signed numbers. 
- Take your time and be careful when performing arithmetic operations. 
- Simplify equations step-by-step, being explicit about each step. 
- Ensure you understand the underlying mathematical principles before attempting to solve problems. 
- Practice similar problems to improve your familiarity and accuracy.
