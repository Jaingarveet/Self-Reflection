## Get Reflection:
Explanation: 
I focused too narrowly on the commute times and overlooked the financial aspect implied in the statement. 
I missed the critical keyword "afford" and its connection to the employees' ability to maintain their current commute times. 
Error Keywords:
- Overlooked financial context
- Missed critical keyword
- Narrow focus

Solution: 
The argument assumes that Acme employees will not receive a significant pay raise accompanying the move, which would enable them to afford housing closer to Ocean View and maintain a shorter commute. 
If employees received a substantial pay raise, the argument's premise about their commute times would be invalid. 

Instructions: 
1. Identify the key premise of the argument: most employees will have longer commutes after the move. 
2. Recognize the condition required for this premise to hold true: employees' financial situation must remain largely unchanged. 
3. Understand that the absence of a significant pay raise ensures employees cannot afford housing for shorter commutes. 
4. Choose the answer option that reflects this absence of a pay raise. 

Advice: 
 - Consider the broader context and implications of the statement. 
 - Pay attention to critical keywords that indicate necessary assumptions or conditions. 
 - Ensure you understand the logical connections between premises and conclusions. 
 - Think about potential counterarguments or alternative explanations. 
 - Practice identifying underlying financial, social, or legal implications in arguments.
