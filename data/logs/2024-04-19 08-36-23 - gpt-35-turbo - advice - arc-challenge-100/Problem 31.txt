## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The Sun is a star that has been around for about 4.6 billion years.
It is currently in the main sequence phase of its life cycle, which means it is burning hydrogen into helium in its core.
It is estimated that the Sun has about 5 billion years left before it exhausts its hydrogen fuel and evolves into a red giant.
Option A is incorrect because the Sun does not have an infinite energy supply.
Option B is incorrect because the Sun is not near the end of its life cycle.
Option C is incorrect because the Sun is not in its infancy in terms of energy consumption.
Option D is incorrect because the Sun has not consumed approximately one-half of its expendable energy.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
