## System:
You are an expert in Science.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")

## User 2:
Topic: Science
Question: A pharmaceutical company develops a new antibiotic to treat pneumonia. After limited testing, the researchers conclude that the antibiotic seems to be effective. How can the researchers strengthen their conclusions?
Choices:
  A: Test the antibiotic on human volunteers.
  B: Publish their results in a medical journal.
  C: Ask an independent lab to retest the antibiotic.
  D: Test the effectiveness of the antibiotic at killing other bacteria.

## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The researchers need to strengthen their conclusions about the effectiveness of the new antibiotic.
Option A, testing the antibiotic on human volunteers, would provide more data but could be unethical without further testing.
Option B, publishing their results in a medical journal, would share their findings but not necessarily strengthen their conclusions.
Option C, asking an independent lab to retest the antibiotic, would provide additional data and help confirm the initial findings.
Option D, testing the effectiveness of the antibiotic at killing other bacteria, would not necessarily strengthen their conclusions about its effectiveness against pneumonia.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
