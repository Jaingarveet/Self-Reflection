## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
An unstable lie in pregnancy refers to the position of the fetus in the uterus, which can change frequently. This condition is often due to factors that prevent the fetus from becoming engaged, such as a large amount of amniotic fluid (oligohydramnios), abnormalities of the uterus (uterine anomalies), or a pelvic tumor. Placenta previa could also cause an unstable lie, but it is less likely than the other options. 
Action: Answer("A")

Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: B
