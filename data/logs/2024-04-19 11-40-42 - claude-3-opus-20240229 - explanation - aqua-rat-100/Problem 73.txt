## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Explanation:
I made an error in my reasoning. I correctly identified that the total number of students must be a multiple of 25 for both the percentage of physics students and math students to be whole numbers. However, I failed to consider the additional constraint that the sum of the percentages of physics and math students should not exceed 100%. If 48% of the students took either physics or math, then the remaining 52% must have taken neither, which is not possible if every student must take at least one of these subjects.
