Context: Editorial: Painting involves a sequential application of layers, each of which adheres satisfactorily only if the underlying layer has been properly applied. Education is, in this respect, like the craft of painting. Since the most important steps in painting are preparation of the surface to be painted and application of the primer coat, it makes sense to suppose that .
Question: Which one of the following most logically completes the editorial's argument?
Choices:
  A: in the educator's initial contact with a student, the educator should be as undemanding as possible
  B: students who have a secure grasp of the fundamentals of a subject are likely to make progress in that subject
  C: educators who are not achieving the goals they intended should revise their teaching methods
  D: teaching new students is rewarding but much more difficult than teaching more advanced students
  E: the success of a student's overall educational experience depends above all upon that student's initial educational experience

Explanation:
I misinterpreted the analogy and focused on the idea that each step builds upon the last, rather than emphasizing the importance of the initial step. I failed to make the connection between the initial educational experience and the overall outcome.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The editorial draws an analogy between painting and education, emphasizing the importance of proper preparation and foundational layers in both processes. The argument suggests that just as a successful painting depends on the initial steps of surface preparation and primer application, a student's educational success may hinge on their earliest educational experiences. 

Therefore, the correct answer is E: "the success of a student's overall educational experience depends above all upon that student's initial educational experience." This conclusion aligns with the editorial's emphasis on the priming and preparatory stages as determinants of ultimate success.
Action: Answer("E")
## Result:
Agent Answer: E
Correct Answer: E
