Explanation:
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The correct answer must follow logically from the information provided.

Statement A is not guaranteed to be true, as it refers to Canadian films shown at international festivals, whereas the question only states that the films shown at Lac Nichoutec were also shown internationally. There could be other Canadian films at the international festivals that did not show at Lac Nichoutec.

Statement B is not guaranteed to be true. It refers to all Canadian films produced this year, but the question only discusses films that won prizes, not all films produced.

Statement C is the correct answer. If most of the films that won prizes at Lac Nichoutec also won prizes internationally, then those films must include Canadian films, as Lac Nichoutec only shows Canadian films.

Statement D is not guaranteed to be true. It is possible that every film that won a prize at Lac Nichoutec also played at an international festival, as the question states that "most" films, not all, won prizes at both types of festivals. There could be films that won at Lac Nichoutec and also played internationally without winning there.

Statement E is not guaranteed to be true. It is possible that all films that won prizes at international festivals were shown at Lac Nichoutec, satisfying the condition that "most" films that won at Lac Nichoutec also won internationally.

Therefore, the correct answer is C.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: D
