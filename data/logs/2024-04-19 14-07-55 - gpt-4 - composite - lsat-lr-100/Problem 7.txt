## User 2:
Topic: Law
Context: Radio producer: Our failure to attract new listeners over the past several years has forced us to choose between devoting some airtime to other, more popular genres of music, and sticking with classical music that appeals only to our small but loyal audience. This audience, however loyal, did not generate enough advertising revenue for us to pay our bills, so if we appeal to them alone, our station risks going out of business. We should not take that risk. We should, therefore, devote some airtime to other, more popular genres of music.
Question: Which one of the following arguments is most similar in its pattern of reasoning to that used by the radio producer?
Choices:
  A: We should either buy blinds for the windows or make full-length curtains. Blinds would be very expensive to purchase. Thus, if cost is our greatest concern, we should make curtains.
  B: We should either make curtains for the windows or buy blinds. Since the windows are not standard sizes, if we buy blinds we will have to special order them. Since we do not have time to wait for special orders, we should make the curtains.
  C: For the living room windows, we can make curtains or valances or both. We want to have privacy; and while curtains provide privacy, valances do not. So we should make curtains but not valances.
  D: Since we have very little fabric, we will have to either buy more, or make valances instead of curtains. However, if we use this fabric to make valances, then we will have to buy blinds. Since it would be hard to buy fabric that matches what we already have, we should buy blinds.
  E: We should either buy blinds or make curtains for the windows. If we buy blinds but do not make valances, the windows will look bare. We should not have bare windows. So if we do not make the curtains, we should make the valances.
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I focused on the risk aspect of the argument but overlooked the necessity aspect. The radio producer's argument is based on a necessity (paying bills) that forces a choice between two options. The correct answer should reflect this pattern of reasoning.
Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation
- Pattern of reasoning
- Necessity-based argument
Solution:
The radio producer's argument is based on a necessity (paying bills) that forces a choice between two options, where one option (sticking with classical music) does not meet the necessity. Therefore, the producer concludes that the other option (devoting some airtime to other, more popular genres of music) should be chosen. 
Looking at the choices, option [REDACTED] presents a similar pattern of reasoning. It presents a necessity (non-standard window sizes) that forces a choice between two options (making curtains or buying blinds), where one option (buying blinds) does not meet the necessity. Therefore, the conclusion is that the other option (making curtains) should be chosen.
Instructions:
1. Understand the pattern of reasoning in the given argument.
2. Identify the necessity that forces a choice between two options.
3. Identify the option that does not meet the necessity.
4. Look for a similar pattern of reasoning in the answer choices.
5. Identify the choice that presents a similar necessity forcing a choice between two options.
6. Identify the option in the choice that does not meet the necessity.
7. Choose the answer that matches this pattern of reasoning.
Advice:
- Always understand the pattern of reasoning in the given argument.
- Look for the necessity that forces a choice between two options.
- Identify the option that does not meet the necessity.
- Look for a similar pattern of reasoning in the answer choices.
- Be careful not to overlook key aspects of the argument's reasoning.
