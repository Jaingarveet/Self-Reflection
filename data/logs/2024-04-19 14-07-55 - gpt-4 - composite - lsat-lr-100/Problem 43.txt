Context: Ethicist: Marital vows often contain the promise to love "until death do us part." If "love" here refers to a feeling, then this promise makes no sense, for feelings are not within one's control, and a promise to do something not within one's control makes no sense. Thus, no one—including those making marital vows—should take "love" in this context to be referring to feelings.
Question: The ethicist's conclusion follows logically if which one of the following is assumed?
Choices:
  A: None of our feelings are within our control.
  B: People should not make promises to do something that is not within their control.
  C: "Love" can legitimately be taken to refer to something other than feelings.
  D: Promises should not be interpreted in such a way that they make no sense.
  E: Promises that cannot be kept do not make any sense.

Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I focused on the part of the argument that discussed the control over feelings and promises, rather than the interpretation of promises. The correct assumption is that promises should not be interpreted in a way that makes no sense, which is the basis of the ethicist's argument.
Error Keywords:
- Interpretation error
- Logical reasoning error
- Assumption error
Solution:
The ethicist's argument is based on the interpretation of the promise in marital vows. The argument states that if "love" refers to a feeling, then the promise makes no sense because feelings are not within one's control. Therefore, the assumption that makes this argument logically sound is that promises should not be interpreted in a way that makes no sense. Hence, the correct answer is [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Understand the argument made by the ethicist.
2. Identify the key points in the argument.
3. Understand what the question is asking - in this case, it's asking for the assumption that makes the argument logically sound.
4. Evaluate each answer choice in relation to the argument.
5. Choose the answer that best fits as the assumption that would make the argument logically sound.
Advice:
- Always read the question carefully and understand what it's asking.
- Break down the argument into its key points.
- Understand the logical flow of the argument.
- Evaluate each answer choice in relation to the argument, not just in isolation.
- Be aware of the difference between an assumption and a conclusion in an argument.
