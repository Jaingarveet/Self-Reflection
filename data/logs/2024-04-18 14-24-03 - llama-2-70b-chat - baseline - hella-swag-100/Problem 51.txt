## Assistant 2:
  Thought: 
Hurling is a sport that involves a ball and a stick called a hurley.
The description in the question suggests that the boys are practicing a drill or exercise, possibly in preparation for a game.
It's unlikely that they would stop to play rock paper scissors or walk back to where they began after completing the drill.
It's also unlikely that they would form a huddle and start talking without any context or reason.
The most likely completion to the text is that they continue playing the sport, possibly starting a new drill or continuing the game.
