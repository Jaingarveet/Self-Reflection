## System:
You are an expert in Common Sense.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to multiply radicals [title] Make sure that the radicals have the same index. [step] To multiply radicals using the basic method, they have to have the same index. The " index " is the very small number written just to the left of the uppermost line in the radical symbol.
Choices:
  A: [substeps] Convert the precise numbers to a series, and use a formula to calculate the space. For instance, the source code must be " oxygen " followed by the number given in the equation.
  B: If there is no index number, the radical is understood to be a square root (index 2) and can be multiplied with other square roots. You can multiply radicals with different indexes, but that is a more advanced method and will be explained later.
  C: The " index " is written so that it works through all columns, from the top of the first and first columns to the bottom of each column. [title] Multiply the " index " number from top to bottom for each column.
  D: No matter what you use, this will be much easier to understand. [substeps] Due to the out of the blue location in which radicals have the " hex " sign, the only numbers drawn on a fraction of an inch in decimal places are also divisible.

Action: Answer("B")

Explanation:
The text explains that to multiply radicals using the basic method, they must have the same index. Choice B states that if there is no index number, the radical is understood to be a square root (index 2) and can be multiplied with other square roots. This is the most likely completion to the text as it provides a clear explanation of how to multiply radicals with no index number.

Choice A is not relevant to the context and seems to be introducing a new concept. Choice C is also not relevant as it talks about multiplying the index number from top to bottom for each column, which is not related to multiplying radicals. Choice D is a vague statement and does not provide any useful information.
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
