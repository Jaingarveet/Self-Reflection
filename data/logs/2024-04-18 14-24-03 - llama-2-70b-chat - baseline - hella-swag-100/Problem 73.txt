Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to decode binary numbers [title] Remember that in binary 1 is " on : [step] And 0 is " off. " [title] Choose the binary number that you want to decode. [title] Give each number a value, starting from the extreme right.
Choices:
  A: [substeps] For example, using the number 1001001 , 1=1, + 0=2, + 0=4, + 1=8, + 0=16, + 0=32, + 1=64. The number becomes : 32 + 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1.
  B: [title] Draw a circle around your decimal place (which is considered the edge of the decimal place) (the first place furthest from it). [title] Place the " on : [step] " digit on the left side of the decimal place.
  C: [title] Put a value next, and add either 1 or 2 values. [step] For example: " 1/1 (1/1/1 and 1/1 1/1.
  D: [step] But the content button will say " value " is set to 0 and the denominator when you set down the values. Example in numerary 1, the number (and the numerator) is " 10, " but 0 may still be the clue you've referenced.

Action: Answer("A")

Explanation:
The text is describing how to decode binary numbers, and the correct answer is choice A. Choice A provides a step-by-step method for decoding binary numbers, starting from the extreme right and giving each number a value. This is the most likely completion to the text.

Choice B is not relevant to decoding binary numbers and is not a valid method for converting binary to decimal.

Choice C is also not relevant to decoding binary numbers and seems to be describing a different concept.

Choice D is not a valid method for decoding binary numbers and seems to be describing a different concept.

Therefore, the best answer is choice A.
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
