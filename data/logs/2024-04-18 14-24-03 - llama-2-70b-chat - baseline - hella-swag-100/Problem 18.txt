## Assistant 2:
  Answer: B

Explanation:
The passage suggests that trying to block or shortcut the grieving process will only prolong heartache. Choice B advises the reader to focus on feeling every feeling and experiencing every heart pang, which aligns with the idea of allowing oneself to grieve fully. Choice A suggests journaling as a way to improve one's mood and gain insight, but it doesn't directly address the importance of fully experiencing emotions. Choice C suggests healthy ways to process grief, but the passage emphasizes the importance of allowing oneself to feel the emotions rather than cutting the ex out of one's life. Choice D suggests giving oneself one day to care, but it doesn't address the importance of fully experiencing emotions. Therefore, the best completion to the text is choice B.
