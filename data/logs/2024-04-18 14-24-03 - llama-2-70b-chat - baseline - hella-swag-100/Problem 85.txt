[header] How to become a dog walker [title] Start working for an agency. [step] A good place to learn the ins and outs of the dog walking business is under someone who is already in it. Look for a large, local dog walking agency and contact the people there to ask if they need any help.

  D: Some dogs are exceedingly talented in their own ways. You want to give up some of your work and go to the professional agency to see what they need.
## Assistant 2:
  Answer: C

Explanation:
The text suggests that the best way to become a dog walker is to start working for an agency to learn the ins and outs of the business. Option C continues this train of thought by suggesting that working for an agency can also be a way to learn about animal safety and that it can lead to starting your own business in the long run. Option A is not related to the topic of dog walking. Option B suggests starting your own business, but it does not align with the text's suggestion of working for an agency first. Option D does not make sense in the context of the text.
## Result:
Agent Answer: None
