Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to remove pen ink stains from a silk dress [title] Blot the stain with paper towel. [step] Treating the ink stain immediately will make removing the stain much easier. If the ink stain is recent and hasn't set into the material, blot the ink stain with a cloth or paper towel before using any cleaning method.
Choices:
  A: [substeps] The ink stain is shallow and should be gradually removed. Blotting towels and paper towels will not get the ink stain out.
  B: [title] Place a first-aid kit inside a size-appropriate bag. [step] If ink stain removers are not readily available on shelves, store your cheap silk dress inside a larger bag or in a bag with an elastic top.
  C: [substeps] If you have any paper towels you can use, as well as the paper towel, blotting on the stain. The blot won't remove the ink stain, but it will prevent the ink from collecting.
  D: Blotting the stain will absorb the excess ink from the dress so that the stain is easier to remove. [title] Place the stained silk over a paper towel.

  D: Blotting the stain will absorb the excess ink from the dress so that the stain is easier to remove. [title] Place the stained silk over a paper towel.

Action: Answer("D") 

Rationale:
The correct answer is D. The text suggests that blotting the stain with a paper towel will absorb the excess ink, making it easier to remove. Therefore, the next step would be to place the stained silk over a paper towel to blot the stain.

Choice A is incorrect because it suggests that the ink stain should be gradually removed, which is not the most effective method for removing ink stains.

Choice B is unrelated to the topic of removing ink stains and is therefore incorrect.

Choice C is incorrect because it suggests using a paper towel to blot the stain, but it does not address the excess ink that needs to be absorbed.
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
