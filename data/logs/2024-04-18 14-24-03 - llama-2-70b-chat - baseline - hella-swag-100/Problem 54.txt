Action: Answer("D") 

Rationale:
The text suggests that if you're unsure about a mole, you should see a doctor. Choice D provides information on how to identify common, non-cancerous moles, which aligns with the text's advice to see a doctor if you're unsure. None of the other choices provide relevant information or advice for dealing with uncertain moles. Choice A discusses the causes of moles, but doesn't address how to assess treatment options or what to do if you're unsure. Choice B advises against cleaning mole sores in a certain way, but doesn't address the main topic of determining the type of mole to assess treatment options. Choice C suggests considering a dermatologist, but only after ruling out other options, which isn't the most appropriate advice for the given situation.
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
