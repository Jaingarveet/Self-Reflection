## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:**
I incorrectly analyzed option A, assuming that selecting two French plays would automatically exclude the Russian play, which is only true if *both* French plays are selected. This oversight led me to believe option A was a possible selection when it actually violated the "at least three novels" requirement.
**Error Keywords:**
*   Misinterpretation 
*   Rule misapplication
*   Logical error
## Step-by-Step Solution
1. **Analyze Option A:** 
    *   This option implies selecting 2 French novels and 2 French plays to reach 4 French works (the maximum allowed).
    *   With only one play remaining, it must be the Russian play.
    *   This leaves us with 2 novels and 3 plays, violating the "at least 3 novels" requirement.
    *   Therefore, option A is NOT possible.
2. **Verify other options:** Briefly check that options B, C, D, and E can indeed be achieved under the given constraints.
## Instructions for Future Problem Solving
1. **Carefully read each rule and constraint:** Pay close attention to keywords like "at least," "at most," and conditional statements ("if...then").
2. **Analyze each option systematically:** Consider the implications of each option on the number of French/Russian works, novels/plays, and how they align with the rules.
3. **Double-check conditional rules:** Ensure you are applying them correctly and not assuming implications that are not explicitly stated.
4. **Consider extreme scenarios:** Check options that push the boundaries of the constraints (e.g., maximum French works, minimum novels) to ensure they still comply with the rules.
## General Advice for Similar Problems
*   **Break down complex problems:** Divide the problem into smaller parts and analyze each part individually.
*   **Focus on keywords:** Pay attention to specific wording and conditions in the problem statement.
*   **Eliminate options:** If you can definitively prove an option is impossible, eliminate it and focus on the remaining choices.
*   **Work with examples:** Try creating examples that fit the given constraints to better understand the possibilities. 
*   **Review and learn from mistakes:** Analyze your incorrect answers to understand the reasoning errors and avoid them in the future.
