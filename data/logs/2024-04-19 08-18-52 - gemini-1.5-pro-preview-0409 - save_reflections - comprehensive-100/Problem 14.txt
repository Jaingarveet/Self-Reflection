## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:** My error stemmed from misinterpreting the implications of the given information and the question prompt. I focused too much on eliminating options that directly contradicted the statements, overlooking the possibility that the correct option might not be explicitly stated but could be inferred from the given constraints.
**Error Keywords:**
*   Logical reasoning error
*   Inference error
*   Misinterpretation of constraints
## Step-by-Step Solution
1.  **Analyze the given information:**
    *   HR and Sales are not adjacent.
    *   Finance is above Planning.
    *   Administration is above Planning but below HR.
    *   HR is not directly above Administration (meaning there's a floor between them).
2.  **Consider the options in light of the constraints:**
    *   **A:** Sales above R&D doesn't contradict the information but doesn't necessarily fit the scenario either.
    *   **B:** Sales above Administration implies HR is on the top floor (since it's above Administration with a floor in between). This satisfies all constraints. 
    *   **C:** Sales above Planning would place it next to HR (as Finance is above Planning), violating constraint 1.
    *   **D:** Sales on the 2nd floor is possible but doesn't necessarily fit the scenario.
3.  **Choose the option that fits the constraints and the question prompt:** Option B is the only option that satisfies all given constraints and could be true based on the information provided.
## Instructions for Future Similar Problems
1.  **Carefully analyze each statement and identify the relationships between the departments.**
2.  **Pay close attention to the wording of the question and what it asks for.**
3.  **Consider all possible arrangements that satisfy the given constraints.**
4.  **Eliminate options that directly contradict the information or the question prompt.**
5.  **Choose the option that logically follows from the given information and constraints, even if it's not explicitly stated.**
## General Advice for Logic Problems
*   **Break down complex problems into smaller, manageable steps.**
*   **Draw diagrams or use visualization techniques to represent the relationships between elements.**
*   **Consider all possibilities and eliminate options that violate the given constraints.**
*   **Focus on the logical implications of the information provided, not just the explicit statements.**
*   **Practice with various logic problems to improve your reasoning and inference skills.**
