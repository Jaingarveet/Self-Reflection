## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:** My error stemmed from overlooking the possibility that the constraint "the pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other" does not necessitate the pharmacy being at space 1 and the restaurant at space 7. The constraint is also satisfied when the restaurant is at space 1 and the pharmacy is at space 7. This oversight led me to prematurely eliminate option E.
**Error Keywords:**
*   Misinterpretation 
*   Assumption error
*   Constraint misapplication
## Step-by-Step Solution
1. **Review Constraints:** List all the given constraints to ensure each option adheres to them.
2. **Analyze Options:** Examine each option meticulously, checking for compliance with each constraint.
    *   **Option A:** Violates the constraint that the pharmacy must be at one end.
    *   **Option B:** Violates the constraint that the pharmacy must be at one end.
    *   **Option C:** Violates the constraint that the pharmacy must be next to the optometrist or veterinarian.
    *   **Option D:** Violates the constraint that the restaurants must have at least two businesses between them.
    *   **Option E:** Satisfies all constraints: restaurant at one end, pharmacy at the other, restaurants separated by three businesses, pharmacy next to the veterinarian, and toy store not next to the veterinarian.
3. **Identify Correct Option:** Based on the analysis, option E is the only one that satisfies all constraints.
## Instructions for Future Problem Solving
1. **Carefully Read Constraints:** Ensure complete understanding of each constraint and avoid making assumptions.
2. **Consider All Possibilities:** Don't limit interpretations of constraints; explore all valid scenarios.
3. **Methodical Analysis:** Evaluate each option against every constraint systematically.
4. **Eliminate Options:** Rule out options that violate any constraint.
5. **Verify Remaining Options:** Double-check the remaining options for adherence to all constraints.
## General Advice for Similar Problems
*   **Break Down Complex Problems:** Divide complex problems into smaller, manageable parts.
*   **Focus on Details:** Pay close attention to the specifics of each constraint and condition.
*   **Avoid Assumptions:** Don't make assumptions or jump to conclusions; rely on explicit information.
*   **Think Critically:** Analyze each option thoroughly and consider all possibilities.
*   **Review and Verify:** Double-check your work to ensure accuracy and avoid careless errors.
