## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:** My error stemmed from misinterpreting the constraint about the pharmacy's location. I incorrectly assumed it had to be next to the shoe store in space 2, eliminating valid possibilities.
**Error Keywords:**
*   Misinterpretation 
*   Constraint misunderstanding
*   Assumption error
## Step-by-Step Solution
1.  **Pharmacy Placement:** Since the pharmacy must be at one end, it's either in space 1 or space 7.
2.  **Restaurant Placement:** One restaurant must be at the opposite end of the pharmacy. So, if the pharmacy is in space 1, the restaurant is in space 7, and vice versa.
3.  **Shoe Store Placement:**  The shoe store is fixed in space 2.
4.  **Analyzing Remaining Options:**
    *   **Option A:** Optometrist in space 5 is possible as it satisfies all constraints.
    *   **Option B:** Pharmacy in space 1 is possible as discussed in step 1.
    *   **Option C:** Restaurant in space 3 violates the constraint of restaurants being separated by at least two spaces. 
    *   **Option D:** Toy store in space 6 is possible depending on the veterinarian's location.
    *   **Option E:** Veterinarian in space 4 violates the constraint about the pharmacy being next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
5.  **Conclusion:** Both options A and B are possible, but since only one option can be correct, there might be additional information missing from the context to definitively choose one. 
## Instructions for Future Problem Solving
1.  **Carefully analyze each constraint:** Pay close attention to the wording and ensure you understand the exact limitations imposed.
2.  **Consider all possibilities:** Don't eliminate options prematurely based on assumptions. Explore different scenarios that satisfy the constraints.
3.  **Visualize the arrangement:** Draw a diagram or map to represent the spaces and potential placements of businesses. This can help in visualizing the constraints and identifying valid solutions.
4.  **Review your reasoning:** Before finalizing your answer, double-check your logic and ensure you haven't overlooked any details or made any incorrect assumptions.
## General Advice for Similar Problems
*   **Break down complex problems:** Divide the problem into smaller, manageable parts to analyze each constraint and possibility systematically.
*   **Identify key information:** Focus on the essential details and constraints that directly impact the possible solutions.
*   **Eliminate options logically:** Use the constraints to rule out options that clearly violate the given conditions.
*   **Consider alternative perspectives:** Try to approach the problem from different angles to ensure you haven't missed any valid solutions.
