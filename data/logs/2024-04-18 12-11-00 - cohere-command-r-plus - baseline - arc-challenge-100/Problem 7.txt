Question: A group of Canada geese left a Florida lake in the spring. The geese arrived at a Maine lake 2,000 km away in 40 days. If the geese traveled at a constant rate, how far did the geese travel on the first day?
Choices:
  A: 5 km
  B: 20 km
  C: 40 km
  D: 50 km
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Distance = Speed x Time
Total distance = 2000 km
Total time = 40 days
Speed = Distance / Time = 2000 km / 40 days = 50 km/day

Distance traveled on the first day = Speed x Time = 50 km/day x 1 day = 50 km
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
