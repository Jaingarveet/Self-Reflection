Question: Red-clay bricks have a density of approximately 2000 kg/m^3. Air has a density of 1 kg/m^3. Which of the following has the lowest mass?
Choices:
  A: 2 m^3 of bricks
  B: 4 m^3 of bricks
  C: 6000 m^3 of air
  D: 10,000 m^3 of air
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Density = Mass / Volume

Mass = Density x Volume

A) Mass of 2m^3 of bricks = 2m^3 x 2000 kg/m^3 = 4000 kg
B) Mass of 4m^3 of bricks = 4m^3 x 2000 kg/m^3 = 8000 kg
C) Mass of 6000m^3 of air = 6000m^3 x 1 kg/m^3 = 6000 kg
D) Mass of 10,000 m^3 of air = 10,000 m^3 x 1 kg/m^3 = 10,000 kg

Therefore, C) 6000 m^3 of air has the lowest mass.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
