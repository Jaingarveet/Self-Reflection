Question: Sheep Challenge Evolution A species of sheep lives on the Scottish island of Hirta. Hirta has plenty of grass for the sheep to eat, and no natural predators of the sheep live on the island. Some sheep have dark wool, and some have light wool. The sheep with dark wool tend to be much larger and stronger than the sheep with light wool. However, researchers have found that in the last 20 years, the sheep with light wool have increased in number. Usually, strength and size help animals survive and breed. A new sheep predator is introduced to the island. Which change to the sheep population will most likely occur first?
Choices:
  A: a decrease in the population of sheep with dark wool
  B: a decrease in the population of sheep with light wool
  C: an increase in the population of sheep with dark wool
  D: an increase in the population of sheep with light wool
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The presence of a new predator will favor the survival of sheep with traits that help them avoid predation. In this case, the light-wool sheep may have an advantage over their dark-wool counterparts due to their smaller size and lower visibility to predators. Therefore, the most likely initial change in the sheep population following the introduction of a predator will be a decrease in the population of dark-wool sheep.
Action: Answer("A")
