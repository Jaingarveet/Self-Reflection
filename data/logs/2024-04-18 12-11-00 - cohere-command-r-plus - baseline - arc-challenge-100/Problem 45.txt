Question: As part of an experiment, an astronaut takes a scale to the Moon and weighs himself. The scale reads 31 pounds. If the astronaut has a mass of about 84 kilograms, which are the approximate weight and mass of the astronaut when standing on the Earth?
Choices:
  A: 31 pounds and 14 kilograms
  B: 31 pounds and 84 kilograms
  C: 186 pounds and 14 kilograms
  D: 186 pounds and 84 kilograms
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Weight is the force of gravity acting on an object, and mass is the amount of matter in an object. The Moon has less gravity than Earth, so an object weighed on the Moon will have a lower weight than on Earth. However, the mass of an object remains the same regardless of where it is measured. 

The astronaut's weight on the Moon is 31 pounds, and his mass is 84 kilograms. To find his weight on Earth, we need to account for Earth's stronger gravity. The formula for weight (W) can be calculated by multiplying mass (m) by the acceleration due to gravity (g):
W = mg

The acceleration due to gravity on the Moon is about 1/6 of that on Earth. So, to find the weight on Earth, we can multiply the Moon weight by 6:
Weight on Earth = 31 pounds x 6 = 186 pounds

Therefore, the approximate weight and mass of the astronaut when standing on Earth are 186 pounds and 84 kilograms.
