Thought: 
- Young male with abdominal pain and a heterogenous necrotizing mass at the left renal hilum on CT scan.
- Elevated AFP or hCG levels.
- Lymphoma is less likely to present with elevated AFP or hCG.
- Transitional cell carcinoma is typically associated with the bladder and not the renal hilum.
- Metastatic melanoma can present with elevated AFP or hCG, but the primary tumor would need to be identified.
- Metastatic germ cell tumor is the most likely diagnosis given the clinical presentation and elevated tumor markers.
