Question: In obstruction of second pa of axillary aery, the anastomosis between the following aery will maintain the blood supply of upper limb
Choices:
  A: Deep branch of transverse cervical aery & subscapular aery
  B: Anterior & posterior circumflex humeral
  C: Posterior circumflex humeral & circumflex scapular aery
  D: Suprascapular & anterior circumflex humeral aery
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The second part of the axillary artery is blocked.
We need to find an anastomosis that connects the arteries above and below the blockage to maintain blood supply to the upper limb.
Option A: The deep branch of the transverse cervical artery and the subscapular artery are not directly connected to the axillary artery.
Option B: The anterior and posterior circumflex humeral arteries are branches of the axillary artery below the blockage. They will not provide blood supply to the upper limb if the second part of the axillary artery is blocked.
Option C: The posterior circumflex humeral artery is a branch of the axillary artery below the blockage. The circumflex scapular artery is a branch of the subscapular artery, which is a branch of the third part of the axillary artery. This option does not provide a connection between arteries above and below the blockage.
Option D: The suprascapular artery is a branch of the thyrocervical trunk, which is a branch of the subclavian artery. The anterior circumflex humeral artery is a branch of the axillary artery below the blockage. This option provides a connection between the subclavian artery and the axillary artery below the blockage, which will maintain blood supply to the upper limb.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
