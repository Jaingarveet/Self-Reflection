Question: At 34 weeks multigravida with previous 2 normal delivery has an unstable lie with the present pregnancy. It can be due to:
Choices:
  A: Oligohydramnios
  B: Placenta pre
  C: Pelvic tumor
  D: Uterine anomalies
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
- Multigravida: A woman who has been pregnant two or more times.
- Unstable lie: A condition in which the baby's position in the womb changes frequently.
- Oligohydramnios: A condition in which there is too little amniotic fluid.
- Placenta previa: A condition in which the placenta covers the opening of the cervix.
- Pelvic tumor: A tumor in the pelvis.
- Uterine anomalies: Abnormalities in the shape or size of the uterus.
Analysis: 
- Oligohydramnios can cause the baby to move more freely, which can lead to an unstable lie.
- Placenta previa can also cause an unstable lie, as the placenta can block the baby's head from engaging in the pelvis.
- Pelvic tumors can take up space in the pelvis, which can also cause an unstable lie.
- Uterine anomalies can change the shape of the uterus, which can make it difficult for the baby to find a stable position.
Conclusion: 
All of the above choices can be a cause of an unstable lie in a multigravida with previous 2 normal deliveries.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
