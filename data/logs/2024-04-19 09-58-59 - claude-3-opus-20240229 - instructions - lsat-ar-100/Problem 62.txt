Context: A government needs to assign new ambassadors to Venezuela, Yemen, and Zambia. The candidates for these ambassadorships are Jaramillo, Kayne, Landon, Novetzke, and Ong. One ambassador will be assigned to each country, and no ambassador will be assigned to more than one country. The assignment of the ambassadors must meet the following constraints: Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships. If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne. If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen. If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.

## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The key information is:
- Ambassadors need to be assigned to Venezuela, Yemen, and Zambia
- The candidates are Jaramillo, Kayne, Landon, Novetzke, and Ong
- Each ambassador is assigned to only one country
- There are several constraints on the assignments
2. The question states that Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen. Let's apply the constraints with this information:
3. "Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships." 
- Since Kayne is assigned to Yemen, Novetzke cannot be assigned to any ambassadorship.
4. "If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne."
- This is satisfied since Kayne is assigned. Jaramillo may or may not be assigned.
5. "If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen."
- Since Kayne is assigned to Yemen, Ong cannot be assigned to Venezuela. 
- Ong could still be assigned to Zambia, or not assigned at all.
6. "If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia."
- Landon can only be assigned to Zambia, or not assigned at all.
7. With Kayne in Yemen, the remaining possibilities are:
- Venezuela: Jaramillo or Landon
- Zambia: Landon or Ong
- Jaramillo and Ong cannot both be unassigned
8. Looking at the answer choices:
- A is possible if Jaramillo is assigned to Venezuela
- B is possible if Landon is assigned to Zambia
- C is possible if Ong is assigned to Zambia
- D is possible if Jaramillo is not assigned 
- E is possible if Ong is not assigned
None of the answer choices MUST be true. The correct answer is not listed.
