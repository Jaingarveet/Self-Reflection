Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Carefully read the question and note all the given conditions.
2. Identify the fixed elements of the schedule (e.g., Jackson on Monday, Iturbe on Wednesday).
3. Determine the possible placements for the remaining witnesses.
4. Consider each condition and eliminate placements that violate the conditions.
5. Look for conclusions that must be true based on the remaining possible placements.
6. Select the answer choice that matches a necessary conclusion.
## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The fixed elements are:
   - Iturbe testifies on Wednesday
   - Jackson is the only witness on Monday
   - Two witnesses testify on Tuesday
2. Since Jackson is the only witness on Monday, the other 4 witnesses must be split between Tuesday and Wednesday. We know Iturbe is on Wednesday, so that leaves 3 witnesses for the 2 Tuesday slots and the remaining Wednesday slot.
3. The conditions state:
   - Franco and Garcia cannot testify the same day
   - Hong does not testify Monday
4. Since Hong can't testify Monday, and there are 2 slots Tuesday, Hong must testify either Tuesday or Wednesday. 
5. If Hong testifies Tuesday, then either Franco or Garcia must take the other Tuesday slot (since they can't testify together). The remaining one would testify Wednesday with Iturbe.
6. If Hong testifies Wednesday, then Franco and Garcia must testify Tuesday since they are the only 2 left.
7. Therefore, regardless of when Hong testifies, Franco and Garcia must testify on different days. The only answer choice that must be true is that Franco and Garcia testify on different days.
Action: Answer("E")
