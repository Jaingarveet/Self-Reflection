Context: Of the eight students—George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert—in a seminar, exactly six will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
Question: Which one of the following could be the schedule of the students' reports?
Choices:
  A: Mon. morning: Helen; Mon. afternoon: Robert Tues. morning: Olivia; Tues. afternoon: Irving Wed. morning: Lenore; Wed. afternoon: Kyle
  B: Mon. morning: Irving; Mon. afternoon: Olivia Tues. morning: Helen; Tues. afternoon: Kyle Wed. morning: Nina; Wed. afternoon: Lenore
  C: Mon. morning: Lenore; Mon. afternoon: Helen Tues. morning: George; Tues. afternoon: Kyle Wed. morning: Robert; Wed. afternoon: Irving
  D: Mon. morning: Nina; Mon. afternoon: Helen Tues. morning: Robert; Tues. afternoon: Irving Wed. morning: Olivia; Wed. afternoon: Lenore

Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Read the problem carefully and list out all the conditions/constraints.
2. Go through each answer choice one by one.
3. For each choice, check if it violates any of the listed conditions.
4. If a choice violates a condition, eliminate it and move to the next choice.
5. If a choice satisfies all conditions, select it as the correct answer.
6. Double-check that the selected answer indeed satisfies all conditions.
## Assistant 2:
You're right, let me carefully go through this step-by-step to arrive at the correct answer:
The key conditions are:
1. Tuesday is the only day George can report
2. Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports
3. If Nina reports, Helen and Irving must report the next day, unless Nina reports on Wednesday
Now checking each choice:
A. [REDACTED]
Robert gives an afternoon report, violating condition 2. Eliminate A.
B. [REDACTED] 
Olivia gives an afternoon report, violating condition 2. Eliminate B.
C. Mon. morning: Lenore; Mon. afternoon: Helen
    Tues. morning: George; Tues. afternoon: Kyle
    Wed. morning: Robert; Wed. afternoon: Irving
George reports on Tuesday, satisfying condition 1. Robert and Olivia give morning reports, satisfying condition 2. Nina does not report, so condition 3 doesn't apply. Choice C satisfies all conditions.
D. [REDACTED]
Nina reports Monday, so Helen and Irving must report Tuesday per condition 3. But they report Wednesday instead. Eliminate D.
E. [REDACTED]
George reports on Wednesday afternoon, violating condition 1 that he can only report on Tuesday. Eliminate E.
After checking all choices against the conditions, only Choice C satisfies all of them. Double-checking, it indeed meets the 3 key criteria.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
