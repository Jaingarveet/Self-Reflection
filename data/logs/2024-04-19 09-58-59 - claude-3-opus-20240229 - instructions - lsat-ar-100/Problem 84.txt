Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Carefully read the rules and conditions.
2. Place books on shelves as explicitly stated in the conditions. 
3. Use the given conditions to deduce the placement of additional books.
4. Consider all possible distributions that satisfy the "more on bottom than top" condition.
5. Eliminate answer choices that violate any of the conditions.
6. Choose the answer that matches a valid distribution.
## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. I is placed on the middle shelf. This is explicitly stated.
2. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. And F is placed on the same shelf as M. 
So F and M must be together on either the middle or bottom shelf. And K must be on the top or middle shelf.
3. O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
So L must be on the middle or bottom shelf, and O must be on the top or middle shelf.
4. More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. 
With 8 books total and at least 2 per shelf, the only way to satisfy this is:
2 books on top, 2 or 3 books in the middle, 4 or 3 books on the bottom.
5. Looking at the answer choices:
A) F, M - Violates the "at least 2 books" condition. Incorrect.
B) F, H, M - This is possible. Keep.
C) G, H, K - Violates the condition of K being higher than F. Incorrect. 
D) F, G, M, O - Violates the condition of O being higher than L. Incorrect.
E) G, H, L, M - Violates F and M being on the same shelf. Incorrect.
Therefore, the only possible correct answer is B) F, H, M
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
