You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Identify the total number of items (plays, in this case) under consideration.
2. Determine any definite lower or upper bounds on the number of items each person has.
3. Consider the implications of these bounds in relation to the total number of items.
4. Draw necessary conclusions based on these implications.
5. Reread the question and answer choices carefully.
6. Eliminate answer choices that are not necessarily true based on your conclusions.
7. Select the answer choice that must be true based on your analysis.
## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. There are exactly 3 plays total being reviewed: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation.
2. Bounds on number of plays reviewed by each student:
   - Kramer and Lopez each review fewer plays than Megregian. So Megregian reviews at least 2 plays.
   - Lopez and Megregian don't review any play Jiang reviews. So Jiang reviews at most 1 play.
   - Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. So they each review at least 1 play.
3. Since Megregian reviews at least 2 out of the 3 total plays, he must review more plays than Jiang, who reviews at most 1 play.
4. Therefore, Megregian definitely reviews more plays than Jiang.
5. Rereading the question, it asks which statement must be true.
6. The other answer choices are not necessarily true based on the given information:
   - A: We don't know for sure if Jiang reviews more plays than Lopez.
   - C, D, E: The number of plays O'Neill reviews compared to Megregian, Jiang and Kramer is not definitely determined.
7. The only statement that must be true is B: Megregian reviews more of the plays than Jiang does.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
