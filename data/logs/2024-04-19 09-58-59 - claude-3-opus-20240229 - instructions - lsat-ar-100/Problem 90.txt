Context: A maintenance company that takes service requests from three clients—Image, Solide, and Truvest—plans to set targets for its average service response times. Service targets will be set at 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day. Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail. The six targets are set according to the following conditions: None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
Question: Which one of the following targets CANNOT be set for more than one of the clients?

## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The key constraints are:
   - No client's website target can be longer than its voicemail target
   - Image's voicemail target must be the shortest of the 3 clients
   - Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's
2. Image must have the shortest voicemail target, so it must be 1 day. Its website target therefore must also be 1 day to satisfy the first constraint.
3. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's. The options are:
   - Solide 1 day, Truvest 2 or 3 days 
   - Solide 2 days, Truvest 3 days
4. In either case above, Solide and Truvest's voicemail targets must be 2 or 3 days to be longer than Image's 1 day voicemail target.
5. Looking at the possible targets:
   - 1 day website - must be Image, cannot be the others
   - 2 day website - could be Solide 
   - 3 day website - could be Truvest
   - 2 day voicemail - could be Solide or Truvest 
   - 3 day voicemail - could be Solide or Truvest
Therefore, the only target that cannot be set for more than one client is the 1-day website target. It must belong to Image uniquely.
