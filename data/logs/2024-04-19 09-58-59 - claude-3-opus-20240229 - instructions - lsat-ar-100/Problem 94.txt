Context: A shopping center has exactly seven spaces—space 1 through space 7—arranged in a straight row. Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
Question: If the veterinarian is in space 5, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: The optometrist is in space 2.
  B: The pharmacy is in space 7.
  C: A restaurant is in space 4.

## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The veterinarian is in space 5. This is the key piece of given information.
2. The pharmacy must be at one end (space 1 or 7) and a restaurant at the other end. 
3. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or veterinarian. Since the vet is in space 5, the pharmacy cannot be next to it. So the pharmacy must be in space 1, next to the optometrist in space 2.
4. A restaurant must be in space 7, since the pharmacy is in space 1.
5. The two restaurants must be separated by at least 2 businesses. With one restaurant in space 7, the other restaurant could be in space 1, 2, 3 or 4. But we know the pharmacy is in space 1 and optometrist in space 2. So the second restaurant must be in space 3 or 4.
6. The toy store can't be next to the vet in space 5. So the toy store is in space 4 or 6.
Evaluating the answer choices:
A. The optometrist is in space 2. This MUST be true based on the deductions above.
B. The pharmacy is in space 7. This is false, the pharmacy must be in space 1.
C. A restaurant is in space 4. This COULD be true but doesn't have to be. The second restaurant could be in space 3 or 4.
D. The shoe store is in space 6. This COULD be true but doesn't have to be. We don't know for certain where the shoe store is placed.
E. The toy store is in space 3. This COULD be true but doesn't have to be. The toy store could be in space 4 or 6.
Therefore, the correct answer is A - the optometrist must be in space 2.
Action: Answer("A")
