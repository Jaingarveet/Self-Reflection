Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.

4. Try to position the pair based on the constraints.
5. Fill in the remaining positions, ensuring that each placement satisfies all the constraints.
6. If there are multiple possible arrangements, consider all of them.
7. Check the businesses immediately on either side of the mentioned pair in all possible arrangements.
8. Choose the answer that matches in all possible arrangements.
## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The pharmacy must be at one end, and one restaurant at the other end. Let's say the pharmacy is in space 1.
2. The optometrist is next to the shoe store. Let's consider the possible positions for this pair:
   - If they are in spaces 2 and 3, then the pharmacy would be next to the optometrist, satisfying that constraint. 
   - They cannot be in spaces 3 and 4, or 4 and 5, because then the two restaurants would not be separated by at least two businesses.
   - If they are in spaces 5 and 6, then the toy store would have to be in space 4 (to avoid being next to the veterinarian). But then the two restaurants could not be separated by at least two businesses.
3. So the only possible arrangement is:
   Pharmacy, Optometrist, Shoe store, Toy store, Veterinarian, Restaurant, Restaurant
      1          2           3           4          5           6          7
4. The businesses immediately on either side of the optometrist-shoe store pair are the pharmacy and the toy store.
