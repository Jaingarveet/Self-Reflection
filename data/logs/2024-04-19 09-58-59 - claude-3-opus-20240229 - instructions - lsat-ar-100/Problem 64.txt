## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The question states that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. And either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. 
2. We're also told Parra and Quinn work in the same zone, and Stuckey and Udall work in the same zone.
3. The question states that Mahr and Stuckey work in the same zone. Let's consider the possibilities:
- If Mahr and Stuckey are in Zone 1, then Udall is also in Zone 1 (since Stuckey and Udall are together). This means Tiao must be in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn would be in Zone 3.
- If Mahr and Stuckey are in Zone 2, then Udall is also in Zone 2 (Stuckey and Udall together). This puts Tiao in Zone 1, and Parra and Quinn in Zone 3. 
- If Mahr and Stuckey are in Zone 3, then Udall is also in Zone 3 (Stuckey and Udall together). Parra and Quinn could be in either Zone 1 or Zone 3. Tiao would be in whichever of Zone 1 or 2 Parra is not in.
4. Now let's look at the answer choices:
A) Kim works in Zone 2 - This is possible if Mahr, Stuckey and Udall are in Zone 3, Tiao in Zone 1, and Parra and Quinn in Zone 3. 
B) Mahr works in Zone 1 - This is not possible, as we determined Mahr is either in the same zone as Stuckey (2 or 3) or if in Zone 1, Tiao would have to be in Zone 2.
C) Parra works in Zone 3 - This is possible in multiple scenarios, like if Mahr, Stuckey, Udall are in Zone 2 or 3.
D) Stuckey works in Zone 2 - This is possible, if Mahr is also in Zone 2 as the question states.
E) Tiao works in Zone 1 - This is possible if Mahr, Stuckey, Udall are in Zone 2 or 3.
5. Of the choices, B is the only one that is not possible under the given constraints.
Action: Answer("A")
