## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: A paper is in a square form whose one side is 20 cm. Two semi circles are drawn on its opposites as diameters. If these semi circles are cut down what is the area of the remaining paper?
Choices:
  A: 8.75
  B: 8.79
  C: 8.75
  D: 8.71
  E: 8.72
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I miscalculated the area of the semicircles. I calculated the area of each semicircle as if it were a full circle, not a semicircle. This led to an overestimation of the total area of the semicircles, and thus an underestimation of the remaining area of the paper.
Error Keywords:
- Calculation error
- Area calculation error
- Circle area calculation error
Solution:
The area of the square is side^2 = 20^2 = 400 cm^2.
The diameter of each semicircle is 20 cm, so the radius is 20/2 = 10 cm.
The area of a full circle is πr^2, so the area of each semicircle is (π(10)^2)/2 = 50π cm^2.
The area of both semicircles is 2*50π = 100π cm^2.
The area of the remaining paper is the area of the square minus the area of the semicircles = 400 - 100π cm^2.
The area of the remaining paper is approximately 314.16 cm^2, which is not an option. However, if the question intended to ask for the area in square meters, then the correct answer would be approximately 0.0314 m^2, which rounds to 0.03 m^2. This is still not an option, so the question may be flawed.
Instructions:
1. Identify the shape and dimensions of the paper.
2. Calculate the area of the paper.
3. Identify the shape and dimensions of the cutouts.
4. Calculate the area of each cutout.
5. Multiply the area of one cutout by the number of cutouts to find the total area of the cutouts.
6. Subtract the total area of the cutouts from the area of the paper to find the remaining area.
7. If necessary, convert the remaining area to the units specified in the question.
8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
- Always read the question carefully and understand what is being asked.
- Always break down complex problems into simpler steps.
- Always double-check your calculations.
- Be aware of the difference between the area of a full circle and a semicircle.
- Be aware of the units you are working with and make sure your answer is in the correct units.
