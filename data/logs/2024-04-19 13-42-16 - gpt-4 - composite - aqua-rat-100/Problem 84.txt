## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: In how many ways can a teacher in a kindergarten school arrange a group of 3 children (Susan, Tim and Zen) on 3 identical chairs in a straight line so that Susan is on the left of Tim?
Choices:
  A: 7
  B: 3
  C: 2
  D: 1
  E: 6
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I misunderstood the problem. I thought the chairs were distinct, but the problem states they are identical. This means the only thing that matters is the order of the children, not the specific chair they sit in. 
Error Keywords:
- Combinatorics error
- Arrangement error
- Misinterpretation error
Solution:
The condition is that Susan must be on the left of Tim. This leaves two possible arrangements: Susan, Tim, Zen and Susan, Zen, Tim. However, since the chairs are identical, these two arrangements are considered the same. Therefore, there is only one way to arrange the children so that Susan is on the left of Tim.
Instructions:
[REDACTED]. Understand the problem and the conditions given.
[REDACTED]. Identify the number of objects (children) to be arranged.
[REDACTED]. Determine the number of ways the objects can be arranged based on the conditions.
4. Remember that if the chairs are identical, the specific chair each child sits in does not matter, only their order.
5. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
- Always read the problem carefully and understand the conditions.
- Be careful with problems involving arrangements or combinations, as they can be tricky.
- Remember that if objects (like chairs) are identical, the specific object each item is placed on does not matter, only their order.
- Always double-check your understanding of the problem and your final answer.
