## System:
You are an expert in Logic.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:
Topic: Geography
Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Logic
Context: A laboratory has three types of robots, A.B, and C.Type A can recognize colors, type B can recognize shapes, and type C can neither recognize colors nor shapes.The laboratory experimented with robots 1 and 2 with red balls, blue balls, red squares, and blue squares, and ordered them to pick up the red balls, but number 1 picked up the red squares, and number 2 picked up the blue balls.
Question: Based on the above experiment, which of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Both No.1 and No.2 are type C.
  B: Only one of No.1 and No.2 is C type.
  C: No.1 is type A and No.2 is type B.
  D: No.1 is not Type B and No.2 is not Type A.
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Advice:
 - Don't make assumptions beyond what is explicitly stated in the problem.
 - Consider all possible scenarios and explanations, even if some seem less likely.
 - Eliminate options that are provably false based on the given information. 
 - Be careful not to confuse what is possible with what is certain.
 - The correct answer will be true in all possible scenarios consistent with the problem statement.
## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. Robot 1 picked up the red squares instead of the red balls. This means it cannot distinguish colors, but it can distinguish shapes. So Robot 1 must be Type B.
2. Robot 2 picked up the blue balls instead of the red balls. This means it cannot distinguish colors. But we don't know if it can distinguish shapes or not based on this information alone. So Robot 2 could be either Type B or Type C.
3. Looking at the answer choices:
A) Both being Type C is not possible, because we know Robot 1 is Type B. 
B) This is possible, if Robot 2 is Type C while Robot 1 is Type B.
C) We know Robot 1 is Type B not A, so this is false.
D) We know Robot 1 is definitely Type B. And while Robot 2 might not be Type A, we can't be certain of that. So this is not necessarily true.
Therefore, the only answer that must be true based on the information given is B - only one of the robots (Robot 2) could be Type C, while the other (Robot 1) is definitely Type B.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
