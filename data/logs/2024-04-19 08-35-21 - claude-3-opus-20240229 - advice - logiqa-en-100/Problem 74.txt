## System:
You are an expert in Logic.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Advice:
 - Always consider the implications of each choice in light of all given conditions.
 - Be thorough in considering both the direct and indirect consequences of each selection.
 - Eliminate options systematically based on logical deductions from the conditions.
 - If a choice leads to a scenario that violates a condition, that choice cannot be part of the solution.
 - In complex scenarios, it may help to enumerate all possible valid selections to identify the impossible ones.
## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step considering the advice:
1. We are told that He Zhilian is not selected. That means the two girls selected must be Fang Rufen and Guo Yanran.
2. Now let's consider each boy individually:
   Tang Xiaohua: If Tang Xiaohua is selected, then per condition (1), Guo Yanran cannot be selected. But we know Guo Yanran must be selected (from step 1). Therefore, Tang Xiaohua cannot be selected.
   Peng Youwen: There is no condition that directly prevents Peng Youwen from being selected when Fang Rufen and Guo Yanran are selected. So Peng Youwen could potentially be selected.
   Qiu Zhijie: If Qiu Zhijie is selected, then per condition (3), Tang Xiaohua cannot be selected. This does not conflict with any other conditions or deductions. So Qiu Zhijie could potentially be selected.
   Song Wenkai: If Song Wenkai is selected, then per condition (2), Peng Youwen cannot be selected. This does not conflict with any other conditions or deductions. So Song Wenkai could potentially be selected.
   Ren Xiangyang: There are no conditions that involve Ren Xiangyang. So he could potentially be selected.
3. From the above analysis, the only boy who definitively cannot be selected is Tang Xiaohua.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
