## System:
You are an expert in Logic.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

## User 2:
Topic: Logic
Context: The Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge, built in 1968, has a clear height of 24 meters in the Fengshui area.Theoretically, it can pass a maximum of 3,000 tons of ships.Today, with the rapid economic development, it has become a building that “cuts the waist” of the Yangtze River waterway and hinders the passage of giant ships.A bridge expert asserted that the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge must be demolished and rebuilt in order to dredge the golden waterways of the Yangtze River completely.
Question: If any of the following is true, can you raise the most doubts about this expert's point of view?
Choices:
  A: Due to the inability of large ships to pass through the Nanjing Bridge, a large number of exported goods in the middle and upper reaches of the Yangtze River can only be taken by road or railway.
  B: 99% of international ships entering the Yangtze River are moored at ports below the Nanjing Bridge, and dozens of foreign trade terminals above Nanjing rarely have large external ships berthed.
  C: It is not enough to dismantle only the Nanjing Bridge.The Yangtze River Bridge, which was built in Wuhu, Tongling, Anqing and other places, has a clear height of 24 meters.
  D: Shipbuilding technology is highly developed, and 8000-ton ships designed for adapting to the passage of the Yangtze River abroad have passed through Nanjing to Wuhan.
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Advice:
 - Always read the full question and understand the key claim you are evaluating.
 - Always consider each answer choice carefully and look for direct evidence that contradicts the main assertion.
 - Never just pick an answer because it seems related to the topic or matches your first instinct.
 - Always be on the lookout for your own potential biases and try to set them aside.
 - Never ignore an answer choice just because it doesn't fit your initial assumptions.
## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
The key claim made by the bridge expert is that the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge must be demolished and rebuilt in order to allow giant ships to pass through and fully open up the Yangtze River waterway.
Looking at each answer choice:
A) This choice supports the expert's view by suggesting the bridge is preventing large ships and hurting trade. It does not raise doubts.
B) This choice directly contradicts the expert's main point. If 99% of large international ships dock below the Nanjing Bridge anyway, and ports above it rarely receive large ships, then demolishing the bridge to allow giant ship passage seems unnecessary. The current bridge is not actually hindering shipping significantly.
C) This suggests the problem is bigger than just the Nanjing Bridge. But it still implies the expert is correct that bridges like Nanjing's need to be rebuilt, so it supports rather than challenges the main assertion.
D) This indicates some large ships are already able to pass through to Wuhan with current bridge heights. That ability raises some doubt on the claim that demolishing and rebuilding the Nanjing Bridge is essential for large ship passage.
Considering all the choices, B most directly challenges the expert's key claim by suggesting the Nanjing Bridge is not actually a major obstacle to shipping, since the vast majority of large ships aren't traveling that far up the Yangtze anyway. It provides the strongest reason to doubt the assertion that this specific bridge must be demolished and rebuilt.
