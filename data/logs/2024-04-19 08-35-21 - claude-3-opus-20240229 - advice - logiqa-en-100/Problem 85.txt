## System:
You are an expert in Logic.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Context: An editor is considering the issue of choosing the manuscript for the theoretical version of the newspaper.Six papers from E, F, G, J and K are available.Taking into account the content of the article, the layout of the newspaper and other factors.(1) If paper E is used, then paper F cannot be used but paper K must be used; (2) Paper G or paper H can only be used without paper J.(3) If you don't need thesis G, you don't need thesis K.(4) Essay E is a manuscript requested by a celebrity and cannot be used.
Question: If the above items are true, which of the following items must be true?
Choices:
  A: Paper E is used, but paper H is not used.
  B: Both articles G and H are used.
  C: No paper J, but paper K.
  D: Both G and J articles are unnecessary.
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and list out all the given information.
 - Consider the implications of each piece of information separately and in combination.
 - Remember that the contrapositive of a statement is always true if the original statement is true.
 - Eliminate choices systematically based on the given conditions.
 - If a choice is a necessary consequence of the given conditions, then it must be true.
 - Always double-check your reasoning to avoid logical errors.
## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. Paper E cannot be used (given in condition 4). So choice A is false.
2. If paper G is used, then paper J cannot be used (condition 2). But the question doesn't state that G is definitely used. So we can't conclude that both G and H are used. Choice B may or may not be true.
3. If paper K is used, then paper G must be used (contrapositive of condition 3). But again, we don't know for sure if K is used. So choice C may or may not be true. 
4. If paper G is not used, then paper K is not used (condition 3). In this case, from the remaining papers F, H, J - paper H can be used without J (condition 2), and papers F and J can be used together. So it's possible to not use both G and J. 
Therefore, the only choice that must be true based on the given conditions is D. If G is not used, J will also not be used.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
