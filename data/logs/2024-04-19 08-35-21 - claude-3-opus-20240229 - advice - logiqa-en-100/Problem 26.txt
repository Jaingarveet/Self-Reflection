## System:
You are an expert in Logic.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Topic: Logic
Context: The late famous logician Jin Yuelin of China heard the words "Money is like dung" and "Friends are worth a thousand dollars" when he was a child, and found that there are logical problems because they can lead to the absurd conclusion of "friends are like dung".
Question: Since the conclusion of "friends like dung" is not true, it can be logically derived?
Choices:
  A: The expression "money is like dung" is false.
  B: If a friend is indeed worth a lot of money, then money is not like dung.
  C: The statement that "friends are valuable" is true.
  D: The words "Money is like dung" and "Friends are worth a thousand dollars" are either true or false.
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Advice:
 - In logical reasoning, always consider the relationships and implications between statements.
 - Pay attention to conditional statements (if-then statements).
 - Consider the consequences of assuming each statement is true or false.
 - Eliminate absurd conclusions by determining what must be true or false for those conclusions to be avoided.
 - Be precise in your logical language and reasoning.
## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The two given statements are:
   - "Money is like dung" 
   - "Friends are worth a thousand dollars"
2. If we assume both statements are true, then by substitution we can conclude "Friends are like dung". But this conclusion is absurd and not true.
3. So for the absurd conclusion to be avoided, at least one of the original statements must be false. 
4. If "Money is like dung" is false, then even if friends are worth a lot of money, it doesn't lead to friends being like dung. The analogy between money and dung is what enables the absurd conclusion.
5. On the other hand, if "Friends are worth a thousand dollars" is false, it also prevents the absurd conclusion. But the question doesn't indicate this statement is false.
6. The question also doesn't suggest both statements must have the same truth value. They could have different truth values.
7. Therefore, the only logically sound conclusion is that if the conclusion "friends are like dung" is false, then the statement "money is like dung" must be false. This breaks the analogy that leads to the absurd conclusion.
Action: Answer("A")
