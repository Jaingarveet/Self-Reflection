## System:
You are an expert in Logic.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Topic: Logic
Context: The football game in the "Master Cup 2003 China Robot Competition" is in progress.Three professors predicted the final result? Professor Zhao said? "The champion is not the Tsinghua University team nor the Zhejiang University team." Professor Qian said ? "The champion is not the Tsinghua University team, but the University of Science and Technology of China." Professor Sun said? "The champion is not the China University of Science and Technology team, but the Tsinghua University team.The results of the competition showed that only one of them judged both, one 'S judgment is one-to-one wrong, the other one is wrong.
Question: According to the above situation, we know that the winner is
Choices:
  A: Tsinghua University Team
  B: China University of Science and Technology Team
  C: Zhejiang University Team
  D: Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Advice:
 - In logic problems with multiple statements, consider each statement independently and its implications.
 - Clearly identify any constraints or conditions that must be satisfied.
 - Systematically consider all possibilities, eliminating those that lead to contradictions or violate constraints.
 - Be rigorous in your reasoning and don't jump to conclusions prematurely.
 - If you get stuck, try working backwards from the constraints to see which possibilities they allow.
 - Practice breaking down complex problems into clear, step-by-step reasoning.
## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1. Professor Zhao said the champion is neither Tsinghua University nor Zhejiang University. This means the champion must be either the University of Science and Technology of China or Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics.
2. Professor Qian said the champion is not Tsinghua University, but is the University of Science and Technology of China. This contradicts Professor Zhao, so one of them must be completely wrong.
3. Professor Sun said the champion is not the University of Science and Technology of China, but is Tsinghua University. This also contradicts both Professor Zhao and Professor Qian.
4. We are told that one professor judged both correctly, one judged one correctly and one incorrectly, and one judged both incorrectly. 
5. If Professor Zhao was correct, then Professor Qian and Professor Sun must both be wrong, but this violates the condition that one professor has one correct and one incorrect judgment.
6. If Professor Qian was correct, then Professor Zhao and Professor Sun would both be wrong, which is not allowed.
7. Therefore, Professor Sun must be the one who is correct. This means Tsinghua University is the champion.
In conclusion, the only possibility consistent with the given information is that Tsinghua University is the champion.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
