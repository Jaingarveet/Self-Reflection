## System:
You are an expert in Logic.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Logic
Context: There must be an outside world, because if there is something outside me that can shine or reflect, shining the light into my eyes, which gives me a visual experience, I ca nâ€™t see the buildings, the crowds and the stars these things.And, not only have visual experience like me, but others also have such visual experience; book knowledge also tells us repeatedly that there is an outside world outside of us.
Question: Which of the following does not constitute doubt or rebuttal to the above argument?
Choices:
  A: To use sensory evidence to explain the existence of the external world requires presupposing the existence of the external world in the mind.
  B: How do you prove that others have similar visual experience to you?
  C: Since the visual experience is reliable, Mirage is not a so-called illusion, but a real existence.
  D: If there is no external world and natural science knowledge is not a true reflection of it, then why does natural science achieve such great success in practice?
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Advice:
- Always read questions thoroughly to ensure you understand what is being asked.
- Take time to carefully consider how each answer choice relates to the main argument.
- Don't just look for the "right" answer; also consider how the "wrong" answers fail to fit the question.
- Be careful not to let your own opinions bias your choice; stick closely to the logic of the argument and question at hand.
- If a choice seems to support the argument rather than challenge it, it's likely the odd one out for a question like this.
## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
The main argument is that there must be an external world because:
1) Our visual experiences seem to be caused by things outside of us 
2) Other people also report having similar visual experiences
3) Book knowledge also tells us there is an external world
The question is asking which choice does NOT provide doubt or rebuttal to this argument. In other words, which choice fails to challenge the reasoning.
Choice A challenges the argument by pointing out circular reasoning - using sensory evidence to prove the external world assumes the external world exists in the first place. This is a valid rebuttal.
Choice B challenges by questioning how we can know others have similar experiences. This casts doubt on point 2 of the argument. Also a reasonable rebuttal.
Choice C states that mirages are real, not illusions, because visual experience is reliable. Rather than challenging the argument, this actually seems to support the idea that our senses give us accurate information about an external reality. It fails to provide doubt.
Choice D questions why science would be so successful if there was no real external world it described. This challenges the argument by implying the alternative (no external world) leads to a strange conclusion. It is a relevant rebuttal.
Therefore, Choice C is the only one that does not offer doubt or rebuttal against the original argument. It sides with the argument rather than questioning it.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
