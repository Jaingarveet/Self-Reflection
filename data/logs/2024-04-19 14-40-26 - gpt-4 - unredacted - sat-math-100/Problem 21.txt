## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Explanation:
I made a mistake in the calculation of the discriminant (b²-4ac) in the quadratic formula. I incorrectly calculated it as 12² - 4*3*6, when it should have been 12² - 4*3*2.
Error Keywords:
- Calculation error
- Discriminant error
- Quadratic formula error
Solution:
The given equation is a quadratic equation. The solutions to a quadratic equation $ax^{2}+bx+c=0$ are given by the formula $x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^{2}-4ac}}{2a}$.
Here, a=3, b=12, and c=6.
So, the solutions are $x=\frac{-12\pm\sqrt{12^{2}-4*3*6}}{2*3}$.
This simplifies to $x=-2\pm\frac{\sqrt{36}}{6}$, which further simplifies to $x=-2\pm\sqrt{2}$.
Instructions:
1. Identify the coefficients a, b, and c in the quadratic equation.
2. Substitute these values into the quadratic formula $x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^{2}-4ac}}{2a}$.
3. Calculate the discriminant (b²-4ac) carefully.
4. Simplify the expression under the square root.
5. Simplify the entire expression to find the solutions.
Advice:
- Always double-check your calculations, especially when calculating the discriminant in the quadratic formula.
- Be careful with signs when substituting values into the quadratic formula.
- Simplify the expression under the square root before proceeding with the rest of the calculation.
- Practice more problems involving the quadratic formula to become more comfortable with the process.
