Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I answered the question correctly, but I did not provide the answer in the correct format. I should have stated my answer as 'Action: Answer("C")' instead of just writing the answer.
Error Keywords:
- Formatting error
- Answer presentation error
Solution:
The sale price of the book is 60% of the original price (100% - 40% = 60%). 
So, if $18.00 is 60% of the original price, we can find the original price by dividing $18.00 by 60% (or 0.60 in decimal form).
Calculate $18.00 / 0.60 = $30.00
Action: Answer("C")
Instructions:
1. Understand the problem and identify the given information.
2. Calculate the percentage of the original price that the sale price represents.
3. Divide the sale price by this percentage (in decimal form) to find the original price.
4. Write your answer in the correct format: 'Action: Answer("[ANSWER_CHOICE]")'.
Advice:
- Always read the instructions carefully and make sure you understand the required format for answers.
- Always double-check your calculations and your answer.
- Always present your answer in the required format.
