## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Explanation:
I made a mistake in the process of equating the numerators of both sides of the equation. I incorrectly combined the terms on the right side of the equation, which led to an incorrect quadratic equation. This error in the initial steps of the problem led to an incorrect conclusion about the value of 'a'.
Error Keywords:
- Calculation error
- Algebraic error
- Rational equation error
- Misinterpretation of equation
Solution:
The equation is a rational equation, and it can be solved by equating the numerators of both sides since the denominators are already equal. 
So, we have: 
24x^2 + 25x - 47 = -8x - 3 - 53
24x^2 + 25x - 47 = -8x - 56
After correctly combining the terms, we get:
24x^2 + 33x + 9 = 0
This is not the correct equation. The correct equation after combining the terms should be:
24x^2 + 33x + 9 = 0
Solving this equation gives us the correct value of 'a' which is -3.
Instructions:
1. Identify the type of equation (in this case, a rational equation).
2. Equate the numerators of both sides of the equation since the denominators are already equal.
3. Correctly combine like terms on both sides of the equation.
4. Solve the resulting equation to find the value of 'a'.
5. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
6. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
- Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
- Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
- Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
- Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
- Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
- Be careful when combining like terms in an equation.
