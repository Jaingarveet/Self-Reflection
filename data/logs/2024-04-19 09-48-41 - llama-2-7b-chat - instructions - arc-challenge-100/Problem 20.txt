## Assistant 2:
  Topic: Science
Question: Which of these events occurs about every three months?
Choices:
A: high tide
B: new moon
C: new season
D: solar eclipse

Self-Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand that I misunderstood the concept of new moons and their frequency. A new moon occurs when the moon is positioned between the Earth and the sun, making it invisible from our planet. This event occurs about every 29.5 days, which is equivalent to about every three months.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) new moon.

Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
