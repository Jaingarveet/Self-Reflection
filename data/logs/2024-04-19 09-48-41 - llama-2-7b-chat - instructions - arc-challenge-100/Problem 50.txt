## Assistant 2:
  Topic: Science
Question: To determine the boiling point of a liquid, a student must use all of these tools except

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I reflected on the problem, my solution, and the correct answer.

The tool that is not needed to determine the boiling point of a liquid is:

D: a thermometer.

A thermometer is used to measure the temperature of a substance, but it is not necessary to determine the boiling point of a liquid. The boiling point of a liquid can be determined by measuring the temperature of the liquid at regular intervals using a stopwatch.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) a heat source.

Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
