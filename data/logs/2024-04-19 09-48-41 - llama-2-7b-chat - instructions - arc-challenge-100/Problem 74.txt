## System:
You are an expert in Science.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:
Topic: Geography
Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Science
Question: Elisa was classifying types of energy as either potential or kinetic. Which is a type of potential energy?
Choices:
  A: sound energy
  B: radiant energy
  C: thermal energy
  D: chemical energy
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:

1. Recognize that potential energy is energy that has the potential to do work, while kinetic energy is energy of motion.
2. Identify the correct type of energy for each option:
	* Sound energy is a type of kinetic energy (it is the energy of motion of particles in a substance).
	* Radiant energy is a type of potential energy (it is energy that has the potential to do work).
	* Chemical energy is a type of potential energy (it is energy that has the potential to do work through chemical reactions).
3. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
4. Choose the answer that matches your reasoning.
## Assistant 2:
  Reflection:

I previously answered this question incorrectly, selecting option A: sound energy, as a type of potential energy. However, upon further reflection, I realize that sound energy is actually a type of kinetic energy, as it is the energy of motion of particles in a substance.

Therefore, the correct answer is option B: radiant energy, which is a type of potential energy as it has the potential to do work.

Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
