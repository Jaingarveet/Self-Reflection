Question: Sheep Challenge Evolution A species of sheep lives on the Scottish island of Hirta. Hirta has plenty of grass for the sheep to eat, and no natural predators of the sheep live on the island. Some sheep have dark wool, and some have light wool. The sheep with dark wool tend to be much larger and stronger than the sheep with light wool. However, researchers have found that in the last 20 years, the sheep with light wool have increased in number. Usually, strength and size help animals survive and breed. A new sheep predator is introduced to the island. Which change to the sheep population will most likely occur first?
Choices:
  A: a decrease in the population of sheep with dark wool
  B: a decrease in the population of sheep with light wool
  C: an increase in the population of sheep with dark wool
  D: an increase in the population of sheep with light wool
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:

1. Recognize that the introduction of a new predator to the island will pose a threat to all of the sheep.
2. Understand that the population of both dark and light wool sheep will decrease.
3. Choose the answer that best explains the most likely outcome.
4. Double-check your reasoning and ensure that it is correct.
## Assistant 2:
  Reflection:
I previously answered this question by selecting option A, a decrease in the population of sheep with dark wool. However, upon further reflection, I realize that this answer is incorrect. The introduction of a new predator to the island will pose a threat to all of the sheep, regardless of their wool color. Therefore, the most likely outcome is that both populations of sheep will decrease.

Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
