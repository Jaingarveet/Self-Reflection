## System:
You are an expert in Science.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: A group of Canada geese left a Florida lake in the spring. The geese arrived at a Maine lake 2,000 km away in 40 days. If the geese traveled at a constant rate, how far did the geese travel on the first day?
Choices:
  A: 5 km
  B: 20 km
  C: 40 km
  D: 50 km
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:

1. Identify the formula for finding distance traveled: distance = speed x time
2. Use the given information to calculate the speed of the geese: speed = distance / time = 2,000 km / 40 days = [REDACTED]/day
3. Calculate the distance traveled on the first day: distance = speed x days = [REDACTED]/day x 1 day = [REDACTED]
4. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
5. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
## Assistant 2:
  Thought: 
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand that the geese traveled at a constant rate.
The formula for finding distance traveled is distance = speed x time.
Action: Answer("C")

Calculation:
Speed = distance / time = 2,000 km / 40 days = [REDACTED]/day
Distance traveled on the first day = speed x days = [REDACTED]/day x 1 day = [REDACTED]

Double-check:
My calculation is correct. The distance traveled by the geese on the first day is [REDACTED].

Therefore, the answer is (C) 40 km.
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
