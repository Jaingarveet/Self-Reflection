Question: Ten grams of sugar is dissolved in 100 grams (g) of water. How many grams is the sugar-and-water solution?

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I reflected on the problem, my solution, and the correct answer.

1. Identify the given information: 10 grams of sugar is dissolved in 100 grams of water.

To find the amount of sugar in the solution, we can use the formula:

Amount of sugar = Amount of sugar dissolved in water x Concentration of sugar in solution

We know that 10 grams of sugar is dissolved in 100 grams of water, so the concentration of sugar in the solution is:

Concentration of sugar in solution = Amount of sugar dissolved in water / Amount of water = 10 g / 100 g = 0.1 g/g

Now, we can use the formula to find the amount of sugar in the solution:

Amount of sugar in the solution = Amount of sugar dissolved in water x Concentration of sugar in solution
= 10 g x 0.1 g/g
= 1 g

Therefore, the sugar-and-water solution contains 1 gram of sugar.

3. Choose the correct answer from the options provided:

The options are:

A: 90 g
B: 100 g
C: 110 g
D: 1000 g

Since the correct answer is 1 g, we can eliminate options A, C, and D, which are greater than 1 g.

Therefore, the answer is B: 100 g.
## Result:
Agent Answer: None
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
