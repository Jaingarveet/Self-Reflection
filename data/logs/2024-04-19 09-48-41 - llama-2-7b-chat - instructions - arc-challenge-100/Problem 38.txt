## System:
You are an expert in Science.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Assistant 2:
  Thought: 
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand that the density of red-clay bricks is approximately 2000 kg/m^3, while the density of air is 1 kg/m^3. To determine which of the following has the lowest mass, we need to calculate the mass of each volume of bricks and air.

Reflection:
I reflected on my previous answer and realized that I made a mistake in calculating the mass of the bricks. I calculated the mass of 2 m^3 of bricks as 4000 kg (2000 kg/m^3 x 2 m^3), but this is incorrect. The correct mass of 2 m^3 of bricks is 2000 kg (2000 kg/m^3 x 2 m^3).

I also realized that I misunderstood the question and thought it was asking for the mass of a single m^3 of bricks, rather than the mass of multiple m^3 of bricks.

Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
