Choices:
  A: 1982
  B: 1987
  C: 1990
  D: 1995
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The question is not specific about which country's mental health program it is referring to. However, considering the global perspective, the World Health Organization (WHO) launched the "Mental Health Action Plan 2013 - 2020" in May 2013. But this is not among the options. If we consider the United States, the Community Mental Health Act was enacted in 1963, which is also not among the options. Therefore, without specific context or country, it's impossible to accurately answer this question. 
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
