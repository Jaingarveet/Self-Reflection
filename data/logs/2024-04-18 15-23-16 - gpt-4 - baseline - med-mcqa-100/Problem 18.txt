## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Leptin is a hormone that is produced by the body's fat cells and is often referred to as the "satiety hormone" or the "starvation hormone." Leptin's primary target is in the brain, particularly an area called the hypothalamus. Leptin is supposed to tell the brain that we have enough fat stored, that we don't need to eat, and that we can burn calories at a normal rate. It has many other functions related to fertility, immunity, brain function, and more. So, Leptin decreases appetite.
