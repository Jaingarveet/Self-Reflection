## System:
You are an expert in Medicine.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:
Topic: Geography
Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")

Question: The facial artery terminates in the anastomosis with
Choices:
  A: Opposite side of the facial artery
  B: Transverse facial artery
  C: Anastomosis with Infra orbital artery
  D: Branch of the ophthalmic artery
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Advice:
 - Always trace arteries from their origin to their terminal branches.
 - Be aware of anastomoses between terminal branches of arteries from different origins.
 - Consider the full course and relations of an artery, not just its proximal segments.
 - Know the branches and supply of the major arteries of the head (carotid, maxillary, ophthalmic).
 - Use the anatomical location and course of an artery to reason out its relations and anastomoses.
## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The facial artery is a branch of the external carotid artery. It arises in the neck.
2. It then runs upward and forward, deep to the submandibular gland, to cross the inferior border of the mandible.
3. On the face, it runs upward and forward, winding around the oral commissure and alongside the nose. 
4. Near the medial canthus of the eye, the facial artery terminates by anastomosing with the dorsal nasal branch of the ophthalmic artery.
5. The ophthalmic artery is a branch of the internal carotid artery that enters the orbit through the optic canal.
Therefore, based on tracing the full course of the facial artery from origin to termination, and considering its anatomical relations, the best answer is:
Action: Answer("D")
The facial artery terminates by anastomosing with a branch of the ophthalmic artery near the medial canthus of the eye.
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
