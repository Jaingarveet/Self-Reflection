## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. Islet cell transplantation is a procedure to treat type 1 diabetes mellitus. 
2. In this procedure, islet cells from a donor pancreas are transplanted into a patient to restore insulin production.
3. For the transplanted islet cells to function, they need a good blood supply to receive nutrients and secrete insulin into the bloodstream.
4. The liver has a dual blood supply (hepatic artery and portal vein) and can easily accommodate the islet cells. 
5. During the procedure, the islet cells are infused into the portal vein, which carries blood from the intestines to the liver.
6. The islet cells then lodge in the liver's small blood vessels and begin producing insulin.
So in islet cell transplantation, the cells are transplanted into the liver via the portal vein. The liver provides the optimal environment for islet cell survival and function.
Action: Answer("C")
