## System:
You are an expert in Medicine.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: A 60 year old male was diagnosed as carcinoma right lung. On CECT chest there was a tumor of 5x5 cm in upper lobe and another 2x2 cm size tumor nodule in middle lobe. The primary modality of treatment is :
Choices:
  A: Radiotherapy
  B: Chemotherapy
  C: Surgery
  D: Suppoive treatment
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Advice:
- Don't assume that multiple lung tumor nodules always mean unresectable stage III or IV disease.
- Carefully evaluate the staging details provided to determine if surgical resection is potentially feasible.
- Remember that surgery offers the best chance for cure in localized non-small cell lung cancer.
- Consider a multidisciplinary approach with surgery as the primary modality followed by adjuvant chemo/radiation when indicated.
## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
The patient is a 60-year-old male diagnosed with carcinoma of the right lung. The CECT chest shows:
- A 5x5 cm tumor in the upper lobe 
- Another 2x2 cm tumor nodule in the middle lobe
Key considerations:
- The presence of two separate tumor nodules does not necessarily mean the cancer is unresectable. We need to carefully evaluate the staging details.
- The tumors are confined to the right lung, with no mention of distant metastases or lymph node involvement. This suggests the cancer may be localized and potentially resectable.
- In localized non-small cell lung cancer, surgery offers the best chance for cure when feasible.
Given the tumor sizes and locations limited to the right lung, surgical resection of the involved lobes (upper and middle) could potentially be curative. A multidisciplinary approach may be optimal, with surgery as the primary treatment modality followed by adjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiation if indicated based on final pathologic staging.
Therefore, the best initial treatment modality for this patient is likely surgery.
Action: Answer("C")
