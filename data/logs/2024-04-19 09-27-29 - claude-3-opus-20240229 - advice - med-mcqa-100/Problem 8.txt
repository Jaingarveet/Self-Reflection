## System:
You are an expert in Medicine.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Advice:
- Carefully consider the context and field-specific meaning of key terms
- Break down complex concepts into their key components
- Differentiate between similar but distinct concepts (probability vs. outcome)
- Consider the purpose and methods of randomization when answering related questions
- If uncertain, mentally walk through the randomization process step-by-step
## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. Randomization is a key principle in scientific experiments and clinical trials. The purpose is to minimize bias and confounding factors.
2. In a randomized experiment, subjects are randomly assigned to different treatment groups. This helps ensure the groups are equivalent and comparable. 
3. The key aspect of randomization is that every subject has an equal probability of being assigned to any given treatment group. The actual group they end up in is determined purely by chance.
4. Importantly, while the probability is known and equal for all subjects, the actual outcome (which group they are assigned to) is unknown until the randomization occurs. The researchers do not decide the assignments.
5. Therefore, randomization implies equal (every subject has same probability) and unknown (the actual assignments are due to chance, not known beforehand) chances of being in any particular group.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
