## System:
You are an expert in Medicine.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Subtopic: Gynaecology & Obstetrics
Question: At 34 weeks multigravida with previous 2 normal delivery has an unstable lie with the present pregnancy. It can be due to:
Choices:
  A: Oligohydramnios
  B: Placenta pre
  C: Pelvic tumor
  D: Uterine anomalies
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Advice:
- Always consider the clinical context when answering questions, including patient history and gestational age.
- Prioritize the most likely diagnoses or causes based on the given scenario.
- Don't assume all options are equally probable; use your clinical judgment to discriminate between choices.
- Brush up on your knowledge of obstetric conditions and their impact on fetal position and stability.
- Eliminate options that are less likely, even if they can potentially contribute to the clinical finding.
- Focus on the most probable cause among the given choices, rather than trying to find a choice that fits all possible causes.
## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The patient is a multigravida at 34 weeks gestation with an unstable lie. This means the fetal position is variable and not consistently longitudinal.
2. Oligohydramnios (decreased amniotic fluid) can allow the fetus more room to move around and change positions, potentially leading to an unstable lie. This is a plausible cause.
3. Placenta previa, where the placenta covers the cervical os, is unlikely to directly cause an unstable lie at this gestational age. The fetus would have less room to move with a previa. This is a less likely cause.
4. A pelvic tumor could limit the space for the fetus and lead to malpresentation or unstable lie, especially later in pregnancy. This is certainly a possibility to consider.
5. Uterine anomalies like bicornuate uterus or septate uterus can lead to abnormal fetal positions throughout pregnancy due to the altered uterine anatomy. This is a very likely cause of unstable lie, especially in the third trimester.
Considering the gestational age, patient's history, and the direct impact of each condition on fetal position, uterine anomalies seem to be the most probable cause among the given choices for this patient's unstable lie at 34 weeks.
Action: Answer("D")
