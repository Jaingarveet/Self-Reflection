Advice:
- Be honest about the limits of your knowledge on a given topic.
- Do not make guesses or assumptions without sufficient evidence.
- It's better to acknowledge uncertainty than to provide a potentially incorrect answer.
- If you lack specific information, say so clearly and directly.

- Remember that it's okay not to know the answer to every question.
## Assistant 2:
I do not have enough specific knowledge to confidently answer the question of when the mental health programme in India was started. The exact year is not a fact I can recall or deduce with certainty based on the information provided.
As an AI system, there are limits to my knowledge on certain topics, especially when it comes to precise historical dates and details about specific programs in particular countries. Without being able to search for or verify this information, I think the most honest and responsible thing for me to do is acknowledge that I do not know the answer.
Rather than guessing between the multiple choice options or trying to reason my way to an answer, I believe it is better to be direct about the gaps in my knowledge on this subject. I apologize that I cannot provide a more definitive response to the question as posed.
## Result:
Agent Answer: None
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
