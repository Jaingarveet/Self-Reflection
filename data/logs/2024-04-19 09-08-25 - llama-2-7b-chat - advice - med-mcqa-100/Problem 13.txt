  Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand the importance of prioritizing the patient's age and symptoms when selecting an investigation. I will take my time and double-check my answer to ensure accuracy.

The investigation of choice for pyloric stenosis in young children under 1 year of age is [REDACTED]. This is because USG and UGI series are not suitable for this age group, and CT and MRI are not recommended due to the risk of radiation exposure and the limited diagnostic yield.

Therefore, the best answer is [REDACTED].
