## System:
You are an expert in Medicine.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Assistant 2:
  Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand now that it is a type of non-probability sampling method called cluster random sampling. In this method, every 10th person is selected from a population, which is not a representative sample of the population.

To answer the question correctly, I will break it down into steps:

Step 1: Understand the question
The question asks for the type of sampling method used in an epidemiological study where every 10th person is selected from a population.

Step 2: Identify the sampling method
Cluster random sampling is a non-probability sampling method where a sample is selected from a population based on clusters or groups rather than a random selection from the entire population.

Step 3: Check the answer
The answer is (D) Cluster random sampling.

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) Cluster random sampling.

Advice:

* Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
* Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
* Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
* Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
* Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
* Remember that the correct answer is the one that best fits the information provided in the question.
