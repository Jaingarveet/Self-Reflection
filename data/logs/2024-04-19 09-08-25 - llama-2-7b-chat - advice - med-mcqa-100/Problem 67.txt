## Assistant 2:
  Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand now that the major complications of cyst-gastrostomy for pseudo pancreatic cyst are infection, obstruction, fistula, and hemorrhage, not fistula and hemorrhage.

To answer this question correctly, I will break it down into simple steps:

Step 1: Identify the problem
The problem is to determine the major complication of cyst-gastrostomy for pseudo pancreatic cyst.

Step 2: Understand the options
The options are:
A: Infection
B: Obstruction
C: Fistula
D: Hemorrhage

Step 3: Analyze each option

A: Infection - This is a possible complication of cyst-gastrostomy, but it is not the major complication.

B: Obstruction - This is also a possible complication of cyst-gastrostomy, but it is not the major complication.

C: Fistula - This is the correct answer. A fistula is a possible complication of cyst-gastrostomy for pseudo pancreatic cyst.

D: Hemorrhage - This is not the major complication of cyst-gastrostomy for pseudo pancreatic cyst.

Therefore, the major complication of cyst-gastrostomy for pseudo pancreatic cyst is C: Fistula.

Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
