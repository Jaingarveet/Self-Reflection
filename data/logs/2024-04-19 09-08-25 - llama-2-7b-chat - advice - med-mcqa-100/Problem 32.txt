I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I need to reassess the case. The patient's symptoms and biopsy findings suggest a possible diagnosis of Wegener's granulomatosis.
Action: Answer("B")

Reflection:
I reflected on my previous answer and realized that I overlooked some crucial information. The patient's symptoms of right-sided nasal obstruction and nasal discharge, sometimes with blood tinges, are consistent with Wegener's granulomatosis. Additionally, the biopsy finding of granulomas in the nasal tissue supports this diagnosis. I should have considered this condition more thoroughly in my initial answer.
