  Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand that I need to be more careful when selecting options. In this case, I chose option A, "Lipase," which is not a correct answer. After re-reading the question, I realized that the correct answer is option D, "ALT."

1. Read the question carefully: I will make sure to read the question thoroughly and understand what is being asked.
2. Eliminate incorrect options: I will use my knowledge of biochemistry to eliminate options that are not relevant to the question. In this case, option B, "ALP," is not related to liver disorders, so I will eliminate it.
