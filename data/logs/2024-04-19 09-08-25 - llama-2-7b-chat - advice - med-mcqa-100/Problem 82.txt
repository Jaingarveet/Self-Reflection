Question: Which of the following is NOT a branch of intracranial part of Internal carotid artery(103 - BDC- 3) 4th edition
Choices:
  A: Anterior communicating
  B: Anterior cerebral
  C: Middle cerebral
  D: Posterior communicating

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand that the posterior communicating artery is not a branch of the intracranial part of the internal carotid artery.

To answer this question correctly, I will break it down into smaller parts:

* The internal carotid artery is a major blood vessel that supplies blood to the brain.
* The intracranial part of the internal carotid artery refers to the portion of the artery that is located within the skull.
* The branches of the intracranial part of the internal carotid artery include the anterior communicating, anterior cerebral, middle cerebral, and posterior communicating arteries.

Using this information, I can eliminate choice D, which is the posterior communicating artery, as it is not a branch of the intracranial part of the internal carotid artery.

Therefore, the correct answer is choice A: Anterior communicating.

Advice:

* Always carefully read and understand the question before answering.
* Break down complex questions into smaller, manageable parts.
* Use visual aids, such as diagrams or images, to help identify the correct answer.
* Double-check your work to ensure accuracy.
* Remember that the posterior communicating artery is not a branch of the IC[REDACTED].
