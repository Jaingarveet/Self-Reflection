Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.

Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas

Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Law
Context: People who are allergic to cats are actually allergic to certain proteins found in the animals' skin secretions and saliva; which particular proteins are responsible, however, varies from allergy sufferer to allergy sufferer. Since all cats shed skin and spread saliva around their environment, there is no such thing as a cat incapable of provoking allergic reactions, although it is common for a given cat to cause an allergic reaction in some-but not all-people who are allergic to cats.
Question: Which one of the following statements is most strongly supported by the information above?
Choices:
  A: Any particular individual will be allergic to some breeds of cat but not to others.
  B: No cat is capable of causing an allergic reaction in all types of allergy sufferers.
  C: Not all cats are identical with respect to the proteins contained in their skin secretions and saliva.
  D: The allergic reactions of some people who are allergic to cats are more intense than the allergic reactions of other allergy sufferers.
  E: There is no way to predict whether a given cat will produce an allergic reaction in a particular allergy sufferer.
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
The passage states: "which particular proteins are responsible, however, varies from allergy sufferer to allergy sufferer." 
This directly implies that cats produce different allergy-causing proteins.
If all cats produced the exact same proteins, the proteins causing an individual's allergies would not vary.
Therefore, not all cats are identical with respect to the proteins in their skin secretions and saliva.
While the passage also supports that no cat causes allergies in everyone, this implication about protein variability in cats is more direct.
## Assistant 2:
You're right, upon further reflection, choice C is most strongly supported by the information provided.
The key sentence is: "which particular proteins are responsible, however, varies from allergy sufferer to allergy sufferer." This directly implies that cats produce different allergy-causing proteins. If all cats had identical proteins, then the specific proteins causing an individual's allergies would not vary between allergy sufferers.
While the passage also suggests that no single cat causes allergies in all sufferers, since "it is common for a given cat to cause an allergic reaction in some-but not all-people who are allergic to cats", the implication about protein variability between cats is more direct and explicit.
Therefore, choice C - "Not all cats are identical with respect to the proteins contained in their skin secretions and saliva" - has the strongest textual support.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
