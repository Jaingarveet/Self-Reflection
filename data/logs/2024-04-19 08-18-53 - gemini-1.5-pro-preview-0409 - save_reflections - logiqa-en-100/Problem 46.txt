## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:** My error stemmed from a misinterpretation of condition (1) and a failure to fully consider all possibilities. I assumed that because H and Y had to be in the same department and couldn't both be in production with F, they must both be in sales. This led me to incorrectly conclude that G couldn't be in sales with them.
**Error Keywords:**
*   Misinterpretation
*   Assumption
*   Incomplete analysis
*   Logic error
## Step-by-Step Solution
1.  **F in Production:** From condition (4), F must be in the production department.
2.  **G not in Production:** From condition (2), G cannot be in the same department as F, so G cannot be in production.
3.  **H and Y Together:** Condition (1) states H and Y must be in the same department. This leaves two possibilities:
    *   **Scenario 1 (Sales):** H and Y are both in sales. This leaves space for one more person in sales and two more in production.
    *   **Scenario 2 (Production):** H and Y are both in production with F. This leaves space for three people in sales.
4.  **Analyzing Scenarios:**
    *   **Scenario 1:** If H and Y are in sales, G could potentially be in sales with them as there is one remaining spot. 
    *   **Scenario 2:** If H and Y are in production, G cannot be in sales as it would violate condition (2) by being in the same department as F. This scenario forces X and W to be in sales due to condition (3) and the remaining available spots. 
5.  **Identifying Unlikely Pair:** Since Scenario 2 is the only one that prevents G from being in sales, the unlikely pair for the sales department is the one that would force Scenario 2 to occur. This is **G and X** because condition (3) dictates that if X is in sales, W must be in production, filling the last spot and forcing H and Y into sales with X.
## Instructions for Future Problems
1.  **Identify Constraints:** Carefully analyze each condition and constraint in the problem.
2.  **Consider All Possibilities:** Don't jump to conclusions or make assumptions. Explore all possible scenarios that satisfy the conditions.
3.  **Evaluate Scenarios:** Analyze each scenario to see which conditions it fulfills and which it violates.
4.  **Eliminate Options:** Based on your analysis, eliminate options that lead to contradictions or violations of the conditions.
5.  **Choose the Answer:** Select the answer that remains possible after considering all scenarios and constraints.
## General Advice
*   **Read Carefully:** Pay close attention to the wording of the problem and conditions.
*   **Break it Down:** Divide complex problems into smaller, manageable steps.
*   **Visualize:** Use diagrams or tables to represent the information and relationships.
*   **Think Step-by-Step:** Avoid making leaps in logic; ensure each step follows logically from the previous one.
*   **Check for Consistency:** Ensure your solution satisfies all conditions and constraints.
*   **Practice:** The more you practice logic problems, the better you will become at identifying patterns and avoiding common errors.
