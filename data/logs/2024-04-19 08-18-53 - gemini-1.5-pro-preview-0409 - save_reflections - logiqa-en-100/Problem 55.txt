## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:** My error stemmed from misinterpreting Rule 6 and overlooking the possibility of G being in the front position. I focused on H being in the front for Team 2, which led me to eliminate options C and D prematurely.
**Error Keywords:**
*   Misinterpretation of rules
*   Overlooking possibilities
*   Logic error
## Step-by-Step Solution
1.  **Analyze Rule 1 & 2:** G or H must be in the front. This eliminates option C (as G is not in the front) but **does not eliminate D**.
2.  **Analyze Rule 4:** P and K cannot be with N. This eliminates option A.
3.  **Analyze Rule 3:** L must be in Team 1. This eliminates option B.
4.  **Analyze Rule 5 & 6:** Since option D has Q in the middle, Rule 6 doesn't apply. Rule 5 is also satisfied as P and Q are not in the same team.
5.  **Conclusion:** Option D remains as the only valid arrangement.
## Instructions for Future Problem Solving
1.  **Carefully read and understand each rule:** Pay close attention to the specific conditions and implications of each rule.
2.  **Consider all possibilities:** Don't fixate on one interpretation or possibility; explore all potential scenarios before eliminating options.
3.  **Apply rules systematically:** Go through each rule and eliminate options that violate them.
4.  **Double-check remaining options:** Ensure the final option satisfies all the given conditions.
## General Advice for Similar Problems
*   **Break down complex problems:** Divide the problem into smaller, manageable parts.
*   **Focus on one rule at a time:** Avoid getting overwhelmed by trying to consider all rules simultaneously.
*   **Visualize the problem:** Use diagrams or other visual aids to represent the information and relationships.
*   **Practice logical reasoning:** Engage in activities that challenge your logical thinking skills.
