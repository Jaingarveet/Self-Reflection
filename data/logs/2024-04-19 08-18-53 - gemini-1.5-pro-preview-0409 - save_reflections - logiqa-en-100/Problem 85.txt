## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:** My error stemmed from misinterpreting the implications of statement (2). I incorrectly assumed that if G is not used, then neither J nor H can be used. However, the statement only specifies that G or H can *only* be used without J, not that the absence of G necessitates the absence of both J and H.
**Error Keywords:**
*   Logical reasoning error
*   Conditional statement misinterpretation
*   Negation inference error 
## Step-by-Step Solution
1. **E is not used (from 4):** This is explicitly stated.
2. **K is not used (from 1 and 3):** If E is not used, then K is not required (1). And if K is not used, then G is also not used (3).
3. **G is not used (from 3 and step 2):** As K is not used, G is also not used.
4. **J is not used (from 2 and step 3):** Since G is not used, and G or H can only be used without J, then J cannot be used.
5. **H may or may not be used:** We have no information to determine the use of H.
Therefore, the only definitive conclusion is that **J is not used, but K is also not used**.
## Instructions for Future Similar Problems
1. **Carefully analyze each statement:** Pay close attention to the specific wording and logical connectors used (e.g., "if...then", "or", "and").
2. **Identify the relationships between statements:**  Look for dependencies and implications between different conditions.
3. **Consider all possible scenarios:** Don't jump to conclusions based on initial assumptions. Explore different possibilities based on the given information.
4. **Use a truth table or diagram if necessary:** For complex problems, visual aids can help clarify the logical connections.
5. **Double-check your reasoning:** Ensure your conclusions are consistent with all the given statements and that you haven't overlooked any possibilities.
## General Advice for Logic Problems
*   **Practice with various logic puzzles and problems:**  This will help you develop your logical reasoning skills and recognize common patterns.
*   **Break down complex problems into smaller parts:** This makes them easier to analyze and understand.
*   **Focus on the structure of the argument:** Identify the premises and conclusions, and evaluate the validity of the reasoning.
*   **Be aware of common logical fallacies:**  Understanding these fallacies will help you avoid making similar mistakes in your reasoning. 
*   **Don't be afraid to revise your initial assumptions:** As you gather more information, be willing to adjust your thinking and conclusions.
