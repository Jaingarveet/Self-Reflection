## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:** My error was assuming that I and E must come after H, limiting the possible arrangements. I failed to consider the possibility of I and E being located between G and F.
**Error Keywords:**
*   Logic error
*   Assumption error
*   Ordering error
**Step-by-Step Solution:**
1.  **G is northernmost:** The order starts with G.
2.  **F is south of G:** From (3), F must come after G. Order is now GF.
3.  **H is south of F:** From (1), H must come after F. Order is now GFH.
4.  **I and E are adjacent:** From (2), I and E are together. They can be placed in three positions:
    *   **South of H:** GFHI, GFHIE (two possibilities as I and E can switch)
    *   **Between G and F:** GIFH, GIEFH (two possibilities as I and E can switch)
**Instructions for Future:**
1.  **Analyze each statement individually:** Break down the given information into separate facts.
2.  **Consider all possibilities:** Don't make assumptions about the order or placement of elements unless explicitly stated.
3.  **Systematically explore placements:** Try placing the remaining elements in all possible valid positions.
4.  **Count distinct arrangements:** Ensure each arrangement is unique and adheres to all given conditions.
**General Advice for Similar Problems:**
*   **Visualize the problem:** Draw diagrams or use objects to represent the elements and their relationships.
*   **Work systematically:** Avoid jumping to conclusions and explore all possibilities in an organized manner.
*   **Check for consistency:** Ensure your solution satisfies all the given conditions and constraints.
*   **Practice similar problems:** The more you practice, the better you become at identifying potential pitfalls and applying logical reasoning.
