## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:**
I focused too much on the mathematical aspect of Premier Wen's statement and the direct implications of a large population. I failed to grasp the underlying message about collective effort and unity.
**Error Keywords:**
*   Misinterpretation 
*   Focus on literal meaning
*   Ignoring figurative language 
**Step-by-Step Solution:**
1.  **Analyze the context:** Premier Wen uses multiplication and division as metaphors.
2.  **Interpret the metaphors:** 
    *   Multiplication: Small problems become big when applied to a large population.
    *   Division: Large totals become small when distributed among a large population.
3.  **Identify the underlying message:** Collective effort (everyone contributing) can overcome large challenges or achieve significant goals.
4.  **Connect to answer choices:** Option D, "Everyone collects firewood and the flame is high," best reflects the idea of collective effort leading to success.
**Instructions for Future:**
1.  **Read the entire passage carefully:** Pay attention to the context and any figurative language used.
2.  **Identify the main point:** Look beyond the literal meaning and consider the underlying message.
3.  **Analyze answer choices in relation to the main point:** Choose the option that best reflects the core message of the passage.
**General Advice:**
*   **Be aware of figurative language:** Metaphors, similes, and other figures of speech can convey deeper meanings.
*   **Consider multiple interpretations:** Don't jump to conclusions based on the literal meaning alone.
*   **Think about the author's intent:** What message are they trying to convey? 
*   **Develop cultural awareness:** Understanding cultural references and context is crucial for accurate interpretation.
