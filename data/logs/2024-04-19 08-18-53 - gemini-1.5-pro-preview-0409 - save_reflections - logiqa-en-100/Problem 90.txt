## Reflection on Logic Problem
**Explanation of Incorrect Answer:**
My reasoning was flawed in assuming the country could find a balance between economic development and social stability. I focused on the immediate impact of social security contributions on competitiveness but failed to consider the long-term consequences of neglecting social security.
**Error Keywords:**
*   Misinterpretation of long-term consequences
*   Overlooking potential instability
*   Incomplete analysis of options
**Step-by-Step Solution:**
1.  **Analyze the conflict:** The context presents a situation where social security contributions are necessary for stability but negatively impact company competitiveness, hindering economic development.
2.  **Evaluate options based on the conflict:**
    *   Option A is incorrect because it assumes no middle ground exists.
    *   Option B is partially correct but doesn't address the core issue of social stability.
    *   **Option C is the correct answer** because neglecting social security would lead to instability, while prioritizing it hinders economic development. The context doesn't offer a solution to this dilemma.
    *   Option D is incorrect because it downplays the severity of the situation, implying only a minor impact on economic development.
**Instructions for Future Similar Problems:**
1.  **Identify the core conflict or dilemma presented in the context.**
2.  **Analyze each option based on how it addresses or resolves the conflict.**
3.  **Consider both the immediate and long-term consequences of each option.**
4.  **Choose the option that most accurately reflects the implications of the presented situation, even if it's not an ideal outcome.**
**General Advice for Logic Problems:**
*   **Read the problem and context carefully, ensuring full comprehension.**
*   **Avoid making assumptions or drawing conclusions not explicitly supported by the information provided.**
*   **Consider all possible interpretations and implications of the context.**
*   **Evaluate each option objectively based on the information given.**
*   **Be aware of common logical fallacies and avoid them in your reasoning.**
