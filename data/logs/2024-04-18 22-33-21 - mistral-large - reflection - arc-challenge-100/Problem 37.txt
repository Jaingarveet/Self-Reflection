## System:
You are an expert in Science.
You have incorrectly answered the following multiple-choice question.
Your task is to reflect on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
You will then use this information help you answer the same question in the future.
First, explain why you answered the question incorrectly.
Second, list the keywords that describe the type of your errors from most general to most specific. 
Third, solve the problem again, step-by-step, based on your knowledge of the correct answer.
Fourth, create a list of detailed instructions to help you correctly solve this problem in the future.
Finally, create a list of general advice to help you solve similar types of problems in the future.  
Be concise in your response; however, capture all of the essential information.  
For guidance, I will provide you with a single generic example problem and reflection (below).

Topic: Geography and Math
Question: What is the product of the number of letters contained in the name of the city where Iowa State University is located multiplied by the number of letters contained in the name of the state?
Choices:
    A: 16
    B: 20
    C: 24
    D: 32
Thought:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
ISU is located in the state of Iowa.
Action: Answer("D")
---
Correct Answer: A
## Assistant 1:
Explanation:
I miscalculated the product of the number of letters in the city and state names. 
The gap in my knowledge was not in geography but in basic arithmetic. 
I knew the correct city and state but made a calculation error.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Arithmetic error
 - Multiplication error
Solution:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
Iowa State University is located in the state of Iowa.
The city name "Ames" contains 4 letters.
The state name "Iowa" contains 4 letters.
The product of 4*4 is 16.
Instructions:
1. Identify the city where the university is located.
2. Identify the state where the university is located.
3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.
4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.
5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.
6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.
7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them.

Topic: Science
Question: Which is not an example of animal instinct?
Choices:
  A: migrating
  B: hibernating
  C: hunting skills
  D: building nests

Thought:
Animal instinct refers to the innate behaviors that animals exhibit without being taught. Migrating, hibernating, hunting skills, and building nests are all examples of animal instinct.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")

However, since I cannot select "None of the Above," I will have to choose one of the available options. In this case, I will choose the option that is least likely to be an example of animal instinct.
Action: Answer("C")

Explanation:
While hunting skills can be an example of animal instinct, they can also be learned behaviors. For example, a mother lion may teach her cubs how to hunt. Therefore, hunting skills are not always an example of animal instinct.

 --- 
Correct Answer: C
## Assistant 2:
Response:
Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I assumed that all the options were examples of animal instinct. However, upon further reflection, I realized that hunting skills can also be learned behaviors, not just instinctual ones.

Error Keywords:
- Assumption error
- Overgeneralization error
- Lack of consideration of alternative explanations

Solution:
Animal instinct refers to the innate behaviors that animals exhibit without being taught. Migrating, hibernating, and building nests are all examples of animal instinct. However, hunting skills can be learned behaviors, not just instinctual ones. For example, a mother lion may teach her cubs how to hunt. Therefore, hunting skills are not always an example of animal instinct.

Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and understand what it is asking.
2. Consider each option and evaluate whether it is an example of animal instinct.
3. Remember that animal instinct refers to innate behaviors that animals exhibit without being taught.
4. Consider whether the behavior could be learned or taught, rather than instinctual.
5. Choose the option that is least likely to be an example of animal instinct.

Advice:
- Always read the question carefully and understand what it is asking.
- Avoid making assumptions about the options.
- Consider alternative explanations for each option.
- Remember that animal instinct refers to innate behaviors that animals exhibit without being taught.
- Consider whether the behavior could be learned or taught, rather than instinctual.
- Choose the option that is least likely to be an example of animal instinct.
