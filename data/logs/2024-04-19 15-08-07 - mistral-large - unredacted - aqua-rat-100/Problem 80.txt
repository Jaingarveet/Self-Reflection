## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I made an incorrect assumption about the cost of the brown sharpeners.
The gap in my knowledge was in understanding the problem statement.
I assumed that the cost of brown sharpeners was 1 rupee, but the problem states that Jack pays 1 rupee more for each white than brown sharpeners.

Error Keywords:
 - Incorrect assumption
 - Misunderstanding of problem statement
 - Misinterpretation of cost difference

Solution:
Let's assume the number of white sharpeners is x and the number of brown sharpeners is y.
We know that x + y = 18 (total number of sharpeners) and x + (x - y) = 100 (total cost of sharpeners).
Solving these equations simultaneously, we get x = 10 and y = 8.

Instructions:
1. Read the problem statement carefully.
2. Identify the variables and their relationships.
3. Set up equations based on the given information.
4. Solve the equations simultaneously.
5. Double-check your calculations and final answer.

Advice:
 - Always read the problem statement carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always identify the variables and their relationships.
 - Always set up equations based on the given information.
 - Always solve the equations simultaneously.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Never make assumptions about the problem statement.
 - Always interpret the problem statement correctly.
 - Always understand the cost difference between two items.
