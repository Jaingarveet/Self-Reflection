Question: A car is being driven, in a straight line and at a uniform speed, towards the base of a vertical tower. The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower?
Choices:
  A: 5(√3 + 1)
  B: 6(√3 + √2)
  C: 7(√3 – 1)
  D: 8(√3 – 2)
  E: None of these

Reflection:

1. Why I answered incorrectly:
I made a calculation error when solving for the time it takes for the car to reach the base of the tower. I incorrectly simplified the expression for time, which led to an incorrect answer.
2. Error keywords:
   - Calculation error
   - Simplification error
   - Trigonometry error
3. Correct solution:
Let's denote the initial distance from the car to the base of the tower as "d" and the height of the tower as "h".
We can use trigonometry to relate the angles of elevation to the distances and height.
When the angle of elevation is 45°, we have tan(45°) = h/d, which simplifies to h = d.
When the angle of elevation is 60°, we have tan(60°) = h/(d - vt), where v is the speed of the car and t is the time it takes for the angle to change from 45° to 60°.
We know that t = 10 minutes and tan(60°) = √3.
Substituting these values, we get √3 = h/(d - 10v).
Since h = d, we can substitute this into the equation to get √3 = d/(d - 10v).
Solving for v, we get v = d/(10 + √3).
Now we want to find the time it takes for the car to travel the remaining distance to the base of the tower, which is d - 10v.
We can use the formula time = distance/speed to find this time.
Substituting the values we have, we get time = (d - 10v)/v = (d - 10d/(10 + √3))/(d/(10 + √3)) = (d(10 + √3) - 10d)/(d/(10 + √3)) = 10(√3 - 1).
Therefore, it will take 10(√3 - 1) minutes for the car to reach the base of the tower.
The correct answer is "C: 7(√3 – 1)".
