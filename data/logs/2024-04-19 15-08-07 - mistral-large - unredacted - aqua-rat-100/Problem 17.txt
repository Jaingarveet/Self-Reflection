Question: What is the product of the number of letters contained in the name of the city where Iowa State University is located multiplied by the number of letters contained in the name of the state?
Choices:
A: 16
B: 20
C: 24
D: 32

Error: Calculation error

---
Correct Answer: A

Explanation:
I miscalculated the product of the number of letters in the city and state names. The gap in my knowledge was not in geography but in basic arithmetic. I knew the correct city and state but made a calculation error.

Error Keywords:

* Calculation error
* Arithmetic error
* Multiplication error

Solution:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames.
Iowa State University is located in the state of Iowa.
The city name "Ames" contains 4 letters.
The state name "Iowa" contains 4 letters.
The product of 4*4 is 16.

Instructions:

1. Identify the city where the university is located.
2. Identify the state where the university is located.
3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.
4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.
5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.
6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.
7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.

Advice:

* Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
* Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
* Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
* Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
* Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
* Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The company produces 420 units of a computer component every month at a production cost of $110 per component. Therefore, the monthly production cost is 420 \* $110 = $46,200.
The company wants to make a yearly profit of at least $626,400. Therefore, the minimum yearly revenue must be $46,200 \* 12 + $626,400 = $1,190,800.
The company sells all of the components by the end of each month. Therefore, the minimum yearly revenue must be equal to the number of components sold per year multiplied by the minimum selling price per component.
The number of components sold per year is 420 \* 12 = 5,040.
Therefore, the minimum selling price per component must be $1,190,800 / 5,040 = $236.27.
The closest answer choice is "E: 280". However, this answer choice is greater than the calculated minimum selling price per component. Therefore, the correct answer must be "D: 260".
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
