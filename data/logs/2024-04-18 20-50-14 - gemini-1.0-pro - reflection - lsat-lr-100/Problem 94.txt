## System:
You are an expert in Law.
You have incorrectly answered the following multiple-choice question.
Your task is to reflect on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
You will then use this information help you answer the same question in the future.
First, explain why you answered the question incorrectly.
Second, list the keywords that describe the type of your errors from most general to most specific. 
Third, solve the problem again, step-by-step, based on your knowledge of the correct answer.
Fourth, create a list of detailed instructions to help you correctly solve this problem in the future.
Finally, create a list of general advice to help you solve similar types of problems in the future.  
Be concise in your response; however, capture all of the essential information.  
For guidance, I will provide you with a single generic example problem and reflection (below).

Topic: Geography and Math
Question: What is the product of the number of letters contained in the name of the city where Iowa State University is located multiplied by the number of letters contained in the name of the state?
Choices:
    A: 16
    B: 20
    C: 24
    D: 32
Thought:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
ISU is located in the state of Iowa.
Action: Answer("D")
---
Correct Answer: A
## Assistant 1:
Explanation:
I miscalculated the product of the number of letters in the city and state names. 
The gap in my knowledge was not in geography but in basic arithmetic. 
I knew the correct city and state but made a calculation error.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Arithmetic error
 - Multiplication error
Solution:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
Iowa State University is located in the state of Iowa.
The city name "Ames" contains 4 letters.
The state name "Iowa" contains 4 letters.
The product of 4*4 is 16.
Instructions:
1. Identify the city where the university is located.
2. Identify the state where the university is located.
3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.
4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.
5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.
6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.
7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them.

Topic: Law
Context: Most auto mechanics have extensive experience. Furthermore, most mechanics with extensive experience understand electronic circuits. Thus, most auto mechanics understand electronic circuits.
Question: The pattern of flawed reasoning in which one of the following arguments is most similar to that in the argument above?
Choices:
  A: During times of the year when automobile traffic increases, gas prices also increase. Increases in gas prices lead to increases in consumer complaints. Thus, increased automobile traffic causes increased consumer complaints.
  B: The most common species of birds in this region are migratory. Moreover, most migratory birds have left this region by the end of November. Hence, few birds remain in this region during the winter.
  C: It is not surprising that most speeding tickets in this region are issued to drivers of sports cars. After all, most drivers who are not interested in driving fast do not buy sports cars.
  D: Most nature photographers find portrait photography boring. Moreover, most portrait photographers especially enjoy photographing dignitaries. Thus, most nature photographers find photographing dignitaries especially boring.
  E: Most snow-removal companies run lawn-care services during the summer. Also, most companies that run lawn-care services during the summer hire additional workers in the summer. Thus, most snow-removal companies hire additional workers in the summer.

Thought: 
The argument in the context is a syllogism with the following structure:
* Premise 1: Most auto mechanics have extensive experience.
* Premise 2: Most mechanics with extensive experience understand electronic circuits.
* Conclusion: Thus, most auto mechanics understand electronic circuits.
The conclusion does not follow logically from the premises. The argument commits the fallacy of affirming the consequent.
Let's analyze the answer choices:
A: This argument also commits the fallacy of affirming the consequent. The conclusion that increased automobile traffic causes increased consumer complaints does not follow logically from the premises.
B: This argument is deductively valid. The conclusion that few birds remain in this region during the winter follows logically from the premises.
C: This argument commits the fallacy of affirming the consequent. The conclusion that most drivers who are not interested in driving fast do not buy sports cars does not follow logically from the premises.
D: This argument commits the fallacy of affirming the consequent. The conclusion that most nature photographers find photographing dignitaries especially boring does not follow logically from the premises.
E: This argument is deductively valid. The conclusion that most snow-removal companies hire additional workers in the summer follows logically from the premises.
Therefore, the pattern of flawed reasoning in the argument above is most similar to that in the argument in choice A.
Action: Answer("A")

 --- 
Correct Answer: E
## Assistant 2:
Response:
Explanation:
I incorrectly identified the pattern of flawed reasoning in the argument. 
I correctly identified the fallacy in the original argument but failed to recognize the same fallacy in the answer choices.
Error Keywords:
 - Affirming the consequent
 - Deductive reasoning
 - Fallacy
Solution:
The argument in the context is a syllogism with the following structure:
* Premise 1: Most auto mechanics have extensive experience.
* Premise 2: Most mechanics with extensive experience understand electronic circuits.
* Conclusion: Thus, most auto mechanics understand electronic circuits.
The conclusion does not follow logically from the premises. The argument commits the fallacy of affirming the consequent.
Let's analyze the answer choices:
A: This argument also commits the fallacy of affirming the consequent. The conclusion that increased automobile traffic causes increased consumer complaints does not follow logically from the premises.
B: This argument is deductively valid. The conclusion that few birds remain in this region during the winter follows logically from the premises.
C: This argument commits the fallacy of affirming the consequent. The conclusion that most drivers who are not interested in driving fast do not buy sports cars does not follow logically from the premises.
D: This argument commits the fallacy of affirming the consequent. The conclusion that most nature photographers find photographing dignitaries especially boring does not follow logically from the premises.
E: This argument is deductively valid. The conclusion that most snow-removal companies hire additional workers in the summer follows logically from the premises.
Therefore, the pattern of flawed reasoning in the argument above is most similar to that in the argument in choice E.
Instructions:
1. Identify the structure of the argument in the context.
2. Determine whether the conclusion follows logically from the premises.
3. Identify the fallacy committed in the argument.
4. Analyze the answer choices to identify the argument with the most similar pattern of flawed reasoning.
5. Choose the answer that matches the argument with the most similar pattern of flawed reasoning.
Advice:
 - Always carefully analyze the structure of the argument.
 - Always determine whether the conclusion follows logically from the premises.
 - Always identify the fallacy committed in the argument.
 - Always carefully analyze the answer choices.
 - Always choose the answer that matches the argument with the most similar pattern of flawed reasoning.
