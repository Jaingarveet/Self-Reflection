## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that the argument was based on the current commute times of Acme employees, when in fact it was based on their future commute times after the move.

Error Keywords:
 - Assumption error
 - Misinterpretation of argument
 - Focus on current situation instead of future situation

Solution:
The argument is based on the future commute times of Acme employees after the move to Ocean View.
The argument assumes that the move will result in most employees having a commute of more than 30 minutes.
The argument does not provide information about the current commute times of Acme employees.
The argument does not provide information about the financial reasons for the move or the opinions of Acme employees.
The argument assumes that the move will not be accompanied by a significant pay raise for Acme employees, as this would potentially allow them to afford housing within a 30-minute commute of Ocean View.

Instructions:
1. Identify the main point of the argument.
2. Determine what assumptions the argument is based on.
3. Consider the information provided in the argument and what it implies.
4. Eliminate answer choices that are not relevant to the argument or are not assumptions.
5. Choose the answer that is a necessary assumption for the argument to be valid.

Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the argument being presented.
 - Always consider the implications of the information provided in the argument.
 - Always focus on the relevant information and ignore irrelevant details.
 - Always eliminate answer choices that are not assumptions or are not relevant to the argument.
 - Always choose the answer that is a necessary assumption for the argument to be valid.
