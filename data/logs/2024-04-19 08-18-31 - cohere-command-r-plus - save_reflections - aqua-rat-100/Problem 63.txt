## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I misinterpreted the question and calculated the answer incorrectly. 
I calculated 30% of 20, but the correct approach was to calculate the total number of matches and then find 30% of that number. 
Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation
- Calculation error
- Percentage error

Solution: 
The team won 20 matches, so they played a total of 100% * 20 matches = 100 matches. 
30% of 100 matches is 0.30 * 100 = 30 matches lost. 
Therefore, the team lost 30 matches, and the correct answer is C.

Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully to understand the given information.
2. Identify the number of matches won and interpret "30% of their matches" as "30% of the total matches played."
3. Calculate the total number of matches played by the team.
4. Calculate the number of matches lost by multiplying the total number of matches by 0.30.
5. Double-check your calculations and ensure they align with the context of the problem.

Advice:
- Always read the question carefully and clarify the meaning of each statement.
- Understand the difference between "30% of X" and "30% of the total," and be mindful of such nuances in the questions.
- Calculate percentages accurately and practice common percentage calculations to improve your speed and accuracy.
