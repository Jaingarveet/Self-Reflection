## Get Reflection:
Explanation: I incorrectly set up the equation to find the man's monthly income. I added his savings to his expenses instead of subtracting them, which led to my incorrect choice of answer "A." 

Error Keywords:
- Algebraic error
- Equation setup error
- Sign error

Solution: 
Let's call the man's monthly income 'x'. 
He saves 12.5% of 'x', which is 0.125x, and this amount is not spent. So, his expenses are Rs. 3500, and his income is x. 

We can set up the equation: 
x - 0.125x = Rs. 3500 

Now, simply solve for x: 
0.875x = Rs. 3500 
x = Rs. 3500 / 0.875 
x = Rs. 4000 

Instructions: 
1. Understand the problem: Identify the given information and what needs to be solved. 
2. Define variables: Let 'x' represent the man's monthly income. 
3. Set up the equation: Subtract his savings (12.5% of income) from his income to get expenses. 
4. Solve the equation: Isolate 'x' to find the value of monthly income. 
5. Choose the correct answer: Select the choice that matches your calculated result. 

Advice: 
 - Always read the question carefully to identify the correct variables and their relationships. 
 - Pay attention to signs and directions (addition, subtraction, etc.). 
 - Double-check your equation setup and ensure it aligns with the problem's logic. 
 - Practice solving similar problems to improve your understanding and accuracy. 
 - Remember that savings are subtracted from income, not added to expenses.
