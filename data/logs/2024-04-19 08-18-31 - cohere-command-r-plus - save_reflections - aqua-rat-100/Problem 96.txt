## Get Reflection:
Explanation: 
I made a calculation error in determining the number of months C joined after B. 
I incorrectly assumed that A and B's profits for 12 months would be equal to their investments multiplied by the total profit divided by the total investment. 
However, I overlooked the fact that A and B had only invested for a portion of the year, and their profits should be calculated proportionally. 
Error Keywords:
- Calculation error
- Proportional reasoning error
- Oversight
Solution: 
Let C join x months after B.
A's profit for the first 2 months = Rs. 40,000 * (2/12) = Rs. 6,667
A's profit for the remaining 10 months = Rs. 40,000 * (10/12) * (375,000/220,000) = Rs. 75,000
A's total profit for the year = Rs. 6,667 + Rs. 75,000 = Rs. 81,667
B's profit for (12-x) months = Rs. 60,000 * (12-x)/12 * (375,000/220,000) = Rs. 75,000 * (12-x)/12
C's profit for x months = Rs. 150,000
Equation: 
A's profit + B's profit + C's profit = Total profit
Rs. 81,667 + Rs. 75,000 * (12-x)/12 + Rs. 150,000 = Rs. 375,000
Simplifying the equation:
Rs. 81,667 + Rs. 6,250 * (12-x) + Rs. 150,000 = Rs. 375,000
Solving for x, we get x = 4
Instructions:
1. Understand the problem: A and B started a business with certain investments, and C joined later with a different investment. They made a total profit at the end of the year, and C received a specific share. The task is to determine the number of months C joined after B.
2. Define variables: Let C join x months after B.
3. Calculate A's profit for the first 2 months and the remaining 10 months separately, as A's investment period is not the same as B and C's.
4. Calculate B's profit for (12-x) months using the formula: B's investment * (12-x)/12 * (total profit/total investment).
5. Write the equation: Sum of A, B, and C's profits equals the total profit.
6. Simplify the equation and solve for x to find the number of months C joined after B.
7. Check your solution: Ensure that the value of x makes sense in the context of the problem.
Advice:
- Read the problem carefully and identify the relevant information.
- Define variables to represent unknown values.
- Consider the different investment periods and calculate profits proportionally.
- Set up and solve equations to find the unknown values.
- Always check your solution to ensure it makes sense in the context of the problem.
