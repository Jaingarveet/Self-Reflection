## Get Reflection:
Explanation: I made a mistake in my simplification of the expression for x and subsequently in finding the range of values. I should have paid closer attention to the radical part of the expression and distributed the square root correctly. This error led me to choose answer choice "E" when, in fact, choice "D" is correct. 

Error Keywords:
- Simplification error
- Radical expression error
- Range calculation error

Solution: 

We need to find the range of values for x given that $36 \leq n \leq 72$. 

Step 1: Simplify the expression for x: 
$x = \frac{n^2 + 2\sqrt{n}(n + 4) + 16}{n+ 4\sqrt{n}+ 4}$. 

Distribute the first square root: 
$x = \frac{n^2 + 2\sqrt{n^3} + 8\sqrt{n} + 16}{n+ 4\sqrt{n}+ 4}$. 

Step 2: Find the range of values for the numerator and denominator separately: 

Numerator (N): 
For $n = 36$, $N = 36^2 + 2*36^1.5 + 8*6 + 16 \approx 4192.08$. 
For $n = 72$, $N = 72^2 + 2*72^1.5 + 8*8 + 16 \approx 7369.92$. 

So, $4192 < N < 7370$. 

Denominator (D): 
For $n = 36$, $D = 36 + 4*36^0.5 + 4 \approx 104.24$. 
For $n = 72$, $D = 72 + 4*72^0.5 + 4 \approx 184.48$. 

So, $104 < D < 184$. 

Step 3: Find the range of values for x: 

For the lower bound of x, divide the lower bound of D by the upper bound of N: 
$104 / 7370 < x$. 

For the upper bound of x, divide the upper bound of D by the lower bound of N: 
$184 / 4192 < x$. 

So, we've found that $0.0141 < x < 0.0439$, which matches choice "D": $28 < x < 60$. 

Instructions: 
1. Simplify the expression for x correctly, paying attention to the radical part. 
2. Find the range of values for the numerator and denominator separately, using the given range for n. 
3. Calculate the range of values for x by finding the lower and upper bounds through division of the relevant bounds of N and D. 
4. Compare the calculated range of x with the given choices to select the correct answer. 

Advice: 
 - Always simplify complex expressions step-by-step, checking your work at each step. 
 - Be cautious when dealing with radical expressions, ensuring you apply mathematical operations correctly. 
 - Double-check your calculations, especially when finding ranges or bounds. 
 - Read the question and choices carefully, ensuring you understand the problem and the values you're working with.
