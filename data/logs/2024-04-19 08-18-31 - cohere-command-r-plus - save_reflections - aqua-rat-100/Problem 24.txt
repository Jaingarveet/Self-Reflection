## Get Reflection:
Explanation: 
I incorrectly assumed that the sum of the remaining scores was zy - 2x, but I did not consider that there are only z - 2 remaining students when excluding the highest and lowest scorers. 
Error Keywords:
 - Assumption error
 - Algebraic error
 - Variable error
Solution: 
The average of the highest and lowest scores is x, so the sum of the highest and lowest scores is 2x. 
Excluding these two scores, we have z - 2 students left in the class. 
The sum of their scores is equal to zy - 2x. 
To find the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers, we divide this sum by the number of students: (zy - 2x) / (z - 2). 
Instructions: 
1. Understand the variables: x = average of highest and lowest scores, y = average of the entire class, z = number of students.
2. Recognize that the sum of the highest and lowest scores is 2x.
3. Calculate the sum of the remaining scores excluding the highest and lowest scorers: zy - 2x.
4. Determine the number of remaining students: z - 2.
5. Find the average score for the remaining students by dividing the sum of their scores by the number of students: ((zy - 2x) / (z - 2)).
6. Ensure your algebraic manipulations are correct and that you are properly applying the order of operations.
Advice: 
 - Always define your variables clearly and understand what they represent.
 - Break down complex problems into simpler steps.
 - Double-check your assumptions and algebraic manipulations.
 - Pay attention to the specific values or variables mentioned in the question, and ensure you are considering all relevant information. 
 - Practice similar problems to improve your familiarity and comfort with these types of algebraic manipulations.
