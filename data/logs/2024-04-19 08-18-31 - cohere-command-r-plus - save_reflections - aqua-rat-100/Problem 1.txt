## Get Reflection:
Explanation: I applied the Pythagorean theorem correctly but made a calculation error in simplifying the square root of 250. I should have calculated $\sqrt{250} = 5\sqrt{10} \approx 15.81$, which is answer choice B. 

Error Keywords:
- Calculation error
- Simplification error
- Estimation error

Solution: The rectangular solid has dimensions $3, 4$, and $15$. The diameter of the sphere is the length of the diagonal of the rectangular solid. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we have:

$$\text{diameter} = \sqrt{3^2 + 4^2 + 15^2} = \sqrt{118} \approx 10.87$$

The correct answer is choice B, approximately $15.81$.

Instructions:
1. Identify the relevant formula: the Pythagorean theorem for the diagonal of a rectangular solid.
2. Plug the dimensions into the formula: $\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}$, where $a, b$, and $c$ are the sides of the rectangular solid.
3. Simplify the square root: $\sqrt{3^2 + 4^2 + 15^2} = \sqrt{118}$.
4. Calculate the square root: $\sqrt{118} \approx 10.87$.
5. Choose the answer choice that matches the calculated value.

Advice:
- Always double-check your calculations, especially when simplifying square roots.
- Practice estimating numerical expressions to identify when a calculated value is unreasonable.
- Be familiar with common square roots and their approximate values.
- Use a calculator for complex calculations to reduce the chance of errors.
