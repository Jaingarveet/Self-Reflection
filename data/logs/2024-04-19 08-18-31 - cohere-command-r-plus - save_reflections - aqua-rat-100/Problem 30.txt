## Get Reflection:
Explanation: 
I correctly calculated the time interval between each tablet consumption but failed to recognize that the question asks for the total time to consume all tablets, not the time interval. 
Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation
- Calculation error
- Arithmetic error
- Multiplication error

Solution: 
The time interval between each tablet consumption is 15 minutes. 
To find the total time to consume all 5 tablets, we recognize that '15 minutes' is a quarter of an hour, and therefore, 5 tablets will take 5 * 15 minutes = 5 * 1/4 hours = 5/4 hours.
Converting this fraction to minutes, we get 5/4 hours * 60 minutes = 75/4 minutes = 18.75 minutes.
So, the correct answer is 75 minutes, or choice E.

Instructions:
1. Understand the question: Identify the given information and the task.
2. Interpret the task: Recognize that the question asks for the total time to consume all tablets, not the time interval.
3. Calculate the total time: Convert the time interval to a fraction of an hour and multiply it by the number of tablets.
4. Convert to minutes: Ensure the final answer is in minutes.
5. Choose the answer: Select the choice that matches your calculated result.

Advice:
- Read the question carefully and understand the task.
- Pay attention to the units and convert them if necessary.
- Double-check your interpretation of the question and identify any potential pitfalls.
- Always double-check your calculations and the final answer.
- Be mindful of common misconceptions and errors, such as confusing time intervals with total time.
