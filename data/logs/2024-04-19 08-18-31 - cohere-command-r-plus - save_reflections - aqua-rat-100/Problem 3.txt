## Get Reflection:
Explanation: 
I made a mistake in calculating the side length of the original square. I correctly found the area of the square but then took the square root of that area to find the side length, which is incorrect. This led me to choose the incorrect answer, as I didn't catch this error. 

Error Keywords:
- Arithmetic error
- Incorrect calculation
- Incorrect application of formulas

Solution: 
Let's break down the problem step by step: 

1. We know that the area of each triangle is $70$ square feet, and we want to find the area of the original square. Since the diagonal cut divides the rectangle into two equal triangles, we know that the area of the rectangle is also $70 \times 2 = 140$ square feet. 

2. Now, we need to find the side length of the original square. The rectangle formed after trimming the square has dimensions $x$ and $x-4$, where $x$ is the side length of the original square. We know that the area of the rectangle is $140$ square feet, so we can set up the equation: 
   $x(x-4) = 140$ 

3. Solving the quadratic equation, we find that $x = 12$. This is the side length of the original square. 

4. To find the perimeter of the square, we multiply the side length by $4$: 
   $4 \times 12 = \text{56 feet}$. 

So, the correct answer is $\text{56 feet}$. 

Instructions: 
1. Calculate the area of the rectangle formed after cutting the square diagonally. 
2. Set up an equation relating the side length of the original square to the area of the rectangle. 
3. Solve the quadratic equation to find the side length of the original square. 
4. Calculate the perimeter of the original square by multiplying the side length by $4$. 
5. Choose the answer option that matches your calculated perimeter. 

Advice: 
 - Pay close attention to the geometric properties of the figures involved. 
 - Take into account the effects of transformations on the figures' properties. 
 - Practice solving quadratic equations to reinforce your understanding of this concept. 
 - Double-check your calculations and ensure you're applying formulas correctly. 
 - Read the question carefully to identify the specific quantity being asked for (area, perimeter, etc.).
