## System:
You are an expert in Law.
You have incorrectly answered the following multiple-choice question.
Your task is to reflect on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
You will then use this information help you answer the same question in the future.
First, explain why you answered the question incorrectly.
Second, list the keywords that describe the type of your errors from most general to most specific. 
Third, solve the problem again, step-by-step, based on your knowledge of the correct answer.
Fourth, create a list of detailed instructions to help you correctly solve this problem in the future.
Finally, create a list of general advice to help you solve similar types of problems in the future.  
Be concise in your response; however, capture all of the essential information.  
For guidance, I will provide you with a single generic example problem and reflection (below).

Topic: Geography and Math
Question: What is the product of the number of letters contained in the name of the city where Iowa State University is located multiplied by the number of letters contained in the name of the state?
Choices:
    A: 16
    B: 20
    C: 24
    D: 32
Thought:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
ISU is located in the state of Iowa.
Action: Answer("D")
---
Correct Answer: A
## Assistant 1:
Explanation:
I miscalculated the product of the number of letters in the city and state names. 
The gap in my knowledge was not in geography but in basic arithmetic. 
I knew the correct city and state but made a calculation error.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Arithmetic error
 - Multiplication error
Solution:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
Iowa State University is located in the state of Iowa.
The city name "Ames" contains 4 letters.
The state name "Iowa" contains 4 letters.
The product of 4*4 is 16.
Instructions:
1. Identify the city where the university is located.
2. Identify the state where the university is located.
3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.
4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.
5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.
6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.
7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them.

Topic: Law
Context: A panel of five scientists will be formed. The panelists will be selected from among three botanists—F, G, and H—three chemists—K, L, and M—and three zoologists—P, Q, and R. Selection is governed by the following conditions: The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types. If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. F and K cannot both be selected. K and M cannot both be selected. If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
Question: If four of the scientists selected are F, L, Q, and R, which one of the following must be the fifth scientist selected?
Choices:
  A: G
  B: H
  C: K
  D: M
  E: P

Thought:
We know that F, L, Q, and R are selected.
We know that at least one scientist of each type must be selected. Since F is a botanist, we don't need to select another botanist.
We know that if more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. Since we already have one zoologist (Q), we cannot select another zoologist.
We know that F and K cannot both be selected. So, K cannot be selected.
We know that K and M cannot both be selected. So, M cannot be selected.
We know that if M is selected, both P and R must be selected. Since M is not selected, we don't need to select P and R.
Therefore, the fifth scientist selected must be a chemist. The only chemist remaining is H.
Action: Answer("B")

 --- 
Correct Answer: E
## Assistant 2:
Response:
Explanation:
My initial analysis was correct up to the point where I concluded that M could not be selected. I overlooked the fact that if M is not selected, then P and R must also not be selected. This oversight led me to incorrectly conclude that H must be the fifth scientist selected.
Error Keywords:
- Overlooking a condition
- Incomplete analysis
- Incorrect conclusion
Solution:
1. Identify the scientists who are already selected: F, L, Q, and R.
2. Verify that at least one scientist of each type is selected: F (botanist), L (chemist), and Q (zoologist).
3. Apply the condition that if more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. Since only one botanist (F) is selected, we can select another zoologist.
4. Apply the condition that F and K cannot both be selected. K is not selected.
5. Apply the condition that K and M cannot both be selected. M is not selected.
6. Apply the condition that if M is selected, both P and R must be selected. Since M is not selected, P and R are not selected.
7. Identify the remaining scientists: G (botanist), H (chemist), and P (zoologist).
8. Choose the scientist who satisfies the remaining conditions: P (zoologist).
Instructions:
1. Carefully read and understand all conditions.
2. Identify the scientists who are already selected.
3. Verify that the minimum requirement for each type of scientist is met.
4. Apply the conditions related to the selection of multiple scientists of the same type.
5. Apply the conditions related to the selection of specific pairs of scientists.
6. Identify the remaining scientists who satisfy all conditions.
7. Choose the scientist who fulfills the remaining requirements.
Advice:
- Pay close attention to all conditions and their implications.
- Break down the problem into smaller steps to avoid overlooking any details.
- Carefully consider all possible scenarios and eliminate options that violate any conditions.
- Double-check your analysis and reasoning before making a final decision.
- Be mindful of potential biases or assumptions that might influence your thinking.
