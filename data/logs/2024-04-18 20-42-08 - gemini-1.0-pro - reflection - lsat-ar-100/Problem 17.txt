I knew the correct city and state but made a calculation error.
Error Keywords:

Topic: Law
Context: On each of exactly seven consecutive days (day 1 though day 7), a pet shop features exactly one of three breeds of kitten—Himalayan, Manx, Siamese—and exactly one of three breeds of puppy—Greyhound, Newfoundland, Rottweiler. The following conditions must apply: Greyhounds are featured on day 1. No breed is featured on any two consecutive days. Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7. Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1. Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.
Question: If Himalayans are not featured on day 7, then which one of the following pairs of days CANNOT feature both the same breed of kitten and the same breed of puppy?
Choices:
  A: day 1 and day 3
  B: day 2 and day 6
  C: day 3 and day 5
  D: day 4 and day 6
  E: day 5 and day 7

Thought:
Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.
Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.
Greyhounds are featured on day 1.
No breed is featured on any two consecutive days.
Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7.
Therefore, Himalayans are featured on days 2, 4, and 6.
Rottweilers are featured on days 1, 3, and 5.
Greyhounds are featured on day 1.
Newfoundlands are featured on days 2, 4, and 6.
Siamese are featured on days 3, 5, and 7.
Action: Answer("E")

Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.
Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.
Greyhounds are featured on day 1.

Greyhounds are featured on day 1.
Newfoundlands are featured on days 2, 4, and 6.
Siamese are featured on days 3, 5, and 7.

2. Identify the days on which each breed of kitten and puppy is featured.
3. Check each pair of days to see if they violate any of the conditions.
