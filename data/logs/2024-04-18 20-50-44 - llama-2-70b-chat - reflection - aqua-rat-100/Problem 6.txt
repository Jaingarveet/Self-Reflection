The gap in my knowledge was not in geography but in basic arithmetic. 
I knew the correct city and state but made a calculation error.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Arithmetic error
 - Multiplication error
Solution:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
Iowa State University is located in the state of Iowa.
The city name "Ames" contains 4 letters.

Question: A company contracts to paint 3 houses. Mr.Brown can paint a house in 6 days while Mr.Black would take 8 days and Mr.Blue 12 days. After 8 days Mr.Brown goes on vacation and Mr. Black begins to work for a period of 6 days. How many days will it take Mr.Blue to complete the contract?
Choices:
  A: 7
  B: 8
  C: 10
  D: 11
  E: 12

  Let's break this down step by step:

1. Mr. Brown paints a house in 6 days, so he can paint 3 houses in 3 x 6 = 18 days.
2. Mr. Brown goes on vacation after 8 days, so he has painted 3 houses in 8 days.
3. Mr. Black starts working after 8 days, so he has 18 - 8 = 10 days to paint 3 houses.
4. Mr. Black can paint a house in 8 days, so he can paint 3 houses in 3 x 8 = 24 days.
5. Since Mr. Black has 10 days to paint 3 houses, he will finish in 10 days.
