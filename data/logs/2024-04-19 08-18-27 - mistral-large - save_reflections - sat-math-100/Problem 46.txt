## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I misunderstood the impact of removing the outlier on the range.
The gap in my knowledge was not in understanding the definitions of mean, median, and range, but in understanding how removing an outlier affects each of these measures.
I knew the correct definitions of mean, median, and range, but made an error in my analysis of how removing the outlier would affect each measure.

Error Keywords:
 - Misunderstanding of outlier impact
 - Analysis error
 - Range calculation error

Solution:
The mean is the average of the data set, and it is calculated by adding up all the values and dividing by the number of values. Removing the outlier of 24 inches will decrease the sum of the values, and therefore decrease the mean.
The median is the middle value of the data set when it is arranged in order. Since there are 21 values, the median is the 11th value. Removing the outlier of 24 inches will not change the median, since it is not the 11th value.
The range is the difference between the largest and smallest values in the data set. Removing the outlier of 24 inches will decrease the range, since it is the largest value.
The correct answer is C, because removing the outlier will have the greatest impact on the range.

Instructions:
1. Identify the mean, median, and range of the original data set.
2. Remove the outlier from the data set.
3. Calculate the mean, median, and range of the new data set.
4. Compare the mean, median, and range of the original data set to the new data set.
5. Determine which measure has changed the most.
6. Choose the answer that corresponds to the measure that has changed the most.

Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that removing an outlier can have a significant impact on the range, but may not have as much of an impact on the mean or median.
 - Always consider the impact of outliers on each measure when analyzing data.
