## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I misinterpreted the problem and did not correctly set up the equation to represent the situation.

Error Keywords:
 - Misinterpretation
 - Incorrect equation setup

Solution:
The initial payment of $60 is subtracted from the total price of $300, leaving $240 to be paid in weekly installments of $30.
The equation to find the number of weekly payments, w, is $240 = 30w.
However, this is not one of the available choices.
The correct equation is $300 = 30w + 60, which can be rearranged to $240 = 30w.

Instructions:
1. Read the problem carefully and understand the situation.
2. Identify the variables and their relationships.
3. Set up an equation to represent the situation.
4. Solve the equation for the desired variable.
5. Check that the solution makes sense in the context of the problem.
6. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.

Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember to correctly set up the equation to represent the situation.
 - Be careful with signs and operations when setting up the equation.
 - Always check that the solution makes sense in the context of the problem.
