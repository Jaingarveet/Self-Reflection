# Model: mistral-large | Task: save_reflection | Exam: sat-math-100 | Problem 2 of 100
## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I made an error in combining like terms.
The gap in my knowledge was in algebraic manipulation.
I knew the correct process but made a calculation error.

Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Algebraic manipulation error
 - Combining like terms error

Solution:
First, distribute the negative sign to the terms inside the second set of parentheses:
$$\left(x^{2} y-3 y^{2}+5 x y^{2}\right)-\left(-x^{2} y+3 x y^{2}-3 y^{2}\right)$$
$$=x^{2} y-3 y^{2}+5 x y^{2}+x^{2} y-3 x y^{2}+3 y^{2}$$
Next, combine like terms:
$$=2 x^{2} y+2 x y^{2}$$

Instructions:
1. Distribute the negative sign to the terms inside the second set of parentheses.
2. Combine like terms.
3. Work step-by-step through your algebraic manipulations.
4. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
5. Choose the answer that matches your simplified expression.

Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that combining like terms involves adding or subtracting terms with the same variables raised to the same powers.
