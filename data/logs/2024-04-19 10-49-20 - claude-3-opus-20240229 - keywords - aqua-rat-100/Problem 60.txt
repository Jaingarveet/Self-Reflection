## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Assistant 2:
Okay, let me think through this step-by-step:
1) We know minor arc AC is 160°. Since B bisects minor arc AC, that means minor arcs AB and BC are each 160°/2 = 80°.
2) We also know minor arc BD is 150°. Since minor arc BC is 80°, that means minor arc CD must be 150° - 80° = 70°. 
3) To find the measure of minor arc AD, we need to add the measures of minor arcs AB and CD. That's 80° + 70° = 150°.
So the measure of minor arc AD is 150°.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
