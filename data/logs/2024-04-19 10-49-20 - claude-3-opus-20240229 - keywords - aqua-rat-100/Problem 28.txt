## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) Let P(A) be the probability Stock A increases, and P(B) the probability Stock B increases.
   We're given P(A) = 0.56 and P(B) = 0.74.
2) We want to find the probability that neither stock increases. Call this event "N". 
   So we're looking for the maximum possible value of P(N).
3) If the stocks were independent, then P(N) would simply be:
   P(N) = (1 - P(A)) * (1 - P(B)) 
        = (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.74)
        = 0.44 * 0.26 
        = 0.1144
4) However, the problem does not state the stocks are independent. If they are dependent, P(N) could be higher.
5) The maximum possible value for P(N) is the smaller of (1 - P(A)) and (1 - P(B)). 
   This would occur if the stocks were perfectly correlated - i.e. Stock B increases if and only if Stock A increases.
6) 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.56 = 0.44
   1 - P(B) = 1 - 0.74 = 0.26
   The smaller of these is 0.26.
Therefore, the maximum possible value for the probability that neither stock increases is 0.26.
Action: Answer("B")
