## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) There are x pickets, each 1/2 inch wide. So the total width of all the pickets is:
   x * (1/2) inches
2) There are x-1 spaces between the pickets (since spaces are only between pickets, not on the ends). Each space is 6 inches wide. So the total width of all the spaces is: 
   (x-1) * 6 inches
3) To get the total length of the fence, we add the width of the pickets and the spaces:
   Total length = x * (1/2) + (x-1) * 6 inches
                = (1/2)x + 6x - 6 inches
                = (13/2)x - 6 inches
4) We need to convert to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so we divide by 12:
   ((13/2)x - 6) / 12 feet
   = (13x - 12) / 24 feet
5) This matches choice E.
Action: Answer("E")
