Question: A car is being driven, in a straight line and at a uniform speed, towards the base of a vertical tower. The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower?
Choices:
  A: 5(√3 + 1)
  B: 6(√3 + √2)
  C: 7(√3 – 1)
  D: 8(√3 – 2)
  E: None of these

## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) Let the height of the tower be h and the distance of the car from the base of the tower at the start be x.
2) After 10 minutes, using the tangent ratio in a right-angled triangle:
   tan 45° = h/x
   1 = h/x
   x = h
   tan 60° = h/(x-distance traveled in 10 min)
   √3 = h/(x-10v), where v is the uniform speed of the car.
3) From (2), h = x = x-10v
   Therefore, 10v = x(1-1/√3)
4) Let the additional time to reach the base be t.
   Then, x = vt
   Substituting in (3),
   10v = vt(1-1/√3)
   10 = t(1-1/√3)
   t = 10/(1-1/√3)
5) Simplifying the denominator:
   (1-1/√3) = (√3-1)/√3 = (√3-1)(√3+1)/(√3(√3+1)) = (3-1)/(√3(√3+1)) = 2/(√3(√3+1))
6) Therefore, t = 10/(2/(√3(√3+1))) = 5(√3(√3+1)) = 5(√3+1)
Action: Answer("A")
