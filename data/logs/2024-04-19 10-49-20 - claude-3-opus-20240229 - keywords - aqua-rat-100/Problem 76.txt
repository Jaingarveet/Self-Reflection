## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step to make sure we get the right answer this time:
1) The given range for n is 36 ≤ n ≤ 72. Let's consider the lower and upper bounds of n.
2) When n = 36:
   x = (36^2 + 2√36(36 + 4) + 16) / (36 + 4√36 + 4)
     = (1296 + 2*6*40 + 16) / (36 + 24 + 4)
     = (1296 + 480 + 16) / 64
     = 1792 / 64 
     = 28
3) When n = 72:
   x = (72^2 + 2√72(72 + 4) + 16) / (72 + 4√72 + 4)
     = (5184 + 2*8.485*76 + 16) / (72 + 33.941 + 4)  [using calculator for √72]
     = (5184 + 1289.76 + 16) / 109.941
     = 6489.76 / 109.941
     = 59.03
4) So when n ranges from 36 to 72, x ranges from 28 to approximately 59.
Looking at the choices, the best match is:
D: 28 < x < 60
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
