## Assistant 2:
Okay, let me think through this step-by-step:
1. Let's define some variables:
   - Let n be the number of matches played before the final
   - Let x be Sachin's total runs before the final
2. We know Sachin's batting average before the final is 51. Batting average is total runs divided by number of matches. So:
   51 = x/n
3. After the final, he has played n+1 matches (the n matches before plus the final).
   His total runs are now x+78 (his runs before plus the 78 he scored in the final).
   His new average is 54. So:
   54 = (x+78)/(n+1)
4. From step 2, we can get x = 51n
   Substituting this into the equation from step 3:
   54 = (51n+78)/(n+1)
5. Now solve this equation for n:
   54(n+1) = 51n+78
   54n + 54 = 51n + 78
   3n = 24
   n = 8
6. Therefore, Sachin played 8 matches before the final, and 9 matches total including the final.
Action: Answer("C")
