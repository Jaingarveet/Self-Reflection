## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) There are 3 children and 3 chairs. This is an arrangement problem, so we need to consider the order.
2) One key constraint is that Susan must be to the left of Tim. This means Susan and Tim can't be in all possible arrangements relative to each other.
3) Let's consider the possible positions for Susan:
   - Susan could be in the leftmost chair
   - Susan could be in the middle chair
   But Susan can't be in the rightmost chair, because then she wouldn't be to the left of Tim.
4) If Susan is in the leftmost chair, then there are two possibilities:
   - Susan, Tim, Zen
   - Susan, Zen, Tim
5) If Susan is in the middle chair, there's only one possibility:
   - Tim, Susan, Zen
   This is because Susan must be to the left of Tim, so Tim must be in the leftmost chair in this case.
6) Adding up the possibilities:
   2 possibilities with Susan in the leftmost chair
   + 1 possibility with Susan in the middle chair
   = 3 total possibilities
Therefore, there are 3 ways to arrange the children under these constraints.
