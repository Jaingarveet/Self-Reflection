## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: Amy is organizing her bookshelves and finds that she has 10 different types of books. She then codes each book with either a single letter or a pair of two different letters. If each type of book is uniquely represented by either a single letter or pair of letters, what is the smallest number of letters Amy will need to create the codes for all 10 types of books? (Assume the order of letters in a pair does not matter.)
Choices:
  A: 3
  B: 4
  C: 5
  D: 10
  E: 20

## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) If Amy uses only single letters, she would need 10 letters to uniquely code each type of book. 
2) However, Amy can also use pairs of two different letters. The number of ways to select 2 letters from n letters is given by the combination formula:
   
   $\binom{n}{2} = \frac{n!}{2!(n-2)!} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}$
3) Let's start with the smallest possible number of letters and see if it's enough:
   If n = 3: 
   Single letter codes: 3
   Two-letter codes: $\binom{3}{2} = \frac{3*2}{2} = 3$
   Total codes: 3 + 3 = 6 (not enough)
   If n = 4:
   Single letter codes: 4  
   Two-letter codes: $\binom{4}{2} = \frac{4*3}{2} = 6$
   Total codes: 4 + 6 = 10 (just enough!)
4) Therefore, the smallest number of letters needed is 4.
Action: Answer("B")
