## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step to make sure we get the right answer this time.
Given:
- If Arjun gives $30 to Sajal, Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun. 
- If Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal.
Let's define variables:
Let x = Arjun's money
Let y = Sajal's money
From the first condition:
y + 30 = 2(x - 30)
y + 30 = 2x - 60
y = 2x - 90 ... (1)
From the second condition: 
x + 10 = 3(y - 10)
x + 10 = 3y - 30
x = 3y - 40 ... (2)
Substituting (1) into (2):
x = 3(2x - 90) - 40
x = 6x - 270 - 40
x = 6x - 310
-5x = -310
x = 62
Substituting x = 62 into (1):
y = 2(62) - 90
y = 124 - 90
y = 34
Therefore, Arjun has $62 and Sajal has $34.
Action: Answer("B")
