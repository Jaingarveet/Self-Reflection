## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) The question states there are more than 501 students. So the minimum number of students will be the smallest number greater than 501 that satisfies the other constraints.
2) 20% of students took physics and 28% took math. Importantly, these percentages are exact, meaning no student took both. 
3) So in total, 20% + 28% = 48% of students took either physics or math. 
4) For these to be exact percentages, the number of students must be divisible by 100. (Because 1% of the total needs to be a whole number of students).
5) Looking at the answer choices, 600 is the smallest number greater than 501 that is divisible by 100.
6) Let's check if 600 works: 
   20% of 600 is 120 students taking physics.
   28% of 600 is 168 students taking math.
   120 + 168 = 288 total taking either, which is indeed 48% of 600.
Therefore, 600 is the least number of students that satisfies all the constraints.
