## System:
You are an expert in Logic.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

## User 2:
Topic: Logic
Context: The Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge, built in 1968, has a clear height of 24 meters in the Fengshui area.Theoretically, it can pass a maximum of 3,000 tons of ships.Today, with the rapid economic development, it has become a building that “cuts the waist” of the Yangtze River waterway and hinders the passage of giant ships.A bridge expert asserted that the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge must be demolished and rebuilt in order to dredge the golden waterways of the Yangtze River completely.
Question: If any of the following is true, can you raise the most doubts about this expert's point of view?
Choices:
  A: Due to the inability of large ships to pass through the Nanjing Bridge, a large number of exported goods in the middle and upper reaches of the Yangtze River can only be taken by road or railway.
  B: 99% of international ships entering the Yangtze River are moored at ports below the Nanjing Bridge, and dozens of foreign trade terminals above Nanjing rarely have large external ships berthed.
  C: It is not enough to dismantle only the Nanjing Bridge.The Yangtze River Bridge, which was built in Wuhu, Tongling, Anqing and other places, has a clear height of 24 meters.
  D: Shipbuilding technology is highly developed, and 8000-ton ships designed for adapting to the passage of the Yangtze River abroad have passed through Nanjing to Wuhan.
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I didn't consider the possibility of ships being designed to adapt to the current height of the bridge. I focused on the current traffic of large ships, rather than considering the potential for technological solutions.
Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation
- Overlooking information
- Technological solutions
Solution:
The expert's point of view is that the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge must be demolished and rebuilt to allow for the passage of larger ships. However, if shipbuilding technology is highly developed and 8000-ton ships designed for adapting to the passage of the Yangtze River abroad have passed through Nanjing to Wuhan, this would raise doubts about the necessity of demolishing and rebuilding the bridge. This suggests that it is possible to design ships that can navigate the river without the need for altering the bridge.
Instructions:
1. Understand the expert's point of view.
2. Evaluate each option in relation to the expert's point of view.
3. Consider the implications of each option.
4. Look for options that challenge the necessity or validity of the expert's point of view.
5. Consider technological advancements or solutions that could negate the need for the proposed action.
6. Choose the answer that raises the most doubts about the expert's point of view.
Advice:
- Always read the question and options carefully.
- Consider all possible implications of each option.
- Don't overlook the potential for technological solutions.
- Always challenge the necessity or validity of the proposed action.
- Consider the broader context and potential future developments.
