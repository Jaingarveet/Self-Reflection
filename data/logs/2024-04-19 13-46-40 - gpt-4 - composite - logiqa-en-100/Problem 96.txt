Context: Based on the following questions? Most people think that advertisers do whatever they can to attract customers.But advertisers are not always like this.Recently, in order to expand sales, a family magazine called "Bay" was renamed "Inferno", which mainly published violent and pornographic content.As a result, some perennial advertisers from the original "Bay" magazine refused to renew the contract and turned to other publications.This shows that these advertisers not only consider economic benefits, but also take into account their ethical responsibilities.
Question: If the following item is true, can the argument be strengthened most?
Choices:
  A: The cost and selling price of "Inferno" are lower than that of "Harbour".
  B: The above advertisers who refused to renew their contracts have not affected the benefits after switching to other publications.
  C: Readers of family magazines are generally not interested in violent and pornographic content.
  D: Some clients who advertise in other family magazines and so on turn to "Inferno" magazine.

Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misunderstood the context of the argument. I thought the argument was about advertisers prioritizing ethics over profits, but it was actually about advertisers considering both ethics and profits. 
Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation
- Contextual understanding
- Argument analysis
Solution:
The argument is about advertisers considering their ethical responsibilities along with economic benefits. The choice that strengthens this argument would be one that further shows advertisers considering both aspects. 
Option [REDACTED]: "[REDACTED]" This strengthens the argument because it shows that some advertisers are willing to advertise in "Inferno" despite its content, suggesting they are considering both their ethical responsibilities and economic benefits.

2. Identify what the argument is about.
3. Understand what each choice implies.
