Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I misunderstood the second condition, which states that the finance department is on the next floor of the planning department. I interpreted this as the finance department being above the planning department, but it could also mean that the finance department is below the planning department. This led to an incorrect arrangement of the departments.
Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation
- Logical reasoning error
- Order arrangement error
Solution:
Given the conditions:
1) The human resources department and the sales department are not adjacent.
2) The finance department is on the next floor of the planning department.
3) The administrative department is above the planning department but below the human resources department.
From these conditions, we can deduce that:
- The finance department and planning department must be adjacent, but the finance department could be either above or below the planning department.
- The administrative department must be above the planning department but below the human resources department.
- The human resources department cannot be adjacent to the sales department.
By trying different arrangements, we find that the only arrangement that satisfies all conditions is: [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Understand the conditions given in the problem.
2. Identify the constraints for each department's position.
3. Try different arrangements based on the constraints.
4. Check each arrangement to see if it satisfies all conditions.
5. Choose the arrangement that satisfies all conditions.
Advice:
- Always read and understand the conditions carefully.
- Be aware that words like "next" can mean either above or below.
- Try different arrangements if the first one doesn't work.
- Check each arrangement carefully to make sure it satisfies all conditions.
- Practice more problems to improve your logical reasoning skills.
