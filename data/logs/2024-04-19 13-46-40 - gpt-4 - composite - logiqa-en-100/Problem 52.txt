Topic: Logic
Context: The money earned by the employees of an enterprise is a wage that is included in the cost, and the money earned by the boss is a profit that is not included in the cost.If the cost is high, the profit is low, and if the profit is high, the cost is low.
Question: If the above statement is true, which of the following conclusions is most strongly supported?
Choices:
  A: Employees hold shares in the enterprise, and there is a conflict of interest with the boss.
  B: If the employee holds shares in the enterprise, there is no conflict in the interests of the boss and the employee.
  C: If the employee does not have shares in the enterprise, the boss and the employee will have conflicts of interest.
  D: The boss always makes more money than the employees.
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I failed to infer the implicit conflict of interest between the boss and the employees based on the information provided. The statement implies that the boss's profit and the employees' wages are inversely related, which suggests a potential conflict of interest if the employees do not hold shares in the enterprise.
Error Keywords:
- Inference error
- Logic error
- Interpretation error
Solution:
The statement implies that the boss's profit and the employees' wages are inversely related. This suggests a potential conflict of interest between the boss and the employees. If the employees do not hold shares in the enterprise, they would not benefit from the boss's profit, which could lead to conflicts of interest. Therefore, the conclusion most strongly supported by the statement is "[REDACTED]"
Instructions:
1. Read the statement carefully and understand the relationship between the variables.
2. Identify the implicit implications of the statement.
3. Evaluate each conclusion based on the information and implications of the statement.
4. Choose the conclusion that is most strongly supported by the statement.
Advice:
- Always read the statement carefully and understand the relationship between the variables.
- Try to infer the implicit implications of the statement.
- Evaluate each conclusion based on the information and implications of the statement, not on external assumptions.
- Choose the conclusion that is most strongly supported by the statement, even if it is not explicitly stated.
