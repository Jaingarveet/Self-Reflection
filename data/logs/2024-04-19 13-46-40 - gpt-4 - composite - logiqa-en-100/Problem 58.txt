Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misunderstood the relationship between the percentage increase in housing prices and land prices. I assumed that any increase in land prices, no matter how small, would support the assertion that rising land prices are the main cause of soaring housing prices. However, in choice [REDACTED], the increase in residential prices is significantly larger than the increase in land prices, which casts doubt on the assertion.
Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation
- Percentage comparison
- Cause and effect relationship
Solution:
The assertion is that rising land prices are the main cause of soaring housing prices. 
In choice [REDACTED], residential prices in Beijing increased by 7.2% in the first quarter of 2005 compared with the same period last year, but residential land prices only rose by 0.37%. This small increase in land prices compared to the larger increase in housing prices casts doubt on the assertion that rising land prices are the main cause of soaring housing prices.
Instructions:
1. Understand the assertion or claim made in the question.
2. Analyze each choice and determine whether it supports or contradicts the assertion.
3. Pay attention to the percentage increase in both housing prices and land prices.
4. If the increase in housing prices is significantly larger than the increase in land prices, this casts doubt on the assertion that rising land prices are the main cause of soaring housing prices.
5. Choose the answer that most contradicts the assertion.
Advice:
- Always read the question and choices carefully.
- Understand the assertion or claim made in the question.
- Analyze the relationship between different variables in the choices.
- Pay attention to the percentage comparison between different variables.
- Understand the cause and effect relationship.

In choice B, residential prices in Beijing increased by 7.2% in the first quarter of 2005 compared with the same period last year, but residential land prices only rose by 0.37%. This small increase in land prices compared to the larger increase in housing prices casts doubt on the assertion that rising land prices are the main cause of soaring housing prices.
