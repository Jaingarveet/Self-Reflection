Topic: Logic
Context: A company has six general manager assistants F, G, H, I, M and P, and three departments, each of which is in charge of three general manager assistants.Each assistant general manager is in charge of at least one department.The following conditions must be met? (1) There is only one assistant to the general manager in charge of three departments at the same time.(2) F and G are not in charge of the same department.(3) H and I are not in charge of the same department.
Question: If F and M are not in charge of the same department, which of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: F and H are in charge of the same department.
  B: F and I are in charge of the same department.
  C: I and P are in charge of the same department.
  D: M and G are in charge of the same department.
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that since F, H, and I each manage a department alone, the remaining assistants (G, M, P) must share the remaining department. However, I overlooked the fact that one assistant can manage all three departments, which changes the distribution of management.
Error Keywords:
- Assumption error
- Distribution error
- Logic error
Solution:
Given that F and M are not in charge of the same department, and F and G are not in charge of the same department, F must be in charge of a department alone. Similarly, since H and I are not in charge of the same department, one of them must be in charge of a department alone. However, one assistant can manage all three departments. If F, H, and I each manage a department alone, the assistant managing all three departments must be either G, M, or P. This leaves two assistants to share the remaining department. Since F, G, H, and M each manage a department alone, the only possible pair left to share a department is I and P.
Instructions:
1. Identify the constraints given in the problem.
2. Determine the distribution of management based on these constraints.
3. Consider all possible scenarios, including one assistant managing all departments.
4. Identify the assistants who must manage a department alone.
5. Determine the remaining assistants who must share a department.
6. Choose the answer that matches your determined distribution.
Advice:
- Always read the question carefully and understand the constraints.
- Consider all possible scenarios, not just the most obvious ones.
- Be careful with distribution problems; ensure all possibilities are considered.
- Double-check your logic and final answer.
