Topic: Logic
Context: The problem faced by a developing country is that to maintain its economic development, it must constantly strengthen the competitiveness of domestic enterprises; to maintain social stability, it must constantly establish and improve social security systems such as pensions, medical care, and unemployment.To establish and improve the social security system, enterprises need to pay a certain percentage of social insurance premiums for employees every year.If an enterprise pays such a proportion of social insurance premiums for employees every year, it will reduce the competitiveness of the enterprise.
Question: Which of the following conclusions can be derived from the above statement?
Choices:
  A: This country can either maintain its economic development or maintain its social stability.
  B: If we reduce the proportion of companies paying social insurance premiums for employees each year, we can maintain the competitiveness of the company.
  C: This country cannot maintain its economic development or maintain its social stability.
  D: The economic development of this country will be affected to a certain extent.
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misinterpreted the implications of the statement. I assumed that the country could still maintain its economic development, albeit with some difficulty, rather than concluding that it could not maintain either its economic development or social stability.
Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation
- Incorrect inference
- Logic error
Solution:
The statement suggests that maintaining economic development requires strengthening the competitiveness of domestic enterprises. However, maintaining social stability requires establishing social security systems, which reduces the competitiveness of enterprises. This creates a paradox where the country cannot maintain both its economic development and social stability simultaneously. Therefore, the correct answer is that this country cannot maintain its economic development or maintain its social stability.
Instructions:
1. Read the statement carefully and understand the problem.
2. Identify the key elements in the statement.
3. Understand the relationship between these elements.
4. Draw logical conclusions based on these relationships.
5. Choose the answer that best matches your conclusion.
Advice:
- Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
- Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
- Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
- Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
- Always double-check your conclusions and final answer.
- Remember that in logic problems, the correct answer is often the one that best fits all the given information.
