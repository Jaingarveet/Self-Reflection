Context: A rare and endangered animal of the northern salamander in Xinjiang.It was first discovered by a Russian explorer in 1840, but disappeared for more than 100 years.It was rediscovered in Hot Spring County, Xinjiang in 1898.But the data shows that in the 15 years since 1898, the number of northern salamanders in Xinjiang has been reduced by half.Some experts believe that the habitat of the northern salamander in Xinjiang was originally a local pasture, and the cattle and sheep walking around on the grassland in summer will trample them to death, resulting in a sharp decline in their numbers.
Question: Which of the following is true will raise the most doubts about the opinions of the above experts?
Choices:
  A: In 1997, the "Hot Spring Xinjiang Northern Salamander Nature Reserve" was established, and local herders' awareness of protecting Xinjiang Northern Salamander is increasing.
  B: In recent years, the rainfall has decreased and the groundwater level has fallen, which has affected the water source environment in which the northern salamander in Xinjiang lives.
  C: Xinjiang salamander is a kind of animal that is afraid of light.Most of them hide under the rocks of the creek during the day, and avoid the trampling of cattle and sheep.
  D: Xinjiang's northern salamanders are located in the mountains, and most tourists cannot enter at all.
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I focused on the expert's opinion about the cause of the salamander's decline (being trampled by cattle and sheep) and chose the option that directly contradicted this. However, the question asked for the option that would raise the most doubts about the expert's opinion. The correct answer (B) introduces a new potential cause for the decline (changes in the water environment), which would indeed raise more doubts about the expert's opinion than my chosen answer.
Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation
- Reading comprehension
- Logic error
Solution:
The expert's opinion is that the northern salamanders in Xinjiang are declining because they are being trampled by cattle and sheep. The option that raises the most doubts about this opinion would be the one that introduces a new potential cause for the decline that the expert did not consider. Option [REDACTED] introduces the idea that changes in the water environment could be causing the decline, which raises more doubts about the expert's opinion than the other options.
Instructions:
1. Understand the expert's opinion.
2. Understand what the question is asking - in this case, which option raises the most doubts about the expert's opinion.
3. Evaluate each option in terms of how much it would raise doubts about the expert's opinion.
4. Choose the option that introduces a new potential cause for the decline that the expert did not consider.
Advice:
- Always read the question carefully and make sure you understand what it is asking.
- Consider all the options before making a choice.
- Don't just look for options that directly contradict the expert's opinion, but also consider options that introduce new information that the expert did not consider.
- Practice logic problems regularly to improve your reasoning skills.
