Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I focused too much on the literal interpretation of Premier Wen Jiabao's statement. I failed to recognize the metaphorical meaning of the Chinese proverb in option [REDACTED], "Everyone collects firewood and the flame is high," which essentially conveys the same idea as Premier Wen's statement about the impact of large numbers.
Error Keywords:
- Interpretation error
- Metaphorical understanding
- Cultural context
Solution:
Premier Wen Jiabao's statement is about the impact of China's large population on problem-solving and resource distribution. He is saying that even a small problem can become big when multiplied by 1.3 billion, and a large total can become small when divided by 1.3 billion. This is a comment on the complexity and scale of issues in a country with a large population. The Chinese proverb "Everyone collects firewood and the flame is high" in option [REDACTED] metaphorically conveys the same idea, as it implies that small contributions can lead to significant results when multiplied by a large population.
Instructions:
1. Read the context and question carefully.
2. Understand the literal and metaphorical meanings of the statement.
3. Consider the cultural context of the statement.
4. Compare the options with the statement, looking for both literal and metaphorical matches.
5. Choose the option that best matches the statement in both literal and metaphorical terms.
Advice:
- Always consider both the literal and metaphorical meanings of a statement.
- Be aware of cultural context and proverbs, as they can often convey the same idea in a different way.
- Don't rush to answer; take your time to understand the question and all the options.
- Practice more questions to improve your understanding of metaphorical language and cultural context.
