Context: For the school paper, five students—Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, Megregian, and O'Neill—each review one or more of exactly three plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation, but do not review any other plays. The following conditions must apply: Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
Question: If exactly three of the students review Undulation, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Megregian does not review Undulation.
  B: O'Neill does not review Undulation.
  C: Jiang reviews Undulation.
  D: Lopez reviews Tamerlane.

Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misunderstood the conditions. I assumed that Megregian had to review Undulation because they review more plays than Kramer and Lopez. However, the conditions do not specify which plays each student reviews, only the relative quantity.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Given that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, and neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews, it means Jiang cannot review Tamerlane. Also, since Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian, it means Megregian must review at least two plays. If exactly three of the students review Undulation, it's possible that Megregian, who reviews more plays, could be one of them. However, it's also possible that Megregian does not review Undulation. Therefore, the answer could be that Megregian does not review Undulation.
Action: Answer("A")
