Topic: Law
Context: Of the eight students—George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert—in a seminar, exactly six will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
Question: If George, Nina, and Robert give reports and they do so on different days from one another, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Helen gives a report on Wednesday.
  B: Nina gives a report on Monday.
  C: Nina gives a report on Tuesday.
  D: Olivia gives a report on Monday.
  E: Robert gives a report on Wednesday.

Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misunderstood the condition that if Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. I interpreted this as Helen and Irving must give their reports on the same day, which is not necessarily true. They just need to give their reports after Nina, not necessarily on the same day.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Given the conditions, if George, Nina, and Robert give reports on different days, then:
- George can only give a report on Tuesday.
- Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
- If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
From these conditions, we can deduce that:
- Nina cannot give a report on Monday because Helen and Irving would have to give their reports on Tuesday, but George is already giving his report on Tuesday.
- Nina cannot give a report on Tuesday because Helen and Irving would have to give their reports on Wednesday, but there are only two slots on Wednesday and one of them is already taken by Robert.
- Therefore, Nina must give her report on Wednesday.
- This means that Helen cannot give her report on Wednesday because Nina is giving her report on that day and Helen must give her report after Nina.
- Therefore, the only possible answer is that Olivia gives a report on Monday.
