Context: During a recital, two pianists—Wayne and Zara—will perform solos. There will be five solos altogether, performed one immediately after another. Each solo will be either a modern piece or a traditional piece. The choice of pianist and type of piece for the solos must conform to the following conditions: The third solo is a traditional piece. Exactly two of the traditional pieces are performed consecutively. In the fourth solo, either Wayne performs a traditional piece or Zara performs a modern piece. The pianist who performs the second solo does not perform the fifth solo. No traditional piece is performed until Wayne performs at least one modem piece.

Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I misunderstood the conditions of the problem. I assumed that Wayne had to perform the [REDACTED]th solo because it was a traditional piece. However, the conditions allow for Zara to perform a modern piece in the [REDACTED]th solo, which means Wayne could potentially not perform any traditional pieces.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The conditions state that the third solo is a traditional piece and exactly two of the traditional pieces are performed consecutively. This means that either the second or fourth solo is also a traditional piece. However, the fourth solo can be a modern piece performed by Zara, which means the second solo must be a traditional piece. Since no traditional piece is performed until Wayne performs at least one modern piece, Wayne must perform a modern piece in the first solo and a traditional piece in the second solo. Therefore, the minimum number of solos in which Wayne performs a traditional piece is one.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
