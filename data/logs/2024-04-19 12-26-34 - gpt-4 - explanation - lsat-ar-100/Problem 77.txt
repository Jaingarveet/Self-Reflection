Context: An administrator must assign parking spaces to six new employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young. Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
Question: For how many of the six new employees is the assignment of a parking space limited to one of only two possible spaces?
Choices:
  A: none
  B: two
  C: three
  D: four

Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I failed to fully consider the implications of each rule on the parking space assignments. I only considered the direct limitations imposed by each rule, but I did not consider how these rules interacted with each other to further limit the options for each employee.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The rules state that:
1. Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
2. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
3. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
4. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
From these rules, we can deduce that:
- Togowa can only be assigned parking space #1 or #2 because Young must have a higher number and Robertson (who must have a higher number than Young) can only go up to #4.
- Young can only be assigned parking space #3 or #4 because he must have a higher number than Togowa (who can only be #1 or #2) and a lower number than Robertson (who can only be #1, #2, #3, or #4).
- Robertson can only be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4 as per the rules.
So, Togowa, Young, and Robertson each have only two possible spaces they can be assigned to.
Action: Answer("C")
