# Model: gpt-4 | Agent: advice | Exam: comprehensive-100 | Problem 69 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

- Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
- Remember to correctly subtract the constants on the right side of the equations.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
To find the value of x - y, we can solve the system of equations for x and y. 
Step 1: Multiply the first equation by 2 and the second equation by 3 to make the coefficients of y the same in both equations:
4x - 6y = -28
9x - 6y = -18
Step 2: Subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate y:
4x - 9x = -28 - (-18)
-5x = -10
x = 2
Step 3: Substitute x = 2 into the first equation to solve for y:
2*2 - 3y = -14
4 - 3y = -14
-3y = -18
y = 6
Step 4: Substitute x = 2 and y = 6 into x - y:
2 - 6 = -4
Action: Answer("C")
