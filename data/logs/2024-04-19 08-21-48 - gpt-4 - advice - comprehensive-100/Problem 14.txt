## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
From the conditions, we know that the human resources department and the sales department are not adjacent. The finance department is next to the planning department. The administration department is above the planning department but below the human resources department. If the human resources department is not above the administration department, it means the human resources department must be on the top floor. The sales department cannot be adjacent to it, so the sales department must be on one of the lower four floors. 
Action: Answer("D")
