Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.

## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. This means the pharmacy and the restaurant cannot be in space 2. The shoe store is in space 2, so the pharmacy cannot be in space 1 because it must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so it cannot be in space 6 if the veterinarian is in space 7. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, so a restaurant cannot be in space 3 if the shoe store is in space 2. The optometrist can be in space 5, and the veterinarian can be in space 4.
Action: Answer("E")
