## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Let's denote the amount each nephew receives as x. 
According to the problem, each daughter receives 4x and each son receives 5x. 
The total amount is divided among 5 sons, 4 daughters, and 2 nephews, which gives us the equation: 
5(5x) + 4(4x) + 2x = 8600
Solving this equation will give us the value of x, and multiplying x by 4 will give us the amount each daughter receives.
Action: 
First, simplify the equation: 
25x + 16x + 2x = 8600
43x = 8600
Solving for x gives us: 
x = 8600 / 43 = 200
Each daughter receives 4x, so: 
4 * 200 = 800
