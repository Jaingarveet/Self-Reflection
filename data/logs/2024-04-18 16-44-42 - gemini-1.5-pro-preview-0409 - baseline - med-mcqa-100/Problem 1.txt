Question: Which is not a branch of cavernous part of internal carotid artery -
Choices:
  A: Cavernous branch
  B: Inferior hypophyseal

## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The cavernous part of the internal carotid artery gives rise to the following branches:
*   **Cavernous branches:** Supply the walls of the cavernous sinus and the trigeminal ganglion.
*   **Inferior hypophyseal arteries:** Supply the posterior pituitary gland.
*   **Meningeal branches:** Supply the dura mater of the middle cranial fossa.
*   **Ophthalmic artery:** Supplies the eye and its surrounding structures.
Therefore, the meningeal artery is not a direct branch of the cavernous part of the internal carotid artery.
