Question: A patient underwent lateral skull base surgery few months back and has presented with complaints of recurrent aspirations. There is no change in voice of the patient. Which of the following nerve is most likely injured during surgery?
Choices:
  A: Vagus nerve
  B: Glossopharyngeal nerve
  C: SLN nerve
  D: RLN nerve
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
*   Recurrent aspirations indicate a problem with swallowing, likely due to nerve damage.
*   No voice change means the Recurrent Laryngeal Nerve (RLN), responsible for vocal cord movement, is likely not damaged.
*   The Superior Laryngeal Nerve (SLN) is involved in vocal fold sensation and doesn't directly control swallowing.
*   The Glossopharyngeal nerve (IX) plays a crucial role in swallowing and sensation in the throat.
*   The Vagus nerve (X) has a broader role, including some aspects of swallowing, but damage often presents with more widespread symptoms.
Action: Answer("B")
