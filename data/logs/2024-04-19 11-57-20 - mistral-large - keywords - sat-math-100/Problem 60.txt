## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: Mr. Kohl has a beaker containing $n$ milliliters of solution to distribute to the students in his chemistry class. If he gives each student 3 milliliters of solution, he will have 5 milliliters left over. In order to give each student 4 milliliters of solution, he will need an additional 21 milliliters. How many students are in the class?
Choices:
  A: 16
  B: 21
  C: 23
  D: 26

## Assistant 2:
Thought:
First, let's set up an equation to represent the given information. Let x be the number of students in the class.

When Mr. Kohl gives each student 3 milliliters of solution, he has 5 milliliters left over. This can be represented as:

3x + 5 = n

When Mr. Kohl gives each student 4 milliliters of solution, he needs an additional 21 milliliters. This can be represented as:

4x = n + 21

Now, we can solve for x by subtracting the first equation from the second equation:

4x - 3x = 21 + 5

x = 26

Action: Answer("D")

Reflection:
Previously, I made an algebraic error when setting up the equations. I incorrectly subtracted the first equation from the second equation, which resulted in an incorrect answer. To avoid this error in the future, I will carefully check my equation setup and simplification steps.
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
