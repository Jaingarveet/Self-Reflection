Question: Alma bought a laptop computer at a store that gave a 20 percent discount off its original price. The total amount she paid to the cashier was $p$ dollars, including an 8 percent sales tax on the discounted price. Which of the following represents the original price of the computer in terms of $p$ ?
Choices:
  A: $0.88 p$
  B: $\frac{p}{0.88}$
  C: $(0.8)(1.08) p$
  D: $\frac{p}{(0.8)(1.08)}$

* Calculation error
* Multiplication error
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The original price of the computer is the price before the discount and the sales tax.
Let's call the original price "x".
The discounted price is 80% of the original price, which is 0.8x.
The sales tax is 8% of the discounted price, which is 0.08 \* 0.8x = 0.064x.
The total amount Alma paid is the discounted price plus the sales tax, which is 0.8x + 0.064x = 0.864x.
We are given that the total amount Alma paid is p, so we have the equation 0.864x = p.
To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 0.864, which gives us x = p / 0.864.
Action: Answer("D")

Reflection:
I previously made a calculation error when I multiplied 0.8 and 1.08 instead of 0.8 and 0.92.
I also made a multiplication error when I calculated the sales tax as 0.08 \* 0.8x instead of 0.08 \* 0.8x = 0.064x.
To avoid these errors in the future, I will double-check my calculations and make sure I am using the correct numbers.
