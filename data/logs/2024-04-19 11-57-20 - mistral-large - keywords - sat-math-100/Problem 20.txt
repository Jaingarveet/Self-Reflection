# Model: mistral-large | Agent: keywords | Exam: sat-math-100 | Problem 20 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:
Topic: Geography
Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: $$\begin{aligned}& 2.4 x-1.5 y=0.3 \\& 1.6 x+0.5 y=-1.3\end{aligned}$$The system of equations above is graphed in the $x y$-plane. What is the $x$-coordinate of the intersection point $(x, y)$ of the system?
Choices:
  A: -0.5
  B: -0.25
  C: 0.8
  D: 1.75

## Assistant 2:
Reflection:
I made a calculation error when solving for the variable $x$. I incorrectly added the equations together instead of multiplying one or both of the equations by a constant to eliminate one of the variables.

Thought:
To solve for $x$, I can multiply the first equation by 4 and the second equation by 3 to eliminate $y$. This gives me:
$$\begin{aligned}& 9.6 x-6 y=1.2 \\& 4.8 x+1.5 y=-3.9\end{aligned}$$
Adding these two equations together, I get:
$$\begin{aligned}& 14.4 x= -2.7 \\& x = -2.7/14.4 \\& x = -0.1875\end{aligned}$$
Action: Answer("B") (The closest answer choice to -0.1875 is -0.25)
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
