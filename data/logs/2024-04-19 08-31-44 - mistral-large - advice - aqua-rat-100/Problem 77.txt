## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The sum of 5 consecutive odd numbers can be represented as:
n + (n+2) + (n+4) + (n+6) + (n+8) = 5n + 20
The sum divided by 10 is a perfect square, so:
(5n + 20) / 10 = (5n / 10) + 2 = perfect square
This means that 5n / 10 must be an odd integer, since the sum of an odd integer and 2 is a perfect square.
Therefore, n must be a multiple of 2, since 5n is a multiple of 10.
The only option that is a multiple of 2 is 42, but it is not an option in the choices.
Therefore, I need to find the closest odd number to 42 that is in the choices.
The closest odd number to 42 in the choices is 41.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
