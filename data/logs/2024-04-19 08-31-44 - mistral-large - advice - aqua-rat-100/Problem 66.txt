## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The youngest member of the club is 7 years old, and the ages of the members are in arithmetic progression with a common difference of 3 months (or 1/4 year).
Let n be the number of members in the club.
The sum of the ages of all the members is given as 250 years.
The sum of an arithmetic progression is given by the formula:
Sum = (n/2) \* (first term + last term)
The first term is 7 years, and the last term is 7 + (n-1) \* (1/4).
Substituting these values into the formula, we get:
250 = (n/2) \* (7 + 7 + (n-1) \* (1/4))
Simplifying and solving for n, we get:
250 = (n/2) \* (14 + (n-1) \* (1/4))
500 = n \* (14 + (n-1) \* (1/4))
500 = 14n + (n^2 - n) \* (1/4)
500 = 14n + (n^2/4 - n/4)
Multiplying both sides by 4 to eliminate fractions, we get:
2000 = 56n + n^2 - n
Rearranging the terms, we get:
n^2 + 55n - 2000 = 0
Factoring the quadratic equation, we get:
(n - 25) \* (n + 80) = 0
The possible values for n are 25 and -80.
Since the number of members cannot be negative, we choose the positive value for n.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
