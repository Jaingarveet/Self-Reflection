## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding the lengths of all its sides. Since a rectangle has two pairs of equal sides, the formula for the perimeter is 2*(length + width).

Step 1: Identify the length and width of the rectangle.
The length is 8 cm and the width is 3 cm.

Step 2: Calculate the sum of the length and width.
8 cm + 3 cm = 11 cm

Step 3: Multiply the sum by 2 to get the perimeter.
2 * 11 cm = 22 cm

Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
