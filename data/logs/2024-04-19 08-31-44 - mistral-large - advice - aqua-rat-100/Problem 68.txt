# Model: mistral-large | Agent: advice | Exam: aqua-rat-100 | Problem 68 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that the GCF and LCM of two integers are related but not the same.
 - Remember that the other integer must be a factor of the LCM and must also be divisible by the prime factors of the GCF.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The greatest common factor (GCF) of two positive integers is 11. The least common multiple (LCM) of these two integers is 7700. One of the integers is 350. To find the other integer, I need to find a factor of 7700 that is also divisible by 11.

Step 1: Find the prime factors of 7700.
7700 = 2^2 * 5^2 * 7^2 * 11

Step 2: Find the factors of 7700 that are also divisible by 11.
The factors of 7700 that are also divisible by 11 are 11, 22, 35, 55, 77, 110, 140, 175, 220, 275, 350, 440, 525, 700, 770, 1100, 1400, 1750, 2200, 2750, 3500, 4400, 5250, 7000, and 7700.

Step 3: Find the factor that is also divisible by 350.
The factor that is also divisible by 350 is 700.

Action: Answer("D")

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly because I did not read the question carefully and did not understand the problem. I also did not decompose the problem into multiple simple steps and did not think through each subproblem step-by-step. I also skipped some steps in my reasoning and did not double-check my calculations and final answer. To avoid making the same mistake again, I will always read the question carefully and understand the problem. I will also decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps and think through each subproblem step-by-step. I will never skip any steps in my reasoning and will always double-check my calculations and final answer. I will also remember that the GCF and LCM of two integers are related but not the same and that the other integer must be a factor of the LCM and must also be divisible by the prime factors of the GCF.
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: A
