Thought:
Let's denote the number of white sharpeners as "w" and the number of brown sharpeners as "b".
We know that Jack bought a total of 18 sharpeners, so we can write the equation: w + b = 18.
We also know that Jack paid Rs. 100 for all the sharpeners, and that he paid Rs. 1 more for each white sharpener than for each brown sharpener. Let's denote the cost of a brown sharpener as "x". Then the cost of a white sharpener is "x + 1". We can write another equation based on this information: x \* b + (x + 1) \* w = 100.
Now we have two equations and two variables. We can solve these equations simultaneously to find the values of "w" and "b".
First, let's isolate "w" in the first equation: w = 18 - b.
Now we can substitute this expression for "w" into the second equation: x \* b + (x + 1) \* (18 - b) = 100.
Simplifying this equation, we get: x \* b + 18x + 18 - x \* b - b = 100.
Combining like terms, we get: 18x - b = 82.
Now we have two equations: w = 18 - b and 18x - b = 82.
We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to get: 18x - (18 - w) = 82.
Simplifying this equation, we get: 18x - 18 + w = 82.
Rearranging the terms, we get: w = 82 - 18x + 18.
Substituting the value of "w" from the first equation, we get: 18 - b = 82 - 18x + 18.
Simplifying this equation, we get: 18x - b = 62.
Now we have two equations: 18x - b = 82 and 18x - b = 62.
These equations are contradictory, which means there is an error in the problem statement or our interpretation of it.
However, since we must select one of the available choices, we can try to find a solution that satisfies one of the equations.
If we use the equation 18x - b = 62, we can solve for "b": b = 18x - 62.
Substituting this expression for "b" into the first equation, we get: w = 18 - (18x - 62).
Simplifying this equation, we get: w = 80 - 18x.
Now we can try different values of "x" to find integer values of "w" and "b" that satisfy both equations.
If we try x = 3, we get w = 80 - 18 \* 3 = 80 - 54 = 26 and b = 18 \* 3 - 62 = 54 - 62 = -8.
These values do not make sense in the context of the problem, since the number of brown sharpeners cannot be negative.
If we try x = 4, we get w = 80 - 18 \* 4 = 80 - 72 = 8 and b = 18 \* 4 - 62 = 72 - 62 = 10.
These values satisfy both equations and make sense in the context of the problem.
