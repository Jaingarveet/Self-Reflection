## Assistant 2:
Reflection:
I previously made an error in calculating the amount of work done by Mr. Brown and Mr. Black before Mr. Blue started working.

Thought:
First, let's find out how much work Mr. Brown and Mr. Black can do in one day.

Mr. Brown can paint a house in 6 days, so his work rate is 1/6 per day.
Mr. Black can paint a house in 8 days, so his work rate is 1/8 per day.

In 8 days, Mr. Brown can complete 8 \* (1/6) = 4/3 of a house.
In 6 days, Mr. Black can complete 6 \* (1/8) = 3/4 of a house.

Together, they have completed 4/3 + 3/4 = 23/12 of a house, which is almost 2 houses.

Since they have almost completed 2 houses, Mr. Blue only needs to complete 1 more house.

Mr. Blue can paint a house in 12 days, so his work rate is 1/12 per day.

It will take Mr. Blue 12 days to complete the remaining house.

Action: Answer("E")
