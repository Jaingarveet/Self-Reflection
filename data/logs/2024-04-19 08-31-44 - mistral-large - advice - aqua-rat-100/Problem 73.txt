## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

## Assistant 2:
Thought:
To find the least possible number of students in the school, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the percentages given for physics and math. However, since the LCM is not always applicable in problems involving percentages, we need to consider the constraints given in the problem.

The problem states that there are more than 501 students in the school. Let's start by checking the first answer choice, 550.

If there are 550 students in the school, then 20% of them took physics, which is equal to 0.20 x 550 = 110 students. Similarly, 28% of them took math, which is equal to 0.28 x 550 = 154 students.

However, since the problem states that exactly 20% of them took physics and exactly 28% of them took math, we need to find a number of students that is divisible by both 20 and 28.

The least common multiple of 20 and 28 is 140. Therefore, the least possible number of students in the school is 140 x 5 = 700.

Action: Answer("D")
