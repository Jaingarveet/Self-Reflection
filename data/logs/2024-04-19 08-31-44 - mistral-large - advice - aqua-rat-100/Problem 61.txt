## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Topic: Math
Question: Kevin drove from A to B at a constant speed of 70 mph. Once he reached B, he turned right around with pause, and returned to A at a constant speed of 90 mph. Exactly 3 hours before the end of his trip, he was still approaching B, only 70 miles away from it. What is the distance between A and B?
Choices:
  A: 180
  B: 90
  C: 270
  D: 360
  E: None of the above

Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that the question may not be asking for the same value that you calculated.
 - Always read the question carefully and understand what is being asked.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Kevin was 70 miles away from B, 3 hours before the end of his trip. Since he was driving at a constant speed of 90 mph on his way back from B to A, he must have been driving for 70/90 = 7/9 hours during those last 3 hours of his trip. This means that the entire trip took 3 + 7/9 = 32/9 hours.

Since Kevin drove at a constant speed of 70 mph from A to B, and the entire trip took 32/9 hours, he must have spent 32/9 - 7/9 = 25/9 hours driving from A to B. Therefore, the distance between A and B is 70 mph \* 25/9 hours = 1750/9 miles.

However, none of the answer choices match this value. I must have made a mistake in my calculations or misunderstood the problem. Let me double-check my work.

Thought 2:
I made a mistake in calculating the time Kevin spent driving from A to B. Since he was driving at a constant speed of 70 mph, and he was 70 miles away from B, 3 hours before the end of his trip, he must have spent 70/70 = 1 hour driving from A to B. Therefore, the distance between A and B is 70 mph \* 1 hour = 70 miles.

Action: Answer("B")

Reflection:
I made a mistake in my initial calculation of the time Kevin spent driving from A to B. I incorrectly subtracted the time he spent driving during the last 3 hours of his trip from the total time of the trip, instead of adding it. I also failed to double-check my calculations and final answer before selecting an answer choice. In the future, I will make sure to carefully read the question, decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps, think through each subproblem step-by-step, and double-check my calculations and final answer.
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
