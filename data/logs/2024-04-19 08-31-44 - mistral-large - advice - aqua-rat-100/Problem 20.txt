## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The ratio of boys to girls after new members joined is 4:3.
Let x be the number of new boys and girls who joined.
Then the number of boys is 64 + x and the number of girls is 40 + x.
The ratio of boys to girls is (64 + x) / (40 + x) = 4/3.
Cross-multiplying gives 192 + 3x = 160 + 4x.
Solving for x gives x = 32.
So 32 boys and 32 girls joined the group.
The total number of members is now 64 + 32 + 40 + 32 = 168.
Action: Answer("E")
