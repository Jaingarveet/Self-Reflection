## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Assistant 2:
Thought:
A starts at home and travels 3km south, then 5km east, then 3km north, and finally 2km west.
To find the distance from home, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to calculate the straight-line distance between the starting and ending points.
The starting point is at (0,0) and the ending point is at (5-2, 0-3+3) = (3,0).
The distance between these two points is sqrt((3-0)^2 + (0-0)^2) = sqrt(9) = 3km.
Action: Answer("A")
