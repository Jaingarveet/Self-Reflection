# Model: mistral-large | Agent: advice | Exam: aqua-rat-100 | Problem 10 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Advice:

* Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
* Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
* Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
* Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
* Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
* Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The space shuttle takes 5 seconds to pass a point, so we need to find the distance it travels in those 5 seconds.
We know that the space shuttle can travel 700m high in 40 seconds, so we can find its speed by dividing the distance by the time: 700m / 40s = 17.5m/s.
Now we can find the distance the space shuttle travels in 5 seconds by multiplying its speed by the time: 17.5m/s x 5s = 87.5m.
However, this is not the length of the space shuttle. We need to find the distance it travels in the time it takes to pass a point, which is 5 seconds.
Since the space shuttle is traveling at a constant speed, we can assume that it takes the same amount of time to pass a point as it does to travel its own length.
Therefore, the length of the space shuttle is equal to the distance it travels in 5 seconds, which we calculated to be 87.5m.
Action: Answer("E")

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly because I misunderstood the problem. I thought that the space shuttle's maximum speed was its speed at all times, and I calculated the distance it traveled in 5 seconds based on that speed. However, the question states that the space shuttle takes 5 seconds to pass a point, which means that its speed is not constant. I should have decomposed the problem into multiple steps and thought through each step carefully. I also should have double-checked my calculations and final answer. In the future, I will make sure to read the question carefully and understand the problem before attempting to solve it.
