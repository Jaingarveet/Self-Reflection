To solve this problem, we need to find out how much profit each person made per month and then use that information to determine how long C was in the business.

First, let's find out how much profit A and B made together before C joined. Since C made Rs.150,000 out of a total profit of Rs.375,000, A and B together made Rs.225,000 (Rs.375,000 - Rs.150,000).

Next, let's find out how many months A and B were in the business together before C joined. Let's assume that C joined x months after B joined. Then A was in the business for 12 months, B was in the business for 12 - x months, and C was in the business for x months.

Since A invested Rs.40,000 and B invested Rs.60,000, their combined investment was Rs.100,000. Therefore, their combined profit per month was Rs.225,000 / (12 - x) (since they were in the business together for 12 - x months).

Similarly, since C invested Rs.120,000, his profit per month was Rs.150,000 / x.

Now, we can set up an equation to solve for x:

Rs.225,000 / (12 - x) = Rs.150,000 / x

Cross-multiplying, we get:

225x = 150(12 - x)

Expanding and simplifying, we get:

225x = 1800 - 150x

Adding 150x to both sides, we get:

375x = 1800

Dividing both sides by 375, we get:

x = 4.8

Since we're looking for a whole number of months, we can round up to the nearest whole number, which is 5 months.

Therefore, C joined the business 5 months after B joined.

Action: Answer("B")
