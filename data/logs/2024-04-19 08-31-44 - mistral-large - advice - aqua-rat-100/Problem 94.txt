## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The bike number consists of 2 letters followed by 2 numbers.
There are 26 letters in the English alphabet, so there are 26 x 26 = 676 possible combinations for the 2 letters.
There are 10 digits (0-9), so there are 10 x 10 = 100 possible combinations for the 2 numbers.
However, since the bike number cannot start with a 0, there are only 9 possible options for the first digit.
Therefore, there are 9 x 10 = 90 possible combinations for the 2 numbers.
To find the total number of distinct bike numbers, we multiply the number of letter combinations by the number of number combinations: 676 x 90 = 60,840.
However, the question asks for the number of distinct letters needed to form these bike numbers.
Since each bike number uses 2 distinct letters, we need to find the number of distinct pairs of letters that can be formed from the 26 letters of the alphabet.
This is a combination problem, since the order of the letters does not matter.
The formula for combinations is nCr = n! / [(n-r)!r!], where n is the total number of items, r is the number of items to choose, and ! denotes factorial.
In this case, n = 26 and r = 2, so the formula becomes 26C2 = 26! / [(26-2)!2!] = 325.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: D
