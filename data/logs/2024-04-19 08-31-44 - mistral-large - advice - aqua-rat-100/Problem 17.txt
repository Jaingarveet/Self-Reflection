* Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
* Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
* Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
* Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
* Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
* Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
First, let's calculate the total production cost per month: 420 units \* $110/unit = $46,200/month.
Next, let's calculate the total production cost per year: $46,200/month \* 12 months/year = $554,400/year.
To guarantee a yearly profit of at least $626,400, the total revenue must be at least $554,400 (production cost) + $626,400 (desired profit) = $1,180,800.
Let x be the minimum selling price per component. Then, the total revenue is 420 units/month \* 12 months/year \* x = 5,040x.
Setting the total revenue equal to the desired total revenue, we have 5,040x = $1,180,800.
Solving for x, we get x = $1,180,800 / 5,040 = $234.29.
Since the minimum selling price must be a whole number, we round up to the nearest choice, which is $240.
Action: Answer("C")
