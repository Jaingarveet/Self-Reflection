# Model: mistral-large | Agent: composite | Exam: med-mcqa-100 | Problem 14 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Medicine.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:
Topic: Geography
Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Medicine
Subtopic: Biochemistry
Question: In anaerobic glycolysis, end product is -
Choices:
  A: 2 ATP + 2 NAD
  B: 2 ATP
  C: 2 ATP + 2 NADH
  D: 4 ATP + 2 FADH2
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I confused the end products of anaerobic glycolysis with those of aerobic glycolysis.
The gap in my knowledge was in biochemistry, specifically in the differences between anaerobic and aerobic glycolysis.
I knew the correct process but mixed up the end products.
Error Keywords:
 - Confusion error
 - Biochemistry error
 - Anaerobic vs aerobic glycolysis error
Solution:
Anaerobic glycolysis, also known as fermentation, occurs in the absence of oxygen.
The end product of anaerobic glycolysis is [REDACTED] (adenosine triphosphate) and 2 NA[REDACTED] (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide).
Instructions:
1. Identify the type of glycolysis being asked about (anaerobic or aerobic).
2. Recall the end products of anaerobic glycolysis.
3. Double-check that the end products are specific to anaerobic glycolysis.
4. Choose the answer that matches the correct end products.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your answer against your knowledge of the topic.
 - Remember that anaerobic glycolysis and aerobic glycolysis have different end products.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The question is asking about the end product of anaerobic glycolysis.
The end product of anaerobic glycolysis is 2 ATP and 2 NADH.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
