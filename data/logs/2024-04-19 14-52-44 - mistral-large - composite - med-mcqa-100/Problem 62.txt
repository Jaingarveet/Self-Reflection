The gap in my knowledge was in the anatomy of the female reproductive system.
I knew the four parts of the uterine tube but misidentified the narrowest part.
Error Keywords:

Solution:
The uterine tube, also known as the fallopian tube, has four parts: the infundibulum, ampulla, isthmus, and interstitial.
The infundibulum is the funnel-shaped opening of the tube near the ovary.
The ampulla is the widest and longest part of the tube.
The isthmus is the narrowest part of the tube, located near the uterus.
The interstitial part is the narrowest part of the tube, located within the muscular wall of the uterus.
Instructions:
1. Identify the four parts of the uterine tube.
2. Understand the anatomy and function of each part.
3. Identify the narrowest part of the uterine tube.
4. Double-check your answer with the anatomy of the female reproductive system.
5. Choose the answer that matches your identified part.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always review the anatomy and function of each part of the system.
 - Always double-check your answer with the anatomy of the system.
 - Remember that the narrowest part of the uterine tube is the interstitial part, located within the muscular wall of the uterus.
