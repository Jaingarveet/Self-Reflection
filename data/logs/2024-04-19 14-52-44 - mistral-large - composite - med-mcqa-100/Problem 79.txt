## System:
You are an expert in Medicine.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Subtopic: Pediatrics
Question: What is the average gain in lenght in 4 years?
Choices:
  A: 25 cm
  B: 50 cm
  C: 75 cm
  D: 100 cm
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I made an error in my calculation of the average gain in length over 4 years.
The gap in my knowledge was not in pediatrics but in basic arithmetic.
I knew the correct growth rate per year but made a calculation error.

Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Arithmetic error
 - Multiplication error

Solution:
The average growth rate for children between the ages of 2 and 5 is about 6 cm per year.
To find the average gain in length over 4 years, we need to multiply the growth rate per year by the number of years.
6 cm/year \* 4 years = 24 cm
However, the question asks for the answer in centimeters, not in years.
Therefore, we do not need to divide by the number of years.
The correct answer is 24 cm.

Instructions:
1. Identify the growth rate per year.
2. Identify the number of years.
3. Multiply the growth rate per year by the number of years.
4. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.
5. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
6. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.

Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them.
 - Always pay attention to the units of measurement in the question and answer choices.
