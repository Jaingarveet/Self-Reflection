# Model: cohere-command-r-plus | Agent: instructions | Exam: logiqa-en-100 | Problem 12 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Logic.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:
Topic: Geography
Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Logic
Context: Most people think that the thinking of scientists is based on strict logical reasoning, not on image thinking means such as analogy, intuition, and epiphany.However, research shows that Nobel Prize winners make more use of these image thinking methods than general scientists.Therefore, image thinking methods help to achieve major scientific breakthroughs.
Question: The above conclusion is based on which of the following assumptions?
Choices:
  A: Organized, step-by-step reasoning is essential for general scientific research.
  B: Nobel Prize winners have the ability to think creatively through analogy, intuition, and insight.
  C: Nobel winners have made major scientific breakthroughs.
  D: Nobel Prize winners are smarter and harder than ordinary scientists.
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Identify the context and the conclusion. 
2. Understand the relationship between them and the underlying assumption. 
3. Analyze each choice and determine if it reflects this core assumption. 
4. Choice [REDACTED] directly expresses this assumption and is, therefore, the correct answer.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
1. Context: The context discusses the thinking processes of scientists, specifically the idea that Nobel Prize winners utilize "image thinking" methods (analogy, intuition, epiphany) more often than general scientists, which may contribute to their significant scientific breakthroughs.
2. Conclusion: The conclusion is that "image thinking methods help to achieve major scientific breakthroughs."

3. Assumption: The assumption underlying this conclusion is that Nobel Prize winners have achieved major scientific breakthroughs, and their success is attributed, at least in part, to their use of "image thinking" methods.

4. Analysis: 
Choice A discusses logical reasoning, which is not the primary focus of the argument; it doesn't reflect the assumption that "image thinking" leads to breakthroughs.
Choice B acknowledges the creative thinking of Nobel laureates but doesn't connect it explicitly to significant achievements.
Choice C directly addresses the assumption by stating that Nobel winners have made major breakthroughs, implying that their use of "image thinking" methods contributed to their success.
Choice D introduces a new element of comparison (smarter and harder) that is not relevant to the argument's focus on thinking methods and breakthroughs.

Therefore, choice C is the correct answer.

Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
