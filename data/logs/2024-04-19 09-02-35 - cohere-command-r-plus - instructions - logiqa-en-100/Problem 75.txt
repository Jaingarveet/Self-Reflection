 - Choice [REDACTED] mentions physical stores, but the argument is about the impact of the Internet on regions with low economic development.
 - Choice [REDACTED] acknowledges a limitation of online shopping, but it does not refute the argument's main claim.
 - Choice [REDACTED] contradicts the argument by stating that satisfaction depends solely on economic development, disregarding the role of the Internet.
