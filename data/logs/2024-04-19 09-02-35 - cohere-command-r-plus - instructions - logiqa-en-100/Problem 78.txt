Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Identify the four distinct roles Mr. Chen's guests fill: 
    - Father's brother-in-law
    - Brother-in-law's father
    - Brother's mother-in-law
    - Brother-in-law's brother
2. Understand that these roles are not mutually exclusive, and each role can be filled by a different person. 
3. Realize that the brother-in-law's brother is not necessarily the same person as the brother's mother-in-law's husband, as they can be brothers married to different people. 
4. Count the number of guests invited (four) and select the answer choice reflecting that count.
## Assistant 2:
Reflection: I made a mistake in my previous reflection by assuming that the brother-in-law's brother and the brother's mother-in-law were the same person, which is not necessarily true. Each of the four roles can be filled by four different individuals, so four guests are invited.

Action: Answer("D")
