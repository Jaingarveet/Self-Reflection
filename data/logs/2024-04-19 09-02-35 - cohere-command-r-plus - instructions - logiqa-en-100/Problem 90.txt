Context: The problem faced by a developing country is that to maintain its economic development, it must constantly strengthen the competitiveness of domestic enterprises; to maintain social stability, it must constantly establish and improve social security systems such as pensions, medical care, and unemployment.To establish and improve the social security system, enterprises need to pay a certain percentage of social insurance premiums for employees every year.If an enterprise pays such a proportion of social insurance premiums for employees every year, it will reduce the competitiveness of the enterprise.
