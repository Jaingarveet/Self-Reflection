Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:

Subtopic: Biochemistry
Question: In anaerobic glycolysis, end product is -
Choices:
  A: 2 ATP + 2 NAD
  B: 2 ATP
  C: 2 ATP + 2 NADH
  D: 4 ATP + 2 FADH2
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Error Keywords:
 - Confusion error
 - Biochemistry error
 - Anaerobic vs aerobic glycolysis error
## Assistant 2:
Reflection:
I made a confusion error by mixing up anaerobic and aerobic glycolysis. In anaerobic glycolysis, the end product is 2 ATP and 2 NADH, not 2 ATP and 2 NAD as I previously answered.

Thought:
Anaerobic glycolysis occurs in the absence of oxygen and produces 2 ATP and 2 NADH as end products.

Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
