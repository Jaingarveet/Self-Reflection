Senescent RBCs are mainly attacked in Plasmodium vivax malaria.
Action: Answer("A")

Reflection:
I previously made a confusion error by selecting the wrong malaria type. I mistakenly thought that senescent RBCs were mainly attacked in Plasmodium falciparum malaria, but I now know that it is actually Plasmodium vivax malaria that primarily targets senescent RBCs. I will be more careful in the future to avoid making similar errors.
