## Assistant 2:
Reflection:
I made a conceptual error in my previous answer. Randomization is a process used in research studies to ensure that participants are assigned to different groups by chance alone, without any bias or systematic differences between the groups. This helps to ensure that any observed differences between the groups are due to the intervention being studied and not to other factors.

Thought:
Randomization implies equal and unknown chances of assignment to different groups.

Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
