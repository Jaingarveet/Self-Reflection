  Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I realize now that I made a mistake in my reasoning. I will use my self-reflection to help me answer the question correctly this time.

Step 1: I will start by reading the problem carefully and making sure I understand the constraints and relationships between the different parts of the problem.

The problem states that there are six bays numbered 1 through 6 consecutively on the loading dock, and each bay is holding a different type of cargo. The problem also provides information about the numbering of the bays, including the fact that the bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock, and the bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.

Step 2: I will break down the problem into smaller sub-problems to help me solve it. For this problem, I will focus on the bays holding livestock and textiles.

I know that the bay holding livestock is higher than the bay holding textiles, so I will start by identifying which bay is holding livestock.

Step 3: I will use the information provided in the problem to determine which bay is holding livestock.

According to the problem, the bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock, so the bay holding livestock must be bay 3.

Step 4: I will double-check my work to make sure I have followed the correct logic throughout the problem.

I have correctly identified the bay holding livestock as bay 3.
