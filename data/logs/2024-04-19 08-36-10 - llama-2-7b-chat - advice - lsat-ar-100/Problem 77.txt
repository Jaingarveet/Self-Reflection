## Assistant 2:
  Thought: I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I need to reassess the problem.

Reflection: I realized that I made a mistake in my previous answer. I incorrectly assigned parking spaces to some of the employees. Let me reevaluate the problem and find the correct solution.

Action: I will reassess the problem and assign parking spaces to each employee based on the given rules.

Answer: For three of the six new employees, the assignment of a parking space is limited to one of only two possible spaces:

* Xu: must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, which means he can only be assigned parking spaces #3 or #4.
* Togowa: must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young, which means he can only be assigned parking spaces #5 or #6.
* Vaughn: must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Robertson, which means he can only be assigned parking spaces #2 or #3.

Therefore, the answer is (B) three.
