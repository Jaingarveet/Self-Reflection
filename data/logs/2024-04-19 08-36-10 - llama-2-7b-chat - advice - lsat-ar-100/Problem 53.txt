## Assistant 2:
  Topic: Law
Context: A realtor will show a prospective buyer seven houses—J, K, L, M, N, 0, and P—during a single day.
Question: Which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: K is shown in the evening.
  B: L is shown in the afternoon.
  C: L is shown in the evening.
  D: M is shown in the morning.
  E: M is shown in the afternoon.

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I realized that my solution was not correct. Here is my reflection on the problem:

I misunderstood the information provided and made an incorrect assumption about the timing of the house showings. I thought that K must be shown in the evening, but upon further analysis, I realized that K cannot be shown in the morning. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) L is shown in the evening.

I will make sure to carefully read and analyze the problem before answering it again. Thank you for providing the opportunity to reflect on my mistake and improve my answer.
