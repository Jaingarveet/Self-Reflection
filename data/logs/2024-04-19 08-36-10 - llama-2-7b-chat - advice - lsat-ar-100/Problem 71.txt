## Assistant 2:
  Thought: I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand the mistake. Let me re-evaluate the problem and the given conditions to find the correct answer.

Action: I will use the information provided to determine which sales representatives work in Zone 3.

Reflection: Based on the conditions given, we know that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. We also know that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, and either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Additionally, Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other, and Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.

Using this information, we can determine the complete and accurate list of sales representatives working in Zone 3 as follows:

Either Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1, so one of them must work in Zone 3. Let's assume that Parra works in Zone 3.

Either Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2, so one of them must work in Zone 3. Let's assume that Tiao works in Zone 3.

Since Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other, they must work in the same zone as Tiao. Therefore, Quinn must work in Zone 3.

Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other, so they must work in the same zone as Tiao. Therefore, Udall must work in Zone 3.

Therefore, the complete and accurate list of sales representatives working in Zone 3 is:

D: Stuckey, Tiao, Udall

I hope this reflection helps me answer the question correctly this time.
