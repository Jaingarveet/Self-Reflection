Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand the mistake. Here is my reflection on the problem, my solution, and the correct answer:

Problem: If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then which one of the following must be true?

Solution: I incorrectly selected option A, which states that F and G are placed on the same shelf as each other. However, upon further reflection, I realized that F and G are not placed on the same shelf. F is placed on the bottom shelf, and G is placed on the middle shelf. Therefore, the correct answer is option C, which states that H and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.

Correct Answer: C

Explanation: If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then H must be placed on a lower shelf than L. Since M is placed on the bottom shelf, H must be placed on the middle shelf. Therefore, H and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.
## Result:
Agent Answer: None
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
