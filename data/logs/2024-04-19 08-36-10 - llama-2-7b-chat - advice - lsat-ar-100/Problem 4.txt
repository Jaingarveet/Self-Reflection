Context: A chemistry class has six lab sessions scheduled over three days—Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday—one session heing held each morning and one each afternoon. Each session will be led by a different lab assistant—Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, or Rebecca. The assignment of lab assistants to sessions is constrained as follows: Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day. Nessa must lead an afternoon session. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
Question: If Lan does not lead a Wednesday session, then which one of the following lab assistants must lead a Thursday session?
Choices:
  A: Rebecca
  B: Olivia
  C: Nessa
  D: Kevin
  E: Julio

## Assistant 2:
  Thought: I previously answered this question incorrectly, so I need to reassess the problem and find the correct solution.

Reflection:
I analyzed the constraints given in the problem:

1. Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
2. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
3. Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
4. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.

From these constraints, I can deduce that:

* If Lan leads a session on Wednesday, then Kevin must lead a session on Thursday.
* If Lan does not lead a Wednesday session, then Nessa must lead a Thursday session.
* Since Olivia's session must meet on a later day than Nessa's, Olivia cannot lead a Thursday session.
* Therefore, the only lab assistant who can lead a Thursday session is Rebecca.

Action: Answer("B")
