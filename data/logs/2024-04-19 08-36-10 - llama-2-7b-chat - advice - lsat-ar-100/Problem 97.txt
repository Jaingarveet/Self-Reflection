  Topic: Law
Context: A bakery makes exactly three kinds of cookie—oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar. Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day. The following conditions apply: No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
Question: If the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday, then each of the following could be true EXCEPT:
Choices:
  A: Two different kinds of cookie have their first batch made on Monday.
  B: Two different kinds of cookie have their first batch made on Tuesday.
  C: Two different kinds of cookie have their second batch made on Wednesday.
  D: Two different kinds of cookie have their second batch made on Thursday.
  E: Two different kinds of cookie have their third batch made on Friday.
Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, selecting choice B: Two different kinds of cookie have their first batch made on Tuesday. However, upon further reflection, I realize that this is not the correct answer.
The information provided in the problem states that the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday, and the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. This means that the first batch of peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Tuesday, as that would violate the condition that no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
Therefore, the correct answer is choice E: Two different kinds of cookie have their third batch made on Friday.

Advice: When solving this problem, it is important to carefully read and understand the conditions provided in the problem, and to use logical reasoning to determine the correct answer. It can be helpful to create a diagram or flowchart to visualize the different batches and their relationships to each other. Additionally, it can be helpful to reflect on past mistakes and use them as an opportunity to improve future problem-solving skills.
