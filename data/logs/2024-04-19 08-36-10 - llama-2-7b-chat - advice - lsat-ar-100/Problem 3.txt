## Assistant 2:
  Thought: I previously answered this question incorrectly by assigning parking space #3 to Xu, which violates the rule that Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.

Action: I will reassess the problem and apply the correct rules to assign parking spaces to the six new employees.

Reflection: Based on the given rules, the correct assignment of parking spaces is as follows:

* Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young, so Robertson will be assigned parking space #1.
* Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, so Xu will be assigned parking space #5.
* Souza must be assigned a lower-numbered parking space than Togowa, so Souza will be assigned parking space #4.
* Togowa must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Vaughn, so Togowa will be assigned parking space #2.
* Vaughn must be assigned parking space #6.
* Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Robertson, so Young will be assigned parking space #3.

Therefore, the correct answer is (E) Young is assigned parking space #2.
