Advice:

1. Read the problem carefully and identify the key conditions that need to be satisfied.
2. Break down the problem into smaller sub-problems and analyze each condition separately.
3. Use a systematic approach to eliminate incorrect options and identify the correct one.

## Assistant 2:
  Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I realize now that I made a mistake in my analysis. Here is my self-reflection:

1. I did not carefully read the problem conditions and missed the crucial information that P cannot be performed at the second position.
2. I broke down the problem into smaller sub-problems, but I did not analyze each condition separately and instead combined them, leading to confusion.
3. I used an unsystematic approach to eliminate options, which resulted in me selecting the incorrect answer.
4. I did not double-check my calculations and reasoning, which led to the mistake in my previous answer.

Based on my reflection, I will approach this question again with a more systematic and careful approach. Here is my revised answer:

Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: E
Score: 0
