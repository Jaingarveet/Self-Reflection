## System:
You are an expert in Medicine.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Subtopic: Biochemistry
Question: In blood buffers Bicarbonates buffers is ideal why?
Choices:
  A: Pka is equal to Ph
  B: High concentration
  C: Weak acid and weak base combination
  D: easy to measure
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Understand the role of blood buffers: maintaining acid-base balance and pH stability. 
2. Recognize the importance of both pKa and concentration in buffer effectiveness. 
3. Interpret the question: Identify why high concentration is specifically ideal for blood buffers. 
4. Answer: Choose the option that reflects the unique advantage of high buffer concentration.
## Assistant 2:
Reflection: A buffer's effectiveness is influenced by both its pKa and its concentration. The correct answer, "B: High concentration," reflects this. A higher concentration of bicarbonate buffers in the blood improves their ability to resist pH changes and maintain acid-base balance. This is essential in the context of blood pH regulation and the body's overall homeostasis.

Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
