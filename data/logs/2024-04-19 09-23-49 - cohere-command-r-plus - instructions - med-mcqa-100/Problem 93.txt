Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Identify the type of acne mentioned in the question (comedonal acne).
2. Recall the standard first-line treatment for this specific type of acne (retinoids). 
3. Recognize that while benzoyl peroxide is effective for inflammatory acne, it is not the primary treatment for comedonal acne. 
4. Choose the answer option that reflects the correct first-line treatment (retinoids).
## Assistant 2:
Reflection: I missed the specific type of acne mentioned in the question, which is comedonal acne. The first-line treatment for comedonal acne is typically retinoids, which are effective in unclogging pores and preventing the formation of new comedones. While benzoyl peroxide is useful for treating inflammatory acne, it is not the primary recommendation for comedonal acne. Therefore, the correct answer is "Retinoids."

Action: Answer("C")
