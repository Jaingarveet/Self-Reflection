## System:
You are an expert in Medicine.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: In Cicatricial pemphigoid, which antigen is bound by IgG on the epidermal side of the salt split skin technique?
Choices:
  A: XVII collagen
  B: Epiligrin
  C: Laminin 5
  D: BP antigen 1 & 2
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Understand the nature of cicatricial pemphigoid as an autoimmune disease.
2. Recognize that the question seeks the antigen targeted by IgG autoantibodies.
3. Identify collagen XVII as the transmembrane collagen component of the hemidesmosome.
4. Confirm that collagen XVII is located on the epidermal side of the dermal-epidermal junction.
5. Select the answer choice corresponding to collagen XVII.
## Assistant 2:
Reflection: Cicatricial pemphigoid is an autoimmune disease where the body produces IgG antibodies against certain antigens in the skin, leading to blistering and scarring. The salt split skin technique is used to examine the dermal-epidermal junction. I need to identify which antigen, out of the choices given, is located on the epidermal side of this junction and bound by IgG antibodies in cicatricial pemphigoid.

Thought: In Cicatricial pemphigoid, an autoimmune disease, IgG autoantibodies target antigens on the epidermal side of the dermal-epidermal junction, which can be visualized using the salt split skin technique. One of the primary antigens targeted in this disease is collagen XVII, a transmembrane collagen component of the hemidesmosome. Therefore, the correct answer is "A: XVII collagen."
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
