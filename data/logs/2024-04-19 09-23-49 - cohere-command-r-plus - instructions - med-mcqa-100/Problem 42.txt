Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Understand the purpose of an inferior alveolar nerve block. 
2. Identify the correct injection site for this procedure. 
3. Ensure you differentiate between the retromolar area and the pterygomandibular space, both relevant in dentistry. 
4. Select the answer choice that specifically refers to the pterygomandibular space.
## Assistant 2:
Reflection: The inferior alveolar nerve block is a common dental procedure used to anesthetize the lower teeth and jaw before dental surgery or other procedures. A local anesthetic is injected into the pterygomandibular space, which is located just above the jawbone and behind the mandibular molars. This space is also known as the "V3" region in the classification of anesthetic injection sites. The correct answer is, therefore, "B: Pterygomandibular space."

Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
