Thought: 
After radiation therapy, it is common to experience skin lesions like desquamation.
The best approach is often conservative management through observation to ensure proper healing and detect any potential complications.
Surgery and antibiotics are not typically indicated unless there are specific concerns or infections.
While petroleum jelly can provide moisture and relief, it is not the primary treatment for desquamation.
