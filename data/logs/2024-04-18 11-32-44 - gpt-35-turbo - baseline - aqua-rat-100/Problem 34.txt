Question: A book was sold for Rs 27.50 with a profit of 10%. If it were sold for Rs. 25.75, then would have been percentage of profit and loss ?
Choices:
  A: 2% Profit
  B: 3% Profit
  C: 2% Loss
  D: 3% Loss
  E: 4% Loss
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Profit percentage = (Profit / Cost Price) x 100
Given, Selling Price = Rs. 27.50 and Profit Percentage = 10%
Let's calculate the Cost Price first.
Cost Price = (100 / (100 + Profit Percentage)) x Selling Price
Cost Price = (100 / (100 + 10)) x 27.50
Cost Price = (100 / 110) x 27.50
Cost Price = 25
Now, if the book were sold for Rs. 25.75, then the profit or loss percentage can be calculated as follows:
Profit = Selling Price - Cost Price
Profit = 25.75 - 25
Profit = 0.75
Profit Percentage = (Profit / Cost Price) x 100
Profit Percentage = (0.75 / 25) x 100
Profit Percentage = 3%
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
