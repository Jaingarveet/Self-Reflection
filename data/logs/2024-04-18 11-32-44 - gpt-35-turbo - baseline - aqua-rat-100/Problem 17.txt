Question: A company produces 420 units of a particular computer component every month, at a production cost to the company of $110 per component, and sells all of the components by the end of each month. What is the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee that the yearly profit (revenue from sales minus production costs) will be at least $626,400 ?
Choices:
  A: 226
  B: 230
  C: 240
  D: 260
  E: 280
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The company produces 420 units of a computer component every month, so it produces 420 x 12 = 5040 units per year.
The production cost per component is $110, so the total production cost per year is 5040 x $110 = $554,400.
The yearly profit should be at least $626,400, so the revenue from sales should be at least $626,400 + $554,400 = $1,180,800.
To find the minimum selling price per component, we need to divide the required revenue by the number of units produced per year.
Minimum selling price per component = $1,180,800 / 5040 = $234.
Action: Answer("None of the Above") 
Note: None of the given choices is the correct answer. The minimum selling price per component that will guarantee that the yearly profit will be at least $626,400 is $234.
