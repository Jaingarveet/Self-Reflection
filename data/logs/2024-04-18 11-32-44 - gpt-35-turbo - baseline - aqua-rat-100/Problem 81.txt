Question: One gram of a certain health food contains 9 percent of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E and 8 percent of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A. If vitamins E and A are to be obtained from no other source, how many grams of the health food must be eaten daily to provide at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins?
Choices:
  A: 8.5
  B: 10.5
  C: 12.5
  D: 14.5
  E: 16.5
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let's assume that the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E and vitamin A is 100 grams each.
One gram of the health food contains 9% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E, which is 9 grams.
One gram of the health food contains 8% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A, which is 8 grams.
To get 100 grams of vitamin E, we need to eat 100/9 grams of the health food.
To get 100 grams of vitamin A, we need to eat 100/8 grams of the health food.
We need to take the maximum of the two values to ensure we get the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins.
Action: Answer("C")

Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
