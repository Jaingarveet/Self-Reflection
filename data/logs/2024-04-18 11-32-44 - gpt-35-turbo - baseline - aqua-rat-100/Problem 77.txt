You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.

Question: The sum of the 5 consecutive two digit odd numbers when divided by 10 becomes a perfect square, which of the following can be one of these 5 numbers?
Choices:
  A: 47
  B: 91
  C: 41
  D: 67
  E: 44
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The sum of 5 consecutive odd numbers can be expressed as 5x + 10, where x is the middle number.
Since the numbers are odd, x must be an odd number.
The sum of 5 consecutive odd numbers is always divisible by 5.
If the sum is divisible by 10, then the last digit of the sum must be 0.
The only perfect square that ends in 0 is 100.
Therefore, the sum of the 5 consecutive odd numbers must be a multiple of 100.
Let's check which of the given numbers can be one of the 5 consecutive odd numbers.
Action: 
Let's start with the smallest number, 41. The sum of the next 4 consecutive odd numbers is 41 + 43 + 45 + 47 + 49 = 225, which is not divisible by 10. So, 41 cannot be one of the 5 consecutive odd numbers.
Let's check 44. The sum of the next 4 consecutive odd numbers is 44 + 46 + 48 + 50 + 52 = 240, which is divisible by 10. So, 44 can be one of the 5 consecutive odd numbers.
Let's check 47. The sum of the next 4 consecutive odd numbers is 47 + 49 + 51 + 53 + 55 = 255, which is not divisible by 10. So, 47 cannot be one of the 5 consecutive odd numbers.
Let's check 67. The sum of the previous 4 consecutive odd numbers is 59 + 61 + 63 + 65 + 67 = 315, which is divisible by 10. So, 67 can be one of the 5 consecutive odd numbers.
Let's check 91. The sum of the previous 4 consecutive odd numbers is 75 + 77 + 79 + 81 + 83 = 395, which is not divisible by 10. So, 91 cannot be one of the 5 consecutive odd numbers.
