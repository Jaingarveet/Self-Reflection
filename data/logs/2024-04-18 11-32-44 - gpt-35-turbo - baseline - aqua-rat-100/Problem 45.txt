Question: At what price should the Karan mark a sewing machine that costs him Rs. 1200/- so that even after offering a 20% discount, he makes 20% profit?
Choices:
  A: 1,879
  B: 1,875
  C: 1,876
  D: 1,872
  E: 1,800
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let the marked price be x.
The selling price after a 20% discount will be 0.8x.
The profit Karan wants to make is 20% of the cost price, which is 0.2*1200 = 240.
We can set up the equation: 
0.8x = 1200 + 240
0.8x = 1440
x = 1800
Action: Answer("E")
## Result:
Agent Answer: E
Correct Answer: E
Score: 1
