## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: there are more than 501 students in a school such that 20% of them exactly took physics and 28% of them exactly took math. What could be the least possible no of students in the school?
Choices:
  A: 550
  B: 570
  C: 600
  D: 700
  E: none of these
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let's assume that the number of students in the school is x.
According to the question, 20% of x took physics and 28% of x took math.
We can write the following equations:
0.2x > 0 (since there must be at least one student who took physics)
0.28x > 0 (since there must be at least one student who took math)
We need to find the least possible value of x that satisfies these equations.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: E
Score: 0
