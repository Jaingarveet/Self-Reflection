## Assistant 2:
Thought:
On a normal day, Bill's speed is 15 mph.
On a windy day, his speed is reduced by 4 mph, so his speed is 11 mph.
We need to find how far he can travel in 21 minutes.
Action: 
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 11 mph x (21/60) hours
Distance = 3.85 miles (rounded to the nearest hundredth)
