Question: Last year, a Home Appliance Store sold an average(arithmetic mean) of 42 microwave ovens per month. In the first 10 months of this year,the store has sold an average(arithmetic mean) of only 20 microwave ovens per month. What was the average number of microwave ovens sold per month during the entire 22 months period ?
Choices:
  A: 21
  B: 30
  C: 31
  D: 32
  E: None of the above
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let's use the formula for the arithmetic mean: 
average = (sum of items) / (number of items)
We need to find the average for the entire 22 months period, so we need to find the sum of all microwave ovens sold during that period.
Action: 
Let's use the formula to find the sum of microwave ovens sold during the first 10 months of this year:
sum = average x number of items
sum = 20 x 10 = 200
Let's find the total number of microwave ovens sold during the entire 22 months period:
total number of microwave ovens = average x number of months
total number of microwave ovens = 42 x 12 + sum
total number of microwave ovens = 504 + 200
total number of microwave ovens = 704
Finally, let's find the average for the entire 22 months period:
average = total number of microwave ovens / number of months
average = 704 / 22
average = 32
