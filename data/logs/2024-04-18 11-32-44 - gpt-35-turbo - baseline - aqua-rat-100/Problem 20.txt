Question: 64 boys and 40 girls form a group for social work. During their membership drive, the same number of boys and girls joined the group. How many members does the group have now, if the ratio of boys to girls is 4:3?
Choices:
  A: 277
  B: 288
  C: 200
  D: 277
  E: 168
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The current ratio of boys to girls is 4:3.
Let's assume that the number of boys and girls who joined the group is x.
So, the total number of boys in the group is 64 + x and the total number of girls in the group is 40 + x.
We can set up the equation 4/3 = (64 + x)/(40 + x) to solve for x.
Once we find x, we can add it to the initial number of boys and girls to get the total number of members in the group.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: E
Score: 0
