Question: At Daifu university, 24% of all students are members of both a chess club and a swim team. If 20% of members of the swim team are not members of the chess club, what percentage of all Daifu students are members of the swim team?
Choices:
  A: 20%
  B: 30%
  C: 40%
  D: 50%
  E: 60%
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let's assume that there are 100 students at Daifu University.
Then, 24 students are members of both a chess club and a swim team.
Let's assume that there are x students in the swim team.
Then, 0.2x students are not members of the chess club.
So, the number of students who are members of both a chess club and a swim team is 0.8x.
Therefore, 24 = 0.8x.
Hence, x = 30.
So, there are 30 students in the swim team out of 100 students in total.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
