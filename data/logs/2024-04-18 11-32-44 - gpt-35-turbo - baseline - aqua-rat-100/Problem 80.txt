Question: Jack buys 18 sharpeners (white and brown) for rs. 100. If he pays 1 rupee more for each white than brown sharpeners. How many of white and how many brown sharpeners did he buy?
Choices:
  A: 10,8
  B: 9,8
  C: 7,8
  D: 5,6
  E: 11,12
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let's assume that Jack bought x white sharpeners and y brown sharpeners.
We know that x + y = 18 and x - y = 2 (because he paid 1 rupee more for each white sharpener than brown sharpener, and he spent 18 rupees more on white sharpeners than brown sharpeners).
We can solve these equations simultaneously to find the values of x and y.
Action: Answer("A") - 10,8
Here's how to solve it:
From x - y = 2, we get x = y + 2.
Substituting x = y + 2 in x + y = 18, we get (y + 2) + y = 18.
Simplifying this, we get 2y + 2 = 18, which gives us y = 8.
Substituting y = 8 in x = y + 2, we get x = 10.
Therefore, Jack bought 10 white sharpeners and 8 brown sharpeners.
