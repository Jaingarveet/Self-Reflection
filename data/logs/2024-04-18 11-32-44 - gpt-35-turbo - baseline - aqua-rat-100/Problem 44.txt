Question: 8 man work for 6 days to complete a work. How many men are required to complete same work in 1/2 day.
Choices:
  A: 93 men
  B: 94 men

## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let's use the formula: 
Men × Days = Work
We know that 8 men work for 6 days to complete a work. So, we can find the total man-days required to complete the work:
8 men × 6 days = 48 man-days
We want to find how many men are required to complete the same work in 1/2 day. Let's use the same formula to solve for the number of men:
Men × Days = Work
Men × 1/2 day = 48 man-days
Men = 48 man-days ÷ 1/2 day
Men = 96
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
