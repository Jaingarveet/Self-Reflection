Topic: Math
Question: A wire in the shape of rectangle of length 27 cm and breadth 17 cm is rebent to form a square. What will be the measure of each side?
Choices:
  A: 9
  B: 11
  C: 22
  D: 25
  E: 31
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The wire of the rectangle will be used to form the square, so the perimeter of the rectangle will be equal to the perimeter of the square.
The perimeter of the rectangle is 2(length + breadth) = 2(27 + 17) = 88 cm.
The perimeter of the square is 4s, where s is the length of each side.
So, 4s = 88, which gives s = 22 cm.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
