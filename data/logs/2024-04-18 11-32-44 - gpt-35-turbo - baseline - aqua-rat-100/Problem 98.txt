Question: At 6% per annum simple interest, Rahul borrowed Rs. 500. What amount will he pay to clear the debt after 4 years
Choices:
  A: 750
  B: 700
  C: 620
  D: 600
  E: None of these
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Simple Interest formula is I = P * R * T, where
I = Interest
P = Principal
R = Rate of Interest
T = Time in years
Here, P = Rs. 500, R = 6% per annum, T = 4 years
I = P * R * T = 500 * 6/100 * 4 = Rs. 120
Total amount to be paid = Principal + Interest = Rs. 500 + Rs. 120 = Rs. 620
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
