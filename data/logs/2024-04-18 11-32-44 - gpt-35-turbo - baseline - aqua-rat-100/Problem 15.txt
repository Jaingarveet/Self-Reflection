Topic: Math
Question: Add: +45 and -30
Choices:
  A: -30
  B: +30
  C: 0
  D: 15
  E: -15
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
To add two numbers with different signs, we need to subtract the smaller absolute value from the larger absolute value and keep the sign of the larger number.
Here, the absolute value of +45 is larger than the absolute value of -30.
So, we subtract 30 from 45 and keep the sign of +45, which is positive.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
