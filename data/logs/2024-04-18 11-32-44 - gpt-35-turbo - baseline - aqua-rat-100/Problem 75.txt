## Assistant 2:
Thought:
To calculate the population of the city in 2 years time, we need to find the population after the first year and then apply the 5% increase again.
To find the population after the first year, we can multiply the current population by 1.05.
To find the population after the second year, we can multiply the population after the first year by 1.05 again.
