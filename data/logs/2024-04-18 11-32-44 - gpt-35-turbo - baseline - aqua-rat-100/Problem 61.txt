## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Question: Kevin drove from A to B at a constant speed of 70 mph. Once he reached B, he turned right around with pause, and returned to A at a constant speed of 90 mph. Exactly 3 hours before the end of his trip, he was still approaching B, only 70 miles away from it. What is the distance between A and B?
Choices:
  A: 180
  B: 90
  C: 270
  D: 360
  E: None of the above
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let's call the distance between A and B "d".
We know that Kevin drove at a constant speed of 70 mph from A to B, and then at a constant speed of 90 mph from B to A.
We also know that 3 hours before the end of his trip, he was still approaching B, only 70 miles away from it.
Action: 
Let's start by using the formula: distance = rate x time
Let's call the time it took Kevin to drive from A to B "t1", and the time it took him to drive from B to A "t2".
We know that:
distance from A to B = distance from B to A = d
rate from A to B = 70 mph
rate from B to A = 90 mph
time from A to B = t1
time from B to A = t2
We also know that:
distance from A to B = distance from B to A = d
distance from A to B - 70 = distance from B to A + 70
Let's use these equations to solve for d:
d = 70t1
d = 90t2
d - 70 = 90(t2 - 3)
We can use the first two equations to solve for t1 and t2 in terms of d:
t1 = d/70
t2 = d/90
We can substitute these expressions for t1 and t2 into the third equation:
d - 70 = 90(d/90 - 3)
Simplifying this equation, we get:
d - 70 = d - 270
Adding 70 to both sides, we get:
d = 340
Therefore, the distance between A and B is 340 miles.
Action: Answer("E")
## Result:
Agent Answer: E
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
