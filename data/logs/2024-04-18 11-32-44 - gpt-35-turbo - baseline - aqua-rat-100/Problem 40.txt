Question: Mark told John "If you give me half your money I will have Rs.75. John said, "if you give me one third of your money, I will have Rs.75/-. How much money did John have ?
Choices:
  A: 22

## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let's assume John has x amount of money.
According to the question, if John gives half of his money to Mark, then Mark will have (x/2)+75.
Also, if Mark gives one-third of his money to John, then John will have (2x/3)+25.
We can form an equation from the above information and solve for x.
Equation: (x/2)+75 = (2x/3)+25
Solution: x = 60
Action: Answer("B")
