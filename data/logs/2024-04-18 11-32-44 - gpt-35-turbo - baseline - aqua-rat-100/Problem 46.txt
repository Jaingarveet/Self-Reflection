Question: A man spends Rs. 3500 per month and saves 12 1/2% of his income. His monthly income is ?
Choices:
  A: Rs. 4400
  B: Rs. 4270
  C: Rs. 4000
  D: Rs. 3937.50
  E: None of these
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
If the man saves 12 1/2% of his income, then he spends 100% - 12 1/2% = 87 1/2% of his income.
Let's assume his monthly income is x.
Then, he spends 87 1/2% of x, which is equal to Rs. 3500.
We can set up an equation to solve for x.
87 1/2% of x = Rs. 3500
0.875x = Rs. 3500
x = Rs. 4000
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
