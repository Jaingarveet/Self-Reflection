Question: At its maximum speed, a space shuttle can travel 700m high in 40 seconds. It will also take 5 seconds to pass a point. What then is the length of the space shuttle?
Choices:
  A: 50 m
  B: 75 m
  C: 100 m
  D: 125 m
  E: 150 m
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
We can use the formula: distance = speed x time
We need to find the speed of the space shuttle first.
The space shuttle travels 700m in 40 seconds, so its speed is 700/40 = 17.5 m/s.
We also know that it takes 5 seconds to pass a point, so the distance it covers during this time is 5 x 17.5 = 87.5 m.
To find the length of the space shuttle, we need to subtract the distance it traveled during the 5 seconds from the total distance it traveled during the 40 seconds.
Total distance = 700 m
Distance traveled during 5 seconds = 87.5 m
Length of space shuttle = Total distance - Distance traveled during 5 seconds = 700 - 87.5 = 612.5 m
Action: Answer("None of the Above") - The correct answer is not among the choices.
## Result:
Agent Answer: N
Correct Answer: C
