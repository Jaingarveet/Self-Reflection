Question: A square piece of cloth is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge to form a rectangular piece, which is then cut diagonally in half to create two triangles. If the area of each of triangle is 70 square feet, what was the perimeter (in feet) of the original piece of square cloth?
Choices:
  A: 56
  B: 58
  C: 60
  D: 62
  E: 64
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let's assume the original side of the square piece of cloth is x feet.
After trimming 4 feet from one edge, the new dimensions of the rectangular piece are (x-4) by x.
The area of the rectangular piece is (x-4)x = x^2 - 4x.
The area of each triangle is 70 square feet, so the area of both triangles is 140 square feet.
The area of a triangle can be calculated as (1/2) * base * height.
Since the two triangles are identical, we can set up the equation (1/2) * (x-4) * h = 70, where h is the height of each triangle.
Solving for h, we get h = 140 / (x-4).
The height of each triangle is also given by the Pythagorean theorem as sqrt(x^2 - (x-4)^2) = sqrt(8x - 16).
Equating the two expressions for h, we get 140 / (x-4) = sqrt(8x - 16).
Squaring both sides and simplifying, we get 8x^2 - 312x + 1960 = 0.
Solving for x using the quadratic formula, we get x = 19.55 or x = 15.95.
Since x represents the length of a side of the original square piece of cloth, we can discard the smaller solution and conclude that x = 19.55 feet.
The perimeter of the original square piece of cloth is 4x = 78.2 feet, which we can round to 78 feet.
Action: Answer("None of the Above") - The correct answer is not among the choices. The correct answer is 78.
