Question: The bus fare for two persons for travelling between Agra and Aligarh id four-thirds the train fare between the same places for one person. The total fare paid by 6 persons travelling by bus and 8 persons travelling by train between the two places is Rs.1512. Find the train fare between the two places for one person?
Choices:
  A: 126
  B: 77
  C: 88
  D: 66
  E: 54
## Assistant 2:
Let's assume that the train fare for one person is x. Then, the bus fare for two persons will be 4x/3.
The total fare paid by 6 persons travelling by bus will be (6/2) * (4x/3) = 4x.
The total fare paid by 8 persons travelling by train will be 8x.
According to the question, the sum of these two fares is Rs. 1512. So, we can write the equation as:
4x + 8x = 1512
Simplifying this equation, we get:
12x = 1512
x = 126
Therefore, the train fare between the two places for one person is Rs. 126.
