## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: An exam is given in a certain class. The average (arithmetic mean) of the highest score and the lowest score is equal to x. If the average score for the entire class is equal to y and there are z students in the class, where z > 5, then in terms of x, y, and z, what is the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers?
Choices:
  A: (zy – 2x)/z
  B: (zy – 2)/z
  C: (zx – y)/(z – 2)
  D: (zy – 2x)/(z -2)
  E: (zy – x)/(z + 2)
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let the highest score be H and the lowest score be L.
The average of H and L is (H+L)/2.
Given, (H+L)/2 = x.
Therefore, H+L = 2x.
Let the sum of all the scores be S.
Given, the average score for the entire class is y.
Therefore, S/z = y.
We need to find the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers.
Let the sum of all the scores excluding the highest and lowest scorers be S'.
Let the number of scores excluding the highest and lowest scorers be z-2.
Then, (S'/(z-2)) = average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers.
We need to express S' in terms of x, y, and z.
Action: Answer("D") 
Explanation:
From the given information, we know that H+L = 2x and S/z = y.
We can express S in terms of H, L, and z as S = H + L + (z-2)A, where A is the average score of the remaining z-2 students.
We can express A in terms of S and z as A = S/z.
Substituting the above equations, we get S = 2x + (z-2)Ay.
We need to find S' which is the sum of all the scores excluding the highest and lowest scorers.
S' = S - H - L
Substituting the above equations, we get S' = 2x + (z-2)Ay - H - L
We know that H+L = 2x.
Substituting the above equation, we get S' = S - 2x.
Substituting the values of S and z, we get S' = zy - 2x.
Therefore, the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers is (zy - 2x)/(z-2).
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
