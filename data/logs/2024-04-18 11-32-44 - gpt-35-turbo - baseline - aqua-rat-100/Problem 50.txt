## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: A ship went on a voyage. After it had traveled 180 miles a plane started with 10 times the speed of the ship. Find the distance when they meet from starting point.
Choices:
  A: 238
  B: 289
  C: 200
  D: 287
  E: 187
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let's assume the speed of the ship is "s" and the time it takes to meet the plane is "t". 
The distance traveled by the ship before meeting the plane is 180 miles.
The distance traveled by the plane before meeting the ship is 10s*t.
The total distance traveled by the plane and the ship when they meet is the same and can be represented as s*t + 10s*t = 11s*t.
Action: 
The distance traveled by the ship when they meet is s*t, which can be calculated using the formula: s*t = 180
The distance traveled by the plane when they meet is 10s*t, which can be calculated using the formula: 10s*t = 11s*t - 180
Solving for t, we get t = 20.
Substituting t in the formula s*t = 180, we get s = 9.
The distance traveled by the plane when they meet is 10s*t = 10*9*20 = 1800.
Therefore, the distance from the starting point when they meet is 180 + 1800 = 1980 miles.
This is not one of the answer choices, so we need to divide it by 10 to get the answer in the given choices.
1980/10 = 198.
Action: Answer("E")
## Result:
Agent Answer: E
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
