Question: If Raj was one-third as old as Rahim 5 years back and Raj is 17 years old now, How old is Rahim now?
Choices:
  A: 37
  B: 41
  C: 40
  D: 42
  E: 43
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let's assume Rahim's age 5 years back was x.
So, Raj's age 5 years back was (1/3)x.
We know that Raj is 17 years old now, so Raj's age 5 years back was 12.
So, (1/3)x = 12
x = 36
Therefore, Rahim's current age = x + 5 = 36 + 5 = 41
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
