Question: Two balls A and B rotate along a circular track. Ball A makes 2 full rotations in 26 minutes. Ball B makes 5 full rotation in 35 minutes. If they start rotating now from the same point, when will they be at the same starting point again?
Choices:
  A: 1 hour and 31 minutes
  B: 2 hour and 31 minutes
  C: 3 hour and 31 minutes
  D: 4 hour and 31 minutes
  E: 5 hour and 31 minutes
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The time taken for each ball to complete one full rotation is different.
We need to find the LCM of the time taken by each ball to complete one full rotation.
Action: 
Ball A takes 26/2 = 13 minutes to complete one full rotation.
Ball B takes 35/5 = 7 minutes to complete one full rotation.
The LCM of 13 and 7 is 91.
Therefore, they will be at the same starting point again after 91 minutes.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
