## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: A paper is in a square form whose one side is 20 cm. Two semi circles are drawn on its opposites as diameters. If these semi circles are cut down what is the area of the remaining paper?
Choices:
  A: 8.75
  B: 8.79
  C: 8.75
  D: 8.71
  E: 8.72
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The area of the square paper is (20 cm) x (20 cm) = 400 cm².
The diameter of each semi-circle is equal to the side of the square, which is 20 cm.
The area of each semi-circle is (1/2) x π x r², where r is the radius of the semi-circle.
The area of both semi-circles is (1/2) x π x r² + (1/2) x π x r² = π x r².
The radius of each semi-circle is 20 cm / 2 = 10 cm.
The area of both semi-circles is π x (10 cm)² = 100π cm².
When the two semi-circles are cut out, the remaining paper is in the shape of a rectangle with a semi-circle on each end.
The length of the rectangle is equal to the diameter of the semi-circle, which is 20 cm.
The width of the rectangle is equal to the radius of the semi-circle, which is 10 cm.
The area of the rectangle is 20 cm x 10 cm = 200 cm².
The area of both semi-circles is 100π cm².
The area of the remaining paper is 200 cm² - 100π cm².
Action: Answer("C")
