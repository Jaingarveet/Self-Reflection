Question: A starts a business with Rs.40,000. After 2 months, B joined him with Rs.60,000. C joined them after some more time with Rs.120,000. At the end of the year, out of a total profit of Rs.375,000, C gets Rs.150,000 as his share. How many months after B joined the business, did C join?
Choices:
  A: 2 months
  B: 4 months
  C: 23 months
  D: 24 months
  E: 84 months
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let's assume C joined the business after x months.
We can use the ratio of their investments to find the share of profit for each person.
We know that C's share is Rs.150,000, so we can use that to find the total profit for the three of them.
Then, we can use the total profit and the ratio of their investments to find x.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: B
