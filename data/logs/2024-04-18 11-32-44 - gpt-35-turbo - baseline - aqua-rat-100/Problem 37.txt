Question: In IPL season, Sachin current batting average is 51. In the finals, he scores 78 runs, then is batting average will be 54. Find out the total number of matches played by Sachin in this season.
Choices:
  A: 6
  B: 8
  C: 9
  D: 10
  E: 11
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let's assume that Sachin played 'x' matches in the season before the finals.
Then, the total runs scored by Sachin in the season before the finals = 51x
After the finals, the total runs scored by Sachin in the season = 51x + 78
Also, we know that the batting average after the finals is 54.
So, (51x + 78)/(x+1) = 54
Solving this equation, we get x = 9
Therefore, Sachin played 9 matches in the season before the finals.
So, the total number of matches played by Sachin in this season = 9 + 1 (finals) = 10
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
