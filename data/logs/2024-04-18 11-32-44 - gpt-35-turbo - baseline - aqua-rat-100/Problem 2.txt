Question: The average (arithmetic mean) of the weight of 10 vehicles is 12.2 tons. The average weight of the group of vehicles increased by 2.6 tons after a new heavy duty truck was added to the group? What is the weight in tons of the heavy duty truck?
Choices:
  A: 40.8
  B: 41.6
  C: 42.2
  D: 43.5
  E: 44.8
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The sum of the weights of the 10 vehicles is 10 * 12.2 = 122 tons.
After adding the new truck, the sum of the weights of the 11 vehicles is 11 * (12.2 + 2.6) = 157.2 tons.
The weight of the new truck is the difference between the two sums: 157.2 - 122 = 35.2 tons.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
