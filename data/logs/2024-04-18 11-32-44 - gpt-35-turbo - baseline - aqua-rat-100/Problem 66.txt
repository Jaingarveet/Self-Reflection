Question: A club consists of members whose ages are in A.P. The common difference being 3 months. If the youngest member of the club is just 7 years old and the sum of the ages of all the members is 250, then number of members in the club are :
Choices:
  A: 18
  B: 20
  C: 25
  D: 26
  E: 27
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let the number of members in the club be n.
The age of the youngest member is 7 years.
The sum of the ages of all the members is 250.
The common difference is 3 months, which is 1/4 years.
The sum of the ages of all the members can be expressed as a function of n.
Action: 
The sum of the ages of n members in A.P. with first term a and common difference d is given by the formula: S = n/2[2a + (n-1)d]
Here, a = 7 years and d = 1/4 years.
So, S = n/2[2(7) + (n-1)(1/4)]
Simplifying the expression, we get:
S = n/2[15/2 + (n-1)/4]
S = n/8[2n + 13]
Given, S = 250.
So, 250 = n/8[2n + 13]
Solving the quadratic equation, we get n = 25 or -26/2.
Since the number of members cannot be negative, the answer is n = 25.
