## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: Calculate the maximum distance you can travel with $8.50 on a cab which charges $3.50 for the first quarter-mile and 10 cents for each additional quarter mile.
Choices:
  A: 11.75 miles
  B: 12.75 miles
  C: 17.75 miles
  D: 14.75 miles
  E: 10.75 miles
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The initial charge is $3.50, which leaves $5.00 for the additional distance.
Each additional quarter-mile costs $0.10, which means that each mile costs $0.40.
To find the maximum distance, we need to divide the remaining $5.00 by $0.40 per mile.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
