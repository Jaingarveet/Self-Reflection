## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let's start by finding the cost price of each bag of flour.
Let's assume the cost price of each bag of flour is x.
The selling price of each bag of flour is $100.
The grocer makes a 25% profit on the selling price, which means he sells each bag of flour for $125.
The profit made on each bag of flour is $125 - $x.
We know that the grocer made a total profit of $3,000.
We can set up an equation to solve for x and then use that value to find the number of bags sold.
Equation: $3,000 = (125 - x) * n, where n is the number of bags sold.
Action: Answer("C") 24. 
Explanation:
$3,000 = (125 - x) * n
$3,000 = (125 - x) * n
$3,000/n = 125 - x
x = 125 - $3,000/n
The cost price of each bag of flour is $125 - $3,000/n.
We know that the selling price of each bag of flour is $100, so we can set up another equation to solve for n.
Equation: $125 - $3,000/n = $100
$25 = $3,000/n
n = 120
The grocer sold 24 bags of flour.
