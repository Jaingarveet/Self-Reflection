Question: A company contracts to paint 3 houses. Mr.Brown can paint a house in 6 days while Mr.Black would take 8 days and Mr.Blue 12 days. After 8 days Mr.Brown goes on vacation and Mr. Black begins to work for a period of 6 days. How many days will it take Mr.Blue to complete the contract?
Choices:
  A: 7
  B: 8
  C: 10
  D: 11
  E: 12
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let's first calculate the fraction of work done by each painter in a day.
Mr.Brown can paint a house in 6 days, so he can paint 1/6 of a house in a day.
Mr.Black can paint a house in 8 days, so he can paint 1/8 of a house in a day.
Mr.Blue can paint a house in 12 days, so he can paint 1/12 of a house in a day.
After 8 days, Mr.Brown has completed 8*(1/6) = 4/3 of the work.
Now, Mr.Black works for 6 days, so he completes 6*(1/8) = 3/4 of the work.
Together, Mr.Brown and Mr.Black have completed (4/3 + 3/4) = 7/3 of the work.
Thus, the remaining work is (1 - 7/3) = 2/3 of the work.
Let's assume Mr.Blue takes x days to complete the remaining work.
So, in x days, Mr.Blue can complete (1/12)*x of the work.
Now, we can set up an equation to solve for x:
(1/12)*x = 2/3
x = (2/3)/(1/12)
x = 8
Therefore, it will take Mr.Blue 8 days to complete the contract.
Action: Answer("B")
