## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: If n is such that 36 ≤ n ≤ 72, then x = (n2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16) / (n+ 4√n+ 4) satisfies
Choices:
  A: 20 < x < 54
  B: 23 < x < 58
  C: 25 < x < 64
  D: 28 < x < 60
  E: None of these
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
We can simplify the expression for x by factoring the numerator and denominator and then canceling out common factors. 
Then we can substitute the given values of n to find the range of x.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
