## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Question: A rectangular piece of 150 sq m has a length which is 1m more than the 4 times the breadth. What is the perimeter of the piece?
Choices:
  A: 60 m
  B: 61 m
  C: 62 m
  D: 63 m
  E: 64 m
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let's assume the breadth of the rectangular piece is "x" meters.
Then, the length of the rectangular piece is (4x + 1) meters.
We know that the area of the rectangular piece is 150 sq m.
So, x(4x + 1) = 150
Simplifying the above equation, we get 4x^2 + x - 150 = 0
We can solve this quadratic equation to find the value of x.
Once we have the value of x, we can calculate the length and perimeter of the rectangular piece.
Action: 
Solving the quadratic equation, we get x = 5 or x = -7.5
Since the breadth cannot be negative, we will consider x = 5.
So, the length of the rectangular piece is 4x + 1 = 21 meters.
The perimeter of the rectangular piece is 2(length + breadth) = 2(21 + 5) = 52 meters.
