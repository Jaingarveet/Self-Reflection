## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The given statement can be written as:
1 man working 1 hour per day can do 1/x units of work in x days.
Therefore, y men working y hours per day can do y * y * (1/x) units of work in y days.
Simplifying the above expression, we get (y^3/x) units of work in y days.
Action: Answer("B")
