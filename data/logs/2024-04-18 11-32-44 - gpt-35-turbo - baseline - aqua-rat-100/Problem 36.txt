Question: In a chocolate store, all chocolates are either vanilla or cocoa flavored only. 10% of the chocolates are cocoa flavored, 90% of the rest are squashed. What percentage of the chocolates are both vanilla flavored and not squashed?
Choices:
  A: 1%

## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let's assume there are 100 chocolates in the store.
10% of the chocolates are cocoa flavored, which means 10 chocolates are cocoa flavored.
The remaining chocolates are vanilla flavored.
90% of the remaining chocolates (90 chocolates) are squashed, which means 10% of the remaining chocolates (10 chocolates) are not squashed.
We need to find the percentage of chocolates that are both vanilla flavored and not squashed.
Action: Answer("10%")
## Result:
Agent Answer: 1
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
