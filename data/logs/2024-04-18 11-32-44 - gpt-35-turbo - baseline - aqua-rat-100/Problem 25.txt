You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: A car is being driven, in a straight line and at a uniform speed, towards the base of a vertical tower. The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower?
Choices:
  A: 5(√3 + 1)
  B: 6(√3 + √2)
  C: 7(√3 – 1)
  D: 8(√3 – 2)
  E: None of these
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let the height of the tower be h and the distance of the car from the base of the tower be x.
Using trigonometry, we can write the following equations:
h/x = tan(45°) = 1
h/(x + vt) = tan(60°) = √3
where v is the speed of the car and t is the time taken to reach the base of the tower.
We need to find t.
Solving the above equations, we get:
x = h
x + vt = h/√3
Substituting x = h, we get:
h + vt = h/√3
t = (h/√3 - h)/v
We know that the time taken for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60° is 10 minutes.
Using trigonometry, we can write:
tan(60°) = h/(x + vt1)
where t1 is the time taken for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°.
Substituting x = h and t1 = 10 minutes, we get:
√3 = h/(h + 10v/√3)
Solving for h, we get:
h = 10v/(√3 - 1)
Substituting this value of h in the expression for t, we get:
t = 5(√3 + 1)
Action: Answer("A")
