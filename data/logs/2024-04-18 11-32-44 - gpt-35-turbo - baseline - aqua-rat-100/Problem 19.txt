Question: A jeep travels a certain distance taking 6 hours in the forward journey. During the return journey, it increased its speed by 12km/hr and took 4 hours. What is the distance travelled by the jeep?
Choices:
  A: 126km
  B: 144km
  C: 127km
  D: 228km
  E: 128km
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let's use the formula: Distance = Speed x Time
Let's assume the speed of the jeep on the forward journey is S km/hr.
On the return journey, the speed of the jeep is (S+12) km/hr.
Let's assume the distance travelled by the jeep is D km.
Using the formula, we can create two equations:
Forward journey: D = S x 6
Return journey: D = (S+12) x 4
We can solve for D by equating the two equations.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
