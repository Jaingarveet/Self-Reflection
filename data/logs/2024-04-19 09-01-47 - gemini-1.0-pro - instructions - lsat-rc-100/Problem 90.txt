Topic: Law
Context: Music and literature, rivals among the arts, have not coexisted without intruding on each other's terrain. Ever since what we think of as "literature" developed out of the sounds of spoken, sung, and chanted art, writing bas aspired to the condition of music, in which fonn contnbutes significantly to content. Nowhere is this truer than in the African American tradition, whose music is often considered its greatest artistic achievement and one of the greatest contributions to North American art. But while many African American writers have used musicians and music as theme and metaphor in their writing, none had attempted to draw upon a musical genre as the structuring principle for an entire novel until Toni Morrison did so in her 1992 novel Jazz, a novel set in the Harlem section of New York City in 1926 . In Jazz, the connection to music is found not only in the novel's plot but, more strikingly, in the way in which the story is told. The narration slips easily from the third-person omniscience of the narrator's disembodied voice-which, though sensitive and sympathetic, claims no particular identity, gender, or immersion in specific social circumstances-to the first-person lyricism of key characters. But throughout these shifts, the narrator is both generous with the characters' voices and protective of his or her mastery over the narrative as a whole. On the one hand, the central characters are given the responsibility of relating their parts of the overarching story, but on the other hand, their sections are set offby quotation maIks, reminders that the narrator is allowing them to speak.. In this way, the narrative is analogous in structure to the playing of a jazz hand which intertwines its ensemble sound with the individuality of emhedded solo perfunnances. In jazz, composer and conductor Duke Ellington was the first to construct his compositions with his individual musicians and their unique "voices" in mind. Yet no matter how lengthy his musicians' improvisations, no matter how bold or inventive their solos might be, they always performed within the undeniable logic of the composer's frame-they always, in other words, performed as ifwith quotation marks ar01md their improvisations and solos. It is this same effect that Toni Morrison has achieved in Jazz, a literary rendering of an art of composition that Duke Ellington perfected around the time in which Jazz is set. In this novel, Morrison has found a way, paradoxically, to create the sense of an ensemble of characters improvising within the fixed scope of a carefully constructed collective narration. By simulating the style of a genius of music while exhibiting Morrison's own linguistic virtuosity, Jazz serves to redefine the very possibilities of narrative point of view.
Question: Each of the following excerpts from the passage exhibits the author's attitude toward the novel Jazz EXCEPT:

  C: "The narration slips easily from the third-person omniscience of the narrator's disembodied voice ....." (lines 19-21)
  D: "... Morrison has found a way, paradoxically, to create the sense of an ensemble of characters improvising within the fixed scope ....." (lines 49-51)

## Self-Reflection on Previous Incorrect Answer:
**My previous answer:** "Action: Answer("A")"
**Reasoning behind the incorrect answer:** I mistakenly interpreted the phrase "greatest artistic achievement" as a negative statement, indicating that the author did not value the novel Jazz as highly as other forms of African American art.
**Correct answer:** "Action: Answer("B")"
**Reasoning behind the correct answer:** The excerpt "In Jazz, the connection to music is found not only in the novel's plot but, more strikingly, in the way in which the story is told" (lines 17-19) expresses a positive and appreciative attitude towards the novel's innovative narrative structure. The author highlights the connection between the novel's form and the art of jazz, suggesting that Morrison's approach is both unique and effective.
**Key takeaways from the mistake:**
* Pay close attention to the author's tone and word choice, especially when evaluating potentially ambiguous statements.
* Consider the overall context of the passage and the author's main argument when interpreting individual sentences or phrases.
* Be cautious of making assumptions based on limited information.
## Applying the learnings to the current question:
**Analyzing the answer choices:**
* **A:** This excerpt expresses a positive view of African American music, not the novel Jazz itself.
* **B:** This excerpt highlights the novel's innovative narrative structure, suggesting a positive attitude.
* **C:** This excerpt describes the narrator's voice, which is not directly related to the author's attitude towards the novel.
* **D:** This excerpt describes the novel's structure as a "paradoxical" blend of improvisation and fixed form, which could be interpreted as a criticism.
* **E:** This excerpt praises Morrison's linguistic virtuosity and her ability to simulate the style of jazz, suggesting a positive attitude.
**Conclusion:**
Based on the analysis, the excerpt that best represents the author's overall attitude towards the novel is **B**. The author clearly admires the novel's innovative narrative structure and its connection to the art of jazz.
