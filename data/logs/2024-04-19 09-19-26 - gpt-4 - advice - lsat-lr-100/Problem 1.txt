## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The statements indicate that it is either easy to grow cacti or easy to raise orange trees in most parts of the country. This implies that most parts of the country are either not humid (suitable for cacti) or not cold (suitable for orange trees). Therefore, the statement that most parts of the country are humid (choice E) must be false, as this would make it difficult to grow cacti in most parts of the country.
Action: Answer("E")
## Result:
Agent Answer: E
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
