## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:

The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: Which of the following is equivalent to $9^{\frac{3}{4}}$ ?
Choices:
  A: $\sqrt[3]{9}$
  B: $\sqrt[4]{9}$
  C: $\sqrt{3}$
  D: $3 \sqrt{3}$
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I made a calculation error.
The gap in my knowledge was not in geography but in basic arithmetic.
I knew the correct city and state but made a calculation error.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
To solve this problem, I need to understand that $9^{\frac{3}{4}}$ is equivalent to the cube root of the fourth root of 9, or the fourth root of the cube of 9.

Calculating the fourth root of 9, we get 3.
Then, calculating the cube of 3, we get 27.
Taking the fourth root of 27, we get 3.

Therefore, $9^{\frac{3}{4}}$ is equivalent to 3.

Action: Answer("D")

Explanation:
I made a calculation error in my previous answer.
The gap in my knowledge was not in the topic of the question but in basic arithmetic.
I knew the correct formula but made a calculation error.
To avoid this mistake in the future, I will double-check my calculations before submitting my answer.
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
