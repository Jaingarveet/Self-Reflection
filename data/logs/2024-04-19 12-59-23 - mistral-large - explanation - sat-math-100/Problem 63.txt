Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I misinterpreted the problem and did not correctly set up the equation to represent the situation.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The initial payment of $60 is subtracted from the total price of the television, leaving $240 to be paid off in weekly installments of $30.
The equation should represent the remaining balance after the initial payment, divided by the weekly payment amount.
