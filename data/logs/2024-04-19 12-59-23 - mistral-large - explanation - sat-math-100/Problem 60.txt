Explanation:
I made an error in my mathematical reasoning and calculation.
The gap in my knowledge was in algebraic manipulation and solving equations.
I incorrectly set up the equation and did not correctly simplify it to solve for x.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let x be the number of students in the class.
According to the problem, n - 3x = 5 and n + 21 = 4x.
Solving the first equation for n, we get n = 3x + 5.
Substituting this expression for n in the second equation, we get 3x + 5 + 21 = 4x.
Simplifying, we get x = 26.
Action: Answer("D")
