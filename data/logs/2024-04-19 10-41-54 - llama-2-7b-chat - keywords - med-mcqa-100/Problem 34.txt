## Assistant 2:
  Thought: 
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I will use my self-reflection to help me answer it correctly this time.
Spring catarrh is a type of hypersensitivity reaction, specifically type II.
Action: Answer("C")

Reflection:
I reflected on my previous answer and realized that I misunderstood the question. Spring catarrh is not a type of allergy, but rather a type of hypersensitivity reaction. Type II hypersensitivity reactions occur when the body produces antibodies against its own tissues, leading to inflammation and damage. This is the correct answer for the question.

Error Keywords:

* Hypersensitivity reaction
* Allergy
* Type I
* Type II
* Type IV
* Type V

Agent Answer: C
