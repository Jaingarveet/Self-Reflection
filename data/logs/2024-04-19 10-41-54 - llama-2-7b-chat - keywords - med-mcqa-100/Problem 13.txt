## Assistant 2:
  Thank you for providing me with the opportunity to reflect on my previous answer and improve my response. I apologize for any confusion caused by my previous mistake.

For the investigation of choice in pyloric stenosis, the correct answer is (C) CT.

During my self-reflection, I realized that I misunderstood the age range for which USG (Option A) is appropriate. USG is typically used in infants and young children, while CT is more suitable for older children and adults.

I also overlooked the non-invasive nature of CT, which is a more comfortable and safer option for patients compared to UGI series (Option B), which involves ingesting barium to visualize the upper gastrointestinal tract.

Lastly, I confused CT with MRI (Option D), which is not the appropriate investigation for pyloric stenosis. MRI is used to evaluate other conditions such as brain and spinal cord injuries, but it is not a diagnostic tool for pyloric stenosis.

In conclusion, the investigation of choice for pyloric stenosis is CT, and I will make sure to keep these key points in mind for future questions. Thank you for the opportunity to improve my response.
