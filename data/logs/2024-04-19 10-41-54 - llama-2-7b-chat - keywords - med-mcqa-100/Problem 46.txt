## Assistant 2:
  Thought: 
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand the mistake. I will use my self-reflection to help me answer the question correctly this time.

Action: Review the choices and the correct answer.

Reflection:
I misidentified the answer as "A: RPGN" when it should have been "C: Membranous GN". I confused the term "crescent-shaped deposits" with the term "RPGN", which stands for "Renal Pelvic Nephrolithiasis". I also misunderstood the question and thought it was asking about a different type of glomerulonephritis.

To answer the question correctly, I will select "C: Membranous GN" as the answer.

Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
