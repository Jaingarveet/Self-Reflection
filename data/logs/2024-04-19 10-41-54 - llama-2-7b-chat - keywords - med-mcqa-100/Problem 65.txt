Choices:
  A: Petroleum jellies
  B: Observation alone
  C: Surgery
  D: Antibiotic coverage

Self-Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, stating that the treatment for post-radiation skin lesions like desquamation was observation alone. However, upon further reflection, I realize that the correct answer is surgery.

The treatment for post-radiation skin lesions like desquamation is surgical excision. This involves removing the affected skin lesion surgically to prevent further spread and promote healing. Observation alone is not a sufficient treatment for this condition, as it may lead to further spread and complications.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) Surgery.
