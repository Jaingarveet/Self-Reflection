## Assistant 2:
  Thought: I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I would like to reflect on my thought process to improve my response.

I realized that I misunderstood the context of the question and overlooked the importance of safety during pregnancy. I mistakenly selected option A, Propylthiouracil, which is not recommended for use during pregnancy due to its potential teratogenic effects.

To answer the question correctly, I will consider the safety profile of each drug during pregnancy. According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), methimazole is the safest antithyroid drug to use during pregnancy, as it has been shown to be effective in controlling hyperthyroidism without causing fetal harm. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) Methimazole.

Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: A
