## Assistant 2:
  Reflection:

I previously answered this question incorrectly, stating that the sticky polysaccharide present in dental plaque is dextran. However, upon further reflection, I realize that the correct answer is actually dextrin. I made this mistake due to confusion between the two terms, which are similar in spelling and pronunciation.

To ensure accuracy, I will carefully review the information provided in the question and use my knowledge of dental plaque and its composition to select the correct answer.

Action: Answer("B")
