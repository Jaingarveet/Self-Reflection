## System:
You are an expert in Logic.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Context: The football game in the "Master Cup 2003 China Robot Competition" is in progress.Three professors predicted the final result? Professor Zhao said? "The champion is not the Tsinghua University team nor the Zhejiang University team." Professor Qian said ? "The champion is not the Tsinghua University team, but the University of Science and Technology of China." Professor Sun said? "The champion is not the China University of Science and Technology team, but the Tsinghua University team.The results of the competition showed that only one of them judged both, one 'S judgment is one-to-one wrong, the other one is wrong.

## Assistant 2:
## Reflection on Previous Attempt:
In my previous attempt, I made an error in interpreting the information about the professors' predictions and the outcome. I focused too much on the individual statements and failed to analyze the combined implications of "only one judged both" and "one's judgment is one-to-one wrong, the other one is wrong." This led me to an incorrect conclusion.
## Improved Approach:
1. **Analyze Combined Information:**  The key to solving this problem lies in understanding the combined meaning of the statements about the professors' judgments. Since only one professor got both parts of their prediction right, and another got both parts wrong, the third professor must have one part right and one part wrong.
2. **Evaluate Each Professor's Statements:**
    * **Professor Zhao:** If Zhao is correct about the champion not being Tsinghua or Zhejiang, then both Qian (who said Tsinghua wouldn't win) and Sun (who said Tsinghua would win) would be wrong in one part of their prediction. This contradicts the given information that only one professor got both parts wrong. Therefore, **Zhao must be wrong on both counts**. This means both Tsinghua and Zhejiang are still potential winners.
    * **Professor Qian:** If Qian is correct, then Tsinghua wouldn't be the winner, but the University of Science and Technology of China would be. This would make Sun wrong on both counts (Tsinghua not winning, and USTC winning). Since we know only one professor is entirely wrong, **Qian cannot be entirely correct**. This means either Tsinghua is the winner, or USTC is not the winner.
    * **Professor Sun:** If Sun is correct, then Tsinghua would be the winner, and USTC wouldn't be. This would make Qian wrong on both counts (Tsinghua winning, and USTC not winning). Since we know only one professor is entirely wrong, **Sun's statement could be entirely correct**.
3. **Deduce the Winner:** Based on the above analysis, we know:
    * Zhao is wrong on both counts, so both Tsinghua and Zhejiang are potential winners.
    * Qian cannot be entirely correct, so either Tsinghua is the winner, or USTC is not.
    * Sun could be entirely correct, meaning Tsinghua is the winner and USTC is not.
Therefore, the only possibility that satisfies all conditions is: **Tsinghua University Team is the winner.**
**Action: Answer("A")**
