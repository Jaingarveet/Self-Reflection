Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Logic
Context: The Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge, built in 1968, has a clear height of 24 meters in the Fengshui area.Theoretically, it can pass a maximum of 3,000 tons of ships.Today, with the rapid economic development, it has become a building that “cuts the waist” of the Yangtze River waterway and hinders the passage of giant ships.A bridge expert asserted that the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge must be demolished and rebuilt in order to dredge the golden waterways of the Yangtze River completely.
Question: If any of the following is true, can you raise the most doubts about this expert's point of view?
Choices:
  A: Due to the inability of large ships to pass through the Nanjing Bridge, a large number of exported goods in the middle and upper reaches of the Yangtze River can only be taken by road or railway.
  B: 99% of international ships entering the Yangtze River are moored at ports below the Nanjing Bridge, and dozens of foreign trade terminals above Nanjing rarely have large external ships berthed.
  C: It is not enough to dismantle only the Nanjing Bridge.The Yangtze River Bridge, which was built in Wuhu, Tongling, Anqing and other places, has a clear height of 24 meters.
  D: Shipbuilding technology is highly developed, and 8000-ton ships designed for adapting to the passage of the Yangtze River abroad have passed through Nanjing to Wuhan.

## Assistant 2:
## Reflection on Previous Attempt:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, likely due to a misunderstanding of the prompt's objective. The goal was to identify the option that casts the most doubt on the expert's claim, not the one that supports it. 
## Analysis of Choices:
* **A:** This option supports the expert's claim by highlighting the negative impact of the bridge on transportation.
* **B:** This option casts doubt on the expert's claim by suggesting that the bridge's impact on international shipping is minimal, as most large ships dock below the bridge anyway.
* **C:** This option suggests that dismantling the Nanjing bridge alone wouldn't solve the problem, as other bridges also have height limitations. This weakens the expert's argument for solely focusing on the Nanjing bridge.
* **D:** This option directly contradicts the expert's claim by showing that large ships designed for the Yangtze River can already pass through the Nanjing bridge.
## Conclusion:
**Option D** raises the most doubt about the expert's viewpoint by demonstrating that the bridge's height limitations are not an insurmountable obstacle for large ships. 
**Action: Answer("D")** 
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
