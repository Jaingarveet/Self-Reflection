## Assistant 2:
## Reflection on Previous Attempt:
Unfortunately, I don't have access to the previous attempt and reflection as my memory is limited to interactions within this current session. However, I can still analyze the problem and provide the best possible answer based on the given information. 
## Analysis:
1. **Three employers**: Tianshu, Tianji, and Tianxuan.
2. **Five graduates**: Zhang, Wang, Li, Zhao, and Liu.
3. **Conditions**:
    - Li works at Tianshu (from statement 1).
    - Li and Zhao work at different places (from statement 2).
    - Liu and Zhao work at the same place (from statement 3).
    - If Zhang is at Tianxuan, then Wang is also at Tianxuan (from statement 4).
## Deductions:
- Since Li is at Tianshu and cannot be with Zhao, then Zhao and Liu must be at either Tianji or Tianxuan.
- We don't have enough information to pinpoint the exact location of Zhang and Wang.
## Evaluating Choices:
A: Li and Liu being in the same unit is impossible as Li is at Tianshu and Liu is with Zhao (not at Tianshu).
B: This could be possible as Zhao and Liu could be at Tianji, and Wang's location is uncertain.
C: This is impossible as Liu is always with Zhao.
D: This is uncertain as we don't have enough information about Wang and Zhang's locations.
## Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the only option that could be correct is B.
**Action: Answer("B")** 
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
