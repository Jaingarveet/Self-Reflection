## Reflection on Previous Attempt:
Unfortunately, I don't have access to the information about my previous attempt and your reflection on it as it's marked as [REDACTED]. However, I can still analyze the current problem and provide the best possible answer based on the given context and clues.
## Step-by-Step Reasoning:
