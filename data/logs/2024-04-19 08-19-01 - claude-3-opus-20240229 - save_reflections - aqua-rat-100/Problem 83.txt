## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I made an error in my reasoning about how to account for the repeated letter 'C' in the word "PROBLEC". I incorrectly thought that I needed to divide the total number of permutations by 2! to account for the repeated letter. However, the correct approach is to directly calculate the number of permutations of 7 distinct objects, which is simply 7!.
Error Keywords:
 - Permutations with repetition error
 - Overcorrection for repeated elements
 - Misunderstanding of permutation formula
Solution:
The word "PROBLEC" contains 7 letters. Although the letter 'C' is repeated, we are told that we need to rearrange the letters such that none of the letters repeat. This means we should treat each 'C' as distinct, like 'C1' and 'C2'.
So, we effectively have 7 distinct letters: P, R, O, B, L, E, C1, C2.
The number of ways to arrange n distinct objects is given by n!.
Here, n = 7. So the number of ways to rearrange "PROBLEC" such that no letters repeat is 7! = 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 5040.
Therefore, the correct answer is C: 7!.
Instructions:
1. Count the total number of letters in the word.
2. Determine if the question is asking about permutations with or without repetition.
3. If the question asks about permutations without repetition (i.e., all letters are considered distinct), then the number of permutations is simply n!, where n is the total number of letters.
4. If the question asks about permutations with repetition, then you need to divide n! by the product of the factorials of the number of repetitions for each repeated element.
5. Select the answer choice that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully to understand what type of permutation is being asked for (with or without repetition).
 - Remember that for permutations without repetition, the formula is simply n!, where n is the number of distinct objects.
 - For permutations with repetition, you need to account for the repeated elements by dividing n! by the product of the factorials of the number of repetitions for each repeated element.
 - Always double-check your understanding of the problem and your calculations before selecting your answer.
