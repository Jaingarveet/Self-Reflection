Explanation:
I made an error in my calculation of the minimum selling price per unit. I correctly set up the problem and followed the right steps, but I made a small arithmetic mistake in the final step that led me to select the wrong answer choice.
Error Keywords:
 - Arithmetic error
 - Division error
 - Rounding error
 - Incorrect answer selection
Solution:
1. The company produces 420 units per month.
2. The production cost per unit is $110.
3. They want a yearly profit of at least $626,400.
To find the minimum selling price, we need to:
1. Calculate the yearly production
   - Yearly production = 420 units/month * 12 months = 5,040 units
2. Calculate the yearly production cost
   - Yearly production cost = 5,040 units * $110/unit = $554,400
3. Add the desired profit to the yearly production cost to get the total revenue needed
   - Total revenue needed = Yearly production cost + Desired profit
   - Total revenue needed = $554,400 + $626,400 = $1,180,800
4. Divide the total revenue needed by the yearly production to get the minimum selling price per unit
   - Minimum selling price per unit = Total revenue needed / Yearly production
   - Minimum selling price per unit = $1,180,800 / 5,040 units = $234.2857... per unit
   - Rounding up, the minimum selling price per unit is $235
The correct answer choice is B: $230, as this is the minimum selling price from the given options that is greater than or equal to the calculated $234.29 per unit.
Instructions:
1. Identify the relevant information: monthly production, production cost per unit, desired yearly profit.
2. Calculate the yearly production by multiplying monthly production by 12.
3. Calculate the yearly production cost by multiplying yearly production by the production cost per unit.
4. Calculate the total revenue needed by adding the desired yearly profit to the yearly production cost.
5. Calculate the minimum selling price per unit by dividing the total revenue needed by the yearly production.
6. Round up the calculated minimum selling price to the nearest whole number.
7. Select the answer choice that is the smallest value greater than or equal to the calculated minimum selling price.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and identify the key information.
 - Break down the problem into clear, logical steps.
 - Double-check your arithmetic at each step, especially in the final calculation.
 - When selecting from multiple choice options, compare your calculated answer to each option.
 - If your exact calculated value is not an option, select the nearest option that satisfies the problem's conditions.
 - In profit calculations, remember that the selling price must be high enough to cover costs and desired profit.
