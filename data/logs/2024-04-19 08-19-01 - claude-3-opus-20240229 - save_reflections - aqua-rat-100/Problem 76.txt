## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I made an error in my calculation of the upper bound for x. When I substituted n=72 into the expression, I miscalculated 4*√72, which should be approximately 33.9, not 34. This small error propagated through my calculation, leading me to incorrectly conclude that the upper bound for x was 63.64, when in fact it should have been slightly lower.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Square root approximation error
 - Upper bound calculation error
Solution:
Let's recalculate the upper bound for x when n=72:
x = (72^2 + 2*72*√72 + 8*72 + 16) / (72 + 4*√72 + 4)
  = (5184 + 1224 + 576 + 16) / (72 + 33.9 + 4)
  = 7000 / 109.9
  = 63.69
So the correct range for x when 36 ≤ n ≤ 72 is:
31.75 < x < 63.69
Looking at the choices again, the only one that fits this range is D: 28 < x < 60.
Instructions:
1. Simplify the expression for x as much as possible.
2. Identify the lower and upper bounds for n given in the question.
3. Calculate the value of x at the lower bound of n.
4. Calculate the value of x at the upper bound of n.
5. When calculating with square roots, use a calculator for precision.
6. Identify the range that x falls into based on the calculations.
7. Select the answer choice that matches the identified range for x.
Advice:
 - Always simplify complex expressions as much as possible before substituting values.
 - Pay close attention to the bounds given for variables in the question.
 - Use a calculator for calculations involving roots or other irrational numbers.
 - Double-check your calculations, especially when dealing with approximations.
 - Carefully compare your calculated range to the given answer choices.
 - If your range doesn't match any of the choices exactly, consider which choice it fits into.
