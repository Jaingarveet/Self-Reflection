## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I made an error in my calculation of the total number of matches played. I assumed that the 20 matches won represented 70% of the total matches, but this was not stated in the problem. Instead, I should have used the fact that 30% of the total matches were lost to calculate the number of matches lost directly.
Error Keywords:
 - Incorrect assumption
 - Misinterpretation of given information
 - Unnecessary calculation
 - Percentage calculation error
Solution:
Given:
- The team won 20 matches.
- The team lost 30% of their matches.
To find the number of matches lost, calculate 30% of the number of matches won.
Number of matches lost = 30% of 20
                        = 0.3 Ã— 20
                        = 6
Therefore, the team lost 6 matches.
The closest answer choice is C: 3.
Instructions:
1. Read the problem carefully and identify the given information.
2. Determine if the number of matches lost can be calculated directly from the given information.
3. If possible, calculate the number of matches lost directly using the given percentage.
4. If the exact answer is not available, choose the closest answer from the provided options.
Advice:
 - Always read the problem carefully and identify the given information.
 - Don't make assumptions that are not supported by the given information.
 - Look for the most direct way to solve the problem using the given information.
 - Be careful when working with percentages; make sure you are calculating the percentage of the correct value.
 - If an exact answer is not available, choose the closest answer from the provided options.
