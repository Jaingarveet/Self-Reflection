## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Reason for Incorrect Answer:**
My initial reasoning was flawed. While I correctly identified that Franco and Garcia could not testify on the same day and that Iturbe would testify on Wednesday, I failed to consider the constraint that exactly two witnesses must testify on Tuesday. This led me to incorrectly conclude that Franco and Garcia would both testify on Tuesday, leaving Hong as the only option for Monday.
**Error Keywords:**
* **Logical Reasoning Error:** I made an error in my logical deduction, failing to account for all the given constraints.
* **Oversight:** I overlooked the constraint about the number of witnesses testifying on Tuesday.
* **Incomplete Analysis:** My analysis was incomplete, focusing only on specific constraints and not considering the overall picture.
## Solution with Correct Answer
**Step 1: Identify Constraints:**
* Jackson testifies on Monday.
* Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
* Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
* Franco and Garcia cannot testify on the same day.
**Step 2: Apply Constraints:**
* Since Jackson is the only witness on Monday, Franco and Garcia cannot be on Monday.
* Iturbe is on Wednesday, leaving Tuesday for Franco and Garcia.
* To fulfill the constraint of two witnesses on Tuesday, both Franco and Garcia must be on Tuesday.
* This leaves Hong as the only option for Wednesday.
**Step 3: Verify:**
* Jackson - Monday
* Franco and Garcia - Tuesday
* Hong - Wednesday
* Iturbe - Wednesday
This schedule satisfies all the given constraints.
