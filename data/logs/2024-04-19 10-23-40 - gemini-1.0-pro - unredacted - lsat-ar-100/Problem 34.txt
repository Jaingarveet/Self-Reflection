## System:
You are an expert in Law.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## User 2:
Topic: Law
Context: A panel of five scientists will be formed. The panelists will be selected from among three botanists—F, G, and H—three chemists—K, L, and M—and three zoologists—P, Q, and R. Selection is governed by the following conditions: The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types. If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. F and K cannot both be selected. K and M cannot both be selected. If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
Question: If P is the only zoologist selected, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: If K is selected, G cannot be selected.
  B: If L is selected, F cannot be selected.
  C: If exactly one chemist is selected, it must be K.
  D: If exactly two chemists are selected, F cannot be selected.
  E: If exactly two chemists are selected, G cannot be selected.

## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:**
My initial reasoning was flawed. While I correctly identified that P being the only zoologist selected implies at most one botanist, I failed to consider the implications of this constraint on the selection of chemists. My subsequent deductions about the selection of F, G, K, and L based on the selection of one or two chemists were therefore incorrect.
**Error Keywords:**
* **Logical reasoning error:** I made an error in applying the constraint about the selection of botanists to the selection of chemists.
* **Overgeneralization:** I incorrectly assumed that the constraint on the selection of botanists applied to all chemists, regardless of whether K or L were selected.
* **Incomplete analysis:** I did not fully consider all possible scenarios for the selection of chemists given the constraint on the selection of botanists.
**Solution:**
1. **Identify the constraint:** P is the only zoologist selected, so at most one botanist is selected.
2. **Analyze the implications for chemists:**
    * If K is selected, then F cannot be selected (given the constraint).
    * If L is selected, there is no restriction on the selection of F or G.
    * If exactly one chemist is selected, it could be either K or L.
    * If exactly two chemists are selected, both K and L must be selected (given the constraint).
3. **Evaluate the answer choices:**
    * A is incorrect because if K is selected, G can be selected if L is not selected.
    * B is incorrect because if L is selected, F can be selected if K is not selected.
    * C is incorrect because if L is selected, it could be the only chemist selected.
    * **D is correct:** If exactly two chemists are selected, both K and L must be selected, and therefore F cannot be selected.
    * E is incorrect because if L is selected, G can be selected if K is not selected.
**Instructions for Future Problems:**
1. Carefully read and understand the problem and all constraints.
2. Break down the problem into smaller, more manageable steps.
3. Analyze each step logically and consider all possible scenarios.
4. Do not make assumptions or overgeneralizations.
5. Double-check your reasoning and calculations before selecting an answer.
**General Advice:**
* Be mindful of logical fallacies and common reasoning errors.
* Pay close attention to details and specific conditions.
* Consider all possible scenarios and exceptions.
* Use a systematic approach to problem-solving.
* Double-check your work and be willing to revise your thinking if necessary.
By following these guidelines, I can improve my accuracy and avoid similar mistakes in the future.
