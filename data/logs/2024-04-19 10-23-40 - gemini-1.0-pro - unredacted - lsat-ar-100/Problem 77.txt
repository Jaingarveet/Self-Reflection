## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:**
My initial analysis of the rules was partially correct. I identified that the third rule limited Young to spaces #5 or #6 and Robertson to spaces #1, #2, #3, or #4. However, I failed to recognize the implications of the fourth rule, which further restricted Robertson's options.
**Error Keywords:**
* Incomplete analysis
* Overlooking implications
* Misinterpretation of rules
**Solution:**
1. **Identify all applicable rules:** 
    * Young > Togowa
    * Xu > Souza
    * Robertson > Young
    * Robertson in #1, #2, #3, or #4
2. **Analyze the impact of each rule:**
    * Rule 1 and 2: No direct limitations on assignments.
    * Rule 3: Limits Young to #5 or #6 and Robertson to #1, #2, #3, or #4.
    * Rule 4: Further restricts Robertson to #1, #2, or #3.
3. **Combine the limitations:**
    * Young: #5 or #6
    * Robertson: #1, #2, or #3
    * Togowa: Any except #6 (due to rule 1)
    * Souza: Any except #5 (due to rule 2)
    * Xu: Any except #4 or below (due to rule 2)
4. **Count employees with limited options:**
    * Young and Robertson have only two possible spaces each.
    * Togowa, Souza, and Xu have more than two options.
**Instructions for Future:**
1. Read and understand all rules thoroughly.
2. Analyze each rule's impact individually and in combination with others.
3. Consider all possible scenarios and limitations.
4. Double-check calculations and logical deductions.
5. If unsure, seek clarification or re-evaluate the problem.
**General Advice:**
* Break down complex problems into smaller, manageable steps.
* Visualize the problem and potential solutions.
* Use diagrams or tables to organize information.
* Test different scenarios and assumptions.
* Be mindful of potential biases or assumptions.
* Don't hesitate to seek help or clarification when needed.
By following these steps and advice, I can improve my accuracy and problem-solving skills in similar legal scenarios.
