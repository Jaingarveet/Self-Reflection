## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:**
My initial answer was incorrect because I misinterpreted the information about the second batch of sugar cookies. I mistakenly assumed that the second batch of sugar cookies had to be made on a different day than the first batch, which led me to eliminate options A and D. However, the prompt only stated that the second batch of sugar cookies was made on Thursday, not that it couldn't be made on the same day as the first batch.
**Error Keywords:**
* Misinterpretation
* Assumption
* Overlooking information
**Solution:**
1. **Identify the constraints:**
    * No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
    * At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
    * The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
    * The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
2. **Start with the given information:**
    * Since the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, the first batch must be made on a different day (Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday).
    * Since the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies, and at least one batch of cookies is made on Monday, the first batch of oatmeal cookies and the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Monday.
3. **Fill in the remaining batches:**
    * The third batch of oatmeal cookies can be made on Wednesday or Thursday.
    * The third batch of peanut butter cookies can be made on Wednesday or Thursday.
    * The third batch of sugar cookies can be made on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday.
4. **Check all options:**
    * Only option A satisfies all the constraints and the given information.

1. Carefully read and understand all the information provided in the prompt.
2. Identify the key constraints and requirements.
3. Start with the given information and work step-by-step to fill in the remaining details.
4. Consider all possible scenarios and eliminate options that violate the constraints.
5. Double-check your reasoning and calculations before selecting an answer.
**General Advice:**
* Be mindful of assumptions and avoid jumping to conclusions.
