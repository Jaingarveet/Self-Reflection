Topic: Law
Context: A maintenance company that takes service requests from three clients—Image, Solide, and Truvest—plans to set targets for its average service response times. Service targets will be set at 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day. Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail. The six targets are set according to the following conditions: None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
Question: If none of the clients has a website target of 2 days, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Image's website target is shorter than Solide's.
  B: Solide's website target is shorter than Image's.
  C: Solide's voicemail target is shorter than Truvest's.
  D: Truvest's website target is shorter than Image's.
  E: Truvest's voicemail target is shorter than Solide's.

## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:**
My initial analysis of the conditions was correct. However, I made a mistake when evaluating the individual choices. I failed to consider all possible combinations of website and voicemail targets for each client while ensuring compliance with the given conditions. This led me to incorrectly eliminate options A, B, and D.
**Error Keywords:**
* Incomplete analysis
* Overlooking possible combinations
* Inaccurate evaluation of choices
**Solution:**
1. **Identify the conditions:**
    * No client's website target is longer than its voicemail target.
    * Image's voicemail target is shorter than the other clients'.
    * Solide's website target is shorter than Truvest's website target.
2. **Create a table to systematically analyze all possible combinations:**
| Client | Website Target | Voicemail Target | Valid? |
|---|---|---|---|
| Image | 1 | 3 | Yes |
| Image | 1 | 2 | Yes |
| Image | 3 | 1 | No |
| Image | 3 | 2 | No |
| Solide | 1 | 3 | Yes |
| Solide | 1 | 2 | Yes |
| Solide | 3 | 1 | No |
| Solide | 3 | 2 | No |
| Truvest | 1 | 3 | Yes |
| Truvest | 1 | 2 | Yes |
| Truvest | 3 | 1 | No |
| Truvest | 3 | 2 | No |
3. **Evaluate each choice based on the table:**
    * A: Image's website target is shorter than Solide's. This is valid (e.g., Image: 1, Solide: 3).
    * B: Solide's website target is shorter than Image's. This is also valid (e.g., Image: 3, Solide: 1).
    * C: Solide's voicemail target is shorter than Truvest's. This is invalid because it violates the condition that Image's voicemail target must be the shortest.
    * D: Truvest's website target is shorter than Image's. This is valid (e.g., Image: 3, Truvest: 1).
    * E: Truvest's voicemail target is shorter than Solide's. This is invalid for the same reason as C.
**Instructions for Future:**
1. **Create a table or chart to systematically analyze all possible combinations.**
2. **Carefully evaluate each choice against all conditions and possible combinations.**
3. **Double-check your analysis and calculations before making a final decision.**
**General Advice:**
* **Break down complex problems into smaller, manageable steps.**
* **Use visual aids like tables or charts to organize information.**
* **Consider all possible scenarios and combinations.**
* **Double-check your work and reasoning before reaching a conclusion.**
* **Be mindful of common logical fallacies and biases.**
