Context: A maintenance company that takes service requests from three clients—Image, Solide, and Truvest—plans to set targets for its average service response times. Service targets will be set at 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day. Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail. The six targets are set according to the following conditions: None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
Question: Which one of the following targets CANNOT be set for more than one of the clients?
Choices:
  A: a 1-day website target

## Assistant 2:
## Thought Process:
1. **Conditions:**
    - No client's website target can be longer than its voicemail target.
    - Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
    - Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
2. **Analyzing Choices:**
    - **A: 1-day website target:** This could be set for multiple clients as long as their voicemail targets are also 1 day or less.
    - **B: 2-day voicemail target:** This could be set for multiple clients as long as their website targets are also 2 days or less.
    - **C: 2-day website target:** This could be set for multiple clients as long as their voicemail targets are also 2 days or less.
    - **D: 3-day voicemail target:** This could only be set for one client (Image) because its voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
    - **E: 3-day website target:** This could be set for multiple clients as long as their voicemail targets are also 3 days or less.
3. **Conclusion:**
Based on the analysis, only a **3-day voicemail target** can be set for only one client (Image) due to the specific condition regarding Image's voicemail target.
