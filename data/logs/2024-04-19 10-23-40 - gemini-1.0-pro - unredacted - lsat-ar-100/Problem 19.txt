## User 2:
Topic: Law
Context: Of the eight students—George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert—in a seminar, exactly six will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
Question: If Helen, Kyle, and Lenore, not necessarily in that order, give the three morning reports, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Helen gives a report on Monday.
  B: Irving gives a report on Monday.
  C: Irving gives a report on Wednesday.
  D: Kyle gives a report on Tuesday.
  E: Kyle gives a report on Wednesday.

I incorrectly stated the answer in the format of a thought process instead of the required format. 
The gap in my knowledge was not in law but in following instructions. 
I knew the correct answer but failed to format it correctly.
Error Keywords:
 - Formatting error
 - Instruction error
 - Answer format error
Solution:
Since Helen, Kyle, and Lenore give the morning reports, they cannot give reports on the same day.
Since George can only give a report on Tuesday, he cannot give a morning report.
Therefore, George must give an afternoon report on Tuesday.
Since Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports, one of them must give a morning report on Tuesday.
If Olivia gives the morning report on Tuesday, then Robert must give the afternoon report on Monday.
If Robert gives the morning report on Tuesday, then Olivia must give the afternoon report on Monday.
In either case, Nina cannot give a report on Monday.
Therefore, Nina must give a report on Tuesday or Wednesday.
If Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Wednesday.
If Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Tuesday.
Therefore, Irving cannot give a report on Monday.
So the answer is B.
