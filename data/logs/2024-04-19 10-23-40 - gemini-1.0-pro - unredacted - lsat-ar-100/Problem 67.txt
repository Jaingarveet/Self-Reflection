Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
My initial answer was incorrect because I focused on the information about Tuesday and Wednesday without considering the full context of the problem. While I correctly identified that at least two batches were made on Tuesday, I failed to recognize the implications of the second batch of sugar cookies being made on Thursday.
## Error Analysis
Here's a breakdown of my errors:
* **Overlooking information:** I focused on the information about Tuesday and Wednesday but neglected the fact that the second batch of sugar cookies was made on Thursday.
* **Incomplete analysis:** I didn't consider all the constraints and how they interacted with each other.
* **Jumping to conclusions:** I concluded that at least two batches were made on Tuesday without considering the impact on other days.
## Step-by-Step Solution
1. **Identify the days with no batches:** Wednesday has no batches.
2. **Analyze the second batch of sugar cookies:** This batch is made on Thursday.
3. **Consider the first batch of sugar cookies:** Since no batches are made on Wednesday, the first batch of sugar cookies must be made on either Monday or Tuesday.
4. **Analyze the second batch of oatmeal cookies:** This batch is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
5. **Consider the first batch of peanut butter cookies:** Since no batches are made on Wednesday, the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on either Monday or Tuesday.
6. **Combine the information:** We know the second batch of sugar cookies is on Thursday, and the first batch could be on Monday or Tuesday. We also know the second batch of oatmeal and the first batch of peanut butter are on the same day, which could be Monday or Tuesday.
7. **Analyze possible scenarios:**
    * **Scenario 1:** First batch of sugar cookies on Monday, second batch of oatmeal/first batch of peanut butter on Tuesday. This leaves Friday for the remaining batches of oatmeal and peanut butter, resulting in 3 batches on Friday.
    * **Scenario 2:** First batch of sugar cookies on Tuesday, second batch of oatmeal/first batch of peanut butter on Monday. This leaves Friday for the remaining batches of oatmeal and peanut butter, resulting in 3 batches on Friday.
8. **Conclusion:** In both scenarios, exactly three batches are made on Friday. Therefore, the correct answer is B.
