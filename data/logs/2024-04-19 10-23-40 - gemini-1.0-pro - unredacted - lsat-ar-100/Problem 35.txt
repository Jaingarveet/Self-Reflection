Context: A bakery makes exactly three kinds of cookieâ€”oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar. Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day. The following conditions apply: No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
