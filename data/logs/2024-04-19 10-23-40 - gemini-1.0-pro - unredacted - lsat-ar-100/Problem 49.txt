Context: A shopping center has exactly seven spaces—space 1 through space 7—arranged in a straight row. Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
Question: Which one of the following could be the order of the businesses in spaces 1 through 7 respectively?

  A: pharmacy, optometrist, shoe store, restaurant, veterinarian, toy store, restaurant

Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I made a mistake in interpreting the constraints and did not correctly identify all possible valid arrangements.
Error Keywords:
 - Constraint misinterpretation
 - Incomplete analysis
 - Solution space oversight
Solution:
1. Pharmacy at one end, restaurant at the other:
    - This leaves 5 spaces in the middle for the remaining 5 businesses.
2. Restaurants separated by at least 2 businesses:
    - This means there must be at least 1 business between them, and they cannot be adjacent.
3. Pharmacy next to optometrist or veterinarian:
    - This leaves 2 options for the pharmacy's placement.
4. Toy store not next to veterinarian:
    - This further restricts the placement options.
5. Consider all possible arrangements that satisfy the constraints.
Instructions:
1. Carefully read and understand all constraints.
2. Identify all possible valid arrangements that satisfy the constraints.
3. Do not prematurely eliminate options without thorough analysis.
4. Consider all possible permutations and combinations.
5. Double-check your analysis and reasoning to ensure all constraints are met.
6. Choose the answer that represents all valid arrangements.
Advice:
 - Be meticulous in interpreting and applying constraints.
 - Consider all possible scenarios and permutations.
 - Avoid making assumptions or jumping to conclusions.
 - Double-check your analysis and reasoning to ensure accuracy.
 - When multiple valid solutions exist, identify and present all of them.
