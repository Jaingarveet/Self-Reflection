You are an expert in Law.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Topic: Law
Context: A government needs to assign new ambassadors to Venezuela, Yemen, and Zambia. The candidates for these ambassadorships are Jaramillo, Kayne, Landon, Novetzke, and Ong. One ambassador will be assigned to each country, and no ambassador will be assigned to more than one country. The assignment of the ambassadors must meet the following constraints: Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships. If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne. If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen. If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
Question: Which one of the following CANNOT be true?
Choices:
  A: Jaramillo is assigned as ambassador to Zambia.
  B: Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Zambia.
  C: Novetzke is assigned as ambassador to Zambia.
  D: Landon is not assigned to an ambassadorship.
  E: Ong is not assigned to an ambassadorship.

## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
I incorrectly identified statement E as impossible. My reasoning was flawed because I overlooked the possibility that Ong could be assigned to Yemen, thus satisfying the constraint that either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
## Error Keywords
* **Oversight:** I failed to consider all possible scenarios.
* **Logical Fallacy:** I made a hasty generalization by assuming that Ong's exclusion from Venezuela automatically meant his exclusion from all ambassadorships.
* **Constraint Violation:** I misinterpreted the constraint, focusing solely on Venezuela instead of considering all possible assignments.
## Step-by-Step Solution
1. **Identify the constraints:**
    * Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
    * If Jaramillo is assigned, Kayne must also be assigned.
    * If Ong is assigned to Venezuela, Kayne cannot be assigned to Yemen.
    * Landon, if assigned, goes to Zambia.
2. **Analyze each statement:**
    * A: Jaramillo to Zambia - Possible (doesn't violate any constraint).
    * B: Kayne to Zambia - Possible (doesn't violate any constraint).
    * C: Novetzke to Zambia - Possible (doesn't violate any constraint).
    * D: Landon not assigned - Possible (doesn't violate any constraint).
    * E: Ong not assigned - **Impossible** (violates the constraint that either Kayne or Novetzke must be assigned).
3. **Identify the correct answer:** C: Novetzke to Zambia.
## Instructions for Future Problems
1. **Read and understand all constraints carefully.**
2. **Consider all possible scenarios before drawing conclusions.**
3. **Avoid making assumptions or generalizations.**
4. **Double-check your reasoning and ensure it aligns with all constraints.**
5. **Systematically analyze each statement and identify any violations.**
## General Advice for Similar Problems
* **Break down complex problems into smaller, manageable steps.**
* **Use logical reasoning and deduction to analyze each statement.**
* **Be mindful of potential logical fallacies and biases.**
* **Double-check your work and ensure all constraints are met.**
* **Consider alternative solutions and explore different scenarios.**
By following these steps and advice, I can improve my accuracy and avoid similar mistakes in the future.
