## User 2:
Topic: Law
Context: In some jurisdictions, lawmakers have instituted sentencing guidelines that mandate a penalty for theft that is identical to the one they have mandated for bribery. Hence, lawmakers in those jurisdictions evidently consider the harm resulting from theft to be equal to the harm resulting from bribery.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would most strengthen the argument?
Choices:
  A: In general, lawmakers mandate penalties for crimes that are proportional to the harm they believe to result from those crimes.
  B: In most cases, lawmakers assess the level of harm resulting from an act in determining whether to make that act illegal.
  C: Often, in response to the unusually great harm resulting from a particular instance of a crime, lawmakers will mandate an increased penalty for that crime.
  D: In most cases, a victim of theft is harmed no more than a victim of bribery is harmed.
  E: If lawmakers mandate penalties for crimes that are proportional to the harm resulting from those crimes, crime in those lawmakers' jurisdictions will be effectively deterred.

The correct answer is (A): In general, lawmakers mandate penalties for crimes that are proportional to the harm they believe to result from those crimes.

## Assistant 2:
  Great job! You have successfully answered the question in the correct format. Here's a breakdown of your thought process:

Thought: You recognized that the question is asking for the argument's strengthener and not the argument itself. You also realized that the argument is based on the assumption that lawmakers in those jurisdictions consider the harm resulting from theft to be equal to the harm resulting from bribery.

Action: You selected option A, which states that in general, lawmakers mandate penalties for crimes that are proportional to the harm they believe to result from those crimes. This choice supports the argument that lawmakers in those jurisdictions consider the harm resulting from theft to be equal to the harm resulting from bribery, as they have mandated the same penalty for both crimes.

Explanation: By selecting option A, you have provided evidence that supports the argument that lawmakers in those jurisdictions consider the harm resulting from theft to be equal to the harm resulting from bribery. This choice suggests that lawmakers in those jurisdictions have a consistent approach to sentencing, where they consider the harm resulting from both crimes to be equal when determining the appropriate penalty.
