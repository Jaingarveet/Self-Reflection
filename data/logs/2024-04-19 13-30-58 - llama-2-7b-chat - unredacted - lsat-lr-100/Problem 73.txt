Topic: Law
Context: Many people say that the press should not pry into the personal lives of private individuals. But the press has the right to publish any story of interest to the public unless that story is libelous. So, if a story about a private individual is not libelous, the press has an obligation to publish it, for such information is clearly of interest to the public.

Choices:
  A: the press can publish nonlibelous stories about private individuals without prying into their personal lives
  B: one's having a right to do something entails one's having an obligation to do it
  C: the publishing of information about the personal lives of private individuals cannot be libelous
  D: if one has an obligation to do something then one has a right to do it
  E: the press's right to publish always outweighs the individual's right not to be libeled

Explanation:
The argument's reasoning is vulnerable to criticism because it assumes that if the press has the right to publish a nonlibelous story about a private individual, then it has an obligation to do so. However, this assumption is not necessarily true. The press has the right to publish information of interest to the public, but it does not necessarily have an obligation to pry into the personal lives of private individuals.

The correct answer is (B) One's having a right to do something entails one's having an obligation to do it. The argument assumes that if the press has the right to publish a nonlibelous story about a private individual, then it has an obligation to do so. However, this assumption is not necessarily true, as the press has the right to publish information of interest to the public but does not necessarily have an obligation to pry into the personal lives of private individuals.

The argument should provide more justification for why the press has an obligation to publish nonlibelous stories about private individuals beyond simply asserting that such information is of interest to the public. The argument should consider the privacy rights of private individuals and the limits of free speech in a society that values individual privacy and dignity.

In conclusion, the argument's reasoning is vulnerable to criticism because it assumes that the press has an obligation to publish nonlibelous stories about private individuals without providing sufficient justification for this assumption. The correct answer is (B) One's having a right to do something entails one's having an obligation to do it, as this option best captures the flaw in the argument's reasoning.
