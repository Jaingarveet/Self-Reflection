Topic: Law
Context: Most people who shop for groceries no more than three times a month buy prepared frozen dinners regularly. In Hallstown most people shop for groceries no more than three times a month. Therefore, in Hallstown most people buy prepared frozen dinners regularly.
Question: Which one of the following arguments has a flawed pattern of reasoning most like the flawed reasoning in the argument above?
Choices:
  A: It is clear that most drivers in West Ansland are safe drivers since there are very few driving accidents in West Ansland and most accidents there are not serious.
  B: It is clear that John cannot drive, since he does not own a car and no one in his family who does not own a car can drive.
  C: It is clear that Fernando's friends usually drive to school, since all of his friends can drive and all of his friends go to school.
  D: It is clear that most people in Highland County drive sedans, since most people who commute to work drive sedans and most people in Highland County commute to work.
  E: It is clear that most of Janine's friends are good drivers, since she accepts rides only from good drivers and she accepts rides from most of her friends.

Explanation:
The argument in the passage is an example of affirming the antecedent, which is a type of fallacy. The reasoning in the argument is flawed because it assumes that just because most people in Hallstown shop for groceries no more than three times a month, it follows that most people in Hallstown buy prepared frozen dinners regularly. However, this conclusion is not supported by any evidence or reasoning, and it ignores the possibility that some people in Hallstown may not buy prepared frozen dinners even if they shop for groceries frequently.

The correct answer is (D) Most people in Highland County drive sedans. This argument also uses affirming the antecedent, assuming that just because most people who commute to work drive sedans, it follows that most people in Highland County drive sedans. Like the original argument, this conclusion is not supported by any evidence or reasoning, and it ignores the possibility that some people in Highland County may not drive sedans.

Advice:

* Be aware of the affirming the antecedent fallacy, which occurs when a conclusion is based solely on the premise that the antecedent is true without considering any evidence or reasoning that might contradict the conclusion.
* Always consider alternative explanations and evidence that may contradict the conclusion.
* Avoid making assumptions about a conclusion based solely on the premise that the antecedent is true.
* Look for evidence and reasoning that supports the conclusion, rather than simply assuming it based on the premise.
