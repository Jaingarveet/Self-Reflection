Context: Economics professor: Marty's Pizza and Checkers Pizza are the two major pizza parlors in our town. Marty's sold coupon books including coupons good for one large plain pizza at any local pizza parlor, at Marty's expense. But Checkers refused to accept these coupons, even though they were redeemed by all other local pizza parlors. Accepting them would have cost Checkers nothing and would have satisfied those of its potential customers who had purchased the coupon books. This shows that Checkers's motive in refusing to accept the coupons was simply to hurt Marty's Pizza.
Question: Which one of the following, if assumed, enables the economics professor's conclusion to be properly drawn?
Choices:
  A: Any company that refuses to accept coupons issued by a competitor when doing so would satisfy some of the company's potential customers is motivated solely by the desire to hurt that competitor.
  B: Any company that wishes to hurt a competitor by refusing to accept coupons issued by that competitor will refuse to accept them even when accepting them would cost nothing and would satisfy its potential customers.
  C: At least one company has refused to accept coupons issued by its major local competitor simply in order to hurt that competitor, even though those coupons were accepted by all other local competitors.
  D: Any company that accepts its major competitor's coupons helps its competitor by doing so, even if it also satisfies its own actual or potential customers.
  E: If accepting coupons issued by a competitor would not enable a company to satisfy its actual or potential customers, then that company's refusal to accept the coupons is motivated by the desire to satisfy customers.

Great job! Your answer is correct. The assumption that any company that wishes to hurt a competitor by refusing to accept coupons issued by that competitor will refuse to accept them even when accepting them would cost nothing and would satisfy its potential customers is the key to drawing the professor's conclusion.

Here's a breakdown of the answer choices:

A. Any company that refuses to accept coupons issued by a competitor when doing so would satisfy some of the company's potential customers is motivated solely by the desire to hurt that competitor. - This answer choice is not the correct assumption, as it does not take into account the cost of accepting the coupons or the potential customers' satisfaction.

B. Any company that wishes to hurt a competitor by refusing to accept coupons issued by that competitor will refuse to accept them even when accepting them would cost nothing and would satisfy its potential customers. - This is the correct assumption, as it explains why Checkers refused to accept the coupons despite it costing them nothing and satisfying their potential customers.

C. At least one company has refused to accept coupons issued by its major local competitor simply in order to hurt that competitor, even though those coupons were accepted by all other local competitors. - This answer choice is not relevant to the scenario, as it does not provide any insight into Checkers's motivation for refusing to accept the coupons.

D. Any company that accepts its major competitor's coupons helps its competitor by doing so, even if it also satisfies its own actual or potential customers. - This answer choice is also not relevant to the scenario, as it does not take into account the cost of accepting the coupons or the potential customers' satisfaction.

E. If accepting coupons issued by a competitor would not enable a company to satisfy its actual or potential customers, then that company's refusal to accept the coupons is motivated by the desire to satisfy customers. - This answer choice is not applicable to the scenario, as Checkers's refusal to accept the coupons did not prevent them from satisfying their potential customers.

Great job on identifying the correct assumption!
## Assistant 2:
  Thank you! I'm glad I could help you reflect on your previous answer and identify the correct assumption. Here's a breakdown of how I arrived at the correct answer:

When analyzing the scenario, I realized that the key to drawing the economics professor's conclusion is to understand Checkers's motivation for refusing to accept the coupons. I considered each of the answer choices and evaluated them based on the information provided in the scenario.

Answer choice B is the correct assumption, as it explains why Checkers refused to accept the coupons despite it costing them nothing and satisfying their potential customers. By assuming that Checkers's motive in refusing to accept the coupons was simply to hurt Marty's Pizza, I was able to draw the professor's conclusion that Checkers's refusal to accept the coupons was motivated by a desire to harm Marty's Pizza, rather than to satisfy its potential customers.

I hope this helps clarify the reasoning behind my answer. Let me know if you have any further questions!
