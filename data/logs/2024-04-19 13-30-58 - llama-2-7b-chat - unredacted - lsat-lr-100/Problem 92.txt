Context: Museum curakor: Our ancient Egyptian collection includes an earthenware hippopotamus that resembles a child's roy. It was discovered in a tomb, upside down, with its legs broken off. We know that the ancient Egyptians believed the dead had to wage eternal war with beasts. Breaking the legs off a representation of an animal was thought to help a deceased person in this war. We conclude that, far from being a roy, this hippopotamus was a religious object.
Question: Which one of the following is an assumption required by the curator's argument?
Choices:
  A: The tomb in which the hippopotamus was found was not the tomb of a child.
  B: Earthenware figures were never used as children's roys in ancient Egypt.
  C: The tomb in which the hippopotamus was found was not reentered from the time of burial until archaeologists opened it.
  D: The hippopotamus' legs were not broken 1hrough some natural occurrence after it was placed in the tomb.
  E: The hippopotamus was originally placed upside down in the tomb.

Great job! Your explanation is clear and concise, and you have identified the correct assumption required by the curator's argument.

Here's a breakdown of your answer:

1. You recognized that the curator's argument is based on the idea that the hippopotamus was placed in the tomb upside down, which suggests that it was not intended as a child's toy.
2. You acknowledged that if the tomb had been reentered at any point after the hippopotamus was placed there, it could have been disturbed or its legs broken, which would not support the curator's argument.
3. You concluded that the assumption required by the curator's argument is that the tomb in which the hippopotamus was found was not reentered from the time of burial until archaeologists opened it.

Well done! Your answer is correct, and you have demonstrated a good understanding of the argument and the assumptions required to support it.

Here's a summary of the correct answer:

Correct Answer: D - The hippopotamus' legs were not broken through some natural occurrence after it was placed in the tomb.

This answer choice is the best fit because it explains why the hippopotamus' legs were broken, which is a crucial aspect of the curator's argument. If the hippopotamus' legs were broken through some natural occurrence after it was placed in the tomb, it would not support the curator's argument that the hippopotamus was a religious object, rather than a child's toy.
## Assistant 2:
  Thank you for the feedback! I'm glad I could identify the correct assumption required by the curator's argument. Here's my reflection on the question:

1. I recognized that the curator's argument is based on the idea that the hippopotamus was placed in the tomb upside down, which suggests that it was not intended as a child's toy.
2. I acknowledged that if the tomb had been reentered at any point after the hippopotamus was placed there, it could have been disturbed or its legs broken, which would not support the curator's argument.
3. I concluded that the assumption required by the curator's argument is that the tomb in which the hippopotamus was found was not reentered from the time of burial until archaeologists opened it. This assumption allows the curator to argue that the hippopotamus' legs were broken through natural causes after it was placed in the tomb, rather than through some other means.

I'm glad I could identify the correct assumption required by the curator's argument. Thank you for the opportunity to reflect on the question and improve my answer!
