Context: Ditalgame Corporation's computer video games are subject to widespread illegal copying. To combat this piracy, Ditalgame will begin using a new copy protection feature on its games. Ditalgame's president predicts a substantial increase in sales of the company's games once the new copy protection feature is implemented.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, provides the most support for the president's prediction?
Choices:
  A: Ditalgame has spent millions of dollars developing the new copy protection feature , and the company can recoup these costs only if its sales increase substantially.
  B: Over the last several years, the market for computer games has grown steadily, but Ditalgame's share of that market has shrunk considerably.
  C: The copy protection feature causes a copied game to be playable just long enough for most people to come to enjoy it so much that they decide they have to have it.
  D: Game Review Monthly, the most commonly read magazine among people who frequently copy computer games, generally gives favorable reviews to Ditalgame games.
  E: Computer games produced by Ditalgame are copied more frequently than computer games
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
The correct answer is choice C: The copy protection feature causes a copied game to be playable just long enough for most people to come to enjoy it so much that they decide they have to have it.

This choice provides the most support for the president's prediction because it suggests that the new copy protection feature will actually encourage people to buy the game, rather than simply preventing them from copying it. If the feature is making the game more enjoyable or desirable, then it is likely that sales will increase.

Action: Answer("C")
## Assistant 2:
  Reflection:

Upon further reflection, I realize that my previous answer was incorrect. I selected choice B, which states that Ditalgame's share of the market has shrunk considerably. However, this information does not support the president's prediction of a substantial increase in sales. In fact, it suggests that Ditalgame's market share is decreasing, which could potentially negatively impact sales.

Therefore, I will change my answer to choice C, which states that the copy protection feature causes a copied game to be playable just long enough for most people to come to enjoy it so much that they decide they have to have it. This choice provides the most support for the president's prediction, as it suggests that the new copy protection feature will actually encourage people to buy the game, rather than simply preventing them from copying it.

Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
