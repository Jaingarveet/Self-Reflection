Context: Editorial: Painting involves a sequential application of layers, each of which adheres satisfactorily only if the underlying layer has been properly applied. Education is, in this respect, like the craft of painting. Since the most important steps in painting are preparation of the surface to be painted and application of the primer coat, it makes sense to suppose that .
Question: Which one of the following most logically completes the editorial's argument?
Choices:
  A: in the educator's initial contact with a student, the educator should be as undemanding as possible
  B: students who have a secure grasp of the fundamentals of a subject are likely to make progress in that subject
  C: educators who are not achieving the goals they intended should revise their teaching methods
  D: teaching new students is rewarding but much more difficult than teaching more advanced students
  E: the success of a student's overall educational experience depends above all upon that student's initial educational experience
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
The editorial argues that education is like the craft of painting, where the most important steps are preparation of the surface to be painted and application of the primer coat. The argument suggests that just as a well-prepared surface is essential for a successful painting, a proper foundation is essential for successful learning.

The correct answer is (E) the success of a student's overall educational experience depends above all upon that student's initial educational experience. This choice aligns with the idea that a proper foundation is essential for successful learning, just as a well-prepared surface is essential for a successful painting.

The other choices do not logically complete the argument:

* (A) is unrelated to the argument, as it suggests that educators should be undemanding, which is not a logical conclusion from the painting analogy.
* (C) is also unrelated, as it suggests that educators should revise their teaching methods, which is not a logical conclusion from the painting analogy.
* (D) is partially related, but it does not complete the argument, as it suggests that teaching new students is more difficult than teaching advanced students, which is not a logical conclusion from the painting analogy.
* (E) is the most logically completing the argument, as it suggests that the success of a student's overall educational experience depends on their initial educational experience, which aligns with the idea that a proper foundation is essential for successful learning, just as a well-prepared surface is essential for a successful painting.

  Reflection:

Upon further reflection, I realize that my previous answer was incorrect. The editorial argues that education is like the craft of painting, where the most important steps are preparation of the surface to be painted and application of the primer coat. The argument suggests that just as a well-prepared surface is essential for a successful painting, a proper foundation is essential for successful learning.

To complete the argument, the most logically completing answer is (E) the success of a student's overall educational experience depends above all upon that student's initial educational experience. This choice aligns with the idea that a proper foundation is essential for successful learning, just as a well-prepared surface is essential for a successful painting.

The other choices do not logically complete the argument:

* (A) is unrelated to the argument, as it suggests that educators should be undemanding, which is not a logical conclusion from the painting analogy.
* (C) is also unrelated, as it suggests that educators should revise their teaching methods, which is not a logical conclusion from the painting analogy.
* (D) is partially related, but it does not complete the argument, as it suggests that teaching new students is more difficult than teaching advanced students, which is not a logical conclusion from the painting analogy.

Therefore, the correct answer is (E) the success of a student's overall educational experience depends above all upon that student's initial educational experience.
