Context: Native speakers perceive sentences of their own language as sequences of separate words. But this perception is an illusion. This is shown by the fact that travelers who do not know a local language hear an unintelligible, uninterrupted stream of sound, not sentences with distinct words.
Question: Which one of the following is an assumption on which the argument depends?
Choices:
  A: It is impossible to understand sentences if they are in fact uninterrupted streams of sound.
  B: Those who do not know a language cannot hear the way speech in that language actually sounds.
  C: People pay less close attention to the way their own language sounds than they do to the way an unfamiliar language sounds.
  D: Accomplished non-native speakers of a language do not perceive sentences as streams of sound.
  E: Native speakers' perceptions of their own language are not more accurate than are the perceptions of persons who do not know that language.
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
The argument depends on the assumption that those who do not know a language cannot hear the way speech in that language actually sounds. This assumption is choice B: Those who do not know a language cannot hear the way speech in that language actually sounds.

The argument is based on the idea that native speakers perceive sentences of their own language as sequences of separate words, but this perception is an illusion. The argument shows that this perception is an illusion by pointing out that travelers who do not know a local language hear an unintelligible, uninterrupted stream of sound, not sentences with distinct words.

The argument does not rely on the other options:

Option A is not a assumption, as it is not a necessary condition for the argument.

Option C is not a assumption, as it does not affect the argument's conclusion.

Option D is not a assumption, as it is not related to the argument's premise.

Option E is the correct assumption, as it is the basis for the argument.

Advice:

* Always read the question carefully and understand the argument.
* Identify the assumption on which the argument depends.
* Choose the best answer based on the argument.
* Double-check your answer to ensure accuracy.
## Assistant 2:
  Reflection:

I previously answered this question incorrectly, selecting option A: It is impossible to understand sentences if they are in fact uninterrupted streams of sound. However, upon further reflection, I realize that the argument depends on the assumption that those who do not know a language cannot hear the way speech in that language actually sounds, which is option B: Those who do not know a language cannot hear the way speech in that language actually sounds.

The argument is based on the idea that native speakers perceive sentences of their own language as sequences of separate words, but this perception is an illusion. The argument shows that this perception is an illusion by pointing out that travelers who do not know a local language hear an unintelligible, uninterrupted stream of sound, not sentences with distinct words.

The other options do not affect the argument's conclusion:

Option A is not a assumption, as it is not a necessary condition for the argument.

Option C is not a assumption, as it does not affect the argument's conclusion.

Option D is not a assumption, as it is not related to the argument's premise.

Option E is the correct assumption, as it is the basis for the argument.

Advice:

* Always read the question carefully and understand the argument.
* Identify the assumption on which the argument depends.
* Choose the best answer based on the argument.
