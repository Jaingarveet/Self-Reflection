## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The sum of 5 consecutive odd numbers is always divisible by 5. 
If the sum divided by 10 is a perfect square, then the sum must be a multiple of 50. 
The smallest sum of 5 consecutive odd numbers that is a multiple of 50 is 250, which is the sum of 45, 47, 49, 51, and 53. 
The sum divided by 10 is 25, which is a perfect square. 
So, 47 can be one of these 5 numbers.
Action: Answer("A")
