## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The man's speed in still water is 4 kmph. His speed against the current is 2 kmph. This means the current is slowing him down by 2 kmph. Therefore, when he rows with the current, it should speed him up by the same amount. So, his speed along the current would be his speed in still water plus the speed of the current, which is 4 kmph + 2 kmph = 6 kmph.
Action: Answer("B")
