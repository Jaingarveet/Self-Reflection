Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

  A: 8.75
  B: 8.79
  C: 8.75
  D: 8.71
  E: 8.72

## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The area of the square is side^2 = 20^2 = 400 cm^2.
The diameter of the semicircles is the side of the square, so the radius is 20/2 = 10 cm.
The area of a circle is πr^2, so the area of one semicircle is (π*10^2)/2 = 50π cm^2.
Since there are two semicircles, their total area is 2*50π = 100π cm^2.
The area of the remaining paper is the area of the square minus the area of the two semicircles = 400 - 100π cm^2.
We know that π is approximately 3.14, so 100π is approximately 314.
So, the area of the remaining paper is approximately 400 - 314 = 86 cm^2.
However, none of the choices match this calculation. There might be a mistake in the question or the choices.
