## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Question: Amy is organizing her bookshelves and finds that she has 10 different types of books. She then codes each book with either a single letter or a pair of two different letters. If each type of book is uniquely represented by either a single letter or pair of letters, what is the smallest number of letters Amy will need to create the codes for all 10 types of books? (Assume the order of letters in a pair does not matter.)
Choices:
  A: 3
  B: 4
  C: 5
  D: 10
  E: 20

## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Amy needs to code 10 different types of books. Each book can be represented by either a single letter or a pair of two different letters. The order of the letters in a pair does not matter. 
If we use 4 letters, we can create 4 single letter codes and 6 two-letter codes (combinations of 4 taken 2 at a time), which is exactly 10 codes. 
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: D
