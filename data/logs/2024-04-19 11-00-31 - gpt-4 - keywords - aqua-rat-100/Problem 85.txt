## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The elevator is moving at a constant speed. When you walk 20 steps and stop, the elevator takes 10 minutes to reach the bottom. This means that the elevator moves at a speed of 20 steps in 10 minutes, or 2 steps per minute. When you walk 10 steps and stop, the elevator takes 20 minutes to reach the bottom. This also means that the elevator moves at a speed of 10 steps in 20 minutes, or 0.5 steps per minute. However, since the elevator is moving at a constant speed, these two speeds should be the same. The discrepancy is due to the fact that when you walk 10 steps, you are also moving at a speed of 0.5 steps per minute, so the elevator's speed is the sum of these two speeds, or 2.5 steps per minute. However, this option is not available, so the correct answer is "None of the above".
Action: Answer("E")
