Question: X and Y are two alloys which were made by mixing zinc and copper in the ratio 6:9 and 7:11, respectively. If 40 grams of alloy X and 60 grams of alloy Y are melted and mixed to form alloy Z, what is the ratio of zinc and copper in the alloy Z ?
Choices:
  A: 69:91
  B: 59:91
  C: 59:90
  D: 59:91
  E: 69:101

## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
First, I need to find the amount of zinc and copper in each alloy. 
For alloy X, the ratio of zinc to copper is 6:9. So, the amount of zinc is 6/15*40 = 16 grams and the amount of copper is 9/15*40 = 24 grams.
For alloy Y, the ratio of zinc to copper is 7:11. So, the amount of zinc is 7/18*60 = 23.33 grams and the amount of copper is 11/18*60 = 36.67 grams.
Then, I add the amounts of zinc and copper from both alloys to get the total amount of zinc and copper in alloy Z. The total amount of zinc is 16 + 23.33 = 39.33 grams and the total amount of copper is 24 + 36.67 = 60.67 grams.
Finally, I find the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z by dividing the total amount of zinc by the total amount of copper. The ratio is 39.33:60.67, which simplifies to approximately 59:91 when rounded to the nearest whole number.
Action: Answer("B")
