## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The initial number of boys and girls is 64 and 40 respectively. 
The ratio of boys to girls after new members joined is 4:3. 
Let's say 'x' is the number of new members who joined. 
So, the equation will be (64+x)/(40+x) = 4/3. 
Solving this equation will give us the value of 'x'. 
Then, we add 'x' to the initial total number of members (64+40) to get the new total number of members.
Action: 
First, cross-multiply the equation to get rid of the fraction: 3*(64+x) = 4*(40+x).
This simplifies to 192+3x = 160+4x.
Subtract 3x from both sides to get x = 32.
The total number of members now is 64 (initial boys) + 40 (initial girls) + 32 (new members) = 136.
So, the answer is not in the choices. There seems to be a mistake in the question or the choices.
