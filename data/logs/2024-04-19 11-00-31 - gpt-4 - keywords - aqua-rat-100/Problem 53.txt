## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Let's denote the amount of money Arjun has as A and the amount of money Sajal has as S. 
From the problem, we have two equations:
1) If Arjun gives $30 to Sajal, Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun. This gives us the equation: S + 30 = 2(A - 30).
2) If Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal. This gives us the equation: A + 10 = 3(S - 10).
We can solve this system of equations to find the values of A and S.
