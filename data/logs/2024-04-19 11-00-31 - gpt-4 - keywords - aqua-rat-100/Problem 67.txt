## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
First, we can set up ratios to represent the relationships between the amounts of falafel in the different types of bread. 
From the first sentence, we know that 6 pita breads = 2 rolls, so 1 roll = 3 pita breads.
From the second sentence, we know that 3 rolls = 5 baguettes, so 1 baguette = 3/5 rolls.
Substituting the value of 1 roll in terms of pita breads into the equation for 1 baguette, we find that 1 baguette = 3/5 * 3 pita breads = 9/5 pita breads.
Therefore, 2 baguettes = 2 * 9/5 pita breads = 18/5 = 3.6 pita breads.
Action: Answer("E")
