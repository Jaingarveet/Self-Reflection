Solution:
To find the two possible values for $c$, we need to expand the equation $(a x+2)(b x+7)$ and compare it to $15 x^{2}+c x+14$.
Expanding the equation, we get $a b x^{2}+7 a x+2 b x+14$.
Since $a+b=8$, we can write $b=8-a$.
Substituting this into the expanded equation, we get $a(8-a) x^{2}+7 a x+2(8-a) x+14$.
Comparing this to $15 x^{2}+c x+14$, we can see that $a(8-a)=15$ and $7 a+16-2 a=c$.
Solving for $a$, we get $a=3$ or $a=5$.
Substituting these values into the equation for $c$, we get $c=31$ or $c=41$.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The given equation is $(a x+2)(b x+7)=15 x^{2}+c x+14$.
Expanding the left side of the equation, we get $a b x^{2}+7 a x+2 b x+14$.
Comparing the coefficients of $x^{2}$ on both sides, we get $a b=15$.
Comparing the coefficients of $x$ on both sides, we get $7 a+2 b=c$.
We are given that $a+b=8$.
Solving for $b$ in terms of $a$, we get $b=8-a$.
Substituting this into the equation $a b=15$, we get $a(8-a)=15$.
Expanding this equation, we get $a^{2}-8 a+15=0$.
Factoring this equation, we get $(a-3)(a-5)=0$.
Therefore, the two possible values for $a$ are $3$ and $5$.
Substituting these values into the equation $7 a+2 b=c$, we get $c=31$ and $c=41$, respectively.
