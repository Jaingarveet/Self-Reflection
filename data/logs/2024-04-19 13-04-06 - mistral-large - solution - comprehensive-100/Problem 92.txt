Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
[REDACTED]s are the most common type of ovarian tumor and are often found in women of reproductive age.
[REDACTED]s are typically small and mobile, and have a long pedicle, making them more prone to torsion.
During pregnancy, the enlarging uterus can cause the ovary to become displaced, increasing the risk of torsion.
[REDACTED]s are also more likely to undergo torsion during pregnancy because they are often not diagnosed until they cause symptoms, such as pain or discomfort.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The question asks for the type of ovarian tumor that is most prone to undergo torsion during pregnancy.
The answer is not Serous cystadenoma or Mucinous cystadenoma, as they are typically larger and less mobile.
The answer is not Dermoid cyst, as they are typically solid and less likely to undergo torsion.
The answer is Theca lutein cyst, as they are typically small and mobile, and have a long pedicle, making them more prone to torsion. During pregnancy, the enlarging uterus can cause the ovary to become displaced, increasing the risk of torsion. Theca lutein cysts are also more likely to undergo torsion during pregnancy because they are often not diagnosed until they cause symptoms, such as pain or discomfort.
