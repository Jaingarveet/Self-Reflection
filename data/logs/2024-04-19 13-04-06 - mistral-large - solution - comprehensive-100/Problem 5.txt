The product of 4*4 is 16.
## Assistant 2:
Reflection:
The previous question was about a club with members whose ages are in arithmetic progression (A.P.) with a common difference of 3 months. The youngest member is 7 years old, and the sum of all the ages is 250 years.

To solve this problem, I need to use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:

Sum = (n/2) \* (a\_1 + a\_n)

where n is the number of terms, a\_1 is the first term, and a\_n is the last term.

First, I need to convert the ages to months:

* The youngest member is 7 years old, which is 7 \* 12 = 84 months old.
* The sum of all the ages is 250 years, which is 250 \* 12 = 3000 months.

Next, I need to find the number of terms (n) using the formula:

3000 = (n/2) \* (84 + a\_n)

Since the ages are in A.P. with a common difference of 3 months, I can express a\_n as:

a\_n = a\_1 + (n - 1) \* d

where d is the common difference.

Substituting a\_1 = 84 and d = 3, I get:

a\_n = 84 + (n - 1) \* 3

Now I can substitute this expression for a\_n back into the sum formula:

3000 = (n/2) \* (84 + 84 + (n - 1) \* 3)

Simplifying, I get:

3000 = (n/2) \* (168 + 3n - 3)

Multiplying both sides by 2/n, I get:

6000/n = 168 + 3n - 3

Rearranging, I get:

3n^2 - 165n + 6000 = 0

Dividing both sides by 3, I get:

n^2 - 55n + 2000 = 0

Factoring, I get:

(n - 25)(n - 80) = 0

The possible values for n are 25 and 80. However, since the common difference is 3 months, it is not possible to have 80 members with ages in A.P. starting from 84 months. Therefore, the number of members in the club is 25.
