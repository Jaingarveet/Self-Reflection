Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
1. Jackson is the only witness scheduled to testify on Monday.
2. Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
3. This leaves Franco, Garcia, and Hong to testify on Tuesday.
4. Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
5. Franco and Garcia cannot testify on the same day.
6. Therefore, Hong and either Franco or Garcia must testify on Tuesday.
7. Since the question asks what must be true, Hong testifying on Tuesday is the only certain conclusion.
## Assistant 2:
You're right, I made a mistake in my previous answer. Let me think through this again step-by-step:
Given:
- Jackson is the only witness testifying on Monday
- Iturbe testifies on Wednesday 
- Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday
- Franco and Garcia can't testify on the same day
- Hong doesn't testify on Monday
1. With Jackson on Monday and Iturbe on Wednesday, that leaves Franco, Garcia and Hong for Tuesday.
2. Since exactly two testify on Tuesday, and Franco and Garcia can't be on the same day, the two witnesses on Tuesday must be either:
   a) Franco and Hong, or
   b) Garcia and Hong
3. Hong is the common element in both possible Tuesday scenarios. Therefore, no matter which of Franco or Garcia testifies Tuesday, Hong must testify on Tuesday.
4. The other choices involve Franco or Garcia's scheduling which isn't definite, only Hong's Tuesday slot is certain based on the conditions.
Therefore, the correct answer is that Hong must be scheduled to testify on Tuesday.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
