Context: Exactly eight books—F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O—are placed on a bookcase with exactly three shelves—the top shelf, the middle shelf, and the bottom shelf. At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.
Question: If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: F and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  B: G and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  C: H and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  D: I and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  E: K and O are placed on the same shelf as each other.

Solution:
Given:
 - I is on the middle shelf
 - L is on a higher shelf than H
 - O is on a higher shelf than L
 - K is on a higher shelf than F
 - F is on the same shelf as M
 - More books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf
Step 1: Place L and O on the top shelf (since O is higher than L, and L is higher than H).
Step 2: Place I on the middle shelf.
Step 3: Place H on the bottom shelf (since L is higher than H).
Step 4: Place F and M on the same shelf, which must be the middle shelf (since K is higher than F).
Step 5: Place K on the top shelf (since it's higher than F, which is on the middle shelf).
Step 6: Place G on the bottom shelf (the only remaining position).
Therefore, H and M are on the same shelf (the bottom shelf).
## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. We know L is on a higher shelf than H. And O is on a higher shelf than L. So the order from top to bottom must be: O, L, H. 
2. I is on the middle shelf.
3. K is on a higher shelf than F. And F is on the same shelf as M. So F and M must be on the bottom shelf (since the middle shelf is taken by I). This puts K on the top shelf.
4. So far we have:
   Top: O, K
   Middle: I
   Bottom: H, F, M
5. The only book left to place is G. We're told more books are on the bottom than the top. So G must go on the bottom to satisfy this condition.
6. Final arrangement:
   Top: O, K
   Middle: I 
   Bottom: H, F, M, G
Looking at the choices, H and M are indeed on the same shelf (the bottom shelf).
Action: Answer("C")
