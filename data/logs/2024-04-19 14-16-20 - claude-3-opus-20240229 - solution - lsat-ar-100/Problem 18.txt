Context: Of the eight students—George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert—in a seminar, exactly six will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
Question: Which one of the following could be the schedule of the students' reports?
Choices:
  A: Mon. morning: Helen; Mon. afternoon: Robert Tues. morning: Olivia; Tues. afternoon: Irving Wed. morning: Lenore; Wed. afternoon: Kyle
  B: Mon. morning: Irving; Mon. afternoon: Olivia Tues. morning: Helen; Tues. afternoon: Kyle Wed. morning: Nina; Wed. afternoon: Lenore
  C: Mon. morning: Lenore; Mon. afternoon: Helen Tues. morning: George; Tues. afternoon: Kyle Wed. morning: Robert; Wed. afternoon: Irving
  D: Mon. morning: Nina; Mon. afternoon: Helen Tues. morning: Robert; Tues. afternoon: Irving Wed. morning: Olivia; Wed. afternoon: Lenore

Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
Let's go through each choice again, this time being careful to correctly interpret the problem conditions:
[REDACTED]: Violates the condition that Robert cannot give an afternoon report.
[REDACTED]: Violates the condition that if Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. Here, Nina gives a report on Wednesday morning, but Helen and Irving give reports on Tuesday. 
[REDACTED]: Satisfies all conditions. George gives a report on Tuesday. Olivia and Robert give morning reports. If Nina had given a report, it would have had to be on Monday or Tuesday for Helen and Irving to both report the next day, but Nina is not reporting at all in this schedule.
[REDACTED]: Violates the condition that Olivia cannot give an afternoon report.
[REDACTED]: Violates the conditions that George can only give a report on Tuesday and that Olivia cannot give an afternoon report.
Therefore, the only schedule that satisfies all the conditions is choice [REDACTED].
## Assistant 2:
Let's carefully go through each choice to see which one satisfies all the given conditions:
A: Violates the condition that Robert cannot give an afternoon report.
B: Violates the condition that if Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. Here, Nina gives a report on Wednesday morning, but Helen and Irving give reports on Tuesday.
C: Satisfies all conditions. George gives a report on Tuesday. Olivia and Robert give morning reports. Nina is not reporting at all in this schedule, so the condition about Helen and Irving reporting the day after Nina does not apply.
D: Violates the condition that Olivia cannot give an afternoon report. 
E: Violates the conditions that George can only give a report on Tuesday and that Olivia cannot give an afternoon report.
Therefore, the only schedule that satisfies all the conditions is choice C.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
