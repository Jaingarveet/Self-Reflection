## User 2:
Topic: Law
Context: Of the eight students—George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert—in a seminar, exactly six will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
Question: If Helen, Kyle, and Lenore, not necessarily in that order, give the three morning reports, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Helen gives a report on Monday.
  B: Irving gives a report on Monday.
  C: Irving gives a report on Wednesday.
  D: Kyle gives a report on Tuesday.
  E: Kyle gives a report on Wednesday.

Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
Given:
 - Helen, Kyle, and Lenore give the three morning reports.
 - George can only report on Tuesday.
 - Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports.
 - If Nina reports, then Helen and Irving must report the next day, unless Nina reports on Wednesday.
Step 1: Since George can only report on Tuesday, he must give the Tuesday afternoon report.
Step 2: Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports, so they must give morning reports (if they report at all).
Step 3: If Nina reports on Monday or Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must report the following day.
Step 4: Helen gives a morning report, so she cannot report on Wednesday (as that would require Nina to report on Tuesday, which would then require Helen to report on Wednesday).
Step 5: Therefore, Helen must report on either Monday or Tuesday morning.
Step 6: If Helen reports on Tuesday morning, then Irving cannot report at all (as he would need to report on Wednesday, which is not possible given the conditions).
Step 7: Therefore, Helen must report on Monday morning, and Irving must report on Tuesday morning.
So, Irving must give a report on Monday.
## Assistant 2:
You're right, my previous answer was incorrect. Let me think through this again step-by-step:
Given:
- Helen, Kyle, and Lenore give the three morning reports.
- George can only report on Tuesday afternoon.
- Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports.
- If Nina reports, then Helen and Irving must report the next day, unless Nina reports on Wednesday.
Step 1: George must give the Tuesday afternoon report, as that's the only day he can report.
Step 2: Helen, Kyle and Lenore give the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, but we don't know the specific order yet.
Step 3: Olivia and Robert can only give morning reports, if they report at all. But since Helen, Kyle and Lenore take the morning slots, Olivia and Robert cannot actually report.
Step 4: If Nina reports on Monday or Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must report the following day. But Helen has a morning slot, so Nina cannot report on Monday or Tuesday, as that would force Helen to take an afternoon slot the next day.
Step 5: Therefore, the only way for Helen and Irving to report is if Nina reports on Wednesday afternoon. This forces Helen and Irving to take the Monday and Tuesday morning slots.
In conclusion, if Helen, Kyle and Lenore give the morning reports, then Irving must report on Monday, as Helen reports Monday and Kyle reports Wednesday.
Action: Answer("B")
