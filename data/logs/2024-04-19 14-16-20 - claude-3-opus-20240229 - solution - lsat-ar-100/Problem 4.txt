Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
1. Lan and [REDACTED] cannot lead sessions on the same day.
2. If Lan does not lead a Wednesday session, then she must lead either a Thursday or Friday session.
3. If Lan leads a Thursday or Friday session, then [REDACTED] must lead a Wednesday session (because they can't be on the same day).
4. [REDACTED]'s session must be earlier in the week than [REDACTED]'s. Since [REDACTED] is on Wednesday, [REDACTED] must lead a Wednesday morning session.
5. [REDACTED] must lead an afternoon session. The only remaining afternoon session is on Friday.
6. [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] must lead sessions on the same day, which must be Thursday since Wednesday and Friday are fully booked.
Therefore, if Lan does not lead a Wednesday session, then [REDACTED] must lead a Thursday session.
## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step using the information provided:
1. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions on the same day.
2. If Lan does not lead a Wednesday session, then she must lead either a Thursday or Friday session.
3. If Lan leads a Thursday or Friday session, then Olivia must lead a Wednesday session (because they can't be on the same day).
4. Julio's session must be earlier in the week than Olivia's. Since Olivia is on Wednesday, Julio must lead a Wednesday morning session.
5. Nessa must lead an afternoon session. The only remaining afternoon session is on Friday.
6. Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions on the same day, which must be Thursday since Wednesday and Friday are fully booked.
Therefore, if Lan does not lead a Wednesday session, then Kevin must lead a Thursday session.
