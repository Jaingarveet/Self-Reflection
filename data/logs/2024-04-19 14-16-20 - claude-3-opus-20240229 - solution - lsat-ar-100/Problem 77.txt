Context: An administrator must assign parking spaces to six new employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young. Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
Question: For how many of the six new employees is the assignment of a parking space limited to one of only two possible spaces?
Choices:
  A: none
  B: two

Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
1. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4. This means Robertson cannot be assigned #5 or #6.
2. Young must be assigned a lower-numbered parking space than Robertson. Since Robertson can only be assigned #1, #2, #3, or #4, Young must be assigned #1, #2, or #3.
3. Togowa must be assigned a lower-numbered parking space than Young. Since Young can only be assigned #1, #2, or #3, Togowa must be assigned #1 or #2.
4. Since Togowa is limited to #1 or #2, this further limits Young to #2 or #3.
5. Since Young is limited to #2 or #3, this further limits Robertson to #3 or #4.
6. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. This doesn't limit Xu or Souza to specific spaces yet.
7. Looking at the employees individually:
   - Robertson: must be assigned #3 or #4 (limited to [REDACTED] spaces)
   - Souza: no specific limitation 
   - Togowa: must be assigned #1 or #2 (limited to [REDACTED] spaces)
   - Vaughn: no specific limitation
   - Xu: no specific limitation
   - Young: must be assigned #2 or #3 (limited to [REDACTED] spaces)
8. Counting the employees with assignments limited to only [REDACTED] spaces:
   - Togowa, Young, Robertson are each limited to [REDACTED] specific spaces
   - Souza, Vaughn, Xu have no such limitation
Therefore, [REDACTED] employees (Togowa, Young, Robertson, and Vaughn) have their assignment limited to only [REDACTED] possible spaces.
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4. This means Robertson cannot be assigned #5 or #6.
2. Young must be assigned a lower-numbered parking space than Robertson. Since Robertson can only be assigned #1, #2, #3, or #4, Young must be assigned #1, #2, or #3. 
3. Togowa must be assigned a lower-numbered parking space than Young. Since Young can only be assigned #1, #2, or #3, Togowa must be assigned #1 or #2.
4. Since Togowa is limited to #1 or #2, this further limits Young to #2 or #3.
5. Since Young is limited to #2 or #3, this further limits Robertson to #3 or #4.
6. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. This doesn't limit Xu or Souza to specific spaces yet.
7. Looking at the employees individually:
   - Robertson: must be assigned #3 or #4 (limited to 2 spaces)
   - Souza: no specific limitation 
   - Togowa: must be assigned #1 or #2 (limited to 2 spaces)
   - Vaughn: no specific limitation
   - Xu: no specific limitation
   - Young: must be assigned #2 or #3 (limited to 2 spaces)
8. Counting the employees with assignments limited to only 2 spaces:
   - Togowa, Young, and Robertson are each limited to 2 specific spaces
   - Souza, Vaughn, and Xu have no such limitation
Therefore, 3 employees (Togowa, Young, and Robertson) have their assignment limited to only 2 possible spaces.
