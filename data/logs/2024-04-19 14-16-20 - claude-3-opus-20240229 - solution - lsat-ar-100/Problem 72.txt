Context: A shopping center has exactly seven spaces—space 1 through space 7—arranged in a straight row. Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.

Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
1. The pharmacy must be at one end and a restaurant at the other end.
2. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. Since the optometrist is next to the shoe store, the pharmacy must be next to the optometrist.
3. So we have this arrangement so far: 
   Pharmacy - Optometrist - Shoe Store - ? - ? - ? - Restaurant
4. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. This means the second restaurant could be in the 4th, 5th, or 6th position.
5. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian. 
6. Given these constraints, there are two possible arrangements:
   a) Pharmacy - Optometrist - Shoe Store - Restaurant - Toy Store - Veterinarian - Restaurant
   b) Pharmacy - Optometrist - Shoe Store - Toy Store - Restaurant - Veterinarian - Restaurant
7. In both cases, the businesses immediately on either side of the optometrist-shoe store pair are [REDACTED].
## Assistant 2:
Based on the problem constraints and my previous reflection, here is my thought process:
1. The pharmacy must be at one end, and a restaurant at the other end.
2. The optometrist is next to the shoe store. Since the pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or veterinarian, it must be next to the optometrist in this case. 
3. So the arrangement is:
   Pharmacy - Optometrist - Shoe Store - ? - ? - ? - Restaurant
4. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two businesses. The second restaurant could be in the 4th, 5th, or 6th position.
5. The toy store can't be next to the veterinarian. 
6. This leaves two possible full arrangements:
   a) Pharmacy - Optometrist - Shoe Store - Restaurant - Toy Store - Veterinarian - Restaurant 
   b) Pharmacy - Optometrist - Shoe Store - Toy Store - Restaurant - Veterinarian - Restaurant
7. In both cases, the businesses immediately on either side of the optometrist-shoe store pair are the pharmacy and the toy store.
