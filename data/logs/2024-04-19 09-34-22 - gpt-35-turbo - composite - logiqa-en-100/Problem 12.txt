## System:
You are an expert in Logic.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## User 2:
Topic: Logic
Context: Most people think that the thinking of scientists is based on strict logical reasoning, not on image thinking means such as analogy, intuition, and epiphany.However, research shows that Nobel Prize winners make more use of these image thinking methods than general scientists.Therefore, image thinking methods help to achieve major scientific breakthroughs.
Question: The above conclusion is based on which of the following assumptions?
Choices:
  A: Organized, step-by-step reasoning is essential for general scientific research.
  B: Nobel Prize winners have the ability to think creatively through analogy, intuition, and insight.
  C: Nobel winners have made major scientific breakthroughs.
  D: Nobel Prize winners are smarter and harder than ordinary scientists.
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I incorrectly identified the assumption that supports the conclusion. The conclusion is that image thinking methods help to achieve major scientific breakthroughs. The assumption that supports this conclusion is that [REDACTED] While option [REDACTED] is true, it is not the assumption that supports the conclusion. 
Error Keywords:
 - Misidentification of assumption
 - Misinterpretation of conclusion
Solution:
The conclusion is that image thinking methods help to achieve major scientific breakthroughs.
The assumption that supports this conclusion is that [REDACTED]
Option [REDACTED] is the correct answer because it states that Nobel Prize winners have made major scientific breakthroughs.
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and understand the problem.
2. Identify the conclusion of the argument.
3. Identify the evidence that supports the conclusion.
4. Identify the assumption that links the evidence to the conclusion.
5. Evaluate each option to determine which one is the correct assumption.
6. Choose the option that best supports the conclusion based on the evidence provided.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Identify the conclusion of the argument.
 - Identify the evidence that supports the conclusion.
 - Identify the assumption that links the evidence to the conclusion.
 - Evaluate each option to determine which one is the correct assumption.
 - Choose the option that best supports the conclusion based on the evidence provided.
 - Be careful not to confuse evidence with assumptions.
