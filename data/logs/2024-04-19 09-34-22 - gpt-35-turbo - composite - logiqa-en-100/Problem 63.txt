Context: The characteristic of capital is the pursuit of profit.In the first half of 2004, the price increase in China exceeded the interest rate of bank deposits.From January to July, residents 'income continued to increase, but the growth rate of residents' savings deposits continued to decline.Outflow deposits in July reached about 100 billion yuan, and the proportion of time deposits in all deposits continued to decline.

Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I incorrectly chose option [REDACTED] as the answer because it mentions buying stocks or funds, which is a possible alternative investment option. However, the passage does not mention anything about buying stocks or funds. Option [REDACTED] is the correct answer because it mentions that private lending is active and the interest on lending is much higher than the bank deposit interest rate. This suggests that residents may be withdrawing their savings from banks and investing in private lending to earn higher interest rates.
Error Keywords:
 - Misinterpretation of answer choices
