# Model: gpt-35-turbo | Agent: composite | Exam: logiqa-en-100 | Problem 10 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Logic.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Topic: Logic
Context: In a study, 51 middle school student volunteers were divided into a test group and a control group to receive the same mathematics training.During the five-day training, the researchers used a technique called transcranial random noise stimulation to lightly shock the areas of the brains of 25 test group members that were considered to be related to computing power.The subsequent test results showed that the mathematics ability of the test group members was significantly higher than that of the control group members.To their surprise, the effect of this ability improvement can last at least half a year.The researchers therefore believe that micro-shocks in the brain can improve the brain's computing power.
Question: Which of the following, if true, best supports the above researchers â€™views?
Choices:
  A: This non-invasive stimulus is inexpensive and will not cause any pain to the human body
  B: After a slight electric shock to the brain, the blood flow between the neurons in the brain is significantly enhanced, but it returns to normal after multiple stimulations
  C: Before the experiment, the mathematics scores of the two groups of students were almost the same
  D: Subjects with microshocks in the brain are more concerned about their behavior, and their concentration is more focused during the test
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I misinterpreted the question and did not pay attention to the keyword "best." 
I chose an answer that provides additional information but does not directly support the researchers' views. 
Error Keywords:
 - Misinterpretation
 - Lack of attention to detail
 - Incorrect reasoning
Solution:
The researchers believe that micro-shocks in the brain can improve the brain's computing power.
The question asks for the choice that best supports the researchers' views.
Choice [REDACTED] supports the researchers' views by providing additional information that the mathematics scores of the two groups of students were almost the same before the experiment. This information supports the idea that the improvement in the test group's mathematics ability was due to the micro-shocks in the brain and not due to any pre-existing differences between the two groups.
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and understand what is being asked.
2. Pay attention to the keywords in the question, such as "best."
3. Identify the main idea or argument being presented.
4. Evaluate each answer choice and determine which one best supports the main idea or argument.
5. Choose the answer that directly supports the main idea or argument.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand what is being asked.
 - Pay attention to the keywords in the question, such as "best," "least," "not," etc.
 - Identify the main idea or argument being presented.
 - Evaluate each answer choice and determine which one best supports the main idea or argument.
 - Choose the answer that directly supports the main idea or argument.
 - Be careful not to choose an answer that provides additional information but does not directly support the main idea or argument.
