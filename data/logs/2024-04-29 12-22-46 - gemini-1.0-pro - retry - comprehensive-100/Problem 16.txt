Action: Answer("C") 
Explanation:
* From (1), we know there are 3 tall men, 2 doctors, and 1 handsome man.
* From (2), we know both Wang Wei and Wu Gang are doctors.
* From (3), we know Liu Dawei and Li Qiang are the same height.
* From (4), we know Li Qiang and Wang Wei are not both tall.
Based on this information, we can eliminate some options:
* Liu Dawei and Li Qiang cannot be the answer because they are not both tall.
* Wang Wei cannot be the answer because he is not handsome.
This leaves us with Wu Gang. He is a doctor, tall, and handsome, fulfilling all of Li Na's requirements.
