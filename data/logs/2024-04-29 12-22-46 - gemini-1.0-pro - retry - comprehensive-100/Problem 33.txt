## Assistant 2:
## Analyzing the answer choices:
* **A**: This weakens the argument because it suggests that the increase in violent crime calls is part of a larger trend of increasing crime, not just violent crime.
* **B**: This weakens the argument because it suggests that the average citizen is not necessarily more likely to be a victim of violent crime, as the increase in calls could be due to a higher proportion of younger people in the town.
* **C**: This strengthens the argument because it suggests that the increase in calls is not due to an actual increase in violent crime, but rather to increased reporting.
* **D**: This weakens the argument because it suggests that the town is taking steps to address the problem of violent crime, which could reduce the likelihood of becoming a victim.
* **E**: This weakens the argument because it suggests that the problem of violent crime could be addressed by focusing on a relatively small number of repeat offenders.
## Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the answer that most seriously weakens the argument is **B**. 
## Action:
Answer("B")
