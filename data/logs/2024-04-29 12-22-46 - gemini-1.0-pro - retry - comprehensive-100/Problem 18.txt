## Assistant 2:
## Self-Reflection
**Previous Incorrect Answer:** C
**Reasoning for Incorrect Answer:** I incorrectly assumed that Robot 1, by picking up the red squares, must be Type A (recognizes colors). However, I failed to consider the possibility that Robot 1 could be Type C (recognizes neither) and simply picked up the red squares by chance.
**Correct Answer:** D
**Reasoning for Correct Answer:**
* **Robot 1:** Since it picked up the red squares instead of the red balls, it cannot be Type A (recognizes colors).
* **Robot 2:** Since it picked up the blue balls instead of the red balls, it cannot be Type B (recognizes shapes).
Therefore, the only possibility is that **No.1 is not Type B and No.2 is not Type A.**
**Action:** Answer("D") 
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
