Context: An administrator must assign parking spaces to six new employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young. Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
Question: Which one of the following could be the assignment of parking spaces to the new employees?
Choices:
  A: #1: Young; #2: Souza; #3: Vaughn; #4: Robertson; #5: Togowa; #6: Xu
  B: #1: Vaughn; #2: Togowa; #3: Young; #4: Souza; #5: Robertson; #6: Xu
  C: #1: Togowa; #2: Young; #3: Xu; #4: Robertson; #5: Souza; #6: Vaughn

## Assistant 2:
## Self-Reflection on Previous Incorrect Answer:
**Mistake:** In my previous attempt, I incorrectly assigned parking space #1 to Young, violating the rule that Robertson must have a higher-numbered space than Young.
**Reasoning:** I focused on the individual rules related to Young and Robertson but failed to consider the combined implication of both rules.
**Learning:** It's crucial to analyze all rules holistically and consider their combined implications to avoid such mistakes.
## Applying the Learning to the Current Question:
**Step 1: Identify the Rules:**
1. Young > Togowa
2. Xu > Souza
3. Robertson > Young
4. Robertson: #1, #2, #3, or #4
**Step 2: Analyze Each Option:**
**A:** Violates rule 3 (Robertson < Young)
**B:** Violates rule 1 (Young < Togowa)
**C:** Violates rule 2 (Xu < Souza)
**D:** **Valid** (satisfies all rules)
**E:** Violates rule 3 (Robertson < Young)
**Step 3: Choose the Valid Option:**
Based on the analysis, only option D satisfies all the rules.
**Action: Answer("D")** 
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: E
Score: 0
