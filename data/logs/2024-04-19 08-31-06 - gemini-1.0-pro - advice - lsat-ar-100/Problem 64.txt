Context: A software company employs exactly seven sales representatives—Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall—to work in its three sales zones—Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3. Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.

There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

## Assistant 2:
Let's analyze the information step-by-step:
1. **Zone 1:** Either Parra or Tiao, but not both.
2. **Zone 2:** Either Tiao or Udall, but not both.
3. **Zone 3:** More representatives than Zone 2.
4. **Parra and Quinn:** Same zone.
5. **Stuckey and Udall:** Same zone.
6. **Mahr and Stuckey:** Same zone (given).
Based on these conditions:
- **Zone 1:** If Parra is in Zone 1, then Tiao must be in Zone 2 (due to condition 2). This leaves Udall for Zone 3.
- **Zone 2:** If Tiao is in Zone 1, then Udall must be in Zone 2 (due to condition 2). This leaves Parra for Zone 3.
- **Zone 3:** In either case, Zone 3 has two representatives (Parra or Udall, and Stuckey).
Now, let's analyze the answer choices:
**A: Kim works in Zone 2:** This is possible. If Parra is in Zone 1, then Tiao is in Zone 2, leaving Kim and Udall for Zone 3.
**B: Mahr works in Zone 1:** This is not possible. Mahr and Stuckey are in the same zone, and Stuckey cannot be in Zone 1 (due to conditions 1 and 2).
**C: Parra works in Zone 3:** This is possible. If Tiao is in Zone 1, then Parra is in Zone 3.
**D: Stuckey works in Zone 2:** This is not possible. Stuckey and Mahr are in the same zone, and Mahr cannot be in Zone 2 (due to conditions 1 and 2).
**E: Tiao works in Zone 1:** This is possible. If Parra is in Zone 1, then Tiao is in Zone 2, leaving Kim and Udall for Zone 3.
Therefore, the possible scenarios are A, C, and E. However, considering the information about Zone 3 having more representatives than Zone 2, scenario A (Kim in Zone 2) is more likely.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
