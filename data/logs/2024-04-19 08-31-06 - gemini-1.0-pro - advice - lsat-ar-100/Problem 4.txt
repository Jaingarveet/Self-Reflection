Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always consider all possible scenarios that satisfy the constraints.
 - Do not make assumptions that are not explicitly stated in the problem.
 - If you cannot determine the answer with certainty, state that you cannot determine the answer.
## Assistant 2:
## Self-reflection on previous incorrect answer:
My previous answer was incorrect because I did not consider all possible scenarios that satisfy the constraints. Specifically, I did not consider the possibility that Lan could lead a Friday afternoon session.
## Step-by-step solution:
1. **Identify the constraints:**
    * Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions on the same day.
    * Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions on the same day.
    * Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
    * Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
2. **Consider the information about Lan:**
    * Since Lan does not lead a Wednesday session, she could lead a Thursday or Friday session.
3. **Consider the information about Nessa:**
    * Since Nessa must lead an afternoon session, she could lead the Thursday afternoon or Friday afternoon session.
4. **Consider the information about Julio and Olivia:**
    * Since Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's, Julio could lead a Wednesday or Thursday session.
    * Olivia could lead a Thursday or Friday session.
5. **Combine the information:**
    * If Lan leads a Thursday session, then Nessa cannot lead the Thursday afternoon session (because Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions on the same day).
    * If Lan leads a Friday session, then Nessa could lead the Thursday afternoon session.
    * If Lan leads a Friday session, then Julio could lead the Thursday morning session.
6. **Conclusion:**
    * If Lan does not lead a Wednesday session, then **Nessa must lead a Thursday session**.
