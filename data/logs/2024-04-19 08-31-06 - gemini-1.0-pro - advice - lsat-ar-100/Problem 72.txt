Context: A shopping center has exactly seven spaces—space 1 through space 7—arranged in a straight row. Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.

Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Advice:
- Pay close attention to all constraints and their implications.
- Start with the most constrained elements and work outwards.
- Visualize the placement of elements to avoid logical errors.
- Double-check your work against all constraints before finalizing.
- Consider using diagrams or tables to visualize the arrangement.
## Assistant 2:
Self-reflection:
- I initially overlooked the constraint that the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
- I focused on the pharmacy and optometrist placement without considering the impact on the restaurant placement.
- I did not visualize the arrangement of businesses carefully enough, leading to an incorrect conclusion.
Thought process:
1. Pharmacy placement:
   - The pharmacy must be at one end of the row.
   - It must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
2. Restaurant placement:
   - One restaurant must be at the other end of the row, opposite the pharmacy.
   - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
3. Optometrist and shoe store placement:
   - If the optometrist is next to the shoe store, they cannot be next to the pharmacy (due to the pharmacy-restaurant constraint).
   - Therefore, the optometrist must be next to the veterinarian.
4. Toy store placement:
   - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian (given constraint).
   - It cannot be next to the optometrist (due to the pharmacy-optometrist constraint).
   - Therefore, the toy store must be next to the restaurant at the opposite end from the pharmacy.
Conclusion:
- The businesses immediately on either side of the optometrist and shoe store pair must be a restaurant and the toy store.
