Context: A shopping center has exactly seven spaces—space 1 through space 7—arranged in a straight row. Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.

## Assistant 2:
## Self-Reflection on Previous Incorrect Answer
**Previous Incorrect Answer:** C: A restaurant is next to the toy store.
**Reasoning for Incorrect Answer:** I focused on the constraint that the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian and overlooked the other constraints.
**Correct Answer:** E: The shoe store is next to the veterinarian.
**Reasoning for Correct Answer:**
1. **Pharmacy Location:** The pharmacy must be at one end of the row. Let's assume it's at the left end (space 1).
2. **Restaurant Locations:** One restaurant must be at the other end (space 7). The other restaurant cannot be next to it, so it must be in either space 2 or space 6.
3. **Optometrist and Veterinarian Locations:** The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. Since the pharmacy is at the left end, the optometrist or veterinarian must be in space 2.
4. **Toy Store Location:** The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, who is in space 2. Therefore, the toy store cannot be in spaces 1, 2, or 3.
5. **Shoe Store Location:** The shoe store is in space 4.
6. **Constraint Satisfaction:** With the current arrangement, all constraints are satisfied:
    - Pharmacy is at one end (space 1).
    - Restaurants are at opposite ends (spaces 1 and 7).
    - Restaurants are separated by at least two other businesses (spaces 3, 4, and 5).
    - Pharmacy is next to the veterinarian (space 2).
    - Toy store is not next to the veterinarian.
Therefore, the only statement that must be true is that the shoe store is next to the veterinarian.
**Action:** Answer("E") 
## Result:
Agent Answer: E
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
