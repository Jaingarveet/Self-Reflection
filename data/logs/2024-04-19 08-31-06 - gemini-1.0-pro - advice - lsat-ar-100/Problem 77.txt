## Assistant 2:
Self-reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly because I did not consider all of the rules. I only considered the rule that Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. I did not consider the rule that Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
To answer this question correctly, I need to consider all of the rules. I need to start by assigning Robertson a parking space. Since Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4, I can assign him any of these four spaces.
Once I have assigned Robertson a parking space, I can then assign the other employees parking spaces. I need to make sure that I follow the rules that Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa and that Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
I can start by assigning Togowa a parking space. Since Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa, I cannot assign Togowa parking space #6. I can assign Togowa parking space #1, #2, #3, #4, or #5.
Once I have assigned Togowa a parking space, I can then assign Souza a parking space. Since Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, I cannot assign Souza parking space #6 or #5. I can assign Souza parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
Once I have assigned Souza a parking space, I can then assign Young a parking space. Since Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa, I cannot assign Young parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4. I can only assign Young parking space #5 or #6.
Once I have assigned Young a parking space, I can then assign Xu a parking space. Since Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, I cannot assign Xu parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4. I can only assign Xu parking space #5 or #6.
Once I have assigned Xu a parking space, I can then assign Vaughn a parking space. Since Vaughn has no restrictions on his parking space, I can assign him any of the remaining parking spaces.
I have now assigned all six employees parking spaces. I have followed all of the rules. I have also limited the assignment of a parking space to one of only two possible spaces for two of the six employees: Togowa and Young.
