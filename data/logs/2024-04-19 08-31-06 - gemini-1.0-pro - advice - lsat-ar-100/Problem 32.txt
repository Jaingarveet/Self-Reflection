Topic: Law
Context: A maintenance company that takes service requests from three clients—Image, Solide, and Truvest—plans to set targets for its average service response times. Service targets will be set at 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day. Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail. The six targets are set according to the following conditions: None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
Question: If none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days, then each of the following must be true EXCEPT:
Choices:
  A: Image's website target is 1 day.
  B: Solide's website target is 2 days.
  C: Solide's voicemail target is 2 days.
  D: Truvest's website target is 2 days.
  E: Truvest's voicemail target is 2 days.

## Assistant 2:
Self-reflection:
I made a mistake in my previous answer because I did not fully consider the implications of the given conditions. I assumed that Image's voicemail target had to be 1 day, but this was not necessarily true.
I have learned that it is important to carefully analyze all of the conditions and their implications before making any assumptions. I will also use a more systematic approach to eliminate incorrect options and double-check my reasoning before making a final decision.
