Advice:
- Be cautious of making assumptions based on incomplete information.
- Focus on identifying the relative comparisons and absolute values explicitly stated in the problem.
- Analyze the choices systematically, considering all possibilities allowed by the available information.
- Choose the answer that is definitively true, even if other possibilities remain.
## Assistant 2:
**Self-Reflection:**
* **Mistake:** I initially chose Answer("A") based on the assumption that Lopez reviews fewer plays than Megregian, which is true. However, I failed to consider the additional information that neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. This oversight led to an incorrect conclusion.
* **Correction:** To avoid such mistakes in the future, I will pay closer attention to all the conditions provided in the problem and ensure that my reasoning is consistent with all of them. I will also double-check my assumptions and conclusions before selecting an answer.
**Analysis:**
* **Relative Comparisons:**
    * Kramer and Lopez each review fewer plays than Megregian.
    * Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
    * Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
* **Absolute Values:**
    * Exactly two students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
**Choices Analysis:**
* **A: Jiang reviews more of the plays than Lopez does.** This could be true, but it is not definitively stated.
* **B: Megregian reviews more of the plays than Jiang does.** This is not necessarily true. Jiang could review the same number of plays as Megregian.
* **C: Megregian reviews more of the plays than O'Neill does.** This could be true, but it is not definitively stated.
* **D: O'Neill reviews more of the plays than Jiang does.** This could be true, but it is not definitively stated.
* **E: O'Neill reviews more of the plays than Kramer does.** This is not necessarily true. Kramer could review the same number of plays as O'Neill.
**Conclusion:**
The only statement that is definitively true based on the given information is that **Jiang reviews more of the plays than Lopez does**. This is because Lopez reviews fewer plays than Megregian, and Megregian does not review any play Jiang reviews.
**Action: Answer("A")**
