## Self-Reflection
**Previous Incorrect Answer:**
My previous answer was incorrect because I did not consider all the rules and constraints of the problem. I focused too much on the individual rules for each house and did not pay enough attention to the overall order of the houses.
**Analysis of the Correct Answer:**
The correct answer is **C: L is shown in the evening.**
Here's why:
* **Rule 1:** J must be shown in the evening.
* **Rule 2:** K cannot be shown in the morning.
* **Rule 3:** L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
Based on these rules, we can eliminate options A, B, D, and E:
* **A: K is shown in the evening:** This is not necessarily true. K could be shown in the afternoon if L is shown in the evening.
* **B: L is shown in the afternoon:** This is not possible because L must be shown after K, which cannot be shown in the morning.
* **D: M is shown in the morning:** This is not possible because L must be shown before M, and L cannot be shown in the morning.
* **E: M is shown in the afternoon:** This is not necessarily true. M could be shown in the evening if L is shown in the evening.
Therefore, the only option that must be true is **C: L is shown in the evening.** This is because L must be shown after K (which cannot be shown in the morning) and before M (which cannot be shown in the afternoon).
