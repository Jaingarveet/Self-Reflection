## Assistant 1:
Explanation:
I miscalculated the product of the number of letters in the city and state names. 
The gap in my knowledge was not in geography but in basic arithmetic. 
I knew the correct city and state but made a calculation error.
Error Keywords:

Correct answer: A

Explanation: To hard boil eggs, you should fill a pan with cold water and set the eggs in it. Then, heat the water until it reaches a rolling boil, turn off the stove, and cover the pan for 20 minutes. This will cook the eggs until they are fully cooked and ready to be added to the salad.
