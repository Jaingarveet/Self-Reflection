Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to deal with frenemies [title] Confide in a true friend that you trust. [step] If you're not sure whether or not this person is a frenemy, talk over your concerns with a friend you're absolutely sure about and happy around. This person may throw new perspective onto the situation that helps you to realize the value of your relationship with the frenemy.
Choices:
  A: If you're just like them, you may not enjoy talking about the dark side of things so this person might not be a good friend. [substeps] Talk to a good friend who you trust.
  B: [substeps] Be sure to jot down this information to work through later. Otherwise, you might find yourself feeling bitterness or resentment.
  C: [substeps] By being open and honest with the frenemy, you'll guarantee that the person will be honest with you about their feelings. [title] Put yourself in the frenemy's shoes.
  D: [substeps] Be certain who you're talking to won't pass your concerns back to the frenemy. [title] Play it safe by ending the relationship gently.

  Thought: The most likely completion to the text is option B: "Be sure to jot down this information to work through later. Otherwise, you might find yourself feeling bitterness or resentment."

Explanation: The text suggests that talking to a trusted friend can provide new perspective on the situation and help the person realize the value of their relationship with the frenemy. However, if the person does not jot down the information and work through it later, they may find themselves feeling bitterness or resentment towards the frenemy. This is a common pitfall when dealing with difficult relationships, and it is important to address the issues in a constructive manner to avoid holding onto negative emotions.
