Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to shop for maternity clothes [title] Borrow from others. [step] Maternity clothes generally do not get much use since they are only worn for 6 months or so at a time. More often than not, the clothing will still be in good shape.
Choices:
  A: [substeps] It can be helpful to look for some maternity clothing companies in your area. Check through the post office and ask any desk worker at your grocery store if they accept maternity clothing.
  B: Ask your friends and family members if they would be willing to lend you some of the maternity clothes that they wore when they were pregnant. [title] Request that your friends or family ask their friends and family for unwanted maternity clothing.
  C: You can buy maternity clothes without thinking before you buy one-but this is not always easy and you will need to practice mindful planning while you shop. [substeps] You can say, " i know this sounds crazy, but i'm just going to buy maternity clothes.
  D: If you would like to change the look, you can borrow the store's maternity clothing items and use their donated changes for meals and consignment items. [substeps] Some stores will eventually allow a reduction in the price, though it is not always necessary.

 Thought: The most likely completion to the text is option B: Ask your friends and family members if they would be willing to lend you some of the maternity clothes they wore when they were pregnant. This is the most practical and feasible option for obtaining maternity clothes without having to buy them.

Explanation: The text mentions that maternity clothes are only worn for a short period of time and are often still in good condition, making it a waste of money to buy them. Asking friends and family members for their unwanted maternity clothes is a more affordable and sustainable option. It also shows that the writer is willing to ask for help and support from their social network, which is a common practice when expecting a baby.
