## System:
You are an expert in Law.
You have incorrectly answered the following multiple-choice question.
Your task is to reflect on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
You will then use this information help you answer the same question in the future.
First, explain why you answered the question incorrectly.
Second, list the keywords that describe the type of your errors from most general to most specific. 
Third, solve the problem again, step-by-step, based on your knowledge of the correct answer.
Fourth, create a list of detailed instructions to help you correctly solve this problem in the future.
Finally, create a list of general advice to help you solve similar types of problems in the future.  
Be concise in your response; however, capture all of the essential information.  
For guidance, I will provide you with a single generic example problem and reflection (below).

Topic: Geography and Math
Question: What is the product of the number of letters contained in the name of the city where Iowa State University is located multiplied by the number of letters contained in the name of the state?
Choices:
    A: 16
    B: 20
    C: 24
    D: 32
Thought:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
ISU is located in the state of Iowa.
Action: Answer("D")
---
Correct Answer: A
## Assistant 1:
Explanation:
I miscalculated the product of the number of letters in the city and state names. 
The gap in my knowledge was not in geography but in basic arithmetic. 
I knew the correct city and state but made a calculation error.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Arithmetic error
 - Multiplication error
Solution:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
Iowa State University is located in the state of Iowa.
The city name "Ames" contains 4 letters.
The state name "Iowa" contains 4 letters.
The product of 4*4 is 16.
Instructions:
1. Identify the city where the university is located.
2. Identify the state where the university is located.
3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.
4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.
5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.
6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.
7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them.

Topic: Law
Context: Radio producer: Our failure to attract new listeners over the past several years has forced us to choose between devoting some airtime to other, more popular genres of music, and sticking with classical music that appeals only to our small but loyal audience. This audience, however loyal, did not generate enough advertising revenue for us to pay our bills, so if we appeal to them alone, our station risks going out of business. We should not take that risk. We should, therefore, devote some airtime to other, more popular genres of music.
Question: Which one of the following arguments is most similar in its pattern of reasoning to that used by the radio producer?
Choices:
  A: We should either buy blinds for the windows or make full-length curtains. Blinds would be very expensive to purchase. Thus, if cost is our greatest concern, we should make curtains.
  B: We should either make curtains for the windows or buy blinds. Since the windows are not standard sizes, if we buy blinds we will have to special order them. Since we do not have time to wait for special orders, we should make the curtains.
  C: For the living room windows, we can make curtains or valances or both. We want to have privacy; and while curtains provide privacy, valances do not. So we should make curtains but not valances.
  D: Since we have very little fabric, we will have to either buy more, or make valances instead of curtains. However, if we use this fabric to make valances, then we will have to buy blinds. Since it would be hard to buy fabric that matches what we already have, we should buy blinds.
  E: We should either buy blinds or make curtains for the windows. If we buy blinds but do not make valances, the windows will look bare. We should not have bare windows. So if we do not make the curtains, we should make the valances.

Thought:
The radio producer's argument is based on the need to choose between two options, one of which is not generating enough revenue to sustain the business. The argument is that they should choose the other option to avoid going out of business.

Choice A is similar in its pattern of reasoning, as it presents two options and argues that one of them is too expensive, so the other option should be chosen if cost is the greatest concern.

Action: Answer("A")

Correct Answer: B
## Assistant 2:
Response:
Explanation:
I incorrectly identified the pattern of reasoning in the radio producer's argument. The radio producer's argument is not based solely on cost, but on the need to avoid going out of business. The argument is that they should choose the other option to avoid going out of business, not because it is less expensive.

Error Keywords:

* Misinterpretation of the argument
* Incorrect identification of the pattern of reasoning
* Failure to consider all aspects of the argument

Solution:
The radio producer's argument is based on the need to choose between two options, one of which is not generating enough revenue to sustain the business. The argument is that they should choose the other option to avoid going out of business.

Choice B is similar in its pattern of reasoning, as it presents two options and argues that one of them is not feasible due to time constraints, so the other option should be chosen.

Instructions:

1. Carefully read the argument presented in the context.
2. Identify the pattern of reasoning used in the argument.
3. Consider all aspects of the argument, including any assumptions or implications.
4. Compare the pattern of reasoning in the argument to the patterns of reasoning in each of the answer choices.
5. Choose the answer choice that most closely matches the pattern of reasoning in the argument.

Advice:

* Always read the argument carefully and consider all aspects of it.
* Be sure to identify the pattern of reasoning used in the argument.
* Do not make assumptions about the argument or the answer choices.
* Compare the pattern of reasoning in the argument to the patterns of reasoning in each of the answer choices.
* Choose the answer choice that most closely matches the pattern of reasoning in the argument.
