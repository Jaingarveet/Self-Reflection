## System:
You are an expert in Law.
You have incorrectly answered the following multiple-choice question.
Your task is to reflect on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
You will then use this information help you answer the same question in the future.
First, explain why you answered the question incorrectly.
Second, list the keywords that describe the type of your errors from most general to most specific. 
Third, solve the problem again, step-by-step, based on your knowledge of the correct answer.
Fourth, create a list of detailed instructions to help you correctly solve this problem in the future.
Finally, create a list of general advice to help you solve similar types of problems in the future.  
Be concise in your response; however, capture all of the essential information.  
For guidance, I will provide you with a single generic example problem and reflection (below).

Topic: Geography and Math
Question: What is the product of the number of letters contained in the name of the city where Iowa State University is located multiplied by the number of letters contained in the name of the state?
Choices:
    A: 16
    B: 20
    C: 24
    D: 32
Thought:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
ISU is located in the state of Iowa.
Action: Answer("D")
---
Correct Answer: A
## Assistant 1:
Explanation:
I miscalculated the product of the number of letters in the city and state names. 
The gap in my knowledge was not in geography but in basic arithmetic. 
I knew the correct city and state but made a calculation error.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Arithmetic error
 - Multiplication error
Solution:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
Iowa State University is located in the state of Iowa.
The city name "Ames" contains 4 letters.
The state name "Iowa" contains 4 letters.
The product of 4*4 is 16.
Instructions:
1. Identify the city where the university is located.
2. Identify the state where the university is located.
3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.
4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.
5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.
6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.
7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them.

Topic: Law
Context: Game show winners choosing between two equally desirable prizes will choose either the one that is more expensive or the one with which they are more familiar. Today's winner, Ed, is choosing between two equally desirable and equally unfamiliar prizes, A and B. He will thus choose A, which is more expensive.
Question: The reasoning in which one of the following is most similar to the reasoning above?
Choices:
  A: With a book contract, an academic writer receives either an advance or a guarantee of royalties. Professor al-Sofi received an advance for a book contract, so al-Sofi did not receive a guarantee of royalties.
  B: When entering this amusement park, children always choose to take their first ride on either the Rocket or the Mouse. Janine insisted on the Rocket for her first ride. Thus, Janine would not have been standing near the Mouse during her first half hour in the amusement park.
  C: The elliptical orbit of an asteroid is only slightly eccentric unless it is affected by the gravitational pull of a planet. Asteroid Y is affected by Jupiter's gravitational pull and asteroid X is not. Thus, the orbit of asteroid Y is the more eccentric of the two.
  D: New students in this program must choose either a physics class or an art class. Miyoko has no desire to take a class in either of those fields, so Miyoko will probably not enter this program.
  E: To avoid predators, rabbits will either double back on their pursuers or flee for nearby cover. The rabbit being pursued by a fox in this wildlife film is in a field that offers no opportunity for nearby cover, so it will try to double back on the fox.

Thought:
The reasoning in the original statement is that when presented with two equally desirable and equally unfamiliar options, the person will choose the one that is more expensive.
The reasoning in choice C is similar, as it presents two options (asteroids) that are different in one aspect (eccentricity of orbit), and the choice is made based on that difference.
Action: Answer("C")

 --- 
Correct Answer: E
## Assistant 2:
Response:
Explanation:
I misunderstood the reasoning in the original statement and failed to identify the correct analogy in the answer choices.
The gap in my knowledge was in understanding the reasoning behind the original statement and identifying the correct analogy in the answer choices.
I incorrectly focused on the difference in one aspect between the two options, rather than the reasoning behind the choice made.

Error Keywords:
 - Misunderstanding of reasoning
 - Incorrect analogy
 - Focus on difference rather than reasoning

Solution:
The reasoning in the original statement is that when presented with two equally desirable and equally unfamiliar options, the person will choose the one that is more expensive.
The reasoning in choice E is similar, as it presents two options (doubling back or fleeing for cover) that are equally desirable and equally unfamiliar to the rabbit, and the choice is made based on the availability of nearby cover.

Instructions:
1. Identify the reasoning behind the original statement.
2. Compare the reasoning in each answer choice to the reasoning in the original statement.
3. Identify the answer choice that presents a similar reasoning to the original statement.
4. Double-check your answer to ensure that it is based on the reasoning, not just the difference between the options.
5. Choose the answer that matches your identified reasoning.

Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always identify the reasoning behind the original statement.
 - Always compare the reasoning in each answer choice to the reasoning in the original statement.
 - Never focus solely on the difference between the options; consider the reasoning behind the choice made.
 - Always double-check your answer to ensure that it is based on the reasoning, not just the difference between the options.
 - Remember that the correct answer will present a similar reasoning to the original statement, not just a similar difference between the options.
