## System:
You are an expert in Law.
You have incorrectly answered the following multiple-choice question.
Your task is to reflect on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
You will then use this information help you answer the same question in the future.
First, explain why you answered the question incorrectly.
Second, list the keywords that describe the type of your errors from most general to most specific. 
Third, solve the problem again, step-by-step, based on your knowledge of the correct answer.
Fourth, create a list of detailed instructions to help you correctly solve this problem in the future.
Finally, create a list of general advice to help you solve similar types of problems in the future.  
Be concise in your response; however, capture all of the essential information.  
For guidance, I will provide you with a single generic example problem and reflection (below).

Topic: Geography and Math
Question: What is the product of the number of letters contained in the name of the city where Iowa State University is located multiplied by the number of letters contained in the name of the state?
Choices:
    A: 16
    B: 20
    C: 24
    D: 32
Thought:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
ISU is located in the state of Iowa.
Action: Answer("D")
---
Correct Answer: A
## Assistant 1:
Explanation:
I miscalculated the product of the number of letters in the city and state names. 
The gap in my knowledge was not in geography but in basic arithmetic. 
I knew the correct city and state but made a calculation error.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Arithmetic error
 - Multiplication error
Solution:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
Iowa State University is located in the state of Iowa.
The city name "Ames" contains 4 letters.
The state name "Iowa" contains 4 letters.
The product of 4*4 is 16.
Instructions:
1. Identify the city where the university is located.
2. Identify the state where the university is located.
3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.
4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.
5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.
6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.
7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them.

Topic: Law
Context: Judge: The defendant admits noncompliance with national building codes but asks that penalties not be imposed because he was confused as to whether national or local building codes applied to the area in which he was building. This excuse might be acceptable had he been charged with noncompliance with local codes, but since he is charged with noncompliance with national codes, his excuse is unacceptable.
Question: Which one of the following principles, if valid, most helps to justify the judge's reasoning?
Choices:
  A: Local codes and national codes must not overlap with each other.
  B: Local codes may be less strict, but not more strict, than national codes.
  C: Any behavior required by national codes is also required by local codes.
  D: Ignorance of the difference between two codes is not an adequate excuse for noncompliance.
  E: A behavior that is in compliance with one law is not necessarily in compliance with another.

Thought:
The judge's reasoning is based on the fact that the defendant cannot use confusion between local and national codes as an excuse for noncompliance with national codes.
The principle that justifies this reasoning is that ignorance of the difference between two codes is not an adequate excuse for noncompliance.
Action: Answer("D")

 --- 
Correct Answer: C
## Assistant 2:
Response:
Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I focused too narrowly on the defendant's excuse and the judge's rejection of it, rather than considering the broader principle that underlies the judge's reasoning.

Error Keywords:
 - Narrow focus
 - Misinterpretation of the question
 - Failure to consider broader principles

Solution:
The judge's reasoning is based on the fact that the defendant's noncompliance with national codes cannot be excused by confusion with local codes.
The principle that justifies this reasoning is that any behavior required by national codes is also required by local codes.
This means that if the defendant was required to comply with national codes, then he was also required to comply with local codes, and his confusion between the two is irrelevant.

Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and identify the key issue.
2. Consider the broader principles that underlie the judge's reasoning.
3. Identify the principle that most directly supports the judge's reasoning.
4. Eliminate answer choices that are not directly relevant to the issue or that contradict the principle.
5. Choose the answer that best reflects the principle that supports the judge's reasoning.

Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and identify the key issue.
 - Consider the broader principles that underlie the reasoning presented in the question.
 - Avoid focusing too narrowly on specific details or arguments presented in the question.
 - Eliminate answer choices that are not directly relevant to the issue or that contradict the principle.
 - Choose the answer that best reflects the principle that supports the reasoning presented in the question.
