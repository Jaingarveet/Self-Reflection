## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The argument states that once Acme moves to Ocean View, most employees will have a commute of more than 30 minutes. 
2. For this to be a meaningful statement, we must assume that the commute time will increase for most employees after the move. Otherwise, the argument would be irrelevant.
3. The argument does not provide any information about the current commute times of Acme employees. So for the argument to be valid, we must assume that currently, most employees have a commute of less than 30 minutes.
4. Choices B, C and E mention financial considerations, employee preferences, and pay raises, none of which are necessary assumptions for the argument to hold. The argument is only about commute times.
5. Choice A goes too far - the argument doesn't require that all employees currently have a short commute, only that most do.
Therefore, the argument requires assuming Choice D: Currently, most Acme employees have a commute of less than 30 minutes. This is the implicit assumption necessary for the argument to be valid.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: E
Score: 0
