Topic: Law
Context: Of the eight students—George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert—in a seminar, exactly six will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
Question: If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, could be given by

## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step, taking into account the constraints and my previous reflection:
1. Kyle and Lenore are not giving reports. That leaves George, Helen, Irving, Nina, Olivia, and Robert.
2. Tuesday is the only day George can report. So George must give a report on Tuesday, either morning or afternoon.
3. Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports. So they must give morning reports if they report at all.
4. If Nina reports, then the next day both Helen and Irving must report (unless Nina reports on Wednesday). 
5. Since exactly 2 people report each day, if Nina reports on Monday or Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must take up both slots the following day (since they must both report).
6. Looking at the answer choices, only B and E have George reporting on Tuesday. Let's consider each:
   B) Irving, Robert, and Helen. This doesn't work because if Irving reports Monday, Nina can't report Monday (since Helen and Irving would then need to report Tuesday, but George must report Tuesday).
   E) Robert, George, and Helen. This works. Robert can report Monday morning, George Tuesday morning, and Helen Wednesday morning. Nina, Irving and Olivia don't report in this scenario, which is allowed.
Therefore, the correct answer is E: Robert, George, and Helen could give the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday respectively, if Kyle and Lenore do not report.
Action: Answer("E")
