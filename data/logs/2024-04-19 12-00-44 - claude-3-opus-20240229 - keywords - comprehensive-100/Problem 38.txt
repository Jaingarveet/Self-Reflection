Topic: Law
Context: Economics professor: Marty's Pizza and Checkers Pizza are the two major pizza parlors in our town. Marty's sold coupon books including coupons good for one large plain pizza at any local pizza parlor, at Marty's expense. But Checkers refused to accept these coupons, even though they were redeemed by all other local pizza parlors. Accepting them would have cost Checkers nothing and would have satisfied those of its potential customers who had purchased the coupon books. This shows that Checkers's motive in refusing to accept the coupons was simply to hurt Marty's Pizza.
Question: Which one of the following, if assumed, enables the economics professor's conclusion to be properly drawn?
Choices:
  A: Any company that refuses to accept coupons issued by a competitor when doing so would satisfy some of the company's potential customers is motivated solely by the desire to hurt that competitor.
  B: Any company that wishes to hurt a competitor by refusing to accept coupons issued by that competitor will refuse to accept them even when accepting them would cost nothing and would satisfy its potential customers.
  C: At least one company has refused to accept coupons issued by its major local competitor simply in order to hurt that competitor, even though those coupons were accepted by all other local competitors.
  D: Any company that accepts its major competitor's coupons helps its competitor by doing so, even if it also satisfies its own actual or potential customers.
  E: If accepting coupons issued by a competitor would not enable a company to satisfy its actual or potential customers, then that company's refusal to accept the coupons is motivated by the desire to satisfy customers.

## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The professor concludes that Checkers refused the coupons solely to hurt Marty's Pizza. To properly draw this conclusion, we need to find an assumption that bridges the gap between the premises and the conclusion.
2. The premises state that:
   - Accepting the coupons would have cost Checkers nothing
   - Accepting the coupons would have satisfied some of Checkers' potential customers
   - Checkers still refused to accept the coupons
3. Looking at the answer choices:
   A) This is too broad. It assumes any company in this situation is solely motivated by hurting competitors, which is not necessarily true.
   
   B) This looks promising. It states that if a company wants to hurt a competitor by refusing coupons, it will do so even if accepting them costs nothing and satisfies customers. This helps bridge the gap to the professor's conclusion.
   
   C) This just restates information from the premises, but doesn't provide the assumption needed to reach the conclusion.
   
   D) This is irrelevant. Whether accepting coupons helps the competitor is not the focus here.
   
   E) This is the opposite of the situation described in the premises.
4. Choice B provides the necessary assumption: if Checkers wanted to hurt Marty's, it would refuse the coupons even if accepting them cost nothing and satisfied customers. This is exactly what Checkers did according to the premises, allowing the professor to conclude Checkers was motivated by hurting Marty's.
