## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The space shuttle travels 700m high in 40 seconds at maximum speed. 
2. To find the speed, we use the formula: speed = distance / time
   speed = 700m / 40s = 17.5 m/s
3. Now, we know it takes the shuttle 5 seconds to pass a point. This 5 seconds is the time it takes the shuttle to travel its own length at the maximum speed.
4. Using the speed we calculated and the time to pass a point, we can find the length:
   length = speed * time 
          = 17.5 m/s * 5s
          = 87.5 m
5. The closest answer choice to 87.5 m is 75 m.
Action: Answer("B")
