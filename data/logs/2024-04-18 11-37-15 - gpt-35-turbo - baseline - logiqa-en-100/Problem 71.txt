Topic: Logic
Context: It is no longer new for college students to take vacation as a nanny.A survey showed that 63% of the respondents favored college students as nanny, but when asked if they would ask college students to be nanny, nearly 60% said "no".
Question: Which of the following statements, if true, can reasonably explain the seemingly contradictory phenomenon?
Choices:
  A: Among those who choose to "will invite college students to be nanny", 75% intend to let college students work as tutors or secretaries, and only 25% want college students to do housework.
  B: 62% of the people in the survey indicated that they were only willing to pay a monthly salary of 800 yuan to 1,000 yuan for the college nanny.
  C: Among those who favor college students as nanny, 69% think that doing housekeeping work is good for college students themselves, and only 31% think that college students nanny can provide better housekeeping services.
  D: Among those who do not approve of college students being nanny, 40% believe that students should choose a field related to their major in practice.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The survey shows that a majority of respondents favor college students as nannies, but a majority of respondents would not actually hire college students as nannies. There must be a reason for this contradiction.
Action: Answer("B") 
Explanation: 
Option B provides a possible explanation for the contradiction. If the respondents are only willing to pay a low salary for a college nanny, then they may not be able to find a college student who is willing to work for such a low wage. This could explain why they would say they favor college students as nannies but would not actually hire them.
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
