Thought:
- Chessman A defeated Chessman B, and Chessman B applauded Chessman C. This means Chessman C is stronger than Chessman B.
- The six players who entered the second round are of equal strength, but they can still score points. This means that the difference in strength between the players is not significant.
- Based on the information given, it is not possible to determine the exact strength of Chessman A and Chessman C.
- Therefore, it is possible that Chessman A is stronger than Chessman C, or vice versa.
- The outcome of the match between Chessman A and Chessman C cannot be determined with certainty.
