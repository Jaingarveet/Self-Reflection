Context: Aluminum alloys have widely replaced steel in military equipment because they provide the same protection and are lighter in weight.But the manufacturing cost of an aluminum alloy armored vehicle is twice that of a newly armored vehicle.Therefore, from a financial point of view, it is not advisable to replace steel armored vehicles with aluminum alloy armored vehicles with the same protective properties.
Question: Which of the following is true can raise greater doubts about the above conclusion?
