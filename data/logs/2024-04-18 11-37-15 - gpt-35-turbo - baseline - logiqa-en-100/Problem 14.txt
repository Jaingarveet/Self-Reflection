## Assistant 2:
Thought:
If the Human Resources Department is not at the upper level of the Administration Department, then the Administration Department is on the top floor. 
The Finance Department is on the next floor of the Planning Department. 
The two floors of the Human Resources Department and the Sales Department are not adjacent. 
Action: Answer("B") 
Explanation: 
If the Administration Department is on the top floor, then the Planning Department is on the 5th floor. According to the third statement, the Administration Department is above the Planning Department, but below the Human Resources Department. Therefore, the Human Resources Department must be on the 6th floor. Since the Sales Department is not adjacent to the Human Resources Department, it cannot be on the 5th floor. Therefore, the Sales Department must be on the 4th floor or lower. The only option that satisfies this condition is that the Sales Department is one level above the Administration Department, which is option B.

Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
