## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Printing group has G, H, and L.
From condition (2), F and K cannot be in the same group. So, F and K must be in the binding group.
From condition (3), if K is in a certain group, J must also be in this group. So, J must be in the binding group.
From condition (4), M is at least one of the members of these two groups. So, M must be in the binding group.
From condition (5), at least one of the same employees in both groups. So, the binding group and the printing group have at least one common member.
The printing group has only three members, so the binding group has four members.
