## User 2:
Topic: Logic
Context: Some Taiwan independence elements argue that all people under the jurisdiction of the People ’s Republic of China are Chinese, and Taiwanese are not under the jurisdiction of the People ’s Republic of China.Therefore, Taiwanese are not Chinese.
Question: Which of the following reasoning clearly shows that the above argument is not valid?
Choices:
  A: All successful people have to eat in clothes.I am not a successful person now, so I do n’t have to eat in clothes.
  B: Commodities have use value, and air certainly has use value, so air is of course a commodity.
  C: All technical backbones study hard.Xiao Zhang is a technical backbone.Therefore, Xiao Zhang is a hard-working person.
  D: Criminal behaviors are illegal behaviors, and violations should be condemned by the society, so all criminal behaviors should be condemned by the society.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The argument presented in the context is an example of a fallacy of denying the antecedent. It assumes that if A (all people under the jurisdiction of the People's Republic of China are Chinese) is true, then B (Taiwanese are not Chinese) must also be true. However, this is not necessarily the case.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
