Context: According to a report, in the year to March, mainland Chinese buyers became the second largest group of foreign buyers buying US real estate, with a transaction volume of US $ 9 billion, second only to Canada.This is 23% higher than the previous year ’s USD 7.3 billion transaction volume and 88% higher than the previous year ’s USD 4.8 billion transaction volume.Some people think that there are more and more rich people in China who are transferring their property abroad.
Question: Which of the following is true is the best argument against the above argument
Choices:
  ?: Although the turnover has increased by 23%, the volume of Chinese buyers has not increased this year
  C: There are groups of real estate speculators among the wealthy Chinese who have speculated in Beijing and Shanghai
  D: The risk of the US real estate market has been small in recent years and has a certain function of value preservation and appreciation
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The argument is that more and more rich people in China are transferring their property abroad, which is supported by the increase in transaction volume of Chinese buyers in the US real estate market.
To argue against this, we need to provide an alternative explanation for the increase in transaction volume.
Option A does not provide an alternative explanation, so it is not the best argument against the above argument.
Option C is not relevant to the argument, so it is not the best argument against the above argument.
Option D provides an alternative explanation for the increase in transaction volume, suggesting that the US real estate market has a function of value preservation and appreciation, which may attract more buyers regardless of their nationality.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
