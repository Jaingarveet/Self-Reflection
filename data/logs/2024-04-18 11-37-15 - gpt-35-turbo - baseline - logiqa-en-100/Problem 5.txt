Context: The function of the government is to meet the real needs of the people.Unless the government knows what those needs are, the government cannot meet those needs.Freedom of expression can ensure that government officials hear such demand messages.Therefore, for a healthy country, free speech is essential.
Question: Which of the following, if true, cannot weaken the above argument?

  C: The legitimate function of the government is not to satisfy the needs of the people, but to provide equal opportunities for the people.
  D: Freedom of expression is insufficient to satisfy the needs of the masses, and good social order is also essential.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The argument states that free speech is essential for a healthy country because it ensures that government officials hear the demand messages of the people, which is necessary for the government to meet the real needs of the people. We need to find a statement that does not contradict this argument.
A: This statement weakens the argument because if the people do not know what they really need, then free speech may not necessarily lead to the government meeting the real needs of the people.
B: This statement weakens the argument because it suggests that free speech may not be essential for meeting the needs of the masses.
C: This statement weakens the argument because it suggests that the government's legitimate function is not to meet the needs of the people, which contradicts the argument's premise.
D: This statement does not weaken the argument because it does not contradict the argument's premise that free speech is essential for ensuring that government officials hear the demand messages of the people.
