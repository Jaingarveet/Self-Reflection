## Assistant 2:
Thought:

1. Since Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, the remaining students who can give reports are George, Helen, Irving, Nina, Olivia, and Robert.
2. The conditions for each student's report are:
	* George can only give a report on Tuesday.
	* Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports.
	* If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
3. The time slots for each day's reports are:
	* Monday: morning and afternoon
	* Tuesday: morning and afternoon
	* Wednesday: morning and afternoon
4. Considering the conditions for each student's report in relation to the time slots:
	* George must give the morning report on Tuesday, as he cannot give a report on any other day.
	* Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports, so they can only give morning reports.
	* If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Tuesday. However, George must give a report on Tuesday, so this is not possible. Therefore, Nina cannot give a report on Monday.
	* If Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Wednesday. This is possible, as long as Olivia and Robert do not give reports on Wednesday.
5. Eliminate any options that contradict the conditions:
	* Option B: Irving, Robert, and Helen - This option is not possible, as Robert cannot give an afternoon report, and the only available afternoon slot is on Tuesday.
	* Option C: Nina, Helen, and Olivia - This option is not possible, as Nina cannot give a report on Monday.
	* Option D: Olivia, Robert, and Irving - This option is not possible, as Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports, and the only available afternoon slots are on Monday and Tuesday.
	* Option E: Robert, George, and Helen - This option is not possible, as Robert cannot give an afternoon report, and the only available afternoon slot is on Tuesday.
6. The only remaining option is:
	* Option A: Helen, George, and Nina
7. Double-checking my reasoning and final answer:
	* Helen can give the morning report on Monday.
	* George must give the morning report on Tuesday.
	* Nina can give the morning report on Wednesday, and Helen and Irving can give the afternoon reports on Tuesday and Wednesday, respectively.
