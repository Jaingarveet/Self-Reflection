Reflection:

1. The minimum number of works that must be selected is 5, and the maximum number of works that can be selected is 6.

Since at least three but no more than four novels have been selected, the maximum number of additional novels that can be selected is 1. Since at least as many French novels as Russian novels have been selected, the maximum number of additional Russian novels that can be selected is 1.
4. If both French plays are selected, then the Russian play is not selected.
