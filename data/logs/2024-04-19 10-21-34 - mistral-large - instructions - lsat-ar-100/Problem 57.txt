## Assistant 2:
Thought:
George can only give a report on Tuesday.
If Nina gives a report, then Helen and Irving must give reports on the next day, unless Nina's report is on Wednesday.
Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports.

Since George can only give a report on Tuesday, he cannot be paired with any student who must give a report on Wednesday. Therefore, option A (George and Lenore) is not possible.

If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday, but Tuesday is the only day George can give a report. Therefore, Nina cannot give a report on Monday. If Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Wednesday. However, George must give a report on Tuesday, so Nina cannot give a report on Tuesday either. Therefore, Nina must give a report on Wednesday.

If Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving cannot give reports on the next day. Therefore, if Nina and Helen give reports on the same day, it must be on Wednesday. So option B (Helen and Nina) is possible.

If Irving gives a report on Monday, then Nina must give a report on Tuesday, but Tuesday is the only day George can give a report. Therefore, Irving cannot give a report on Monday. If Irving gives a report on Tuesday, then Nina must give a report on Wednesday. However, George must give a report on Tuesday, so Irving cannot give a report on Tuesday either. Therefore, Irving must give a report on Wednesday. If Robert gives a report on Wednesday, then Olivia cannot give a report on Wednesday because she cannot give an afternoon report. Therefore, option C (Irving and Robert) is not possible.

If Kyle gives a report on Monday, then Nina must give a report on Tuesday, but Tuesday is the only day George can give a report. Therefore, Kyle cannot give a report on Monday. If Kyle gives a report on Tuesday, then Nina must give a report on Wednesday. However, George must give a report on Tuesday, so Kyle cannot give a report on Tuesday either. Therefore, Kyle must give a report on Wednesday. If Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then Kyle can give a report on Wednesday. Therefore, option D (Kyle and Nina) is possible.

If Olivia gives a report on Monday, then Nina must give a report on Tuesday, but Tuesday is the only day George can give a report. Therefore, Olivia cannot give a report on Monday. If Olivia gives a report on Tuesday, then Nina must give a report on Wednesday. However, George must give a report on Tuesday, so Olivia cannot give a report on Tuesday either. Therefore, Olivia must give a report on Wednesday. If Kyle gives a report on Wednesday, then Olivia can give a report on Wednesday. Therefore, option E (Olivia and Kyle) is possible.

However, since Nina must give a report on Wednesday, she cannot be paired with any student who must give a report on a different day. Therefore, option D (Kyle and Nina) is not possible.
