Topic: Law
Context: Of the eight students—George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert—in a seminar, exactly six will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.

Choices:
  A: Helen gives a report on Monday.
  B: Irving gives a report on Monday.

## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Since Helen, Kyle, and Lenore give the morning reports, and George can only give a report on Tuesday, he must give the afternoon report on Tuesday. This means that neither Olivia nor Robert can give a report on Tuesday afternoon, so they must give their reports on Monday and Wednesday.
If Nina gives a report, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on the next day, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. Since Helen is giving a morning report, Irving cannot give a report on the same day as Nina. Therefore, Nina cannot give a report on Monday or Tuesday.
If Nina cannot give a report on Monday or Tuesday, then she must give a report on Wednesday. However, since Olivia and Robert must also give reports on Monday and Wednesday, and they cannot give afternoon reports, they must give the morning reports on those days. This means that Nina cannot give a report on Wednesday either.
Therefore, Nina cannot give a report at all. Since Helen and Irving must both give reports on the next day after Nina's report, and Nina cannot give a report, Irving must give a report on Monday or Wednesday.
Since Olivia and Robert must give reports on Monday and Wednesday, and they cannot give afternoon reports, they must give the morning reports on those days. Since Helen, Kyle, and Lenore give the morning reports, and Olivia and Robert give the morning reports on Monday and Wednesday, Kyle must give the morning report on Tuesday.
Therefore, Irving must give a report on Monday or Wednesday. Since Irving cannot give a report on Tuesday, and Kyle gives the morning report on Tuesday, Irving must give a report on Monday or Wednesday.
