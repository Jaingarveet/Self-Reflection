## Assistant 2:
Thought:
There are 9 batches of cookies in total, and no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. Since no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, the 9 batches must be distributed among Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday.

The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. Since the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, the first batch of sugar cookies cannot be made on Thursday. Therefore, the first batch of sugar cookies must be made on Monday or Tuesday.

If the first batch of sugar cookies is made on Monday, then the second batch of oatmeal cookies and the first batch of peanut butter cookies must also be made on Monday. However, this would mean that all three batches of oatmeal cookies would have to be made on Tuesday and Friday, which violates the condition that no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.

Therefore, the first batch of sugar cookies must be made on Tuesday. This means that the second batch of oatmeal cookies and the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Monday. The remaining batches of cookies can be distributed among Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday without violating any conditions.

Action: Answer("C") (At least two batches of cookies are made on Monday.)
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: D
