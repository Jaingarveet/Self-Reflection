## Assistant 2:
Thought:

1. The constraints of the problem are: Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day. Nessa must lead an afternoon session. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
2. Since Lan does not lead a Wednesday session, Lan must lead a session on Thursday or Friday.
3. Since Lan cannot lead a session on the same day as Olivia, Olivia must lead a session on Wednesday.
4. Since Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's, Julio must lead a session on Wednesday.
5. Since Nessa must lead an afternoon session, Nessa must lead a session on Wednesday afternoon or Thursday afternoon.
6. Since Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day, they must both lead sessions on Thursday or Friday.
7. Since Lan must lead a session on Thursday or Friday, and Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day, Kevin or Rebecca must lead a session on Thursday.
8. Since Kevin or Rebecca must lead a session on Thursday, and Nessa must lead an afternoon session, Nessa cannot lead a session on Thursday. Therefore, Kevin or Rebecca must lead a session on Thursday.
9. Double-checking my reasoning, I can confirm that Kevin or Rebecca must lead a session on Thursday.
10. The answer that matches my reasoning is "D: Kevin" or "A: Rebecca". However, since the question asks for which lab assistant must lead a Thursday session, and both Kevin and Rebecca can lead a Thursday session, the correct answer is either "D: Kevin" or "A: Rebecca". Since I cannot choose both, I will choose one of them.

Action: Answer("D") (Note: The correct answer could also be "A", but since I cannot choose both, I am choosing "D".)
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: E
Score: 0
