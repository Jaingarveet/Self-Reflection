## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The problem states that the third solo is a traditional piece and that exactly two of the traditional pieces are performed consecutively. This means that the fourth solo must also be a traditional piece.
The problem also states that in the fourth solo, either Wayne performs a traditional piece or Zara performs a modern piece. Since the fourth solo is a traditional piece, Wayne must perform it.
Therefore, Wayne performs at least one traditional piece.
