## Assistant 2:
Thought:
1. Conditions for each sales representative:
   - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone.
   - Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone.
   - Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
   - Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
2. Conditions for each sales zone:
   - There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
3. Possible scenarios based on the given conditions:
   - Since there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, Zone 3 must have at least 3 representatives.
   - Parra and Quinn must be together, and Stuckey and Udall must be together. The only way to satisfy this condition and have more representatives in Zone 3 is to have Parra and Quinn in Zone 1 and Stuckey and Udall in Zone 3.
   - This leaves Tiao, Kim, and Mahr. Tiao cannot be in Zone 1 (since Parra is there) or Zone 2 (since Udall is in Zone 3). Therefore, Tiao must be in Zone 3.
   - This leaves Kim and Mahr for Zone 2.
4. The scenario that satisfies all the given conditions is:
   - Zone 1: Parra, Quinn
   - Zone 2: Kim, Mahr
   - Zone 3: Stuckey, Udall, Tiao
