## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Julio and Kevin both lead morning sessions.
Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.

If Julio leads a morning session, he can only lead a session on Wednesday or Thursday morning.
If Kevin leads a morning session, he can only lead a session on Wednesday or Thursday morning.
Rebecca must lead a session on the same day as Kevin, so she can only lead a session on Wednesday or Thursday afternoon.
Nessa must lead an afternoon session, so she can lead a session on Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday afternoon.
Lan cannot lead a session on the same day as Olivia, so he can lead a session on Wednesday or Thursday.
Olivia cannot lead a session on the same day as Lan, so she can lead a session on Friday.

The only scheduling possibility that violates the constraints is:

D: Olivia's session meets Thursday morning.

Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
