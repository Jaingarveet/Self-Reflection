## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Based on the conditions, Kramer and Lopez each review fewer plays than Megregian, and neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Since there are only three plays, Megregian must review all three plays, and Jiang must review zero plays. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, so they each review at least one play. Since Kramer reviews fewer plays than Megregian, Kramer must review only one play. O'Neill could review one or two plays, but since exactly two students must review the same plays as each other, O'Neill must also review only one play (Tamerlane).
Action: Answer("E")
## Result:
Agent Answer: E
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
