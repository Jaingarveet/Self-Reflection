## Assistant 2:
Thought:

1. Conditions:
	* Kramer and Lopez each review fewer plays than Megregian.
	* Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
	* Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
	* Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
2. Plays each student can or cannot review:
	* Jiang cannot review Tamerlane (given in the question).
	* Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
	* Lopez and Megregian cannot review any play Jiang reviews.
3. Minimum and maximum number of plays each student can review:
	* Jiang can review 1 or 2 plays (maximum 2 because there are only 2 plays left: Sunset and Undulation).
	* Kramer can review 1 or 2 plays (minimum 1 because they review Tamerlane).
	* Lopez can review 1 play (maximum 1 because they review fewer plays than Megregian).
	* Megregian can review 2 plays (minimum 2 because they review more plays than Kramer and Lopez).
	* O'Neill can review 1 or 2 plays (minimum 1 because they review Tamerlane).
4. Plays that must be reviewed by at least two students:
	* Tamerlane must be reviewed by at least two students (Kramer and O'Neill).
5. Logical reasoning:
	* Since Jiang cannot review Tamerlane, they must review either Sunset or Undulation or both.
	* If Jiang reviews Sunset, then Megregian cannot review Sunset (because they cannot review any play Jiang reviews). So, Megregian must review Tamerlane and Undulation. But this would mean that Lopez cannot review any play, which contradicts the condition that Lopez reviews at least one play.
	* Therefore, Jiang must review Undulation.
	* Since Megregian reviews more plays than Lopez, Megregian must review Tamerlane and one other play. But Megregian cannot review Undulation (because Jiang reviews it). So, Megregian must review Tamerlane and Sunset.
	* This leaves Lopez with only one play to review: Undulation.
6. Double-check:
	* All conditions are met: Kramer and Lopez review fewer plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other (Kramer and O'Neill review Tamerlane; Megregian and O'Neill review Sunset).
7. Answer:
Action: Answer("B")
