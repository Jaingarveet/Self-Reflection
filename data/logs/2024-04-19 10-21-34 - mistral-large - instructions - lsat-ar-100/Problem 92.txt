## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The conditions given in the problem are:

* Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
* Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
* Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
* Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
* There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

Based on these conditions, let's consider all possible scenarios:

1. Parra works in Zone 1, Tiao works in Zone 2, and Udall works in Zone 3.
	* In this scenario, Quinn would have to work in Zone 1 with Parra, but this would violate the condition that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
2. Tiao works in Zone 1, Parra works in Zone 3, and Udall works in Zone 3.
	* In this scenario, Quinn would work in Zone 3 with Parra, and Stuckey would work in Zone 3 with Udall. This scenario satisfies all the given conditions.

Therefore, Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Tiao, since Tiao works in Zone 1 and Quinn works in Zone 3.

Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
