You are an expert in Law.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Topic: Law
Context: A government needs to assign new ambassadors to Venezuela, Yemen, and Zambia. The candidates for these ambassadorships are Jaramillo, Kayne, Landon, Novetzke, and Ong. One ambassador will be assigned to each country, and no ambassador will be assigned to more than one country. The assignment of the ambassadors must meet the following constraints: Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships. If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne. If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen. If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
Question: Which one of the following, if substituted for the constraint that if Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne, would have the same effect in determining the assignment of the ambassadors?
Choices:
  A: If Kayne is assigned to an ambassadorship, then so is Jaramillo.
  B: If Landon and Ong are both assigned to ambassadorships, then so is Novetzke.
  C: If Ong is not assigned to an ambassadorship, then Kayne is assigned to an ambassadorship.
  D: Jaramillo and Novetzke are not both assigned to ambassadorships.
  E: Novetzke and Ong are not both assigned to ambassadorships.

Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Carefully read and understand the original constraint.
2. Identify the effect of the original constraint.
3. Evaluate each alternative constraint to determine if it has the same effect as the original constraint.
4. Choose the alternative constraint that has the same effect as the original constraint.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The original constraint states that if Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne. This means that Jaramillo and Kayne must be assigned together to either Venezuela, Yemen, or Zambia.
The effect of this constraint is that Jaramillo cannot be assigned to an ambassadorship without Kayne also being assigned to an ambassadorship.
Let's evaluate each alternative constraint to determine if it has the same effect as the original constraint:
A: If Kayne is assigned to an ambassadorship, then so is Jaramillo. This constraint has the same effect as the original constraint, but in reverse. It still requires that Jaramillo and Kayne be assigned together.
B: If Landon and Ong are both assigned to ambassadorships, then so is Novetzke. This constraint does not have the same effect as the original constraint. It does not require that Jaramillo and Kayne be assigned together.
C: If Ong is not assigned to an ambassadorship, then Kayne is assigned to an ambassadorship. This constraint does not have the same effect as the original constraint. It does not require that Jaramillo and Kayne be assigned together.
D: Jaramillo and Novetzke are not both assigned to ambassadorships. This constraint does not have the same effect as the original constraint. It does not require that Jaramillo and Kayne be assigned together.
E: Novetzke and Ong are not both assigned to ambassadorships. This constraint does not have the same effect as the original constraint. It does not require that Jaramillo and Kayne be assigned together.
