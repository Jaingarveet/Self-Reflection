## Assistant 2:
Thought:

1. Conditions:
	* Kramer and Lopez each review fewer plays than Megregian.
	* Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
	* Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
	* Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
2. Inferences:
	* Since Kramer and Lopez review fewer plays than Megregian, Megregian must review all three plays.
	* Since neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews, Jiang must review only one play, and it cannot be Tamerlane (since Megregian reviews it). Therefore, Jiang reviews only Sunset.
	* Since Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, they cannot review exactly the same plays as each other. Therefore, one of them must review an additional play. Since Kramer reviews fewer plays than Megregian, Kramer must review only Tamerlane and one other play. Since Lopez reviews fewer plays than Megregian, Lopez must review only one or two plays. If Lopez reviews only one play, it must be Undulation (since Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane). If Lopez reviews two plays, they must be Tamerlane and Undulation (since Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane).
	* Since exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other, and Jiang reviews only Sunset, the other student who reviews only Sunset must be Lopez (if Lopez reviews only one play).
3. Elimination:
	* A: Lopez - Lopez could review only Sunset, but only if Lopez reviews only one play.
	* B: O'Neill - O'Neill cannot review only Sunset, since O'Neill reviews Tamerlane.
	* C: Jiang, Lopez - Jiang reviews only Sunset, but Lopez could review only Sunset only if Lopez reviews only one play.
	* D: Kramer, O'Neill - Neither Kramer nor O'Neill can review only Sunset, since they both review Tamerlane.
	* E: Lopez, Megregian - Neither Lopez nor Megregian can review only Sunset, since Megregian reviews all three plays.
4. Inference:
	* The only student who could review only Sunset is Lopez, but only if Lopez reviews only one play.
5. Work:
	* Since Lopez could review only Sunset, but only if Lopez reviews only one play, the answer is A: Lopez.
6. Double-check:
	* If Lopez reviews only Sunset, then all the conditions are satisfied: Kramer and Lopez each review fewer plays than Megregian, neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews, Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, and exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other (Jiang and Lopez both review only Sunset).
