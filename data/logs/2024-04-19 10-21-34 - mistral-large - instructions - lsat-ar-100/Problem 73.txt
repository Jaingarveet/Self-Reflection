4. Eliminate scenarios that violate the conditions.
5. Choose the answer that corresponds to a possible scenario.

## Assistant 2:
Thought:

1. Three students review Undulation.
2. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
3. Megregian reviews more plays than Kramer and Lopez.
4. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
5. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.

Since exactly three students review Undulation, and Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, it means that Jiang, Kramer, and O'Neill review Undulation.

Since Megregian reviews more plays than Kramer and Lopez, and neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews, it means that Megregian must review Tamerlane and Sunset.

Since exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other, and Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, it means that Lopez must review Sunset.

Action: Answer("D")
