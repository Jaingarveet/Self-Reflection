Topic: Law
Context: A shopping center has exactly seven spaces—space 1 through space 7—arranged in a straight row. Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
Question: If the veterinarian is in space 5, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: The optometrist is in space 2.
  B: The pharmacy is in space 7.
  C: A restaurant is in space 4.
  D: The shoe store is in space 6.
  E: The toy store is in space 3.

## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The veterinarian is in space 5. The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. Since the veterinarian is in space 5, the pharmacy cannot be next to it, so it must be at the other end of the row. Therefore, the pharmacy must be in space 1 or space 7.

The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. Since the pharmacy is at one end of the row, the other end must be occupied by a restaurant. If the pharmacy is in space 1, the restaurant must be in space 7. If the pharmacy is in space 7, the restaurant must be in space 1. In either case, the other restaurant cannot be in space 4, because it would be separated by only one business from the restaurant at the end of the row.

The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian. Since the veterinarian is in space 5, the toy store cannot be in space 4 or space 6.

Action: Answer("B")

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly because I did not consider all the constraints given in the problem. I did not realize that the pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, and I did not consider that the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. I also did not eliminate the options that violated the constraints.

To improve my answer, I identified all the constraints given in the problem and considered all the possible options for each business based on the constraints. I eliminated the options that violated the constraints and worked step-by-step through my logical reasoning. I double-checked my reasoning to ensure accuracy and chose the answer that matched my logical conclusion.

In the future, I will make sure to carefully consider all the constraints given in a problem and eliminate the options that violate those constraints. I will also work step-by-step through my logical reasoning and double-check my reasoning to ensure accuracy.
