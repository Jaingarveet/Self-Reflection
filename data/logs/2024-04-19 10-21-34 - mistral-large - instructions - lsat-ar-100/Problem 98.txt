## Assistant 2:
Thought:

1. Constraints: J must be shown in the evening, K cannot be shown in the morning, L must be shown after K and before M.
2. Houses that cannot be shown in the morning: J (must be shown in the evening), K (cannot be shown in the morning).
3. Houses that cannot be shown in the evening: None specified.
4. Houses that must be shown before or after other houses: L must be shown after K and before M.
5. Houses that can be shown in each time slot:
	* Morning: Only one house can be shown in the morning, and it cannot be J or K. So it must be one of L, M, N, O, or P.
	* Afternoon: Three houses must be shown in the afternoon. Since L must be shown after K and before M, and K cannot be shown in the morning, K and L must be shown in the afternoon. The third house shown in the afternoon can be any of the remaining houses except J (which must be shown in the evening).
	* Evening: Two houses must be shown in the evening. Since J must be shown in the evening, it must be one of the two houses shown in the evening. The other house shown in the evening can be any of the remaining houses except K (which cannot be shown in the morning) and L (which must be shown after K and before M).
6. Logical reasoning:
	* Since L must be shown after K and before M, and K cannot be shown in the morning, K and L must be shown in the afternoon.
	* Since J must be shown in the evening, it must be one of the two houses shown in the evening.
	* Since K cannot be shown in the morning, it cannot be shown before J, which is shown in the evening. Therefore, A cannot be true.
	* Since L must be shown after K and before M, and K cannot be shown in the morning, L must be shown in the afternoon. Therefore, B cannot be true.
	* Since J must be shown in the evening, it cannot be shown before P, which is shown in the evening. Therefore, C cannot be true.
	* Since L must be shown after K and before M, and K cannot be shown in the morning, L must be shown in the afternoon. Therefore, D cannot be true.
	* Since K cannot be shown in the morning, it must be shown in the afternoon. Therefore, E could be true.
7. Double-check:
	* Since K cannot be shown in the morning, it must be shown in the afternoon.
	* Since L must be shown after K and before M, and K cannot be shown in the morning, L must be shown in the afternoon.
	* Since J must be shown in the evening, it must be one of the two houses shown in the evening.
	* Therefore, E could be true.
