## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Assistant 2:
I understand. I will try my best to answer this question correctly.
**Error Keywords:**
* **Incorrect answer:** I previously answered this question incorrectly.
* **Reflection:** I reflected on the problem, my solution, and the correct answer.
**Solution:**
1. **Identify the method used to solve the system of equations.**
   - In my previous attempt, I may have used an incorrect method, such as substitution or elimination.
   - The correct method for this system is elimination.
2. **Set up the equations for elimination.**
   - Multiply the second equation by 3 to make the coefficients of x the same:
     ```
     3x + 4y = -23
     -6x + 6y = -57
     ```
3. **Add the equations to eliminate x.**
   ```
     10y = -80
     ```
4. **Solve for y.**
   ```
     y = -8
     ```
5. **Substitute y back into one of the original equations to solve for x.**
   ```
     3x + 4(-8) = -23
     3x - 32 = -23
     3x = 9
     x = 3
     ```
6. **The solution is (x, y) = (3, -8).**
**Instructions:**
* Use the elimination method to solve the system of equations.
* Follow the steps outlined above to find the correct solution.
**Advice:**
* Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
* Review the concepts of elimination and substitution to ensure you understand the methods.
* Practice solving systems of equations with different methods to improve your skills.
**Action:** Answer("B")
