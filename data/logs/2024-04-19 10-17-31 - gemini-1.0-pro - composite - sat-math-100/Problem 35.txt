## Assistant 2:
I understand. I will use my self-reflection to answer this question correctly.
**Self-reflection:**
* **Error:** I previously made a mistake in solving the equation.
* **Solution:** I need to carefully follow the steps of solving equations to avoid making mistakes.
* **Instructions:** I need to pay attention to the instructions and make sure I am answering the question that is being asked.
* **Advice:** I should take my time and double-check my work before submitting my answer.
**Answer:**
**Step 1:** Square both sides of the equation.
$$\begin{align*}
\sqrt{4 x}&=x-3\\
(\sqrt{4 x})^2&=(x-3)^2\\
4x&=x^2-6x+9
\end{align*}$$
**Step 2:** Move all terms to one side of the equation.
$$0=x^2-10x+9$$
**Step 3:** Factor the quadratic equation.
$$0=(x-1)(x-9)$$
**Step 4:** Solve for $x$.
$$x=1 \text{ or } x=9$$
**Therefore, the values of $x$ that satisfy the given equation are 1 and 9.**
**Action: Answer("C")**
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
