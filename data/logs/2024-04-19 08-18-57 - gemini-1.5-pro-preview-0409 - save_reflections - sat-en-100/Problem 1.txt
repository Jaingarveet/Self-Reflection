## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:** I focused on the differing viewpoints on slavery and its impact on the Union, neglecting the more direct conflict regarding Lincoln's stance on the Constitution.
**Error Keywords:**
*   Misinterpretation of central conflict
*   Focus on thematic differences rather than direct argument
*   Overlooking textual evidence regarding the Constitution
## Step-by-Step Solution
1.  **Identify the main argument of Passage 1:** Douglas defends the Constitution and criticizes Lincoln for suggesting it violates God's law.
2.  **Identify the main argument of Passage 2:** Lincoln clarifies his position, stating he doesn't believe the Constitution is flawed but that the Union cannot endure permanently divided over slavery.
3.  **Analyze the relationship between the arguments:** Douglas attacks Lincoln's stance on the Constitution, while Lincoln defends his position and shifts the focus to the issue of slavery.
4.  **Connect the analysis to the answer choices:** Option C accurately reflects this central tension between the passages.
