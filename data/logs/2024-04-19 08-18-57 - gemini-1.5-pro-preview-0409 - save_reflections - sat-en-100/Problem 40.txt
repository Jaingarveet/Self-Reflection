## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:** I focused too much on the narrator's detailed observations and missed the key aspect of her behavior around unfamiliar people. While she is observant, the passage also highlights her shyness and initial hesitation in interacting with her uncles.
**Error Keywords:**
*   Misinterpretation of character traits
*   Overemphasis on observation
*   Neglecting social cues
**Solution:**
1.  **Identify key character interactions:** Analyze how the narrator interacts with others, especially those she is unfamiliar with. 
2.  **Note emotional cues:** Look for descriptions of the narrator's feelings and reactions in social situations.
3.  **Consider the context:** Understand the setting and the narrator's background to interpret her behavior accurately.
**Instructions for Future:**
1.  **Read for character development:** Pay close attention to how characters interact and behave in different situations.
2.  **Identify emotional responses:** Look for clues about characters' feelings and motivations.
3.  **Analyze social cues:** Consider how characters respond to others and interpret social situations.
4.  **Evaluate multiple character traits:** Avoid focusing on just one aspect of a character's personality.
**General Advice:**
*   **Consider the full context:** Analyze the passage as a whole, considering the setting, plot, and character relationships.
*   **Balance observation with interpretation:** While observing details is important, also interpret their meaning and significance for character development.
*   **Think about character motivations:** Understand why characters behave the way they do and what drives their actions.
