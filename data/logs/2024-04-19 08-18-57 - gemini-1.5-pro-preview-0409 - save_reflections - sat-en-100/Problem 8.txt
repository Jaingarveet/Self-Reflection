## Get Reflection:
Explanation: 
I misinterpreted the data in the table. I focused on the individual percentages of each pathogen and failed to consider the combined impact of all four pathogens, which is indicated in the last row of the table.
Error Keywords:
 - Data misinterpretation
 - Table reading error
 - Combining information error
Solution:
1. The question asks for the pathogen that infected the highest percentage of honeybee colonies *without* colony collapse disorder.
2. We need to focus on the third column of the table, which represents colonies without colony collapse disorder.
3. While Nosema apis shows 81%, the last row indicates that "All four pathogens" were present in 100% of the colonies without colony collapse disorder.
4. Therefore, the correct answer is Nosema ceranae, as it is one of the four pathogens that collectively infected 100% of the colonies without colony collapse disorder.
Instructions:
1. Read the question and all answer choices carefully.
2. Identify the specific data required to answer the question (e.g., colonies without colony collapse disorder).
3. Locate the relevant data within the table, paying attention to both rows and columns.
4. Consider all rows and columns, including those that summarize or combine information.
5. Compare the data points and identify the highest percentage or value as needed.
6. Choose the answer choice that corresponds to the correct data point.
Advice:
 - Pay close attention to the details in tables and graphs, including titles, labels, and units.
 - Consider all data points presented, including summaries or combined categories.
 - Don't jump to conclusions based on initial observations; analyze the entire dataset.
 - If a question involves multiple pieces of information, ensure you have considered all of them before selecting an answer. 
 - Be mindful of keywords like "without," "not," or "except" that may change the focus of the question.
