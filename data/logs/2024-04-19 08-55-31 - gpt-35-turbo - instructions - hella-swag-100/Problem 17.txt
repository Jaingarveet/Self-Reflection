Action: Answer("D") 
Choice A is incorrect because it provides irrelevant information about putting your zip code and departure location. 
Choice B is incorrect because it provides irrelevant information about putting the state in which the car is registered and typing the address of the car into line 10-1 and hitting call. 
Choice C is incorrect because it provides irrelevant information about keeping your plate number and leaving the tag blank or printing it out. 
Choice D is the correct answer because it provides relevant information about where the registration renewal forms will get sent and putting the address where the car will be stored or parked on line 14b.
