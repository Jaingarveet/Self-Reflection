[header] How to care for your skin when you travel [title] Gather and pack the basics. [step] Before leaving for a trip, invest in a makeup or toiletry bag.

Self-reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly by selecting choice D, which is not a complete answer to the step provided. After reviewing the text, I realized that the step is about packing the basic skin care products before traveling. Therefore, the completion should provide additional information about what basic products to pack. Choice A talks about bringing usual hygiene products like toothbrush, toothpaste, antiperspirant, sunscreen, moisturizer, and spf, which is not only relevant but also completes the step. Therefore, the correct answer is A.
