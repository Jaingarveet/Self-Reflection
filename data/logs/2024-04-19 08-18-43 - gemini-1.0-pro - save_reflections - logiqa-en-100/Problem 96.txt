## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that the argument was about the advertisers' ethical responsibilities. However, the argument is actually about the advertisers' economic considerations.
Error Keywords:
- Misunderstanding the argument
- Focusing on the wrong aspect of the argument
- Ignoring the economic aspect of the argument
Solution:
The argument is that some advertisers consider economic benefits when making decisions.
Choice D strengthens this argument by showing that the advertisers who switched to "Inferno" magazine were motivated by economic benefits.
Instructions:
1. Carefully read the argument and identify the main point.
2. Identify the aspect of the argument that the question is asking about.
3. Consider each answer choice and evaluate how it affects the main point of the argument.
4. Choose the answer choice that strengthens the argument in the way that the question asks for.
Advice:
- Pay close attention to the wording of the argument and the question.
- Consider all aspects of the argument, not just the ones that are explicitly stated.
- Be aware of your own biases and assumptions, and try to set them aside when evaluating the argument.
- Think critically about the answer choices and choose the one that is most logically sound.
