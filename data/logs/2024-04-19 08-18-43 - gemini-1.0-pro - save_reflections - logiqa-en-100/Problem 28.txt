## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I misinterpreted the condition "Unless F, then not M" as "If F, then M". This led me to incorrectly eliminate option D, which satisfies all other conditions.
Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation
- Conditional logic error
- Negation error
Solution:
1. E or F, but not both: This means either E or F will be selected, but not both.
2. J or K, but not both: This means either J or K will be selected, but not both.
3. If J, then G: This means if J is selected, then G must also be selected.
4. Unless F, then not M: This means if F is not selected, then M cannot be selected. This is equivalent to "If F, then M".
5. Analyze the choices based on the corrected conditions.
A: F and H: This violates condition 1, as both F and E are selected.
B: G and J: This satisfies all conditions. If J is selected, then G is also selected (condition 3). If F is not selected (condition 4), then M cannot be selected.
C: G and M: This violates condition 4, as F is not selected and M is selected.
D: H and M: This satisfies all conditions. If F is selected (condition 4), then M can be selected.
Instructions:
1. Carefully read and understand all conditions, including any negations or implications.
2. Break down complex conditions into simpler components.
3. Analyze each choice systematically against all conditions.
4. Double-check your reasoning and interpretation of the conditions.
5. Choose the answer that satisfies all conditions without violating any.
Advice:
- Pay close attention to the wording of conditions, especially negations and implications.
- Visualize the conditions using diagrams or tables if helpful.
- Test each choice systematically against all conditions to avoid overlooking any violations.
- Be mindful of common logical fallacies and biases.
- Practice similar problems to improve your logical reasoning skills.
