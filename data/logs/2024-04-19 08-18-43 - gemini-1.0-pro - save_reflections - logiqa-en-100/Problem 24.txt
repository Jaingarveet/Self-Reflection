## Get Reflection:
## Explanation:
My initial answer was incorrect because I focused solely on the representativeness of the sample, neglecting the broader context and potential biases. While the sample size and composition are indeed crucial factors, the analogy presented in option C effectively exposes the fundamental flaw in the reasoning.
## Error Keywords:
* **Limited scope:** Focusing solely on sample representativeness without considering broader context and potential biases.
* **Ignoring confounding variables:** Failing to account for factors like occupation, lifestyle, and access to healthcare that could significantly influence life expectancy.
* **Misleading analogy:** Overlooking the flawed logic of comparing the average age of death of in-service staff with the average life expectancy of the general population.
## Solution:
1. **Identify the target population:** Intellectuals in Zhongguancun.
2. **Recognize the limited scope of the sample:** In-service staff from 7 specific research institutes.
3. **Consider potential biases:** Occupation, lifestyle, and access to healthcare could differ significantly between the sample and the target population.
4. **Evaluate the analogy in option C:** It accurately highlights the flawed logic of comparing the average age of death of a specific group with the average life expectancy of a broader population.
5. **Conclude that the reasoning is fallacious due to its limited scope, potential biases, and misleading analogy.**
## Instructions for Future Problems:
1. **Carefully analyze the context and target population.**
2. **Evaluate the representativeness and potential biases of the sample.**
3. **Consider alternative explanations and confounding variables.**
4. **Be cautious of misleading analogies and overgeneralizations.**
5. **Focus on logical reasoning and avoid jumping to conclusions.**
## General Advice:
* **Develop a critical eye for statistical reasoning.**
* **Question assumptions and look for potential biases.**
* **Consider alternative explanations and evidence.**
* **Be mindful of the limitations of data and statistical methods.**
* **Strive for logical consistency and avoid overgeneralizations.**
