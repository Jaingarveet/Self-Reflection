## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I incorrectly focused on the reasons why people might not want to ask college students to be nannies, rather than on the reasons why they might favor them. 
I overlooked the fact that the survey showed that a majority of people favored college students as nannies.
Error Keywords:
 - Misinterpretation of data
