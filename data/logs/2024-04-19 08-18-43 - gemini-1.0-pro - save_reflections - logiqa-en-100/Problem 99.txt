## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I incorrectly focused on the ethical concerns surrounding "customized babies" rather than the specific issue of gene screening.
Error Keywords:
 - Misinterpretation of the question
 - Irrelevant reasoning
 - Ignoring key details
Solution:
The views of ordinary people are that humans may usher in the era of "customized babies".
Option A refutes this by stating that genetic screening does not guarantee perfection and natural selection may be more effective.
Option B refutes this by stating that technology can sometimes deviate from human expectations.
Option C refutes this by stating that gene screening is mainly for avoiding defects and "customized babies" are more related to cloning.
Option D refutes this by stating that "customized babies" are not yet a reality and raise ethical concerns.
The correct answer is C because it directly addresses the issue of gene screening and its limitations in creating "customized babies".
Instructions:
1. Carefully read the question and identify the specific issue being addressed.
2. Analyze each answer choice and determine how it relates to the issue.
3. Choose the answer choice that directly refutes the given view.
