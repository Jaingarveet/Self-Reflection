## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that the condition "There is only one assistant to the general manager in charge of three departments at the same time" meant that only one assistant could be in charge of multiple departments. This led me to eliminate options A, B, and D, which all implied that two assistants were in charge of the same department. However, the condition only states that there is one assistant who is in charge of three departments, not that there cannot be other assistants who are in charge of multiple departments.
Error Keywords:
 - Misinterpretation of condition
 - Overgeneralization
 - Ignoring possibilities
Solution:
F and M are not in charge of the same department.
F and G are not in charge of the same department.
H and I are not in charge of the same department.
There is only one assistant to the general manager in charge of three departments at the same time.
Since F and M are not in charge of the same department, and there is only one assistant in charge of three departments, then either F or M must be the assistant in charge of three departments.
If F is in charge of three departments, then G, H, and I must each be in charge of one department. Since F and G cannot be in charge of the same department, G must be in charge of a different department than F. This leaves H and I to be in charge of the remaining two departments. Since H and I cannot be in charge of the same department, they must be in charge of different departments. Therefore, if F is in charge of three departments, then I and P must be in charge of the same department.
If M is in charge of three departments, then F, G, and H must each be in charge of one department. Since F and M cannot be in charge of the same department, F must be in charge of a different department than M. This leaves G and H to be in charge of the remaining two departments. Since F and G cannot be in charge of the same department, G must be in charge of a different department than F. This leaves H to be in charge of the remaining department. Therefore, if M is in charge of three departments, then I and P must be in charge of the same department.
