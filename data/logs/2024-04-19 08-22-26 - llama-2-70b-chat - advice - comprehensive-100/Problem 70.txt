## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Question: In 2015 the populations of City $\mathrm{X}$ and City $\mathrm{Y}$ were equal. From 2010 to 2015, the population of City X increased by $20 \%$ and the population of City $\mathrm{Y}$ decreased by $10 \%$. If the population of City $\mathrm{X}$ was 120,000 in 2010, what was the population of City Y in 2010 ?
Choices:
  A: 60,000
  B: 90,000
  C: 160,000
  D: 240,000

Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Advice:

* Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
* Always write down the correct equation based on the information given.
* Always solve for the variable (Y) in the equation.
* Always calculate the population of City Y in 2010.
* Always choose the answer that matches the calculated result.
* Be careful when working with percentages and equations.
## Assistant 2:
  Thought: 
The population of City X in 2010 was 120,000.
The population of City X in 2015 was 120,000 + (20% of 120,000) = 120,000 + 24,000 = 144,000.
The population of City Y in 2015 was equal to the population of City X in 2015, so the population of City Y in 2015 was 144,000.
The population of City Y in 2010 was 144,000 - (10% of 144,000) = 144,000 - 14,400 = 130,600.
Action: Answer("B")

Reflection:
In my previous response, I made a mistake by not paying attention to the information given in the question. I incorrectly solved for the population of City X in 2010 instead of City Y. This time, I carefully read the question and wrote down the correct equation based on the information given. I solved for the variable (Y) in the equation and calculated the population of City Y in 2010, which is 130,600. Therefore, the correct answer is B: 90,000. I learned that it is important to always read the question carefully, write down the correct equation, and solve for the variable (Y) in the equation to get the correct answer.
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
