Advice:

* Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
* Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
* Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
* Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
* Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
* Remember that the length of a fence is calculated by multiplying the total width by the number of pickets.
* Remember that there are 12 inches in a foot, so to convert inches to feet, divide by 12.
## Assistant 2:
  My previous answer was incorrect because I made a mistake in my calculation. I misunderstood the problem and didn't read it carefully. I thought the question was asking for the total width of the fence, not the length.

To solve this problem, we need to first find the total width of the fence in inches. We can do this by multiplying the number of pickets by the width of each picket: 13x \* 1/2 = 6.5x.

Next, we need to find the length of the fence in feet. We can do this by dividing the total width by the number of pickets: 6.5x / 13 = 0.5x.

Finally, we need to convert the length from inches to feet by dividing by 12: 0.5x / 12 = 1/24.

Therefore, the correct answer is (13x-12)/24.
