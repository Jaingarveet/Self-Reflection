## Assistant 2:
  My previous answer was incorrect because I made a simple mistake in my calculation. I added $a$ and $b$ instead of multiplying them.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. $(a x+2)(b x+7)=15 x^{2}+c x+14$ for all values of $x$
2. $ab x^{2}+(a+b)x+2b=15 x^{2}+c x+14$
3. $ab x^{2}+(a+b)x+2b-15 x^{2}-c x-14=0$
4. $(ab-15)x^{2}+(a+b-c)x+2b-14=0$
5. Since $x$ can take on any value, we know that $ab-15=0$ and $a+b-c=0$
6. Solving for $a$ and $b$, we get $a=3$ and $b=5$
7. Now, we can find $c$ by substituting $a$ and $b$ into the original equation:
$(3x+2)(5x+7)=15 x^{2}+c x+14$
8. Simplifying and comparing coefficients, we get $c=3$ or $c=5$

Therefore, the two possible values for $c$ are 3 and 5.
