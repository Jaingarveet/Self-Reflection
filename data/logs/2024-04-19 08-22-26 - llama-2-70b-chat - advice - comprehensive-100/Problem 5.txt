## Assistant 2:
  My apologies for my previous mistake. Let's reflect on the problem and the correct answer.
The youngest member is 7 years old, and the sum of the ages of all members is 250.
The ages of the members are in arithmetic progression with a common difference of 3 months.
We can let the age of the youngest member be x, then the age of the oldest member would be x + (n - 1) \* 3, where n is the number of members in the club.
We know that x + (n - 1) \* 3 = 250.

Now, we can solve for n:
n = (250 - x) / 3

Since the youngest member is 7 years old, x = 7 \* 12 = 84.
Substituting this value into the equation above, we get:
n = (250 - 84) / 3
n = 166 / 3
n = 55

Therefore, the number of members in the club is 55.
The correct answer is E: 27.

Action: Answer("E")
