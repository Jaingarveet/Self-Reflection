Choices:
  A: the addition of acids to create a ball of food
  B: the secretion of pepsin to change proteins to peptides
  C: the breakdown of food substances by digestive juices
  D: the squeezing of food through the intestines

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, selecting option A.
However, upon reflection, I realized that option A does not describe a physical change that occurs during digestion.
The addition of acids to create a ball of food is not a physical change, as it does not alter the chemical composition of the food.

The correct answer is option C, the breakdown of food substances by digestive juices.
This option describes a physical change that occurs during digestion, as the food is broken down into smaller molecules by the action of digestive enzymes.

Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
