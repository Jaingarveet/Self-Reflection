* Remember that the formula for finding the new average is New average = Old average + (Change in weight / Number of items).
## Assistant 2:
  My previous answer was incorrect because I made a mistake in my calculation. I added 2.6 tons to the old average instead of using the formula New average = Old average + (Change in weight / Number of items).

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The average weight of the 10 vehicles before adding the new truck is 12.2 tons.
2. The weight of the new heavy-duty truck is x tons.
3. The total weight of the 11 vehicles (10 old + 1 new) is 12.2 + x tons.
4. The average weight of the 11 vehicles is (12.2 + x) / 11.
5. We want to find the weight of the new truck, x.

Now, let's substitute the given information:

1. The average weight of the 10 vehicles before adding the new truck is 12.2 tons.
2. The weight of the new heavy-duty truck is x tons.
3. The total weight of the 11 vehicles (10 old + 1 new) is 12.2 + x tons.
4. The average weight of the 11 vehicles is (12.2 + x) / 11.
5. We want to find the weight of the new truck, x.

We can set up an equation using the formula for finding the new average:
New average = Old average + (Change in weight / Number of items)

(12.2 + x) / 11 = 12.2 + 2.6

Now, we can solve for x:

x = 12.2 + 2.6 - 12.2

x = 2.6

So, the weight of the new heavy-duty truck is 2.6 tons.
