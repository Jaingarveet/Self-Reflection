Advice:
- Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
- Always use the correct conversion factors when converting units.
- Always double-check your calculations, especially when working with different units.
- Remember that multiplication is commutative, meaning the order of the factors does not change the result.
- Practice converting between different units to become more comfortable with the process.
## Assistant 2:
  My previous answer was incorrect because I made a mistake in my calculations. I misunderstood the question and used the wrong conversion factor.

To solve this problem, we need to convert 20 inches to miles. We know that 1/4 inch represents 10 miles, so we can set up a proportion to find the conversion factor:
1/4 inch = 10 miles
20 inches = x miles

We can cross-multiply and simplify:
20 inches \* 10 miles/1/4 inch = x miles
200 miles = x miles

Now, we can divide both sides by 200 to find the conversion factor:
x miles / 200 miles = 1/4 inch / 10 miles
1/5 miles = 1/4 inch

Now, we can convert 20 inches to miles:
20 inches \* 1/5 miles/inch = 20/5 miles
4 miles = x miles

Therefore, the actual distance from Town F to Town G along this road is 4 miles.

Action: Answer("B")
