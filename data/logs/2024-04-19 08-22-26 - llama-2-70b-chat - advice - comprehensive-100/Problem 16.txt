## Assistant 2:
  My apologize for my previous response, where I incorrectly answered the question.
Here's my revised answer:

Let's analyze the given information systematically:

1. Three men are tall: Liu Dawei, Li Qiang, and Wang Wei (from statement 1).
2. Two men are doctors: Wang Wei and Wu Gang (from statement 2).
3. Li Qiang and Liu Dawei are the same height (from statement 3).
4. Li Qiang is not tall (from statement 4).

Now, let's consider the characteristics of each person:

* Liu Dawei: Tall, doctor (from statement 1 and 2).
* Li Qiang: Not tall, same height as Liu Dawei (from statement 3 and 4).
* Wang Wei: Tall, doctor (from statement 1 and 2).
* Wu Gang: Doctor (from statement 2).

Based on the above analysis, we can see that only Wang Wei meets all of Li Na's requirements: tall, handsome, and doctor.
