## Assistant 2:
  Thought: 
Previously, I chose answer A, Levodopa, which is incorrect.
Levodopa is converted into dopamine in the brain, which increases dopaminergic activity.
It does not decrease brain cholinergic activity.
The correct answer is C, Selegiline.
Selegiline is a selective monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) inhibitor that increases dopamine levels by preventing its breakdown.
It also has some evidence of decreasing acetylcholine levels, thus decreasing brain cholinergic activity.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
