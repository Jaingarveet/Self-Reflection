## Assistant 2:
  My previous answer was incorrect because I made a mistake in my calculation. I misunderstood the question and calculated 5% of $1500 instead of $500.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The monthly salary, S, of a shop assistant is the sum of a fixed salary of $500 plus 5% of all monthly sales.
2. We want to find the monthly sales that will result in a monthly salary of $1500.
3. We can start by writing an equation:
S = 500 + (0.05) x sales
4. Now, we can substitute the values:
S = 500 + (0.05) x sales
5. To isolate sales, we can subtract $500 from both sides:
S - 500 = (0.05) x sales
6. Now, we can divide both sides by 0.05:
(S - 500)/0.05 = sales
7. Now, we can substitute the values:
(1500 - 500)/0.05 = sales
8. Now, we can simplify:
1000/0.05 = sales
9. Now, we can multiply both sides by 0.05:
10000 = sales

Therefore, the monthly sales should be $10,000 so that the shop assistant's monthly salary reaches $1500.

Action: Answer("B")
