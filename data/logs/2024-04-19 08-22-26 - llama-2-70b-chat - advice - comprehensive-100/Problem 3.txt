## Assistant 2:
  My previous answer was incorrect because I made a mistake in my calculation. I misunderstood the problem and calculated the number of sales needed to reach a salary of $1000 without considering the commission percentage.

To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the commission earned from each sale:
Commission = Sale price x Commission percentage
Commission = $250 x 10%
Commission = $25

Now, we need to calculate the number of sales needed to reach a salary of $1000:
Number of sales = Total salary / Commission per sale
Number of sales = $1000 / $25
Number of sales = 40

Therefore, the salesperson must make 40 sales of $250 each to reach a salary of at least $1000.
