## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Ovarian tumors that are most prone to undergo torsion during pregnancy are typically those that are large, cystic, and have a pedicle.
Dermoid cysts are often large and cystic, but they are not typically pedunculated.
Serous and mucinous cystadenomas are also cystic, but they are not as likely to be pedunculated as theca lutein cysts.
Theca lutein cysts are more common in pregnancy due to the high levels of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and are often pedunculated, making them more prone to torsion.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
