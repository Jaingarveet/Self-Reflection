Topic: Law
Context: The chairperson of Acme Corporation has decided to move the company from its current location in Milltown to Ocean View. Most Acme employees cannot afford housing within a 30-minute commute of Ocean View. So once the company has moved, most Acme employees will have a commute of more than 30 minutes.
Question: The argument requires assuming which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: All Acme employees can afford housing within a 30-minute commute of Milltown.
  B: The chairperson of Acme has good financial reasons for wanting to move the company to Ocean View.
  C: None of Acme's employees except the chairperson are in favor of moving the company to Ocean View.
  D: Currently, most Acme employees have a commute of less than 30 minutes.

Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I focused too narrowly on the commute times mentioned in the argument and failed to consider the underlying reason why the commute times would increase for most employees after the move. The argument implicitly assumes that there will not be a significant pay raise to offset the increased housing costs near Ocean View.
