Topic: Logic
Context: A rare and endangered animal of the northern salamander in Xinjiang.It was first discovered by a Russian explorer in 1840, but disappeared for more than 100 years.It was rediscovered in Hot Spring County, Xinjiang in 1898.But the data shows that in the 15 years since 1898, the number of northern salamanders in Xinjiang has been reduced by half.Some experts believe that the habitat of the northern salamander in Xinjiang was originally a local pasture, and the cattle and sheep walking around on the grassland in summer will trample them to death, resulting in a sharp decline in their numbers.
Question: Which of the following is true will raise the most doubts about the opinions of the above experts?
Choices:
  A: In 1997, the "Hot Spring Xinjiang Northern Salamander Nature Reserve" was established, and local herders' awareness of protecting Xinjiang Northern Salamander is increasing.
  B: In recent years, the rainfall has decreased and the groundwater level has fallen, which has affected the water source environment in which the northern salamander in Xinjiang lives.
  C: Xinjiang salamander is a kind of animal that is afraid of light.Most of them hide under the rocks of the creek during the day, and avoid the trampling of cattle and sheep.
  D: Xinjiang's northern salamanders are located in the mountains, and most tourists cannot enter at all.
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I focused too narrowly on finding a choice that directly contradicted the expert opinion about cattle and sheep trampling. While choice [REDACTED] does suggest the salamanders avoid trampling, it doesn't provide a compelling alternative explanation for the population decline. I overlooked the significance of choice [REDACTED], which points to decreased rainfall and lower groundwater levels affecting the salamanders' habitat. This offers a plausible contributing factor separate from the trampling issue.
