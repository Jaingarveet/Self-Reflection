Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
Let's assume the number of friends who attended the picnic is x.
The total amount spent on eatables was Rs. 96.
Since four friends did not turn up, the amount spent by the remaining friends is Rs. 96 / x.
Since each of the remaining friends had to contribute Rs. 4 extra, the total amount spent by them is Rs. 96 / x + 4x.
We want to find the value of x for which the above expression is equal to Rs. 96.

Rs. 96 / x + 4x = Rs. 96

Simplifying, we get:

x = [REDACTED]

Therefore, the number of friends who attended the picnic is [REDACTED].

Choices:

  B: 12
  C: 16
  D: 24
  E: 25
Reflection:
Previously, I answered this question incorrectly.
I realized that I made a mistake in my calculation.
I had divided the total amount spent on eatables by the number of friends who attended the picnic, instead of dividing it by the number of friends who did not attend the picnic.
I also realized that I didn't take into account the fact that four friends did not turn up, and therefore, the number of friends who attended the picnic was not the total number of friends.
Solution:
Let's assume the number of friends who attended the picnic is x.
The total amount spent on eatables was Rs. 96.
The number of friends who did not turn up is 4.
The amount spent by the remaining friends is Rs. 96 / (x - 4).
Since each of the remaining friends had to contribute Rs. 4 extra, the total amount spent by them is Rs. 96 / (x - 4) + 4(x - 4).
We want to find the value of x for which the above expression is equal to Rs. 96.

Rs. 96 / (x - 4) + 4(x - 4) = Rs. 96

Simplifying, we get:

x = 12

Therefore, the number of friends who attended the picnic is 12.
