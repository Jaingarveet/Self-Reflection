Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
Let's break this down step by step:

1. Initially, the tea is 50% strong, meaning it has a concentration of 50%.
2. John replaces 15% of the tea with milk twice, which means he replaces 15% of the tea with milk once.

The concentration of the tea after the first time replacing 15% of it with milk is:

50% - (15% of 50%) = 50% - 7.5% = 42.5%

3. Now, John replaces 10% of the resultant solution with more milk.

The concentration of the tea after the second time replacing 10% of it with milk is:

42.5% - (10% of 42.5%) = 42.5% - 4.25% = 38.25%

Therefore, the final concentration of tea John drinks is 38.25%.
