Solution:
Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. 24% of all students are members of both the chess club and the swim team.
2. [REDACTED] of members of the swim team are not members of the chess club.

We can start by finding the number of students who are members of both the chess club and the swim team:

24% of all students = 0.24 x 100 = 24 students

Now, let's find the number of students who are members of the swim team but not the chess club:

[REDACTED] of members of the swim team = 0.20 x 24 = 4.8

Since 4.8 is not a whole number, we'll round up to 5 students.

Now, let's find the total number of students who are members of the swim team:

Total number of students who are members of the swim team = Number of students who are members of both the chess club and the swim team + Number of students who are members of the swim team but not the chess club
= 24 + 5 = 29

Finally, we can find the percentage of all Daifu students who are members of the swim team:

Percentage of all Daifu students who are members of the swim team = (Number of students who are members of the swim team / Total number of students) x 100
= (29 / 100) x 100 = 29%

Therefore, the correct answer is:

Action: Answer("[REDACTED]")
