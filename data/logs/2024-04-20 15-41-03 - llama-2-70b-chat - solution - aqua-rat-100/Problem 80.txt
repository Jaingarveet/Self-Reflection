Solution:
Let W be the number of white sharpeners and [REDACTED] be the number of brown sharpeners.
Since Jack pays 1 rupee more for each white sharpeners than brown sharpeners, the cost of each white sharpeners is 1 rupee more than the cost of each brown sharpeners.
The total cost of all sharpeners is 100 rupees.
The cost of W white sharpeners is W rupees, and the cost of [REDACTED] brown sharpeners is [REDACTED] rupees.
Since the total cost is 100 rupees, we can set up the equation:
W + [REDACTED] = 100

We know that W + [REDACTED] = 18 (total number of sharpeners)

Substituting W + [REDACTED] = 18 into the first equation, we get:
W + [REDACTED] = 100
W = 100 - B

Now, we can substitute this expression for W into the first equation:
100 - [REDACTED] + [REDACTED] = 100

Combine like terms:
2[REDACTED] = 100 - 100
2[REDACTED] = 0

Since [REDACTED] is a whole number, [REDACTED] = 0.

Now, we can find W:
W = 100 - B
W = 100 - 0
W = 100

Therefore, the answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED].
