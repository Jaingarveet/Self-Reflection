## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Question: A straight picket fence is composed of x pickets each of which is 1/2 inch wide. If there are 6 inches of space between each pair of pickets, which of the following represents the length of fence in feet?
Choices:
  A: 13x/2
  B: 13x/2 - 6
  C: 13x/24
  D: (13x+1)/24
  E: (13x-12)/24
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:

1. Calculate the total width of all the pickets: x/2.
2. Calculate the total width with spaces: x/2 + 6.
3. Calculate the length of the fence: x/2 + 6 \* 13 = [REDACTED] + 78.
4. Convert the result from inches to feet: [REDACTED].
## Assistant 2:
  Action: Answer("D")

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly by selecting choice A.
Upon reflection, I realized that I needed to account for the spaces between the pickets, which adds 6 inches to the total width.
The correct calculation for the length of the fence is (13x+1)/24, which gives us the length in feet.
Therefore, the correct answer is choice D.
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: E
Score: 0
