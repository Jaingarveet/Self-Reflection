Solution:
[REDACTED] grocer makes a 25% profit on the selling price for each bag of flour it sells. If he sells each bag for $100 and makes $3,000 in profit, how many bags did he sell?
Let's break this down step by step:
1. The grocer makes a 25% profit on the selling price for each bag of flour. This means that the profit per bag is 25% of $100, or $25.
2. The total profit is $3,000.
3. To find the number of bags sold, we can divide the total profit by the profit per bag: $3,000 รท $25 = [REDACTED]0 bags (rounded up to [REDACTED]1 bags).
So, the grocer sold [REDACTED]1 bags of flour.
