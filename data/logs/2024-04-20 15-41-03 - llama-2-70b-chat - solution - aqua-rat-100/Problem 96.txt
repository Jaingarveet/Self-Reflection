Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
Let's break this down step by step:

1. [REDACTED] starts a business with Rs.40,000.
2. After [REDACTED], [REDACTED] joins with Rs.60,000.
3. [REDACTED] joins after some more time with Rs.120,000.
4. The total investment now is Rs.40,000 + Rs.60,000 + Rs.120,000 = Rs.220,000.
5. The total profit at the end of the year is Rs.375,000.
6. [REDACTED] gets Rs.150,000 as his share.

Now, let's find the time at which [REDACTED] joined the business.

Profit share of [REDACTED] = Total profit x (C's investment / Total investment)

Profit share of [REDACTED] = Rs.375,000 x (Rs.120,000 / Rs.220,000)

Profit share of [REDACTED] = Rs.375,000 x 0.545

Profit share of [REDACTED] = Rs.199,750

Since [REDACTED] gets Rs.150,000 as his share, the difference between the profit share of [REDACTED] and the actual amount he gets is:

Rs.199,750 - Rs.150,000 = Rs.49,750

Now, we need to find the time at which [REDACTED] joined the business.

Let X be the number of months after [REDACTED] joined that [REDACTED] joined.

The investment of [REDACTED] = Rs.120,000

The profit share of [REDACTED] = Rs.199,750

The difference between the profit share of [REDACTED] and the actual amount he gets = Rs.49,750

We can set up the following equation:

Rs.120,000 x (1 + (X/12))^X = Rs.199,750

Simplifying the equation:

1 + (X/12)^X = 1.66125

(X/12)^X = 1.66125 - 1

(X/12)^X = 0.66125

X = 4

Therefore, [REDACTED] joined the business [REDACTED] after [REDACTED] joined.
