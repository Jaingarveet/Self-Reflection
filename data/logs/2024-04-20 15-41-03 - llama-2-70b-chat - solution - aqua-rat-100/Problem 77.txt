Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
[REDACTED] consecutive sequence of 5 odd numbers: [REDACTED], [REDACTED], 89, 111, 133
When divided by 10: 4.7, 6.7, 8.9, 11.1, 13.3
Square root of 4.7= 2.1, 6.7= 2.6, 8.9= 3.1, 11.1= 3.3, 13.3= 3.6
Only one of the given numbers is a perfect square, which is [REDACTED].
## Assistant 2:
  Action: Answer("C")

Explanation:
The sum of 5 consecutive two-digit odd numbers when divided by 10 becomes a perfect square. The sequence of 5 odd numbers is [REDACTED], [REDACTED], 89, 111, 133. When divided by 10, the numbers become 4.7, 6.7, 8.9, 11.1, and 13.3. The square root of each number is 2.1, 2.6, 3.1, 3.3, and 3.6, respectively. Among the given choices, the only perfect square is 8.9, which corresponds to choice C, 41. Therefore, the answer is C.
