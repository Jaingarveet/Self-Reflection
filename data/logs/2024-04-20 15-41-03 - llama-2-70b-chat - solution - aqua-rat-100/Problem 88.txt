Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
Let's break this down step by step:

1. The train's original speed is [REDACTED]0 miles/hour, and it takes [REDACTED] hours to reach its destination.
2. This means the train travels a total distance of [REDACTED]00 miles ([REDACTED] x [REDACTED]0).
3. The train slows down to 75 miles/hour after covering a quarter of the distance, which is 250 miles (1/4 x [REDACTED]00).
4. The time taken to cover the remaining distance of 750 miles ([REDACTED]00 - 250) at a speed of 75 miles/hour is:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 750 / 75
Time = [REDACTED]

5. The total journey duration is the sum of the time taken to cover the first quarter of the distance and the time taken to cover the remaining distance:

Total Time = [REDACTED] + [REDACTED]
Total Time = 20

6. Therefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED] hours.
