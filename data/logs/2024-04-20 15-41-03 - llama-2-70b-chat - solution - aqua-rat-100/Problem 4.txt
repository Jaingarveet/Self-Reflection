## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
Train [REDACTED] leaves every 16 minutes, so it will leave at 16, 32, 48, 64, ... minutes past the hour.
Train [REDACTED] leaves every 17 minutes, so it will leave at 17, 34, 51, 68, ... minutes past the hour.
The least common multiple (LCM) of 16 and 17 is 272.
Therefore, both trains will leave simultaneously again in [REDACTED].
## Assistant 2:
  Sure, I'll be happy to help! Here's my answer:

Action: Answer("A")

My reasoning is as follows:

Train A leaves every 16 minutes, so it will leave at 16, 32, 48, 64, ... minutes past the hour.
Train B leaves every 17 minutes, so it will leave at 17, 34, 51, 68, ... minutes past the hour.
The least common multiple (LCM) of 16 and 17 is 272.
Therefore, both trains will leave simultaneously again in 272 minutes.

I hope that's correct! Let me know if you have any further questions.
