Solution:
Let's re-read the question carefully. The question asks for the total distance traveled by the jeep, not the distance traveled in the return journey.

We know that the jeep travels at a constant speed during the forward journey, so we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

6 hours = Distance / Speed

Speed = Distance / 6 hours

Now, we know that the jeep increases its speed by 12 km/hr during the return journey. So, the average speed during the return journey would be:

Average Speed during return journey = Speed + 12 km/hr

We can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

4 hours = Distance / (Speed + 12 km/hr)

We can simplify this equation by substituting the value of Speed:

4 hours = Distance / (Distance / 6 hours + 12 km/hr)

Simplifying further:

4 hours = Distance / (1/6 + 12 km/hr)

Distance = 4 hours \* (1/6 + 12 km/hr)

Distance = 4 hours \* (1/6) + 4 hours \* (12 km/hr)

Distance = 4/6 + 48 km

Distance = 1/1.5 + 48 km

Distance = 1.5/1.5 + 48 km

Distance = 1 + 48 km

Distance = 49 km

Therefore, the total distance traveled by the jeep is 49 km.

The correct answer is [REDACTED]: 144 km.
