Topic: Law
Context: Counselor: Many people assume that personal conflicts are inevitable, but that assumption is just not so. Personal conflicts arise primarily because people are being irrational. For instance, people often find it easier to ascribe bad qualities to a person than good ones-even when there is more evidence of the latter. If someone suspects that a friend is unreliable, for example, a single instance may turn this suspicion into a feeling of certainty, whereas a belief that someone is reliable is normally built up only after many years of personal interaction.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main conclusion drawn in the argument?
Choices:
  A: Many people assume that personal conflicts are inevitable.
  B: Even when there is more evidence of good qualities than of bad ones, people find it easier to ascribe bad qualities than good ones.
  C: It is irrational to allow a single instance to turn one's suspicion that a friend is unreliable into a feeling of certainty.
  D: Personal conflicts are not inevitable.
  E: Unlike a suspicion that a friend is unreliable, a belief that someone is reliable is normally built up only after many years of personal interaction.

  D: Personal conflicts are not inevitable.
  E: Unlike a suspicion that a friend is unreliable, a belief that someone is reliable is normally built up only after many years of personal interaction.

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly as option A: Many people assume that personal conflicts are inevitable. However, upon further reflection, I realize that the main conclusion drawn in the argument is actually option B: Even when there is more evidence of good qualities than of bad ones, people find it easier to ascribe bad qualities than good ones.

Explanation:
The argument states that personal conflicts arise primarily because people are being irrational. It provides an example of how a single instance can turn a suspicion into a feeling of certainty, while a belief in someone's reliability is built up only after many years of personal interaction. This suggests that people tend to jump to conclusions about others' reliability based on limited information, rather than giving them the benefit of the doubt. Therefore, option B is the best answer.
