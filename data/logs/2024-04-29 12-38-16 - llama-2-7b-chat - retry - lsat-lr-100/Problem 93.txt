  Topic: Law
Question: The conclusion drawn above follows logically if which one of the following is assumed?
Choices:
  A: Everyone suspects self-righteous people of being, in actuality, unethical.
  B: Ellsworth has been accused of unethical business practices before.
  C: Hypocrites often hide behind righteous indignation.
  D: Ellsworth is in fact innocent of all wrongdoing.
  E: Everyone expects self-righteous people to be easily offended.

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I have reflected on my solution and the correct answer.

The correct answer is (A): Everyone suspects self-righteous people of being, in actuality, unethical.

My reasoning is as follows:

The passage states that Ellsworth is "bursting with self-righteousness" and that he is offended by suggestions of unethical business practices. This suggests that Ellsworth is projecting his own perceived moral superiority onto others, which is a common trait of self-righteous individuals. Therefore, it is likely that Ellsworth is hiding behind his righteous indignation to conceal any actual unethical behavior.

[REDACTED]
