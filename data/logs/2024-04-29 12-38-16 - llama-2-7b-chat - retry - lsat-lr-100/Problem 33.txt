Context: Physician: In an experiment, 50 patients with chronic back pain were divided into two groups. Small magnets were applied to the backs of one group; the other group received no treatment. Most of the patients in the first group, but very few in the second group, reported a significant reduction in pain. This shows that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, constitutes the logically strongest counter to the physician's argument?
Choices:
  A: A patient's merely knowing that a treatment has been applied can lead to improvement in his or her condition.
  B: Most physicians believe that medication relieves chronic back pain more effectively than magnets do.
  C: No other experiments have been done showing that magnetic fields reduce pain in any area other than the back.
  D: Some of the scientists who helped design the experiment believed even before the experiment that magnetic fields relieve back pain, but they were not directly involved in conducting the experiment.
  E: There was wide variation in the specific causes of the chronic back pain suffered by the patients in the experiment.

  Topic: Law
Question: Which one of the following, if true, constitutes the logically strongest counter to the physician's argument?

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and then I reflected on the problem, my solution, and the correct answer.

The logically strongest counter to the physician's argument is:

C: No other experiments have been done showing that magnetic fields reduce pain in any area other than the back.

Explanation:
The physician's argument relies on the assumption that the reduction in pain experienced by the patients in the first group is due to the magnetic fields. However, if no other experiments have been done showing that magnetic fields reduce pain in any area other than the back, then it is possible that the reduction in pain in the first group is due to other factors, such as the placebo effect or the natural course of the patients' condition. Therefore, the lack of evidence for the effectiveness of magnetic fields in other areas undermines the physician's argument.
