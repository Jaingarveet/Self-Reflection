## User 2:
Topic: Law
Context: To accommodate the personal automobile, houses are built on widely scattered lots far from places of work and shopping malls are equipped with immense parking lots that leave little room for wooded areas. Hence, had people generally not used personal automobiles, the result would have to have been a geography of modern cities quite different from the one we have now.
Question: The argument's reasoning is questionable because the argument
Choices:
  A: infers from the idea that the current geography of modern cities resulted from a particular cause that it could only have resulted from that cause
  B: infers from the idea that the current geography of modern cities resulted from a particular cause that other facets of modern life resulted from that cause
  C: overlooks the fact that many technological innovations other than the personal automobile have had some effect on the way people live
  D: takes for granted that shopping malls do not need large parking lots even given the use of the personal automobile
  E: takes for granted that people ultimately want to live without personal automobiles

## Assistant 2:
  Topic: Law
Question: The argument's reasoning is questionable because the argument

Action: Answer("B")

Explanation:
The argument infers from the idea that the current geography of modern cities resulted from a particular cause (the use of personal automobiles) that other facets of modern life resulted from that cause (the construction of houses on widely scattered lots and the provision of immense parking lots in shopping malls). This line of reasoning is questionable because it assumes a causal relationship between the use of personal automobiles and the geography of modern cities that may not be accurate. Other technological innovations, such as public transportation or telecommuting, could also have played a role in shaping the geography of modern cities. Therefore, the argument's reasoning is not sound.
