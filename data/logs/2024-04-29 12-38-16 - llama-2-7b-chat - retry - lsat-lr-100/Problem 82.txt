Topic: Law
Context: Patricia: During Japan's Tokugawa period, martial arts experts known as ninjas were trained for the purposes of espionage and assassination. Yet at that time there was actually very little ninja activity in Japan, and most Japanese did not fear ninjas. Tamara: That is not true. Many wealthy Japanese during the Tokugawa period had their houses constructed with intentionally squeaky floors so that they would receive warning if a ninja were in the house.
Question: Of the following, which one, if true, is the strongest counter Patricia can make to Tamara's objection?
Choices:
  A: Many poor Japanese during the Tokugawa period also had houses constructed with intentionally squeaky floors.
  B: As part of their secret training, ninjas learned to walk on squeaky floors without making a sound.
  C: The wealthy made up a small portion of Japan's population during the Tokugawa period.
  D: The fighting prowess of ninjas was exaggerated to mythic proportions in the years following the Tokngawa period.
  E: There were very few ninjas at any time other than during the Tokugawa period.

Question: Of the following, which one, if true, is the strongest counter Patricia can make to Tamara's objection?

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I will use my self-reflection to help me answer it correctly this time.

The strongest counter Patricia can make to Tamara's objection is:

B: As part of their secret training, ninjas learned to walk on squeaky floors without making a sound.

Explanation:
Tamara's objection is that many wealthy Japanese during the Tokugawa period had their houses constructed with intentionally squeaky floors so that they would receive warning if a ninja were in the house. Patricia can counter this by pointing out that ninjas were trained to walk silently, even on squeaky floors, as part of their secret training. This suggests that the wealthy Japanese were unlikely to receive any warning of a ninja's presence, as the ninjas would be able to move stealthily and silently.

Therefore, option B is the strongest counter to Tamara's objection, as it directly addresses the issue at hand and provides a logical explanation for why the wealthy Japanese would not have received any warning of a ninja's presence.
