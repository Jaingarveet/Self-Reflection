## User 2:
Topic: Law
Context: When a group is unable to reach a consensus, group members are often accused of being stubborn, bullheaded, or unyielding. Such epithets often seem abusive, are difficult to prove, and rarely help the group reach a resolution. Those who wish to make such an accusation stick, however, should choose "unyielding," because one can always appeal to the fact that the accused has not yielded; obviously if one acknowledges that a person has not yielded, then one cannot deny that the person is unyielding, at least on this issue.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately descrthes the argumentative technique employed above?
Choices:
  A: rejecting a factic on the grounds that it constitutes an attack on the character of a person and has no substance in :fact
  B: rejecting a factic on the grounds that the factic makes it virtually imposSlble for the group to reach a consensus on the issue in question
  C: conditionally advocating a factic on the grounds that it results in an accusation that is less offensive than the alternatives
  D: conditionally advocating a factic on the grounds that it results in an argument that would help the group to reach a consensus on the issue in question
  E: conditionally advocating a factic on the grounds that it results in an argument for which one could not consistently accept the premise but deny the conclusion

## Assistant 2:
  Topic: Law
Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes the argumentative technique employed above?

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly. Upon reflection, I realized that the correct answer is (B) rejecting a factic on the grounds that the factic makes it virtually impossible for the group to reach a consensus on the issue in question.

The argument employed in the passage is an example of rejecting a factic on the grounds that it makes it difficult to reach a consensus. The author argues that accusing someone of being unyielding is a more effective way to make progress in a group than accusing them of being stubborn or bullheaded. The author acknowledges that the accusation of unyielding is less offensive than the alternatives, but argues that it is more effective in achieving the group's goal of reaching a consensus. Therefore, option (B) best describes the argumentative technique employed in the passage.
