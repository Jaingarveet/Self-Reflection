## Assistant 2:
  Topic: Law
Question: Which one of the following principles, if valid, would most help to justify Mike's reasoning?

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand that my reasoning was flawed. I will use my self-reflection to help me answer this question correctly.

After reflecting on the problem, I realize that Mike's reasoning is based on the principle of "lex non scripta," or unwritten law. This principle holds that customs and practices that are not explicitly stated in written laws can still be used to guide decision-making.

In this case, Mike is arguing that since Tom used Mary's bicycle without her permission, it is permissible for Mike to use Tom's computer without his permission. However, this argument is flawed because it ignores the fact that Tom's use of Mary's bicycle without her permission was not justified by any unwritten law or custom.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) Using the possessions of others without their permission is not always theft. This principle recognizes that there are situations in which it is not illegal to use someone else's property without their permission, but it does not justify Mike's actions in this case.

Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
