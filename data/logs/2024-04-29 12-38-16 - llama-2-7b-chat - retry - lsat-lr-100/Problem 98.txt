## Assistant 2:
  Topic: Law
Question: The argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it
Action: Answer("B")
Explanation:
The argument states that technological innovation rarely serves the interests of society as a whole, as those responsible for technological advances are motivated by personal gain rather than societal benefit. However, this argument takes for granted that technology beneficial to society as a whole cannot be commercially viable. This is a flawed assumption, as there are many examples of commercially viable technologies that have had a positive impact on society. Therefore, the argument is most vulnerable to criticism on this grounds.
