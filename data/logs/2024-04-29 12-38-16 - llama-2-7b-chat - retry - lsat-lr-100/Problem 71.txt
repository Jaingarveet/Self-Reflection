Question: If the curator's statements are true, which one of the following must be true?

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I will use my self-reflection to help me answer it correctly this time.

The correct answer is (C): There are prints in the museum store of every work that is displayed in the museum and not on loan from a private collector.

Explanation:
The curator's statements indicate that the museum displays only twentieth-century works, either on loan from private collectors or in the museum's permanent collection. This means that every work displayed in the museum is either on loan or part of the permanent collection. Therefore, every print in the museum store must be of a work that is either on loan or part of the permanent collection.

Option (A) is incorrect because it implies that every print in the museum store is of a work that is either on loan or part of the permanent collection, which is already true by virtue of the curator's statements.

Option (B) is incorrect because it implies that every print sold in the museum store is a copy of a twentieth-century work, which may not be the case. The curator's statements do not provide any information about the age of the prints sold in the museum store.

Option (D) is incorrect because Hopper's Nighthawks is not a twentieth-century work, as it was painted in 1942.

Option (E) is irrelevant, as the curator's statements do not provide any information about whether Hopper's Nighthawks is displayed in the museum or not.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C): There are prints in the museum store of every work that is displayed in the museum and not on loan from a private collector.
