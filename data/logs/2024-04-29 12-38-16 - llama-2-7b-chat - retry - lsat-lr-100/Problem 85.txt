## Assistant 2:
  Topic: Law
Question: Which one of the following, if true, provides the most support for the president's prediction?

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand the mistake. The correct answer is (A): Ditalgame has spent millions of dollars developing the new copy protection feature, and the company can recoup these costs only if its sales increase substantially.

Explanation:
The passage states that Ditalgame's president predicts a substantial increase in sales of the company's games once the new copy protection feature is implemented. This suggests that the success of the new feature depends on its ability to increase sales. If Ditalgame has spent millions of dollars developing the feature, it will only be worth it if the company can recoup those costs through increased sales. Therefore, option (A) provides the most support for the president's prediction.
