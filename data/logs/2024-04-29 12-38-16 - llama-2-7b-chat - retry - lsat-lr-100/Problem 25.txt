Context: When presented with the evidence against him, Ellison freely admitted to engaging in illegal transactions using company facilities. However, the company obtained the evidence by illegally recording Ellison's conversations. Therefore, although the company may demand that he immediately cease, it cannot justifiably take any punitive measures against him.
Question: Which one of the following judgments best illustrates the principle illustrated by the argument above?
Choices:
  A: After Price confessed to having stolen money from Long over a period of several years, Long began stealing from Price. Despite Price's guilt, Long was not justified in taking illegal action against him.
  B: Shakila's secretary has admitted that he is illegally receiving cable television without paying for it. Shakila would not be justified in reporting him, though, since she once did the same thing.
  C: After Takashi told Sarah's parents that he had seen her at the movies on Tuesday, Sarah confessed to sneaking out that day. On Monday, however, Takashi had violated the local curfew for minors. Hence Sarah's parents cannot justifiably punish her in this case.
  D: After a conservation officer discovered them, Kuttner admitted that he had set the illegal animal traps on his land. But, because she was trespassing at the time, the conservation officer cannot justifiably punish Kuttner in this case.
  E: Ramirez was forced by the discovery of new evidence to admit that she lied about her role in managing the chief of staff's financial affairs. Nevertheless, the board of directors cannot justifiably take action against Ramirez, because in past instances it has pardoned others guilty of similar improprieties.

## Assistant 2:
  Topic: Law
Question: Which one of the following judgments best illustrates the principle illustrated by the argument above?

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly. Upon reflection, I realized that the correct answer is (E) Ramirez was forced by the discovery of new evidence to admit that she lied about her role in managing the chief of staff's financial affairs. Nevertheless, the board of directors cannot justifiably take action against Ramirez, because in past instances it has pardoned others guilty of similar improprieties.

Explanation:
The argument above highlights the principle that justifiable punitive measures can only be taken against someone who has engaged in illegal activities. In the scenario provided, the company obtained evidence of Ellison's illegal transactions by illegally recording his conversations. Therefore, even though Ellison admitted to the illegal activities, the company cannot take punitive measures against him.

The judgments provided in the question illustrate this principle in different scenarios. Judgment (A) is not applicable as Price's guilt does not justify Long's illegal actions. Judgment (B) is also not applicable as Shakila's secretary's illegal activity does not justify Shakila's failure to report him. Judgment (C) is applicable as Takashi's violation of the curfew does not justify Sarah's parents' punishment of her. Judgment (D) is not applicable as Kuttner's illegal animal traps were set on his own land, and the conservation officer does not have the authority to punish him.

Therefore, the correct answer is (E) Ramirez was forced by the discovery of new evidence to admit that she lied about her role in managing the chief of staff's financial affairs. The board of directors' failure to take action against Ramirez in the past does not justify their failure to take action against her now, as the principle of justifiable punishment only applies to illegal activities that have been committed.
