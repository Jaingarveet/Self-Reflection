Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I incorrectly diagnosed the neonate's condition as Total Anomalous Pulmonary Venous Connection ([REDACTED]) because I misunderstood the chest X-ray image.
The prominent aortic arch and large, dilated heart suggested to me that there was increased systemic circulation, which is a characteristic of TAPV[REDACTED].
However, the correct diagnosis is Transposition of the Great Arteries ([REDACTED]), which is a congenital heart defect where the aorta and pulmonary artery are reversed, causing the aorta to arise from the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery to arise from the left ventricle.
This results in deoxygenated blood being pumped to the body and oxygenated blood being pumped to the lungs, leading to heart failure.
The chest X-ray image shows a reversed aortic arch, which is a characteristic of TG[REDACTED].
