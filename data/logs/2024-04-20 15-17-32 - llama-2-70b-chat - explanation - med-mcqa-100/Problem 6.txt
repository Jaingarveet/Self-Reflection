## System:
You are an expert in Medicine.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:
Topic: Geography
Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?

## User 2:
Topic: Medicine
Subtopic: Pathology
Question: Necrosis of cell is due to -
Choices:
  A: Ca+2 efflux in cell
  B: Fat depostion in cells
  C: Water imbibition in cells
  D: Enzymatic digestion
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I misunderstood the mechanism of necrosis. I thought that necrosis was caused by the efflux of calcium ions from the cell, but it is actually caused by enzymatic digestion.
## Assistant 2:
  Action: Answer("D")

Explanation:
Necrosis is a type of cell death that occurs due to enzymatic digestion. Enzymes, such as proteases and lipases, break down the cellular components, leading to the destruction of the cell. This process is not related to calcium efflux, fat deposition, or water imbibition. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) Enzymatic digestion.

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly because I misunderstood the mechanism of necrosis. I thought that necrosis was caused by the efflux of calcium ions from the cell, but it is actually caused by enzymatic digestion. This mistake highlights the importance of understanding the underlying mechanisms of cellular processes. By taking the time to reflect on my mistake, I was able to correct my understanding and provide the correct answer.
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
