I previously answered this question incorrectly because I misunderstood the site of transplantation for islet cell transplantation in diabetes mellitus. I thought the cells were transplanted into the liver, but the correct answer is that they are injected into the portal vein. This mistake highlights the importance of understanding the specific details of medical procedures and not relying on general knowledge or assumptions. In this case, I should have taken the time to review the specifics of islet cell transplantation and not assumed that the cells would be transplanted into the liver like other types of organ transplants.

I will also double-check my answers and consider all possible options before submitting my response. By taking these steps, I can improve my accuracy and provide better answers to medical questions.
