  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:

Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Science
Question: Which process in plants is most similar to sexual reproduction in vertebrates?
Choices:
  A: cell division
  B: self-pollination
  C: cross-pollination
  D: seed development
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Sexual reproduction in vertebrates involves the fusion of two different gametes from two different individuals.
Cross-pollination in plants involves the transfer of pollen from the anther of one flower to the stigma of another flower, resulting in fertilization and the production of seeds.
Self-pollination in plants involves the transfer of pollen from the anther to the stigma of the same flower, which is more similar to asexual reproduction.
Seed development is the process by which a fertilized egg develops into a mature seed, which is not directly comparable to sexual reproduction.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
