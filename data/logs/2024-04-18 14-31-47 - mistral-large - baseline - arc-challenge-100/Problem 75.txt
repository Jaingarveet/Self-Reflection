Topic: Science
Question: A fox gave birth to an offspring that had a better sense of hearing than most foxes. How could this small change most likely result in descendants that are different from the original fox?
Choices:
  A: Foxes that have a better sense of hearing may mutate more frequently than other foxes.
  B: Foxes that have a better sense of hearing may be hunted more frequently.
  C: Over time, descendants of this fox may hear and hunt prey better than other foxes.
  D: Over time, descendants of this fox may become extinct.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The small change in the fox's sense of hearing could lead to a better ability to hunt prey, which would increase its chances of survival and reproduction. This would result in the trait being passed on to its offspring, leading to a population of foxes with better hearing over time.
