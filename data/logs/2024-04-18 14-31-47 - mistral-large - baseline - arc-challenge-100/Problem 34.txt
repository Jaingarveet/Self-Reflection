## System:
You are an expert in Science.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Science
Question: A pharmaceutical company develops a new antibiotic to treat pneumonia. After limited testing, the researchers conclude that the antibiotic seems to be effective. How can the researchers strengthen their conclusions?
Choices:
  A: Test the antibiotic on human volunteers.
  B: Publish their results in a medical journal.
  C: Ask an independent lab to retest the antibiotic.
  D: Test the effectiveness of the antibiotic at killing other bacteria.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
To strengthen the conclusions of the researchers, they need to conduct more extensive testing to confirm the effectiveness of the antibiotic.
Testing the antibiotic on human volunteers is the best way to determine its safety and efficacy in treating pneumonia.
Publishing their results in a medical journal is important for sharing their findings with the scientific community, but it does not necessarily strengthen their conclusions.
Asking an independent lab to retest the antibiotic can help confirm the results, but it does not provide additional evidence of its effectiveness in treating pneumonia.
Testing the effectiveness of the antibiotic at killing other bacteria is not relevant to the question, as the researchers are specifically interested in its effectiveness in treating pneumonia.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: C
