Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Science
Question: Which of the following areas is most likely to form metamorphic rocks such as gneiss and schist?
Choices:
  A: a sea floor
  B: a windblown desert
  C: a site deep underground
  D: a site covered by a glacier
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Metamorphic rocks such as gneiss and schist are formed under high temperature and pressure conditions.
The sea floor and windblown desert do not have the required conditions for the formation of these rocks.
A site covered by a glacier has low temperature and high pressure, but not high enough to form these rocks.
A site deep underground has both high temperature and pressure, making it the most likely area for the formation of gneiss and schist.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
