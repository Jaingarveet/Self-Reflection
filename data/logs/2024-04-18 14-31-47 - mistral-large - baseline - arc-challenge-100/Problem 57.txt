## System:
You are an expert in Science.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Science
Question: The Ohio state tree is the buckeye. Which of these is a trait that is inherited by the buckeye tree in the reproduction process?
Choices:
  A: number of leaves that fall during winter
  B: change in leaf color during the autumn season
  C: type of mineral that is absorbed from the soil
  D: amount of water that is available for growth
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Inherited traits are passed down from parents to offspring through genes. The number of leaves that fall during winter, change in leaf color during the autumn season, type of mineral that is absorbed from the soil, and amount of water that is available for growth are all environmental factors that can affect the growth and development of a tree, but they are not inherited traits.

The buckeye tree is a type of tree that is characterized by its palmately compound leaves, large seeds, and smooth bark. These are all inherited traits that are passed down from parents to offspring through genes.

Action: Answer("None of the Above")

Wait, I cannot select "None of the Above". In this case, I would say that the question is flawed and none of the choices provided are correct. However, if I had to choose one, I would go with "A: number of leaves that fall during winter" as it is the closest to being an inherited trait, but it is still not a good answer.

Action: Answer("A") (but with reservations)
## Result:
Agent Answer: N
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
