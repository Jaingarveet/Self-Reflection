The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Science
Question: Michelle performed an investigation but the results did not match her hypothesis. What should Michelle do next?
Choices:
  A: perform the investigation in a different way
  B: change the hypothesis to match the results
  C: choose a different investigation
  D: repeat the investigation
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
When the results of an investigation do not match the hypothesis, it is important to first determine if there were any errors in the investigation that could have affected the results. If there were no errors, then the hypothesis may need to be revised or rejected.
Action: Answer("D")
Explanation:
Michelle should repeat the investigation to ensure that the results were not due to chance or error. If the results are consistent, then she can consider revising or rejecting her hypothesis. Changing the hypothesis to match the results is not a valid scientific approach. Performing the investigation in a different way or choosing a different investigation may not address the issue with the original hypothesis.
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
