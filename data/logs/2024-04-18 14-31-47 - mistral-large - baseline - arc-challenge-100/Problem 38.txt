Question: Red-clay bricks have a density of approximately 2000 kg/m^3. Air has a density of 1 kg/m^3. Which of the following has the lowest mass?
Choices:
  A: 2 m^3 of bricks
  B: 4 m^3 of bricks
  C: 6000 m^3 of air
  D: 10,000 m^3 of air
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The mass of an object is calculated by multiplying its volume by its density.
The mass of 2 m^3 of bricks is 2 m^3 \* 2000 kg/m^3 = 4000 kg.
The mass of 4 m^3 of bricks is 4 m^3 \* 2000 kg/m^3 = 8000 kg.
The mass of 6000 m^3 of air is 6000 m^3 \* 1 kg/m^3 = 6000 kg.
The mass of 10,000 m^3 of air is 10,000 m^3 \* 1 kg/m^3 = 10,000 kg.
The lowest mass is 4000 kg.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
