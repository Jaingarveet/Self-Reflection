Question: \begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}\hlineList A & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 \\\hlineList B & 2 & 3 & 3 & 4 & 4 & 5 \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}The table above shows two lists of numbers. Which of the following is a true statement comparing list $\mathrm{A}$ and list B ?
Choices:
  A: The means are the same, and the standard deviations are different.
  B: The means are the same, and the standard deviations are the same.
  C: The means are different, and the standard deviations are different.
  D: The means are different, and the standard deviations are the same.
## Assistant 2:

The means of both lists are the same, which is 3.5. 
The standard deviations are different because the data in list B is more clustered around the mean than the data in list A.
