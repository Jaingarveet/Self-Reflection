The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: $$g(x)=a x^{2}+24$$For the function $g$ defined above, $a$ is a constant and $g(4)=8$. What is the value of $g(-4)$ ?
Choices:
  A: 8
  B: 0
  C: -1
  D: -8
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
*   We know $g(4) = 8$, so we can plug in $x = 4$ and $g(x) = 8$ into the equation to solve for $a$. 
*   This gives us $8 = a(4^2) + 24$, which simplifies to $a = -1$.
*   Now we know the function is $g(x) = -x^2 + 24$. 
*   Plugging in $x = -4$, we get $g(-4) = -(-4)^2 + 24 = 8$.
Action: Answer("A") 
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
