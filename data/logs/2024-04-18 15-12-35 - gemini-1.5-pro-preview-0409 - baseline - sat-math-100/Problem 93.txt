The survey data were broken down as shown in the table above. Which of the following categories accounts for approximately 19 percent of all the survey respondents?
Choices:
  A: Females taking Geometry
  B: Females taking Algebra II
  C: Males taking Geometry
  D: Males taking Algebra I
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
We need to find which category is approximately 19% of the total respondents (310 students). So, we're looking for a value close to 0.19 * 310 = 58.9.
Examining the table:
* Females taking Geometry: 53 students (not close enough)
* Females taking Algebra II: 62 students (close, but let's check others)
* Males taking Geometry: 59 students (closer)
* Males taking Algebra I: 44 students (not close enough)
Action: Answer("C") 
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
