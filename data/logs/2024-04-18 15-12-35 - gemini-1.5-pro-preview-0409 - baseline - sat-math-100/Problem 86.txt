Topic: Math
Question: If $y=k x$, where $k$ is a constant, and $y=24$ when $x=6$, what is the value of $y$ when $x=5$ ?
Choices:
  A: 6
  B: 15
  C: 20
  D: 23
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
*   We know $y=kx$ and when $x=6$, $y=24$. We can plug these values into the equation to solve for $k$.
*   $24 = k(6)$
*   $k = 4$
*   Now we know the equation is $y=4x$.
*   We can plug in $x=5$ to find the value of $y$.
*   $y = 4(5)$
*   $y = 20$
Action: Answer("C") 
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
