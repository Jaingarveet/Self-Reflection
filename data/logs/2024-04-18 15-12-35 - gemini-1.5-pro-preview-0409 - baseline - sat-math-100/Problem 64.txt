## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: If $3 x-y=12$, what is the value of $\frac{8^{x}}{2^{y}} ?$
Choices:
  A: $2^{12}$
  B: 4
  C: $8^{2}$
  D: The value cannot be determined from the information given.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
We're given $3x - y = 12$. We want to manipulate this equation to get $\frac{8^x}{2^y}$.
Notice that $8 = 2^3$, so we can rewrite $\frac{8^x}{2^y}$ as $\frac{(2^3)^x}{2^y} = \frac{2^{3x}}{2^y}$.
Using exponent rules, this simplifies to $2^{3x-y}$.
Since we know $3x - y = 12$, we have $2^{3x-y} = 2^{12}$.
Action: Answer("A") 
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
