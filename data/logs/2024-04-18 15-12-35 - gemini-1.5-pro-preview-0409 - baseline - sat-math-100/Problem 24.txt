## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: For what value of $n$ is $|n-1|+1$ equal to 0 ?
Choices:
  A: 0
  B: 1
  C: 2
  D: There is no such value of $n$.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The absolute value of any expression is always nonnegative. Therefore, $|n-1| \geq 0$. 
Adding 1 to a nonnegative value will always result in a positive value. 
Therefore, $|n-1| + 1$ can never be equal to 0.
Action: Answer("D") 
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
