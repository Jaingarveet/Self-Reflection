Question: A helicopter, initially hovering 40 feet above the ground, begins to gain altitude at a rate of 21 feet per second. Which of the following functions represents the helicopter's altitude above the ground $y$, in feet, $t$ seconds after the helicopter begins to gain altitude?
Choices:
  A: $y=40+21$
  B: $y=40+21 t$
  C: $y=40-21 t$
  D: $y=40 t+21$
## Assistant 2:
