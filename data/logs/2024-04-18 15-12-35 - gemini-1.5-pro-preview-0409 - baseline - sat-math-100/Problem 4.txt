## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: In the $x y$-plane, the line determined by the points $(2, k)$ and $(k, 32)$ passes through the origin. Which of the following could be the value of $k$ ?
Choices:
  A: 0
  B: 4
  C: 8
  D: 16
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The line passes through the origin, so its equation is of the form y=mx.
Substituting the given points into this equation, we get two equations: k=2m and 32=km.
From the first equation, m=k/2. Substituting this into the second equation, we get 32=k(k/2), which simplifies to k^2=64.
Therefore, k could be 8 or -8. However, only 8 is among the answer choices.
Action: Answer("C") 
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
