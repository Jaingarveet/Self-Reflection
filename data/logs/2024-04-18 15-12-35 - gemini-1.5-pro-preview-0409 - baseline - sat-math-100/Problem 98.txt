## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:
Topic: Geography
Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?

  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: $$\begin{array}{r}3 x+4 y=-23 \\2 y-x=-19\end{array}$$What is the solution $(x, y)$ to the system of equations above?
Choices:
  A: $(-5,-2)$
  B: $(3,-8)$
  C: $(4,-6)$
  D: $(9,-6)$
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
We can solve this system of equations using elimination. Let's multiply the second equation by 2 to make the coefficients of $x$ in both equations equal: $$\begin{array}{r}3 x+4 y=-23 \\ -2x+4 y=-38\end{array}$$Now, subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate $y$: $$5x = 15$$Divide both sides by 5 to solve for $x$: $$x = 3$$Substitute $x = 3$ into the first equation to solve for $y$: $$3(3) + 4y = -23$$ $$9 + 4y = -23$$ $$4y = -32$$ $$y = -8$$Therefore, the solution to the system of equations is $(3, -8)$.
Action: Answer("B") 
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
