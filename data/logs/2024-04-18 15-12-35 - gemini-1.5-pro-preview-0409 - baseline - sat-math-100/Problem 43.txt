The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: $$\frac{2}{3}(9 x-6)-4=9 x-6$$Based on the equation above, what is the value of $3 x-2$ ?
Choices:
  A: -4
  B: $-\frac{4}{5}$
  C: $-\frac{2}{3}$
  D: 4
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
We can solve for $x$ first, then find the value of $3x-2$. 
Distribute the $\frac{2}{3}$: $6x - 4 - 4 = 9x - 6$
Combine like terms: $6x - 8 = 9x - 6$
Move all $x$ terms to one side: $-8 + 6 = 9x - 6x$
Simplify: $-2 = 3x$
Solve for $x$: $x = -\frac{2}{3}$
Substitute $x$ into $3x - 2$: $3(-\frac{2}{3}) - 2 = -2 - 2$
Therefore, $3x - 2 = -4$.
Action: Answer("A") 
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
