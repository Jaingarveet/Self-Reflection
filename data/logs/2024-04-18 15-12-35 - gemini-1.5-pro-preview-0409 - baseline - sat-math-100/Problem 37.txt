Topic: Math
Question: The volume of right circular cylinder A is 22 cubic centimeters. What is the volume, in cubic centimeters, of a right circular cylinder with twice the radius and half the height of cylinder A?
Choices:
  A: 11
  B: 22
  C: 44
  D: 66
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
*   The volume of a cylinder is calculated as V = πr²h, where r is the radius and h is the height.
*   Doubling the radius will quadruple the volume because the radius is squared in the formula (2² = 4).
*   Halving the height will halve the volume.
*   Therefore, the new volume will be 4 * 1/2 = 2 times the original volume.
*   2 * 22 cubic centimeters = 44 cubic centimeters.
Action: Answer("C") 
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
