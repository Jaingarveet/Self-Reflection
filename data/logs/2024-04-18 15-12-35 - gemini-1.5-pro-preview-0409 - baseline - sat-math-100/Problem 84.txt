## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: The volume of a sphere is given by the formula $V=\frac{4}{3} \pi r^{3}$, where $r$ is the radius of the sphere. Which of the following gives the radius of the sphere in terms of the volume of the sphere?
Choices:
  A: $\frac{4 \pi}{3 V}$
  B: $\frac{3 V}{4 \pi}$
  C: $\sqrt[3]{\frac{4 \pi}{3 V}}$
  D: $\sqrt[3]{\frac{3 V}{4 \pi}}$
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
We need to solve the equation $V=\frac{4}{3} \pi r^{3}$ for $r$.
1. Multiply both sides by $\frac{3}{4\pi}$:  $\frac{3V}{4\pi} = r^3$
2. Take the cube root of both sides: $\sqrt[3]{\frac{3V}{4\pi}} = r$
Action: Answer("D") 
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
