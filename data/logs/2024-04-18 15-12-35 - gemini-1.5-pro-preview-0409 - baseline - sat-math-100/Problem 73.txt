Question: The sum of three numbers is 855 . One of the numbers, $x$, is $50 \%$ more than the sum of the other two numbers. What is the value of $x$ ?
Choices:
  A: 570
  B: 513
  C: 214
  D: 155
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let the sum of the other two numbers be $y$. We know that $x = 1.5y$ and $x + y = 855$.
Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get $1.5y + y = 855$.
Combining like terms, we have $2.5y = 855$.
Dividing both sides by 2.5, we find that $y = 342$.
Therefore, $x = 1.5 * 342 = 513$.
Action: Answer("B")
