## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: $$\begin{aligned}& 3 x+b=5 x-7 \\& 3 y+c=5 y-7\end{aligned}$$In the equations above, $b$ and $c$ are constants.If $b$ is $c$ minus $\frac{1}{2}$, which of the following is true?
Choices:
  A: $x$ is $y$ minus $\frac{1}{4}$.
  B: $x$ is $y$ minus $\frac{1}{2}$.
  C: $x$ is $y$ minus 1 .
  D: $x$ is $y$ plus $\frac{1}{2}$.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
We can solve each equation for $x$ and $y$, respectively, to determine the relationship between them.
Solving the first equation: $x = \frac{b+7}{2}$
Solving the second equation: $y = \frac{c+7}{2}$
Given that $b = c - \frac{1}{2}$, we can substitute this into the equation for $x$:
$x = \frac{(c - \frac{1}{2})+7}{2} = \frac{c + \frac{13}{2}}{2}$
Comparing this to the equation for $y$, we see that $x$ is $y$ minus $\frac{1}{4}$.
Action: Answer("A") 
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
