## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.

Question: $$h=-16 t^{2}+v t+k$$The equation above gives the height $h$, in feet, of a ball $t$ seconds after it is thrown straight up with an initial speed of $v$ feet per second from a height of $k$ feet. Which of the following gives $v$ in terms of $h, t$, and $k$ ?
Choices:
  A: $v=h+k-16 t$
  B: $v=\frac{h-k+16}{t}$
  C: $v=\frac{h+k}{t}-16 t$
  D: $v=\frac{h-k}{t}+16 t$
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
We need to isolate $v$ in the equation $h=-16t^2 + vt + k$. 
First, subtract $k$ and add $16t^2$ to both sides to get $h - k + 16t^2 = vt$.
Then, divide both sides by $t$ to isolate $v$, resulting in $v = \frac{h - k + 16t^2}{t}$.
This can be rewritten as $v = \frac{h - k}{t} + 16t$.
Action: Answer("D") 
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
