Question: A rectangle was altered by increasing its length by 10 percent and decreasing its width by $p$ percent. If these alterations decreased the area of the rectangle by 12 percent, what is the value of $p$ ?
Choices:
  A: 12
  B: 15
  C: 20
  D: 22
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let L be the original length and W be the original width. 
The original area is LW.
The new area is 1.1L * (1-p/100)W = 0.88LW
So, 1.1 * (1-p/100) = 0.88
This simplifies to 1- p/100 = 0.8
Therefore, p/100 = 0.2
Hence, p = 20
Action: Answer("C") 
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
