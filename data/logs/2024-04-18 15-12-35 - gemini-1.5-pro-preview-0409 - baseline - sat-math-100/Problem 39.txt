## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:
Topic: Geography
Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: $$\begin{aligned}& -3 x+y=6 \\& a x+2 y=4\end{aligned}$$In the system of equations above, $a$ is a constant. For which of the following values of $a$ does the system have no solution?
Choices:
  A: -6
  B: -3
  C: 3
  D: 6
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The system of equations has no solution when the lines are parallel, which means they have the same slope but different y-intercepts. 
First, find the slope of the first equation:
-3x + y = 6
y = 3x + 6
The slope of the first equation is 3.
Next, find the slope of the second equation in terms of a:
ax + 2y = 4
2y = -ax + 4
y = (-a/2)x + 2
The slope of the second equation is -a/2.
For the lines to be parallel, the slopes must be equal:
3 = -a/2
a = -6
Action: Answer("A") 
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
