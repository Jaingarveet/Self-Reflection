Topic: Math
Question: Alan drives an average of 100 miles each week. His car can travel an average of 25 miles per gallon of gasoline. Alan would like to reduce his weekly expenditure on gasoline by $\$ 5$. Assuming gasoline costs $\$ 4$ per gallon, which equation can Alan use to determine how many fewer average miles, $m$, he should drive each week?
Choices:
  A: $\frac{25}{4} m=95$
  B: $\frac{25}{4} m=5$
  C: $\frac{4}{25} m=95$
  D: $\frac{4}{25} m=5$
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Alan wants to reduce his expenditure by $5, which is equivalent to reducing his gasoline consumption by $\frac{5}{4}$ gallons (since each gallon costs $4).
He needs to find out how many fewer miles, m, he should drive to achieve this reduction in gasoline consumption.
Since his car travels 25 miles per gallon, the equation becomes: $\frac{m}{25} = \frac{5}{4}$. 
This is equivalent to $\frac{4}{25}m = 5$.
Action: Answer("D")
