## System:
You are an expert in Logic.
You have incorrectly answered the following multiple-choice question.
Your task is to reflect on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
You will then use this information help you answer the same question in the future.
First, explain why you answered the question incorrectly.
Second, list the keywords that describe the type of your errors from most general to most specific. 
Third, solve the problem again, step-by-step, based on your knowledge of the correct answer.
Fourth, create a list of detailed instructions to help you correctly solve this problem in the future.
Finally, create a list of general advice to help you solve similar types of problems in the future.  
Be concise in your response; however, capture all of the essential information.  
For guidance, I will provide you with a single generic example problem and reflection (below).
## User 1:
Topic: Geography and Math
Question: What is the product of the number of letters contained in the name of the city where Iowa State University is located multiplied by the number of letters contained in the name of the state?
Choices:
    A: 16
    B: 20
    C: 24
    D: 32
Thought:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
ISU is located in the state of Iowa.
Action: Answer("D")
---
Correct Answer: A
## Assistant 1:
Explanation:
I miscalculated the product of the number of letters in the city and state names. 
The gap in my knowledge was not in geography but in basic arithmetic. 
I knew the correct city and state but made a calculation error.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Arithmetic error
 - Multiplication error
Solution:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
Iowa State University is located in the state of Iowa.
The city name "Ames" contains 4 letters.
The state name "Iowa" contains 4 letters.
The product of 4*4 is 16.
Instructions:
1. Identify the city where the university is located.
2. Identify the state where the university is located.
3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.
4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.
5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.
6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.
7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them.
## User 2:
Topic: Logic
Context: There are 6 scholars F, G, J, L, M, and N, who will speak at a logical meeting, and the speeches are arranged in the following order? (1) Each speaker speaks only once, and only once at the same time By.(2) Three speakers speak before lunch, and the other three speak after lunch.(3) G must speak before lunch.(4) Only one speaker is between M and N.(5) F speaks in the first or third place.
Question: If J is the fourth speaker, who must be the third speaker?
Choices:
  A: F or M
  C: L or N
  B: G or L
  D: M or N

Thought:
If J is the fourth speaker, then J speaks after lunch.
Since G must speak before lunch, G cannot be the third speaker.
Since only one speaker is between M and N, M and N cannot both be in the first three speakers.
Since F speaks in the first or third place, F can be the third speaker.
If F is not the third speaker, then M must be the third speaker.
Action: Answer("A")

 --- 
Correct Answer: D
## Assistant 2:
Response:
Explanation:
I made an incorrect assumption about the possible positions of M and N.
The gap in my knowledge was not in logic but in my interpretation of the given information.
I knew the correct order of the speakers but made an assumption error.

Error Keywords:
 - Assumption error
 - Interpretation error
 - Logic error

Solution:
If J is the fourth speaker, then J speaks after lunch.
Since G must speak before lunch, G cannot be the third speaker.
Since only one speaker is between M and N, M and N cannot both be in the first three speakers.
Since F speaks in the first or third place, F can be the third speaker.
However, if F is the first speaker, then M must be the second speaker, and N must be the third speaker.
Therefore, if J is the fourth speaker, then N must be the third speaker.

Instructions:
1. Identify the position of the given speaker (J).
2. Identify the speakers who cannot be in the third position based on the given conditions.
3. Identify the possible speakers who can be in the third position based on the given conditions.
4. Consider all possible scenarios for the first three speakers.
5. Eliminate any scenarios that violate the given conditions.
6. Choose the answer that matches the remaining scenario.

Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never make assumptions about the problem without verifying them.
 - Always consider all possible scenarios before making a decision.
 - Always double-check your reasoning and final answer.
 - Remember that logic problems require careful interpretation of the given information.
