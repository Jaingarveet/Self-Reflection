## System:
You are an expert in Logic.
You have incorrectly answered the following multiple-choice question.
Your task is to reflect on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
You will then use this information help you answer the same question in the future.
First, explain why you answered the question incorrectly.
Second, list the keywords that describe the type of your errors from most general to most specific. 
Third, solve the problem again, step-by-step, based on your knowledge of the correct answer.
Fourth, create a list of detailed instructions to help you correctly solve this problem in the future.
Finally, create a list of general advice to help you solve similar types of problems in the future.  
Be concise in your response; however, capture all of the essential information.  
For guidance, I will provide you with a single generic example problem and reflection (below).

Topic: Geography and Math
Question: What is the product of the number of letters contained in the name of the city where Iowa State University is located multiplied by the number of letters contained in the name of the state?
Choices:
    A: 16
    B: 20
    C: 24
    D: 32
Thought:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
ISU is located in the state of Iowa.
Action: Answer("D")
---
Correct Answer: A
## Assistant 1:
Explanation:
I miscalculated the product of the number of letters in the city and state names. 
The gap in my knowledge was not in geography but in basic arithmetic. 
I knew the correct city and state but made a calculation error.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Arithmetic error
 - Multiplication error
Solution:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
Iowa State University is located in the state of Iowa.
The city name "Ames" contains 4 letters.
The state name "Iowa" contains 4 letters.
The product of 4*4 is 16.
Instructions:
1. Identify the city where the university is located.
2. Identify the state where the university is located.
3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.
4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.
5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.
6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.
7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them.
## User 2:
Topic: Logic
Context: Zhang Shan received a higher bonus than Li Si.After learning that Wang Wu's bonus was higher than Miao Xiaoqin, Zhang Shan's bonus was also higher than Miao Xiaoqin.
Question: The following assumptions can make the above inference hold, except
Choices:
  A: Wang Wu's bonus is higher than Li Si's.
  B: Li Si's bonus is higher than Miao Xiaoqin's.
  C: Li Si's bonus is higher than Wang Wu's.
  D: Li Si's bonus is as high as Wang Wu's.

Thought:
The inference is that Zhang Shan's bonus is higher than Miao Xiaoqin's.
This inference is based on the fact that Zhang Shan's bonus is higher than Li Si's and Wang Wu's bonus is higher than Miao Xiaoqin's.
The only assumption that contradicts this inference is that Li Si's bonus is higher than Wang Wu's.
Action: Answer("C")

 --- 
Correct Answer: A
## Assistant 2:
Response:
Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I misunderstood the logic behind the inference.
The gap in my knowledge was in understanding the relationship between the bonuses of the individuals involved.
I incorrectly assumed that the only assumption that contradicts the inference is that Li Si's bonus is higher than Wang Wu's.
However, the correct answer is that Wang Wu's bonus is higher than Li Si's, which does not contradict the inference.

Error Keywords:
 - Logic error
 - Inference error
 - Assumption error

Solution:
The inference is that Zhang Shan's bonus is higher than Miao Xiaoqin's.
This inference is based on the fact that Zhang Shan's bonus is higher than Li Si's and Wang Wu's bonus is higher than Miao Xiaoqin's.
The only assumption that contradicts this inference is that Li Si's bonus is higher than Wang Wu's.
However, the correct answer is that Wang Wu's bonus is higher than Li Si's, which does not contradict the inference.

Instructions:
1. Identify the inference being made in the question.
2. Identify the assumptions that are given in the question.
3. Determine which assumption contradicts the inference.
4. Read each answer choice carefully and evaluate whether it contradicts the inference.
5. Choose the answer that does not contradict the inference.

Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always identify the inference being made in the question.
 - Always identify the assumptions that are given in the question.
 - Always determine which assumption contradicts the inference.
 - Always read each answer choice carefully and evaluate whether it contradicts the inference.
 - Always choose the answer that does not contradict the inference.
 - Remember that assumptions are not necessarily true, but are used to make an inference.
 - Remember that the correct answer may not contradict the inference, but rather be consistent with it.
