## System:
You are an expert in Logic.
You have incorrectly answered the following multiple-choice question.
Your task is to reflect on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
You will then use this information help you answer the same question in the future.
First, explain why you answered the question incorrectly.
Second, list the keywords that describe the type of your errors from most general to most specific. 
Third, solve the problem again, step-by-step, based on your knowledge of the correct answer.
Fourth, create a list of detailed instructions to help you correctly solve this problem in the future.
Finally, create a list of general advice to help you solve similar types of problems in the future.  
Be concise in your response; however, capture all of the essential information.  
For guidance, I will provide you with a single generic example problem and reflection (below).

Topic: Geography and Math
Question: What is the product of the number of letters contained in the name of the city where Iowa State University is located multiplied by the number of letters contained in the name of the state?
Choices:
    A: 16
    B: 20
    C: 24
    D: 32
Thought:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
ISU is located in the state of Iowa.
Action: Answer("D")
---
Correct Answer: A
## Assistant 1:
Explanation:
I miscalculated the product of the number of letters in the city and state names. 
The gap in my knowledge was not in geography but in basic arithmetic. 
I knew the correct city and state but made a calculation error.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Arithmetic error
 - Multiplication error
Solution:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
Iowa State University is located in the state of Iowa.
The city name "Ames" contains 4 letters.
The state name "Iowa" contains 4 letters.
The product of 4*4 is 16.
Instructions:
1. Identify the city where the university is located.
2. Identify the state where the university is located.
3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.
4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.
5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.
6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.
7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them.

Topic: Logic
Context: Confucius said? "Do not do what you don't want to do to others."
Question: Which of the following options is not a logical inference from the above sentence?
Choices:
  A: Only those who do what they want can do it to others.
  B: If you want, then give it to others.
  C: Don't treat others unless you want to.
  D: Whatever is applied to people should be what they want.

Thought:
The statement "Do not do what you don't want to do to others" is a form of the Golden Rule, which means treating others the way you want to be treated.
Option A is not a logical inference because it misinterprets the statement as only doing what you want to do to others, rather than not doing what you don't want to be done to you.
Option B is a logical inference because it suggests giving to others what you want for yourself.
Option C is a logical inference because it suggests not treating others in a way that you wouldn't want to be treated.
Option D is a logical inference because it suggests that whatever is applied to people should be something they want.
Action: Answer("A")

 --- 
Correct Answer: B
## Assistant 2:
Response:
Explanation:
I incorrectly identified option B as a logical inference from the statement "Do not do what you don't want to do to others."
The gap in my knowledge was in understanding the logical implications of the statement.
I misinterpreted the statement as suggesting that if you want something, you should give it to others, rather than not doing something to others that you wouldn't want done to you.

Error Keywords:
 - Logical inference error
 - Misinterpretation error
 - Golden Rule error

Solution:
The statement "Do not do what you don't want to do to others" is a form of the Golden Rule, which means treating others the way you want to be treated.
Option A is not a logical inference because it misinterprets the statement as only doing what you want to do to others, rather than not doing what you don't want to be done to you.
Option B is not a logical inference because it suggests giving to others what you want for yourself, rather than not doing something to others that you wouldn't want done to you.
Option C is a logical inference because it suggests not treating others in a way that you wouldn't want to be treated.
Option D is a logical inference because it suggests that whatever is applied to people should be something they want.

Instructions:
1. Read the statement carefully and understand its meaning.
2. Identify the logical implications of the statement.
3. Evaluate each option to determine if it is a logical inference from the statement.
4. Eliminate options that are not logical inferences.
5. Choose the answer that is not a logical inference.

Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your reasoning and final answer.
 - Remember that logical inferences must be based on the meaning of the statement, not on personal interpretations or assumptions.
