## System:
You are an expert in Logic.
You have incorrectly answered the following multiple-choice question.
Your task is to reflect on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
You will then use this information help you answer the same question in the future.
First, explain why you answered the question incorrectly.
Second, list the keywords that describe the type of your errors from most general to most specific. 
Third, solve the problem again, step-by-step, based on your knowledge of the correct answer.
Fourth, create a list of detailed instructions to help you correctly solve this problem in the future.
Finally, create a list of general advice to help you solve similar types of problems in the future.  
Be concise in your response; however, capture all of the essential information.  
For guidance, I will provide you with a single generic example problem and reflection (below).
## User 1:
Topic: Geography and Math
Question: What is the product of the number of letters contained in the name of the city where Iowa State University is located multiplied by the number of letters contained in the name of the state?
Choices:
    A: 16
    B: 20
    C: 24
    D: 32
Thought:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
ISU is located in the state of Iowa.
Action: Answer("D")
---
Correct Answer: A
## Assistant 1:
Explanation:
I miscalculated the product of the number of letters in the city and state names. 
The gap in my knowledge was not in geography but in basic arithmetic. 
I knew the correct city and state but made a calculation error.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Arithmetic error
 - Multiplication error
Solution:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
Iowa State University is located in the state of Iowa.
The city name "Ames" contains 4 letters.
The state name "Iowa" contains 4 letters.
The product of 4*4 is 16.
Instructions:
1. Identify the city where the university is located.
2. Identify the state where the university is located.
3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.
4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.
5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.
6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.
7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them.
## User 2:
Topic: Logic
Context: Most people think that the thinking of scientists is based on strict logical reasoning, not on image thinking means such as analogy, intuition, and epiphany.However, research shows that Nobel Prize winners make more use of these image thinking methods than general scientists.Therefore, image thinking methods help to achieve major scientific breakthroughs.
Question: The above conclusion is based on which of the following assumptions?
Choices:
  A: Organized, step-by-step reasoning is essential for general scientific research.
  B: Nobel Prize winners have the ability to think creatively through analogy, intuition, and insight.
  C: Nobel winners have made major scientific breakthroughs.
  D: Nobel Prize winners are smarter and harder than ordinary scientists.

Thought:
The conclusion assumes that the use of image thinking methods such as analogy, intuition, and epiphany leads to major scientific breakthroughs.
This assumption is based on the observation that Nobel Prize winners make more use of these methods than general scientists.
Action: Answer("B")

 --- 
Correct Answer: C
## Assistant 2:
Response:
Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I focused on the assumption that image thinking methods lead to major scientific breakthroughs, rather than the assumption that Nobel Prize winners have made major scientific breakthroughs.

Error Keywords:
 - Assumption error
 - Focus error
 - Misinterpretation error

Solution:
The conclusion assumes that Nobel Prize winners have made major scientific breakthroughs.
The assumption is based on the observation that Nobel Prize winners make more use of image thinking methods than general scientists.
The assumption is necessary to support the conclusion that image thinking methods help to achieve major scientific breakthroughs.

Instructions:
1. Identify the conclusion of the argument.
2. Identify the assumption that supports the conclusion.
3. Evaluate each answer choice to determine which one best represents the assumption.
4. Choose the answer that matches the assumption.

Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always identify the conclusion and assumption of the argument.
 - Always evaluate each answer choice to determine which one best represents the assumption.
 - Never assume that the correct answer is the one that seems most obvious.
 - Always double-check your answer to ensure accuracy.
 - Remember that assumptions are often unstated and must be inferred from the argument.
