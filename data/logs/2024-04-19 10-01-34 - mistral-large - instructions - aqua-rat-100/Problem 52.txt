I previously answered this question incorrectly by not calculating the weight of zinc and copper in alloy X and alloy Y separately before finding the ratio in alloy Z.

To solve this problem correctly, I need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the weight of zinc and copper in alloy X.
2. Calculate the weight of zinc and copper in alloy Y.
3. Add the weight of zinc and copper in alloy X and alloy Y to find the weight of zinc and copper in alloy Z.
4. Find the ratio of zinc and copper in alloy Z.

Step 1: Calculate the weight of zinc and copper in alloy X.
Alloy X has zinc and copper in the ratio 6:9. This means that for every 15 parts of alloy X, there are 6 parts of zinc and 9 parts of copper.
Since alloy X weighs 40 grams, we can calculate the weight of zinc and copper as follows:
Weight of zinc in alloy X = (6/15) \* 40 = 16 grams
Weight of copper in alloy X = (9/15) \* 40 = 24 grams

Step 2: Calculate the weight of zinc and copper in alloy Y.
Alloy Y has zinc and copper in the ratio 7:11. This means that for every 18 parts of alloy Y, there are 7 parts of zinc and 11 parts of copper.
Since alloy Y weighs 60 grams, we can calculate the weight of zinc and copper as follows:
Weight of zinc in alloy Y = (7/18) \* 60 = 23.33 grams (approximately)
Weight of copper in alloy Y = (11/18) \* 60 = 36.67 grams (approximately)

Step 3: Add the weight of zinc and copper in alloy X and alloy Y to find the weight of zinc and copper in alloy Z.
Weight of zinc in alloy Z = Weight of zinc in alloy X + Weight of zinc in alloy Y = 16 + 23.33 = 39.33 grams (approximately)
Weight of copper in alloy Z = Weight of copper in alloy X + Weight of copper in alloy Y = 24 + 36.67 = 60.67 grams (approximately)

Step 4: Find the ratio of zinc and copper in alloy Z.
The ratio of zinc and copper in alloy Z is approximately 39.33 : 60.67, which simplifies to 59 : 91.
