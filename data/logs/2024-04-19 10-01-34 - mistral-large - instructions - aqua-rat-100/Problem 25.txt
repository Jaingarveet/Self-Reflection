Question: A car is being driven, in a straight line and at a uniform speed, towards the base of a vertical tower. The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower?
Choices:
  A: 5(√3 + 1)
  B: 6(√3 + √2)
  C: 7(√3 – 1)
  D: 8(√3 – 2)
  E: None of these

## Assistant 2:
Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly by not considering the uniform speed of the car.
I realized that the distance traveled by the car in the first 10 minutes is equal to the distance it will travel in the remaining time until it reaches the base of the tower.
I also realized that the ratio of the distances traveled by the car in the first 10 minutes and the remaining time is equal to the ratio of the tangents of the angles of elevation.

Thought:
Let's denote the distance traveled by the car in the first 10 minutes as "d1" and the distance it will travel in the remaining time as "d2".
Since the car is moving at a uniform speed, we can say that d1/d2 = t1/t2, where t1 is the time taken to travel d1 and t2 is the time taken to travel d2.
We know that t1 = 10 minutes and t2 is what we need to find.
We also know that the angle of elevation changes from 45° to 60° in the first 10 minutes.
Therefore, we can say that d1/d2 = tan(45°)/tan(60°) = 1/√3.
We can rearrange this equation to find d2 = d1*√3.
Since d1 is the distance traveled in the first 10 minutes, we can say that d1 = speed*t1.
We don't know the speed of the car, but we can express it as d1/t1.
Therefore, d2 = (d1/t1)*√3*t2.
We can simplify this equation to find t2 = d1*√3/d1 = √3.

Action: Answer("A")
