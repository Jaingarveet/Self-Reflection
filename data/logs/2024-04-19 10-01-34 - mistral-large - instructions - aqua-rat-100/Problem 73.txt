## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Identify the percentages given in the problem.
2. Convert the percentages to fractions.
3. Determine the smallest number that satisfies both fractions (i.e., is a multiple of both denominators).
4. Check if the number obtained in step 3 is greater than the minimum number of students given in the problem.
5. If the number obtained in step 3 is not greater than the minimum number of students, find the next multiple of both denominators that is greater than the minimum number of students.
6. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The percentages given in the problem are 20% and 28%.
Converting these percentages to fractions gives us 1/5 and 7/25, respectively.
The smallest number that satisfies both fractions is the least common multiple of their denominators, which is 100.
However, this number is not greater than the minimum number of students given in the problem, which is 501.
Therefore, we need to find the next multiple of both denominators that is greater than 501.
The next multiple of 100 that is greater than 501 is 600.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: E
Score: 0
