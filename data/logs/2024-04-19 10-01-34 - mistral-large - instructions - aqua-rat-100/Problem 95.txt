Question: John likes to have lightly flavored tea every evening. In a 50% strong milk tea, he replaces 15% of it with milk twice. Then, he replaces 10 percent of the resultant solution with more milk.
What is the final concentration of tea John drinks?
Choices:
  A: 15.38%
  B: 42%
  C: 39.86%
  D: 22.35%
  E: 32.51%

## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The university is Johns Hopkins University, which is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The number of letters in Baltimore is 8, and the number of letters in Maryland is 7.
Multiplying 8 by 7 gives 56.
However, this calculation does not relate to the question about the concentration of tea.

To solve the problem, we need to calculate the concentration of tea after each replacement with milk.
After the first replacement, the concentration of tea is 50% - 15% = 35%.
After the second replacement, the concentration of tea is 35% - 15% = 20%.
After the third replacement, the concentration of tea is 20% - 10% = 10%.
However, this calculation is incorrect because we need to calculate the concentration of tea based on the total volume of the solution after each replacement.

After the first replacement, the concentration of tea is 50% x (1 - 15%) = 42.5%.
After the second replacement, the concentration of tea is 42.5% x (1 - 15%) = 36.13%.
After the third replacement, the concentration of tea is 36.13% x (1 - 10%) = 32.51%.

Action: Answer("E")
