## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: A club consists of members whose ages are in A.P. The common difference being 3 months. If the youngest member of the club is just 7 years old and the sum of the ages of all the members is 250, then number of members in the club are :
Choices:
  A: 18
  B: 20

Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Identify the ages of the members as an arithmetic progression with a common difference of 3 months (or 1/4 year).
2. Identify the youngest member as 7 years old, so the first term (a) of the [REDACTED].P. is 7.
3. Identify the sum of the ages of all the members as [REDACTED]0 years.
4. Use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic progression to solve for the number of members (n).
5. Rearrange the formula to solve for n.
6. Substitute the given values into the formula.
7. Simplify and solve for n.
8. Factor the quadratic equation to find the possible values for n.
9. Choose the positive value for n as the number of members.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The ages of the members form an arithmetic progression with a common difference of 3 months or 1/4 year.
The youngest member is 7 years old, so the first term (a) is 7.
The sum of the ages of all the members is 250 years.
The formula for the sum of an arithmetic progression is:
Sum = n/2 * (2a + (n-1)d)
where n is the number of terms, a is the first term, and d is the common difference.
Rearranging the formula to solve for n:
n^2 + (2a/d - 1)n - 2Sum/d = 0
Substituting the given values:
n^2 + (56 - 1)n - 2000 = 0
Simplifying:
n^2 + 55n - 2000 = 0
Factoring:
(n - 25)(n + 80) = 0
The possible values for n are 25 and -80.
Since the number of members cannot be negative, the number of members is 25.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
