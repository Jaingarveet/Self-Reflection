## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The sum of 5 consecutive odd numbers can be calculated as 5 times the middle number.
The middle number of 5 consecutive two digit odd numbers would also be a two digit odd number.
When this sum is divided by 10, it becomes a perfect square.
This means that the middle number must end in a 5, as only then will the sum be divisible by 10.
The only option that ends in a 5 is 65.
Action: Answer("D")

Self-reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly because I did not consider that the sum of 5 consecutive odd numbers is always 5 times the middle number.
I also did not consider that the middle number must end in a 5 for the sum to be divisible by 10.
I have now corrected my mistake and arrived at the correct answer.
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
