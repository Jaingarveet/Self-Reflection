## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let's denote the number of white sharpeners as "w" and the number of brown sharpeners as "b".
We know that Jack bought a total of 18 sharpeners, so w + b = 18.
We also know that Jack paid 1 rupee more for each white sharpener than for each brown sharpener, and that the total cost was rs. 100.
Let's denote the cost of a brown sharpener as "x". Then the cost of a white sharpener is x + 1.
We can set up another equation: x \* b + (x + 1) \* w = 100.
Now we have two equations and two variables. We can solve them simultaneously.
First, let's express "b" from the first equation: b = 18 - w.
Then substitute it into the second equation: x \* (18 - w) + (x + 1) \* w = 100.
Expanding and simplifying the equation, we get: 18x - xw + xw + w = 100.
So, 18x + w = 100.
Now we can express "w" from this equation: w = 100 - 18x.
Since "w" and "b" are both positive integers, we can try different values of "x" to find a suitable solution.
If x = 4, then w = 100 - 18 \* 4 = 16. But 16 + b = 18 has no integer solution for "b".
If x = 5, then w = 100 - 18 \* 5 = 8. And b = 18 - w = 18 - 8 = 10.
So, Jack bought 8 white sharpeners and 10 brown sharpeners.
Action: Answer("A")
