## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The question asks for the number of matches that the team lost, not the number of letters in the city or state name.
The team lost 30% of their matches.
If they won 20 matches, then they played a total of 100 matches (since 20 is 70% of 100).
Therefore, they lost 30 matches.
Action: Answer("B")
