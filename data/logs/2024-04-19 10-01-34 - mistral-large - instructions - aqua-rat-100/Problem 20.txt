## Assistant 2:
Thought:

1. The initial ratio of boys to girls is 64:40, which simplifies to 4:2.5 or 8:5.
2. The new ratio of boys to girls is 4:3.
3. Let x be the number of boys and girls who joined the group.
4. The new number of boys is 64 + x, and the new number of girls is 40 + x.
5. The equation for the new ratio is (64 + x) / (40 + x) = 4/3.
6. Solving for x, we get x = 20.
7. The new number of boys is 64 + 20 = 84, and the new number of girls is 40 + 20 = 60.
8. The total number of members now is 84 + 60 = 144.

Action: Answer("E")

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly by misinterpreting the new ratio as 4:3 for the initial number of boys and girls. However, the new ratio applies to the number of boys and girls after the membership drive. I have now corrected my mistake and arrived at the correct answer.
## Result:
Agent Answer: E
