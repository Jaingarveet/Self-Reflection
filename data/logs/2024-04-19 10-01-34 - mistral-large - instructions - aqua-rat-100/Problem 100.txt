## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The area of a rectangle is given by the formula A = lw, where A is the area, l is the length, and w is the width (or breadth).
We know that the area is 150 sq m and that the length is 1m more than 4 times the breadth, which can be written as l = 4w + 1.
We can substitute this expression for l into the area formula and solve for w:
150 = (4w + 1)w
Expanding and rearranging the equation, we get:
4w^2 + w - 150 = 0
This is a quadratic equation, which we can solve using the quadratic formula:
w = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a
Plugging in the values for a, b, and c, we get:
w = (-1 ± √(1 + 2400)) / 8
w = (-1 ± 49) / 8
Since the width cannot be negative, we choose the positive root:
w = 48/8 = 6
Now that we have the width, we can find the length using the expression we derived earlier:
l = 4w + 1 = 4(6) + 1 = 25
Finally, we can find the perimeter using the formula P = 2l + 2w:
P = 2(25) + 2(6) = 62
