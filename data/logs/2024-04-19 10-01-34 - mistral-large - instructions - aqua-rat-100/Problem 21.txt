## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")

Topic: Math
Question: x men working x hours per day can do x units of a work in x days. How much work can be completed by y men working y hours per day in y days?
Choices:
  A: x2/y2 units
  B: y3/x2 units
  C: x3/y2 units
  D: y2/x2 units
  E: None of these
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Identify the variables in the problem: number of workers, hours worked per day, and number of days.
2. Write down the equation for work: W = (number of workers) x (hours worked per day) x (number of days)
3. Use the equation to find the amount of work done by x men working x hours per day in x days: W1 = x^3
4. Use the equation to find the amount of work done by y men working y hours per day in y days: W2 = y^3
5. Calculate the ratio of W2 to W1: W2/W1 = y^3 / x^3
6. Simplify the ratio by canceling out common factors: y^3 / x^3 = y^3 / x^2
7. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The amount of work done by x men working x hours per day in x days is W1 = x^3.
The amount of work done by y men working y hours per day in y days is W2 = y^3.
The ratio of W2 to W1 is y^3 / x^3.
Simplifying the ratio by canceling out common factors gives y^3 / x^3 = y^3 / x^2.
However, none of the answer choices match this result.
Action: Answer("E") (None of these)
## Result:
Agent Answer: E
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
