## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding the lengths of all its sides. Since a rectangle has two pairs of equal sides, we can calculate the perimeter by adding the length and width twice.

Perimeter = 2(length + width)
= 2(8cm + 3cm)
= 2(11cm)
= 22cm

Action: Answer("B")

Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
