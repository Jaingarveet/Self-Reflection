## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Identify the greatest common factor (GCF) of the two integers.
2. Identify one of the integers.
3. Determine the prime factors of the GCF.
4. Determine the least common multiple (LCM) of the two integers.
5. Determine the prime factors of the LCM.
6. Check each of the answer choices to see which one is a factor of the LCM and is also divisible by the prime factors of the GCF.
7. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The greatest common factor (GCF) of the two integers is 11.
One of the integers is 350.
The least common multiple (LCM) of the two integers is 7700.
The prime factors of 11 are 11.
The prime factors of 7700 are 2^2 \* 5^2 \* 7^2 \* 11.
Checking each of the answer choices:
A: 242 is not a factor of 7700.
B: 308 is a factor of 7700 and is divisible by 11.
C: 352 is not a factor of 7700.
D: 412 is not a factor of 7700.
E: 456 is not a factor of 7700.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
