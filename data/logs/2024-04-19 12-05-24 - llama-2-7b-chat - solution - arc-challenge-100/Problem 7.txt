Question: A group of Canada geese left a Florida lake in the spring. The geese arrived at a Maine lake 2,000 km away in 40 days. If the geese traveled at a constant rate, how far did the geese travel on the first day?
Choices:
  A: 5 km
  B: 20 km
  C: 40 km
  D: 50 km
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
To find the distance traveled by the Canada geese on the first day, we need to use the formula: distance = speed x time.

The question states that the geese traveled 2,000 km in 40 days, so the speed of the geese is:
speed = distance / time = 2,000 km / 40 days = [REDACTED]/day

Now, to find the distance traveled on the first day, we can multiply the speed by the number of days the geese have been traveling:
distance = speed x days = [REDACTED]/day x 1 day = [REDACTED]

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) [REDACTED].
## Assistant 2:
