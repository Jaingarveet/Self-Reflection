The oil spill will likely have a negative impact on the coastal habitat.
The oil will harm or kill marine life and alter the water's chemistry.
The correct answer is "[REDACTED]".
## Assistant 2:
  Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, stating that fish reproduction rates would increase due to the oil spill. However, upon further reflection, I realize that the oil spill will likely have a negative impact on the coastal habitat. The oil will harm or kill marine life and alter the water's chemistry, which will have a cascading effect on the entire ecosystem.

Therefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED].
