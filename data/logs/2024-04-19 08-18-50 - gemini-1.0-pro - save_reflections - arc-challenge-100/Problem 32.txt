## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that tossing a ball in the air does not generate a wave. 
My knowledge gap was in understanding the concept of mechanical waves. 
I knew that waves transfer energy, but I did not realize that the movement of an object through a medium can also be a wave.
Error Keywords:
 - Mechanical wave
 - Transverse wave
 - Longitudinal wave
 - Medium
Solution:
A wave is a disturbance that transfers energy from one place to another.
There are two main types of waves: mechanical waves and electromagnetic waves.
Mechanical waves require a medium to travel through, while electromagnetic waves do not.
Tossing a ball in the air generates a mechanical wave called a transverse wave.
Shaking the ends of a rope generates a mechanical wave called a transverse wave.
Throwing a pebble into a pool of water generates a mechanical wave called a surface wave.
Pulling on a coiled spring toy generates a mechanical wave called a longitudinal wave.
Instructions:
1. Identify the type of wave being described in the question.
2. Determine if the wave requires a medium to travel through.
3. If the wave requires a medium, identify the medium involved.
4. Consider the actions described in each answer choice.
5. Determine which action would not generate the type of wave identified in step 1.
6. Choose the answer that corresponds to the action that would not generate the wave.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always consider the different types of waves and their properties.
 - Always think about the medium involved in the wave generation.
 - Always consider the actions described in each answer choice and their potential to generate the wave.
 - Never assume that your initial understanding of a concept is complete or accurate.
 - Always be willing to learn new information and revise your understanding of concepts.
