## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I misinterpreted the question and the context. I focused on the fact that "customized babies" had not been tried globally and ignored the part about "eugenics and the concept of cloning." I missed the key distinction between gene screening for defect prevention and the concept of creating "customized babies."

Error Keywords:
 - Misinterpretation
 - Ignoring key details
 - Lack of attention to context

Solution:
The correct answer is Choice C. Gene screening, as described in the context, is primarily about avoiding reproductive defects and creating opportunities for human eugenics. The concept of "customized babies," on the other hand, involves cloning, which is a separate and more complex ethical issue. Choice C refutes the view that "customized babies" are imminent by clarifying the purpose and scope of gene screening technology. It distinguishes between gene screening for defect prevention and the concept of creating "customized babies."

Instructions:
1. Focus on the specific argument to be refuted: the belief that "humans may usher in the era of 'customized babies'."
2. Examine each choice for its effectiveness in refuting this belief.
3. Consider the context and the distinction between gene screening and "customized babies."
4. Identify the choice that clarifies this distinction and refutes the belief effectively.

Step-by-step solution:
1. The context mentions "the world's first test-tube baby screened by next-generation gene sequencing technology." This refers to gene screening, which aims to avoid reproductive defects and create opportunities for human eugenics.
2. Choice C clarifies that gene screening has a specific purpose and scope, distinct from the concept of "customized babies." It refutes the belief by explaining that "customized babies" involve cloning, a separate and more complex ethical issue.
3. Therefore, Choice C is the best option to refute the views of ordinary people who believe that "customized babies" are imminent.

Advice:
 - Read and understand the context carefully, paying attention to key distinctions and nuances.
 - Focus on the specific argument or belief to be refuted and identify the most effective counterargument.
 - Consider the scope and limitations of the technology described and how it differs from potential future applications.
 - Avoid making assumptions or jumping to conclusions based on limited information.
 - Always seek to clarify and distinguish between similar but distinct concepts.
