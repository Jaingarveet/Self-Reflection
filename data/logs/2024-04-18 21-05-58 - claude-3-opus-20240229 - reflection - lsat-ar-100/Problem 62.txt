## System:
You are an expert in Law.
You have incorrectly answered the following multiple-choice question.
Your task is to reflect on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
You will then use this information help you answer the same question in the future.
First, explain why you answered the question incorrectly.
Second, list the keywords that describe the type of your errors from most general to most specific. 
Third, solve the problem again, step-by-step, based on your knowledge of the correct answer.
Fourth, create a list of detailed instructions to help you correctly solve this problem in the future.
Finally, create a list of general advice to help you solve similar types of problems in the future.  
Be concise in your response; however, capture all of the essential information.  
For guidance, I will provide you with a single generic example problem and reflection (below).

Topic: Geography and Math
Question: What is the product of the number of letters contained in the name of the city where Iowa State University is located multiplied by the number of letters contained in the name of the state?
Choices:
    A: 16
    B: 20
    C: 24
    D: 32
Thought:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
ISU is located in the state of Iowa.
Action: Answer("D")
---
Correct Answer: A
## Assistant 1:
Explanation:
I miscalculated the product of the number of letters in the city and state names. 
The gap in my knowledge was not in geography but in basic arithmetic. 
I knew the correct city and state but made a calculation error.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Arithmetic error
 - Multiplication error
Solution:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
Iowa State University is located in the state of Iowa.
The city name "Ames" contains 4 letters.
The state name "Iowa" contains 4 letters.
The product of 4*4 is 16.
Instructions:
1. Identify the city where the university is located.
2. Identify the state where the university is located.
3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.
4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.
5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.
6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.
7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them.

Topic: Law
Context: A government needs to assign new ambassadors to Venezuela, Yemen, and Zambia. The candidates for these ambassadorships are Jaramillo, Kayne, Landon, Novetzke, and Ong. One ambassador will be assigned to each country, and no ambassador will be assigned to more than one country. The assignment of the ambassadors must meet the following constraints: Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships. If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne. If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen. If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
Question: If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Jaramillo is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela.
  B: Landon is assigned as ambassador to Zambia.
  C: Ong is assigned as ambassador to Zambia.
  D: Jaramillo is not assigned to an ambassadorship.
  E: Ong is not assigned to an ambassadorship.

Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. We know that either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, will be assigned an ambassadorship.
2. The question states that Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen. This means Novetzke cannot be assigned an ambassadorship.
3. We also know that if Jaramillo is assigned an ambassadorship, then so is Kayne. Since Kayne is assigned, Jaramillo may or may not be assigned.
4. If Ong is assigned to Venezuela, Kayne cannot be assigned to Yemen. But since Kayne is assigned to Yemen, Ong cannot be assigned to Venezuela.
5. If Landon is assigned, it must be to Zambia.
6. Looking at the choices:
   A) Jaramillo may or may not be assigned to Venezuela. Not necessarily true.
   B) Landon may or may not be assigned to Zambia. Not necessarily true.
   C) Ong may be assigned to Zambia, but not necessarily. Not necessarily true.
   D) Jaramillo may or may not be assigned. Not necessarily true.
   E) Ong cannot be assigned to Venezuela, but could be assigned to Zambia. This is the only choice that must be true.
Action: Answer("E")

 --- 
Correct Answer: A
## Assistant 2:
Response:
Explanation:
I made an error in my logical reasoning. I correctly identified some of the constraints but failed to properly apply them to determine what must be true if Kayne is assigned to Yemen. I eliminated some possibilities but did not narrow it down to the one correct answer that must be true.
Error Keywords:
 - Logical reasoning error
 - Constraint application error
 - Deductive reasoning error
 - Incomplete analysis
Solution:
1. Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned an ambassadorship. 
2. If Kayne is assigned to Yemen, then Novetzke is not assigned an ambassadorship.
3. If Jaramillo is assigned an ambassadorship, then so is Kayne. 
4. Since Kayne is assigned to Yemen, Jaramillo must also be assigned an ambassadorship.
5. If Ong is assigned to Venezuela, Kayne cannot be assigned to Yemen. 
6. Since Kayne is assigned to Yemen, Ong cannot be assigned to Venezuela.
7. The only remaining country for Ong is Zambia.
8. If Landon is assigned an ambassadorship, it must be to Zambia. 
9. But since Ong is assigned to Zambia, Landon cannot be assigned an ambassadorship.
10. Therefore, if Kayne is assigned to Yemen, Jaramillo must be assigned to Venezuela.
Instructions:
1. Carefully read the question and constraints.
2. Identify the key information given in the question. 
3. Go through the constraints one by one and apply them to the scenario in the question.
4. Use the process of elimination to rule out possibilities that violate the constraints.
5. Continue narrowing down the possibilities until only one remains.
6. Double check that the remaining possibility satisfies all the given constraints.
7. Select the answer choice that matches the one remaining possibility.
Advice:
 - Always read the question and constraints very carefully.
 - Break down complex scenarios into individual facts and constraints. 
 - Consider each constraint separately and apply them methodically.
 - Use deductive reasoning to draw new conclusions from the given information.
 - Eliminate possibilities that violate any of the constraints.
 - Continue this process until you arrive at the one and only possibility that must be true.
 - If you get stuck, try working backwards from the answer choices.
