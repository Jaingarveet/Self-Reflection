## System:
You are an expert in Law.
You have incorrectly answered the following multiple-choice question.
Your task is to reflect on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
You will then use this information help you answer the same question in the future.
First, explain why you answered the question incorrectly.
Second, list the keywords that describe the type of your errors from most general to most specific. 
Third, solve the problem again, step-by-step, based on your knowledge of the correct answer.
Fourth, create a list of detailed instructions to help you correctly solve this problem in the future.
Finally, create a list of general advice to help you solve similar types of problems in the future.  
Be concise in your response; however, capture all of the essential information.  
For guidance, I will provide you with a single generic example problem and reflection (below).

Topic: Geography and Math
Question: What is the product of the number of letters contained in the name of the city where Iowa State University is located multiplied by the number of letters contained in the name of the state?
Choices:
    A: 16
    B: 20
    C: 24
    D: 32
Thought:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
ISU is located in the state of Iowa.
Action: Answer("D")
---
Correct Answer: A
## Assistant 1:
Explanation:
I miscalculated the product of the number of letters in the city and state names. 
The gap in my knowledge was not in geography but in basic arithmetic. 
I knew the correct city and state but made a calculation error.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Arithmetic error
 - Multiplication error
Solution:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
Iowa State University is located in the state of Iowa.
The city name "Ames" contains 4 letters.
The state name "Iowa" contains 4 letters.
The product of 4*4 is 16.
Instructions:
1. Identify the city where the university is located.
2. Identify the state where the university is located.
3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.
4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.
5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.
6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.
7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them.

Topic: Law
Context: A panel of five scientists will be formed. The panelists will be selected from among three botanists—F, G, and H—three chemists—K, L, and M—and three zoologists—P, Q, and R. Selection is governed by the following conditions: The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types. If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. F and K cannot both be selected. K and M cannot both be selected. If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
Question: If both G and H are among the scientists selected, then the panel must include either
Choices:
  A: F or else K
  B: F or else M
  C: K or else M
  D: M or else Q
  E: P or else Q

Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The panel must include at least one scientist of each type (botanist, chemist, zoologist).
2. If both G and H are selected (two botanists), then at most one zoologist can be selected.
3. F and K cannot both be selected. K and M cannot both be selected.
4. If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
Now, let's consider each answer choice:
A. F or else K: This cannot be correct because F and K cannot both be selected.
B. F or else M: This could be possible. If G and H are selected, then either F or M could be the chemist.
C. K or else M: This cannot be correct because K and M cannot both be selected.
D. M or else Q: If M is selected, then both P and R must be selected. But if G and H are also selected, this would violate the condition that at most one zoologist can be selected when more than one botanist is selected. So this cannot be correct.
E. P or else Q: If G and H are selected, then at most one zoologist can be selected. So either P or Q could be selected, but not both. This is a possible answer.
Considering the conditions, if both G and H are selected, the panel must include either F or M as the chemist, and either P or Q as the zoologist.
Action: Answer("B")

Correct Answer: A
## Assistant 2:
Response:
Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that if both G and H were selected, the panel could include either F or M as the chemist. However, I overlooked the condition that if M is selected, both P and R must also be selected. This would violate the rule that if more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist can be selected. Therefore, if both G and H are selected, the chemist must be either F or K, not M.
Error Keywords:
 - Overlooked constraint
 - Violated condition
 - Incorrect deduction
 - Faulty reasoning
Solution:
1. The panel must include at least one scientist of each type (botanist, chemist, zoologist).
2. If both G and H are selected (two botanists), then at most one zoologist can be selected. 
3. F and K cannot both be selected. K and M cannot both be selected.
4. If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
5. If both G and H are selected, M cannot be selected as the chemist because that would require selecting both P and R, violating the condition that at most one zoologist can be selected when more than one botanist is selected.
6. Therefore, if both G and H are selected, the chemist must be either F or K.
Instructions:
1. Carefully read the question and note all the conditions and constraints.
2. Identify the key information given in the question.
3. Consider each condition one by one and think through the implications.
4. Eliminate answer choices that violate any of the given conditions.
5. If a condition leads to a contradiction with another condition, that scenario is not possible.
6. Choose the answer that satisfies all the conditions and constraints.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and note all the conditions and constraints.
 - Consider the implications of each condition and constraint separately.
 - Look for contradictions that arise when combining different conditions.
 - Eliminate answer choices that violate any of the given conditions.
 - Be careful not to make unwarranted assumptions or overlook any given information.
 - Double-check your reasoning to ensure it is logically sound and consistent with all the given conditions.
