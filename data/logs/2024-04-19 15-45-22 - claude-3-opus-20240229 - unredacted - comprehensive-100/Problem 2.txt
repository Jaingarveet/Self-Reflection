Question: A straight picket fence is composed of x pickets each of which is 1/2 inch wide. If there are 6 inches of space between each pair of pickets, which of the following represents the length of fence in feet?
Choices:
  A: 13x/2
  B: 13x/2 - 6
  C: 13x/24
  D: (13x+1)/24
  E: (13x-12)/24

Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I made an error in my calculation of the total length of the fence. I correctly identified that each picket plus space is 13/2 inches wide, but I failed to account for the fact that there is no space after the last picket. So my formula included an extra 6 inches of length.
Error Keywords:
 - Logical error
 - Fencepost error
 - Off-by-one error
 - Incorrect formula
Solution:
1) Each picket is 1/2 inch wide.
2) There are 6 inches of space between each pair of pickets.
3) So, the total width of one picket plus one space is 1/2 + 6 = 13/2 inches.
4) For x pickets, there are only x-1 spaces. 
5) The total length in inches is: 
   (number of pickets * width of each picket) + (number of spaces * width of each space)
   = (x * 1/2) + ((x-1) * 6)
   = x/2 + 6x - 6
   = 13x/2 - 6 inches
6) To convert inches to feet, divide by 12:
   (13x/2 - 6) / 12 = (13x - 12) / 24 feet
Therefore, the correct answer is E: (13x-12)/24.
Instructions:
1. Identify the width of each picket.
2. Identify the width of the space between pickets.
3. Calculate the total width of one picket plus one space.
4. Determine the number of spaces for x pickets (it's x-1, not x).
5. Calculate the total length by:
   - Multiplying the number of pickets by the width of each picket
   - Multiplying the number of spaces by the width of each space
   - Adding these two results
6. If needed, convert the total length to the requested units by dividing.
7. Simplify the resulting expression if possible.
8. Select the answer choice that matches your expression.
Advice:
 - Always consider the "fencepost problem" - if you have x posts, you usually only have x-1 spaces between them.
 - Break the problem into parts - calculate the total contribution from the pickets, then the total contribution from the spaces, then add.
 - Remember to do unit conversions at the end if necessary.
 - Simplify your expression to match the answer choices, factoring out common terms.
 - Double-check your work, especially for off-by-one errors.
## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1. Each picket is 1/2 inch wide.
2. The space between each pair of pickets is 6 inches.
3. The total width of one picket plus one space is:
   1/2 + 6 = 13/2 inches
4. For x pickets, there are x-1 spaces. This is the key insight I missed before.
5. The total length in inches is:
   (x pickets * 1/2 inch per picket) + ((x-1) spaces * 6 inches per space)
   = (x * 1/2) + ((x-1) * 6)  
   = x/2 + 6x - 6
   = 13x/2 - 6 inches
6. The question asks for the length in feet, so we divide by 12 to convert from inches to feet:
   (13x/2 - 6) / 12 = (13x - 12) / 24 feet
7. This matches answer choice E.
Therefore, the correct answer is E: (13x-12)/24.
Action: Answer("E")
