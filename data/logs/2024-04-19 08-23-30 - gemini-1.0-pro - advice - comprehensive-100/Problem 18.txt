## System:
You are an expert in Logic.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## User 2:
Topic: Logic
Context: A laboratory has three types of robots, A.B, and C.Type A can recognize colors, type B can recognize shapes, and type C can neither recognize colors nor shapes.The laboratory experimented with robots 1 and 2 with red balls, blue balls, red squares, and blue squares, and ordered them to pick up the red balls, but number 1 picked up the red squares, and number 2 picked up the blue balls.
Question: Based on the above experiment, which of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Both No.1 and No.2 are type C.
  B: Only one of No.1 and No.2 is C type.
  C: No.1 is type A and No.2 is type B.
  D: No.1 is not Type B and No.2 is not Type A.
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Advice:
- Avoid making assumptions that are not explicitly stated.
- Consider all possible scenarios before drawing conclusions.
- Be cautious about eliminating options without sufficient evidence.
- Remember that the absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.
## Assistant 2:
Self-reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly because I made an assumption that was not explicitly stated. I assumed that the robots were only able to recognize one type of object, either colors or shapes. However, the context states that type C robots can recognize neither colors nor shapes. This means that it is possible for a robot to pick up an object that it does not recognize.
In order to answer this question correctly, I need to consider all possible scenarios. There are four possible scenarios:
1. Both No.1 and No.2 are type C.
2. No.1 is type A and No.2 is type B.
3. No.1 is type B and No.2 is type A.
4. No.1 is type C and No.2 is type C.
Scenario 1 is possible because type C robots can recognize neither colors nor shapes. Scenario 2 is possible because type A robots can recognize colors and type B robots can recognize shapes. Scenario 3 is possible because type B robots can recognize shapes and type A robots can recognize colors. Scenario 4 is possible because type C robots can recognize neither colors nor shapes.
The only scenario that is not possible is scenario 1. This is because if both No.1 and No.2 were type C, then they would not be able to pick up any of the objects. However, the context states that No.1 picked up the red squares and No.2 picked up the blue balls. Therefore, both No.1 and No.2 cannot be type C.
The only other scenario that is possible is scenario 2. This is because if No.1 is type A and No.2 is type B, then No.1 would be able to recognize the red balls and No.2 would be able to recognize the blue balls. Therefore, No.1 would pick up the red balls and No.2 would pick up the blue balls.
Therefore, the answer to the question is C: No.1 is type A and No.2 is type B.
Action: Answer("C")
