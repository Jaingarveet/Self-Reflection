## Self-Reflection on Previous Incorrect Answer
**Previous Question:** What is the mode of inheritance for Hypophosphatemic Vitamin D Resistant Rickets (HVDRR)?
**Previous Incorrect Answer:** XR
**Reasoning for Incorrect Answer:** I incorrectly assumed that HVDRR followed an X-linked recessive inheritance pattern due to the presence of "X" in the answer choices.
**Correct Answer:** AD
**Reasoning for Correct Answer:** HVDRR is an autosomal dominant disorder, meaning that only one mutated copy of the gene is needed to cause the disease. This is supported by the fact that both males and females can be affected, and the disease can be passed down from either parent.
**Reflection:**
* I need to be more careful in reading the question and answer choices.
* I should not make assumptions based on limited information.
* I need to review the inheritance patterns of genetic disorders to ensure accurate responses.
