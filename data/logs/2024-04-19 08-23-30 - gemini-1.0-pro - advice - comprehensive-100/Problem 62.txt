## Assistant 2:
Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly because I did not carefully read the question and understand the problem. I also did not decompose the problem into multiple simple steps and think through each subproblem step-by-step. I skipped steps and was not explicit in my reasoning. I did not double-check my calculations and final answer. I also did not remember that substitution involves replacing a variable with an expression that is equivalent to that variable, and that algebraic manipulation involves applying mathematical operations to both sides of an equation to isolate a variable.
I will now use this reflection to help me answer the question correctly.
Step 1: Read the question carefully and understand the problem.
The question is asking for the solution $(x, y)$ to the system of equations above. This means that we need to find the values of $x$ and $y$ that satisfy both equations.
Step 2: Decompose the problem into multiple simple steps.
We can solve this problem by using the substitution method. This method involves solving one equation for one variable in terms of the other variable, and then substituting that expression into the other equation.
Step 3: Think through each subproblem step-by-step.
Let's solve the second equation for $x$ in terms of $y$:
$$2 y-x=-19$$
$$-x=-19-2 y$$
$$x=19+2 y$$
Now, let's substitute this expression for $x$ into the first equation:
$$3 x+4 y=-23$$
$$3 (19+2 y)+4 y=-23$$
$$57+6 y+4 y=-23$$
$$10 y=-80$$
$$y=-8$$
Now that we know $y=-8$, we can substitute this value back into the second equation to solve for $x$:
$$2 y-x=-19$$
$$2 (-8)-x=-19$$
$$-16-x=-19$$
$$-x=-3$$
$$x=3$$
Therefore, the solution to the system of equations is $(x, y)=(3, -8)$.
Step 4: Double-check your calculations and final answer.
We can check our answer by substituting $x=3$ and $y=-8$ into both equations:
$$3 x+4 y=-23$$
$$3 (3)+4 (-8)=-23$$
$$9-32=-23$$
$$-23=-23$$
$$2 y-x=-19$$
$$2 (-8)-3=-19$$
$$-16-3=-19$$
$$-19=-19$$
Therefore, our answer is correct.
