Topic: Law
Context: Economics professor: Marty's Pizza and Checkers Pizza are the two major pizza parlors in our town. Marty's sold coupon books including coupons good for one large plain pizza at any local pizza parlor, at Marty's expense. But Checkers refused to accept these coupons, even though they were redeemed by all other local pizza parlors. Accepting them would have cost Checkers nothing and would have satisfied those of its potential customers who had purchased the coupon books. This shows that Checkers's motive in refusing to accept the coupons was simply to hurt Marty's Pizza.
Question: Which one of the following, if assumed, enables the economics professor's conclusion to be properly drawn?
Choices:
  A: Any company that refuses to accept coupons issued by a competitor when doing so would satisfy some of the company's potential customers is motivated solely by the desire to hurt that competitor.
  B: Any company that wishes to hurt a competitor by refusing to accept coupons issued by that competitor will refuse to accept them even when accepting them would cost nothing and would satisfy its potential customers.
  C: At least one company has refused to accept coupons issued by its major local competitor simply in order to hurt that competitor, even though those coupons were accepted by all other local competitors.
  D: Any company that accepts its major competitor's coupons helps its competitor by doing so, even if it also satisfies its own actual or potential customers.
  E: If accepting coupons issued by a competitor would not enable a company to satisfy its actual or potential customers, then that company's refusal to accept the coupons is motivated by the desire to satisfy customers.

## Self-Reflection
**Previous Incorrect Answer:** C
**Reasoning:** I incorrectly assumed that the professor's conclusion was based on the general principle that any company refusing coupons to hurt a competitor would also refuse them even when it's costless and satisfies customers.
**Correct Answer:** B
**Reasoning:** The professor's conclusion relies on the specific observation that Checkers refused coupons despite it being costless and satisfying customers. This aligns with the principle that a company willing to hurt a competitor would do so even when it's seemingly irrational.
**Key Takeaways:**
* Be cautious of generalizing from specific observations.
* Pay close attention to the context and specific details of the scenario.
* Identify the underlying principle or reasoning behind the conclusion.
## Applying the Learnings
**Analysis of Choices:**
* A: Incorrect. This statement is too broad and doesn't consider the cost-benefit aspect.
* B: Correct. This aligns with the professor's observation about Checkers' behavior.
* C: Incorrect. This statement is true but doesn't directly support the conclusion about Checkers' motive.
* D: Incorrect. Accepting coupons can benefit both companies by attracting customers.
* E: Incorrect. This statement focuses on customer satisfaction, not competitor sabotage.
**Action: Answer("B")**
