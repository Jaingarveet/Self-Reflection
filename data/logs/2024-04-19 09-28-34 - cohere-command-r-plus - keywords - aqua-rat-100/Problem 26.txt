## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:
Topic: Geography
Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")

## Assistant 2:
Reflection: I made a mistake in calculating the area of the rectangle and thus, the side length of the square. The area of the rectangle is 27 cm * 17 cm = 459 sq. cm. The area of the square is the side length squared, so taking the square root of 459 gives approximately 21.4 cm. This is closer to choice B (22 cm) than any other answer.

Thought: The wire forms a rectangle, and when rebent, it forms a square. To find the side of the square, we must ensure the area is conserved. The area of the rectangle is $27 \times 17 = 459$ square cm. So, the area of the square is $\sqrt{459} \approx 21.4$ cm. The closest answer is:
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
