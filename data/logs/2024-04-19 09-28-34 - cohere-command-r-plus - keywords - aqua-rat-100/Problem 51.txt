Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Question: R, S, T, and U are points on a line, and U is the midpoint of line segment ST. If the lengths of line segments RS, RT, and ST are 5, 17, and 22, respectively. What is the length of line segment RU?
Choices:
  A: 6
  B: 7
  C: 8
  D: 9

## Assistant 2:
Reflection: I made a calculation error in my previous attempt. To find the length of RU, I must first find the length of SU, as U is the midpoint of ST. 

[Calculation reflection]

The correct calculation for the length of SU is as follows:
- SU = (ST)/2 = 22/2 = 11

Now, to find RU:
- RT = RU + UT
- 17 = RU + 11
- 17 - 11 = RU
- RU = 6

Therefore, the correct answer is 6, which is choice A.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
