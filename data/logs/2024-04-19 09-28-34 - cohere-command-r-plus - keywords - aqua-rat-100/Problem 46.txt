## Assistant 2:
Reflection: I made an error in setting up the equation. The correct equation is:
X * 0.125 = 3500 * 0.875
0.125X = 3062.5
X = 24500

Thought: 
The amount saved is 12.5% of his income, and the amount spent is Rs. 3500, which is 87.5% of his income. 
So, the equation is: 0.125x = 0.875 * 3500, where x is the monthly income. 
Solving for x, we get x = 24500.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
