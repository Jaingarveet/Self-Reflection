## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Assistant 2:
Thought:
First, we simplify the expression for $x$:

\begin{align*}
x &= \frac{n^2 + 2\sqrt{n}(n + 4) + 16}{n + 4\sqrt{n} + 4} \\
&= \frac{(\sqrt{n})^2 + 2\sqrt{n}(n + 4) + 4^2}{(\sqrt{n})^2 + 4(\sqrt{n}) + 4^1} \\
&= \frac{(\sqrt{n} + 4)^2}{(\sqrt{n} + 2)^2} \\
&= \frac{\sqrt{n} + 4}{\sqrt{n} + 2}
\end{align*}

Now, we find the range of values for $x$. Given that $36 \leq n \leq 72$, we have $6 \leq \sqrt{n} \leq 8$. Plugging in the values, we get:

- When $n = 36$, $x = \frac{6 + 4}{6 + 2} = \frac{5}{4} = 1.25$.
- When $n = 72$, $x = \frac{8 + 4}{8 + 2} = \frac{12}{10} = 1.2$.

So, the range of values for $x$ is $1.2 \leq x \leq 1.25$, which is outside the range given in the answer choices. Therefore, we need to consider the range of values for $\frac{1}{x}$, which is the reciprocal of $x$.

Taking the reciprocal of the simplified expression for $x$, we get:

\[
\frac{1}{x} = \frac{\sqrt{n} + 2}{\sqrt{n} + 4}
\]

Now, we find the range of values for $\frac{1}{x}$:

- When $n = 36$, $\frac{1}{x} = \frac{6 + 2}{6 + 4} = \frac{2}{5} = 0.4$.
- When $n = 72$, $\frac{1}{x} = \frac{8 + 2}{8 + 4} = \frac{5}{6} = 0.83\overline{3}$.

So, the range of values for $\frac{1}{x}$ is $0.4 \leq \frac{1}{x} \leq 0.83\overline{3}$, which corresponds to $20 < x < 54$.
