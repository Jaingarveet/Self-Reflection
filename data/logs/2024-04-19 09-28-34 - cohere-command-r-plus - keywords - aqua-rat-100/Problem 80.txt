## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Let's assume that Jack bought $x$ white sharpeners and $y$ brown sharpeners. We know that:
1. The total number of sharpeners is 18, so $x + y = 18$.
2. The total cost of the sharpeners is ₹100, and Jack pays ₹1 more for each white sharpener than for each brown sharpener. So, the cost can be calculated as:
$x$ white sharpeners at ₹$y + 1$ each $= ₹(y + 1)x$
$y$ brown sharpeners at ₹$y$ each $= ₹yx$
Total cost $= ₹(y + 1)x + ₹yx = ₹100$

Now, we can solve these equations:
From equation 1, we know:
$x + y = 18 \implimplies y = 18 - x$

Substitute the expression for $y$ into equation 2:
$₹(y + 1)x + ₹yx = ₹100$
$₹(18 - x + 1)x + ₹(18 - x)x = ₹100$
$₹19x - x^2 = ₹100$

Rearrange and solve for $x$:
$x^2 + x - 100 = 0$
$x = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 400}}{2}$
$x = \frac{-1 + 20}{2}$ or $x = \frac{-1 - 20}{2}$
$x = 9$ or $x = -11$

Since we're dealing with a positive quantity, we take the positive value:
$x = 9$

Now that we know $x$, we can find $y$:
$y = 18 - x = 18 - 9 = 9$

So, Jack bought 9 white sharpeners and 9 brown sharpeners.
