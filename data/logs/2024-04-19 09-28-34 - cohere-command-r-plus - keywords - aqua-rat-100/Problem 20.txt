## Assistant 2:
Reflection: I made an error in calculating the ratio of boys to girls in the original group, which should be 64:40 or 16:10, or simplified, 4:3. 

Thought: 
Let's call the number of new members x.
The total number of members after the drive = (64+x) boys and (40+x) girls.
We are told the ratio is now 4:3, so:
(64+x):(40+x) = 4:3
Multiplying both sides by (40+x), we get:
4*(64+x) = 3*(40+x)
256 + 4x = 120 + 3x
Combining like terms:
x = 12
The group now has a total of 124 members.
Action: Answer("A")

Agent Answer: A
