## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The total weight of the 10 vehicles is 10 x 12.2 = 122 tons.
After adding the new truck, the total weight increased to (10 + 2.6) x 12.2 = 153.44 tons.
So, the weight of the heavy-duty truck = 153.44 - 122 = 31.44 tons.

I made a calculation error in my previous attempt. I added the increment in weight to the number of vehicles instead of adding it to the total weight.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
