## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
First, we need to find the total weight of the alloy formed. The total weight = 40 + 60 = 100 grams.

Now, we need to find the ratio of zinc to copper in the alloy.

For alloy X: The ratio of zinc to copper is 6:9, which can be simplified to 2:3. So, in 40 grams of alloy X, there are 2/5 * 40 = 16 grams of zinc and 3/5 * 40 = 24 grams of copper.

For alloy Y: The ratio of zinc to copper is 7:11, which simplifies to 7/11. So, in 60 grams of alloy Y, there are 7/18 * 60 = 21 grams of zinc and 11/18 * 60 = 39 grams of copper.

In alloy Z, the total zinc = zinc in X + zinc in Y = 16 + 21 = 37 grams.
The total copper = copper in X + copper in Y = 24 + 39 = 63 grams.

Therefore, in alloy Z, the ratio of zinc to copper is 37:63. To simplify the ratio, we can divide both parts by 1: 1/1 * 37/63 = 1/1 * 7/11 = 7/11.

So, the correct ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z is 7:11.

Choice D is the correct answer.
Action: Answer("D")
