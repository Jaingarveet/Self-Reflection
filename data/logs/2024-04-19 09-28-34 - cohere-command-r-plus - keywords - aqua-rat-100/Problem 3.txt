## Assistant 2:
Reflection: I made an arithmetic error in calculating the side length of the square. 

Correct Solution: 
Let s be the side length of the square. 
After trimming 4 feet, the dimensions of the rectangle are (s - 4) by s feet. 
The diagonal of this rectangle is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs of length (s - 4) and s. 
Using the Pythagorean theorem:
s^2 + (s - 4)^2 = 2 * 70 
Simplifying and solving this equation for s, we find s = 14. 

The perimeter of the original square is 4 * s = 4 * 14 = **56** feet.

Thought: Each triangle has an area of 70 square feet, and they were formed by cutting a rectangle diagonally. 
The rectangle was formed by trimming a square by 4 feet on one edge, so the side length of the square is 4 feet more than the width of the rectangle. 

Let's calculate the dimensions of the rectangle and the resulting triangles: 
Let 's' be the side length of the original square. 
The rectangle has a width of (s - 4) feet and a length of 's' feet. 

Using the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the diagonal of the rectangle, which is also the height of each triangle: 
diagonal^2 = length^2 + width^2 
= s^2 + (s - 4)^2 
= 200 
So, the diagonal length is 10 feet. 

Now we can find the base of each triangle: 
base * height = half the area of the rectangle 
base * 10 = 70 
base = 7 feet. 

The perimeter of the original square is 4s, and s = diagonal^2 / 2 = 100, so the perimeter is 400/4 = **100** feet.
Action: Answer("A")
