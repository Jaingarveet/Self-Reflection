## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Let's say X people attended the picnic.
Each person was supposed to contribute 96/X rupees, but since 4 people were missing, each person had to contribute 4 rupees extra, so 96/X + 4.
We know this amount equals 100 rupees, so:

96/X + 4 = 100

Combining like terms:

96/X = 96

 X = 12

So, 12 people attended the picnic.
Action: Answer("B")
