## Assistant 2:
Reflection: I made a calculation error last time as I calculated 30% of 20 matches, rather than 30% of the total number of matches (won and lost).

Thought: 
The team won 20 matches, so they played a total of 20 + number of matches lost. 
30% of the total matches = 0.30 x (20 + number of matches lost)
6 matches = 0.30 x number of matches lost
Number of matches lost = 6 / 0.30 = **20** matches.
Action: Answer("E")
## Result:
Agent Answer: E
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
