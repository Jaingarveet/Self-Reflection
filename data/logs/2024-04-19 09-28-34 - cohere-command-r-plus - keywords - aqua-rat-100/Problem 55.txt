## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Assistant 2:
Reflection: The previous answer was incorrect because I made an algebraic error. 
The correct way to solve this is to use the formula Speed = Distance/Time. 
First, I calculated the speed of the current. 
Then, I could find the speed of the man rowing along with the current by adding the speed of the current to the speed of the man rowing in still water. 

Thought: 
The speed of the current can be calculated as the difference between the speed in still water and the speed against the current: 
Current speed = 4 kmph - 2 kmph = 2 kmph

Therefore, the man's rate along the current is 4 kmph + 2 kmph = 6 kmph.
Action: Answer("B")
