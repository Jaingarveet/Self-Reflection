## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Let's denote John's amount of money as $x$.

First, we can set up and solve the equation for the statement "If you give me half your money, I will have Rs.75."

$\frac{x}{2} + \frac{x}{2} = 75$
$x = 150$

Now, we can set up and solve the equation for the statement "if you give me one-third of your money, I will have Rs.75."

$\frac{150}{3} = 50$

John would need to give away Rs.50, so he started with Rs.100.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
