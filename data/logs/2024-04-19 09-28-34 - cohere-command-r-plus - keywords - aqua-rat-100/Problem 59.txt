Question: 20 marbles were pulled out of a bag of only white marbles, painted black, and then put back in. Then, another 20 marbles were pulled out, of which 1 was black, after which they were all returned to the bag. If the percentage of black marbles pulled out the second time represents their percentage in the bag, how many marbles in total Q does the bag currently hold?
Choices:
  A: 40
  B: 200
  C: 380
  D: 400
  E: 3200

Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Error Keywords:
- Data misinterpretation
- Inattention to detail
- Arithmetic error
## Assistant 2:
Reflection: I made an arithmetic error in my previous attempt. The probability of pulling out a black marble remains 1/20 after the second draw, which means that there must still be only 2 black marbles in the bag. Thus, there are a total of 20+2=22 marbles in the bag. The correct answer is D: 40.

Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
