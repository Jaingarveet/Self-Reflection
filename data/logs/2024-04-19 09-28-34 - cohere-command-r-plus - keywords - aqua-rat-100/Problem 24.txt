## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")

Topic: Math
Question: An exam is given in a certain class. The average (arithmetic mean) of the highest score and the lowest score is equal to x. If the average score for the entire class is equal to y and there are z students in the class, where z > 5, then in terms of x, y, and z, what is the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers?
Choices:
  A: (zy – 2x)/z
  B: (zy – 2)/z
  C: (zx – y)/(z – 2)
  D: (zy – 2x)/(z -2)
  E: (zy – x)/(z + 2)

## Assistant 2:
Reflection: I made an assumption that the highest and lowest scores were the same, which led to treating x as a single value rather than the average of two values. The correct approach should involve recognizing that the average of the highest and lowest scores means there are two values that need to be accounted for.

Thought: 
The highest and lowest scores have an average of x, so they add up to 2x. Excluding these two scores, the sum of the remaining scores is zy - 2x. With z students in total, the average excluding the highest and lowest scorers is (zy - 2x) / (z - 2).
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
