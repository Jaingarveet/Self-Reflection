## Assistant 2:
Reflection: I made a miscalculation in my previous attempt. I correctly calculated Alex's toy-making rate and the total number of hours worked but miscalculated Jacob's rate, which led to an incorrect number of toys made by him. I need to be more careful with the numbers and double-check my calculations.

Thought: 
Alex's rate = 1 toy/7 hours
Jacob's rate = 1 toy/9 hours
Total toys = 35
Let the total hours worked be 'x' hours.

(7/7) * x = 35/2
x = 24.5 hours

Jacob's contribution = (24.5/9) * 1 = 16 toys
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
