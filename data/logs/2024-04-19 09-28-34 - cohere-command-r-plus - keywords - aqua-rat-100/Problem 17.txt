Question: A company produces 420 units of a particular computer component every month, at a production cost to the company of $110 per component, and sells all of the components by the end of each month.

  A: 226
  B: 230
  C: 240
  D: 260

## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The company wants to make a profit of $626,400 in a year, which is equivalent to $626,400 / 12 = $52,200 per month.

The production cost of each component is $110, so the selling price must be at least $110 + $52,200 = $162.20 per component for the company to reach its desired monthly profit.

Therefore, the minimum selling price per component is $160.

Choice B, $230, is the closest answer to $160, so the answer is B.

Reflection on previous error: I made a calculation error in my previous attempt. I incorrectly calculated the break-even price per component instead of considering the profit margin. To make a profit of $52,200 per month, the revenue must exceed the production costs by this amount.

Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
