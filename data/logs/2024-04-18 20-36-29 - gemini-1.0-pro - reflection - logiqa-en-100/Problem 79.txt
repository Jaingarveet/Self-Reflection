## System:
You are an expert in Logic.
You have incorrectly answered the following multiple-choice question.
Your task is to reflect on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
You will then use this information help you answer the same question in the future.
First, explain why you answered the question incorrectly.
Second, list the keywords that describe the type of your errors from most general to most specific. 
Third, solve the problem again, step-by-step, based on your knowledge of the correct answer.
Fourth, create a list of detailed instructions to help you correctly solve this problem in the future.
Finally, create a list of general advice to help you solve similar types of problems in the future.  
Be concise in your response; however, capture all of the essential information.  
For guidance, I will provide you with a single generic example problem and reflection (below).

Topic: Geography and Math
Question: What is the product of the number of letters contained in the name of the city where Iowa State University is located multiplied by the number of letters contained in the name of the state?
Choices:
    A: 16
    B: 20
    C: 24
    D: 32
Thought:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
ISU is located in the state of Iowa.
Action: Answer("D")
---
Correct Answer: A
## Assistant 1:
Explanation:
I miscalculated the product of the number of letters in the city and state names. 
The gap in my knowledge was not in geography but in basic arithmetic. 
I knew the correct city and state but made a calculation error.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Arithmetic error
 - Multiplication error
Solution:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
Iowa State University is located in the state of Iowa.
The city name "Ames" contains 4 letters.
The state name "Iowa" contains 4 letters.
The product of 4*4 is 16.
Instructions:
1. Identify the city where the university is located.
2. Identify the state where the university is located.
3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.
4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.
5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.
6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.
7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them.

Topic: Logic
Context: There must be an outside world, because if there is something outside me that can shine or reflect, shining the light into my eyes, which gives me a visual experience, I ca nâ€™t see the buildings, the crowds and the stars these things.And, not only have visual experience like me, but others also have such visual experience; book knowledge also tells us repeatedly that there is an outside world outside of us.
Question: Which of the following does not constitute doubt or rebuttal to the above argument?
Choices:
  A: To use sensory evidence to explain the existence of the external world requires presupposing the existence of the external world in the mind.
  B: How do you prove that others have similar visual experience to you?
  C: Since the visual experience is reliable, Mirage is not a so-called illusion, but a real existence.
  D: If there is no external world and natural science knowledge is not a true reflection of it, then why does natural science achieve such great success in practice?

Thought: 
The argument claims that the existence of an external world is proven by visual experiences and scientific knowledge.
Option A points out a circular reasoning in the argument.
Option B questions the reliability of visual experiences.
Option C is irrelevant to the argument.
Option D supports the argument.
Action: Answer("A")

 --- 
Correct Answer: D
## Assistant 2:
Response:
Explanation:
I incorrectly identified option D as supporting the argument when it actually strengthens the argument for the existence of an external world.
Error Keywords:
 - Misinterpretation of argument
 - Failure to identify supporting evidence
Solution:
The argument claims that the existence of an external world is proven by visual experiences and scientific knowledge.
Option A points out a circular reasoning in the argument.
Option B questions the reliability of visual experiences.
Option C is irrelevant to the argument.
Option D strengthens the argument by pointing out the success of natural science in practice, which would be difficult to explain without an external world.
Instructions:
1. Carefully read the argument and identify its main claim.
2. Analyze each option to determine whether it supports, weakens, or is irrelevant to the argument.
3. Be cautious of options that appear to support the argument but actually strengthen it.
4. Consider the implications of each option in relation to the main claim of the argument.
5. Choose the option that most clearly constitutes doubt or rebuttal to the argument.
Advice:
 - Pay close attention to the wording of the argument and the answer choices.
 - Consider the logical structure of the argument and how each option interacts with it.
 - Be wary of options that seem intuitively appealing but do not directly address the argument.
 - Remember that the goal is to identify the option that casts doubt on or refutes the argument, not necessarily the option that is most obviously wrong.
