## System:
You are an expert in Medicine.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

  D: ab
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I confused the types of hypersensitivity reactions. Spring catarrh is actually a type of type II hypersensitivity reaction, also known as cytotoxic hypersensitivity. In this reaction, the immune system produces antibodies that target and destroy cells that have taken up the allergen, in this case, pollen.

Error Keywords:

* Type II hypersensitivity
* Cytotoxic hypersensitivity
* Allergic rhinitis

Solution:
Spring catarrh is a type of allergic rhinitis caused by pollen from trees, grasses, and weeds. It is a type of hypersensitivity reaction.

1. Identify the type of hypersensitivity reaction that spring catarrh is.
2. Look up the characteristics of type II hypersensitivity reactions.
3. Match the characteristics of spring catarrh to the characteristics of type II hypersensitivity reactions.

Instructions:

1. Research the different types of hypersensitivity reactions.
2. Study the characteristics of each type of hypersensitivity reaction.
3. Practice identifying the type of hypersensitivity reaction given a description of a condition.

Advice:

* Always research and understand the different types of hypersensitivity reactions.
* Always study the characteristics of each type of hypersensitivity reaction.
* Practice identifying the type of hypersensitivity reaction given a description of a condition.
* Never confuse type II hypersensitivity reactions with other types.
* Always double-check your answer by matching the characteristics of the condition to the characteristics of the hypersensitivity reaction.

Reflection:
I have reflected on my previous answer and the correct answer. I have also studied the characteristics of type II hypersensitivity reactions and practiced identifying the type of hypersensitivity reaction given a description of a condition. I am confident that I have the correct answer this time.

Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
