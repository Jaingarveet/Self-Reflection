Question: 60-year-old male complaints of right-sided nasal obstruction and nasal discharge, which sometimes is blood tinged. Biopsy finding is also shown below. What is your diagnosis?
Choices:
  A: Rhinoscleroma
  B: Wegener's granulomatosis
  C: Stewa's granuloma
  D: Rhinosporidiosis
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I incorrectly diagnosed the patient with Rhinoscleroma.
The patient's symptoms and biopsy results are actually consistent with Rhinosporidiosis.
I was not familiar with the term "Stewa's granuloma" and mistakenly thought it was a type of granuloma that could cause nasal obstruction and discharge.
I was also not familiar with the term "Wegener's granulomatosis" and its association with nasal symptoms.
Error Keywords:
- Lack of knowledge
- Misinformation
- Unfamiliarity with medical terms
Solution:
A 60-year-old male presents with right-sided nasal obstruction and nasal discharge, which sometimes is blood-tinged.
The patient's symptoms and biopsy results are consistent with Rhinosporidiosis.
Instructions:
1. Review the patient's symptoms and medical history.
2. Conduct a thorough physical examination.
3. Order appropriate diagnostic tests, such as a nasal endoscopy or biopsy.
4. Research and familiarize yourself with uncommon conditions that may cause nasal symptoms, such as Rhinosporidiosis.
5. Consider all possible diagnoses and their characteristics, including symptoms, medical history, and test results.
6. Use differential diagnosis to rule out other possible conditions.
7. Choose the most likely diagnosis based on the patient's symptoms and test results.
Advice:
- Always keep an open mind and consider all possible diagnoses.
- Never underestimate the importance of a thorough physical examination and diagnostic testing.
- Stay up-to-date on uncommon conditions and their characteristics.
- Familiarize yourself with medical terms and their meanings.
- Use differential diagnosis to rule out other possible conditions.
