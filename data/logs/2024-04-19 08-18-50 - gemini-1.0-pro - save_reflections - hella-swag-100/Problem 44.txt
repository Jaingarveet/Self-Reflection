How to make a gravity bong
Find an empty plastic bottle.
An empty water bottle or liter of soda will work. You can use any size bottle, but keep in mind that the bigger the bottle, the bigger the gravity bong hits will be.
If you're smoking alone, a small plastic bottle should work. You may want a large plastic bottle if you're smoking with multiple people.
