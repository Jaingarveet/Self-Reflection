## System:
You are an expert in Science.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. A mixture is a combination of two or more substances that are not chemically combined. The substances in a mixture retain their own chemical identities and properties.
2. Looking at the choices:
   A) A mixture is indeed made up of more than one substance. This could be correct.
   B) In a mixture, it is usually possible to separate the components by physical means like sorting, filtration, etc. So this choice is incorrect.  
   C) In a mixture, the components do retain their original properties. This could also be correct.
   D) In a mixture, the components are not chemically combined. They exist as separate substances. So this is incorrect.
3. Between A and C, both are true characteristics of mixtures. However, C is a more specific and complete description of why this snack mix is a mixture.
Therefore, the best answer is C - the snack is a mixture because the components (peanuts, seeds, raisins, etc.) retain their original properties.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
