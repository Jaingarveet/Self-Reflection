Question: The greatest common factor of two positive integers is 11. The least common multiple of these two integers is 7700. If one of the integers is 350, what is the other?
Choices:
  A: 242
  B: 308
  C: 352
  D: 412
  E: 456
## Assistant 2:
  Great, let's solve this problem step by step!

The greatest common factor (GCF) of two positive integers is 11. So, we can divide both integers by their GCF to simplify the problem.

Let's say the smaller integer is x. Then, the larger integer is 3x.

The least common multiple (LCM) of 3x and x is 7700.

So, we can write:

3x × x = 7700

Now, we can simplify this equation by multiplying both sides by 3:

x × x = 23100

Now, we can find the value of x by dividing both sides by 2:

x = 11550

Now, we can find the value of the other integer by using the fact that the GCF of 3x and x is 11:

3x = 31550

So, the other integer is 31550.

Action: Answer("B")
