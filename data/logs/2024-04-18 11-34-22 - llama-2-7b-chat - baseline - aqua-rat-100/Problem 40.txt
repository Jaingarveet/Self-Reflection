Question: Mark told John "If you give me half your money I will have Rs.75. John said, "if you give me one third of your money, I will have Rs.75/-. How much money did John have ?
Choices:
  A: 22
  B: 60
  C: 28
  D: 26
  E: 18
## Assistant 2:
  Thought: Let's analyze the problem step by step.

John said, "if you give me one third of your money, I will have Rs.75/-."

So, if John has Rs.75, then Mark giving him half of his money will give John Rs.75/2 = Rs.37.50.

Now, we are given two statements:

1. Mark will have Rs.75 if he gives John one third of his money.
2. John will have Rs.37.50 if Mark gives him half of his money.

We can set up a proportion to relate these two statements:

Mark's money = John's money / 3

Solving for John's money, we get:

John's money = Mark's money x 3
John's money = Rs.75 x 3
John's money = Rs.225

So, John had Rs.225.

Action: Answer("C")
