Question: 20 marbles were pulled out of a bag of only white marbles, painted black, and then put back in. Then, another 20 marbles were pulled out, of which 1 was black, after which they were all returned to the bag. If the percentage of black marbles pulled out the second time represents their percentage in the bag, how many marbles in total Q does the bag currently hold?

  Great, let's solve this problem step by step!

Question: If the percentage of black marbles pulled out the second time represents their percentage in the bag, how many marbles in total Q does the bag currently hold?

Let's analyze the given information:

* 20 marbles were pulled out of the bag the first time, and 1 of them was black.
* The percentage of black marbles in the first pull was 1/20 = 0.05.
* Then, 20 more marbles were pulled out, including 1 black marble.
* The percentage of black marbles in the second pull was 1/20 = 0.05 again.

Now, we need to find the total number of marbles in the bag. Let's use the information given in the question:

* The total number of marbles in the bag is 20 + 20 = 40 marbles.

So, the total number of marbles in the bag currently is:

Q = 40 + (0.05 \* 40) = 40 + 2 = 42 marbles.

Therefore, the answer is (D) 400 marbles.
