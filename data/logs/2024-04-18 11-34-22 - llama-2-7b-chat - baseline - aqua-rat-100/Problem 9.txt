## Assistant 2:
  Great, let's solve this problem step by step!

The grocer makes a 25% profit on the selling price of each bag of flour, so the profit per bag is 25% of $100, which is $25.

If the grocer makes $3,000 in profit, then the total number of bags sold is:

Profit = Number of bags sold x Profit per bag
= $3,000 x 25%
= 750 bags

So, the answer is (C) 24 bags.

Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
