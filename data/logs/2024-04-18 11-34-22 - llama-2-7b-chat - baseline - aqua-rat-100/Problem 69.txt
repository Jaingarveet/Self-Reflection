Question: A bookshelf contains 45 books, 30 of which are hardcover and 20 of which are fiction. What is the maximum number of books that are both hardcover and fiction?
Choices:
  A: 10
  B: 15
  C: 18
  D: 20
  E: 30
## Assistant 2:
  Thought: To find the maximum number of books that are both hardcover and fiction, we need to use the information that 30 of the books are hardcover and 20 are fiction.

Let's assume that the maximum number of books that are both hardcover and fiction is x.

We know that the total number of books is 45, so the number of hardcover books plus the number of fiction books must be less than or equal to 45.

So, the equation is: 30 + x = 45

Now, we can solve for x:

x = 15

Therefore, the maximum number of books that are both hardcover and fiction is 15.

Action: Answer("B")
