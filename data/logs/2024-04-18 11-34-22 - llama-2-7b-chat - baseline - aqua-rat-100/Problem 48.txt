Question: At Daifu university, 24% of all students are members of both a chess club and a swim team. If 20% of members of the swim team are not members of the chess club, what percentage of all Daifu students are members of the swim team?
Choices:
  A: 20%
  B: 30%
  C: 40%
  D: 50%
  E: 60%
## Assistant 2:
 Thought: Let's use the information given in the question to find the percentage of Daifu students who are members of the swim team.

If 24% of all students are members of both the chess club and the swim team, then the number of students who are members of the swim team is 24% of the total number of students.

If 20% of members of the swim team are not members of the chess club, then the number of students who are members of the swim team and are also members of the chess club is 20% of the total number of students.

So, the number of students who are members of the swim team is:
24% - 20% = 4%

Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
