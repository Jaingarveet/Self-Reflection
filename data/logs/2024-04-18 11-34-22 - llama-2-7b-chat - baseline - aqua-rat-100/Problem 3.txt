Question: A square piece of cloth is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge to form a rectangular piece, which is then cut diagonally in half to create two triangles. If the area of each of triangle is 70 square feet, what was the perimeter (in feet) of the original piece of square cloth?
Choices:
  A: 56
  B: 58
  C: 60
  D: 62
  E: 64
## Assistant 2:
  Great, let's solve this problem step by step!

The problem states that a square piece of cloth is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge to form a rectangular piece. The area of the original square piece is equal to the area of the resulting rectangular piece, since the square shape is preserved.

So, the area of the original square piece is 70 square feet.

The problem also states that the rectangular piece is then cut diagonally in half to create two triangles. The area of each triangle is also 70 square feet.

Since the triangles are symmetrical, we can assume that the length of each triangle is half the length of the original rectangular piece.

So, the length of the original rectangular piece is 4 feet longer than the length of each triangle.

Now, we can use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle to find the perimeter of the original rectangular piece:

Perimeter = 2(length + width)

Since the width of the original rectangular piece is half the length, we can substitute these values:

Perimeter = 2(4 + 2) = 20 feet

Therefore, the answer is (B) 58 feet.
