Question: Two cars start at the same time from opposite ends of a highway that is 50 miles long. One car is riding at 12 mph and the second car is riding at 13 mph. How long after they begin will they meet?
Choices:
  A:  1
  B:  1.25
  C:  1.50
  D:  1.75
  E:  2
## Assistant 2:
  Great, let's solve this problem!

We know that the two cars start at opposite ends of a 50-mile highway, and they are traveling at different speeds. The car traveling at 12 mph will cover 12 miles in 1 hour, since the speed is constant. The car traveling at 13 mph will cover 13 miles in 1 hour, since the speed is also constant.

To find the time it takes for the cars to meet, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

For the car traveling at 12 mph, the time it takes to cover 50 miles is:

Time = 50 miles / 12 mph = 4.17 hours (Answer: B)

For the car traveling at 13 mph, the time it takes to cover 50 miles is:

Time = 50 miles / 13 mph = 3.85 hours (Answer: C)

So, the cars will meet after 4.17 hours (Answer: B) and 3.85 hours (Answer: C).
## Result:
Agent Answer: None
Correct Answer: E
Score: 0
