Topic: Math
Question: [5 + ? × 19 - 15 - 7]/[13 × 13 - 156] = 6
Choices:
  A: 4
  B: 4.5
  C: 5
  D: 5.5
  E: 6.5
## Assistant 2:
  Thought: To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS):

1. Multiply 5 and 19: 5 × 19 = 95
2. Subtract 15: 95 - 15 = 80
3. Subtract 7: 80 - 7 = 73
4. Divide 73 by the result of step 2: 73 / 80 = 0.9125

So, the answer is B: 4.5.

Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
