Question: The monthly salary S of a shop assistant is the sum of a fixed salary of $500 plus 5% of all monthly sales. What should the monthly sales be so that her monthly salary reaches $1500?
Choices:
  A: $50000
  B: $40000
  C: $30000
  D: $20000
  E: None of these
## Assistant 2:
 Thought: To find the monthly sales that will result in a monthly salary of $1500, we need to use the given formula:

Monthly salary = fixed salary + (monthly sales x percentage)

We know the fixed salary is $500, and we want the monthly salary to be $1500. So, we can set up the equation:

$500 + (monthly sales x 5%) = $1500

Now, we need to solve for the monthly sales. We can do this by isolating the monthly sales term on one side of the equation:

$500 + (monthly sales x 5%) = $1500

Subtracting $500 from both sides gives us:

$500 + (monthly sales x 5%) = $1000

Now, we can divide both sides by 5% to find the monthly sales:

$500 + (monthly sales x 5%) = $1000

$500 + (monthly sales x 5%) / 5% = $1000

Monthly sales = $20,000

Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
