Question: A shopkeeper employed a servant at a monthly salary of 1500. In addition to it, he agreed to pay him a commission of 15% on the monthly sale. How much sale in Rupees should the servant do if he wants his monthly income as 6000?
Choices:
  A: 30000
  B: 415000
  C: 31500
  D: 50000
  E: None of these
## Assistant 2:
  Thought: To find the minimum sale required for the servant to earn a monthly income of 6000, we need to calculate the total amount the shopkeeper will pay the servant.

Total amount = Monthly salary + Commission on monthly sale
= 1500 + (15% of monthly sale)

To find the monthly sale, we can set up the following equation:

Total amount = Monthly sale

Now, we can solve for the monthly sale by substituting the values given in the question:

1500 + (15% of monthly sale) = 6000

1500 + 900 = 6000

900 = 6000 - 1500

600 = 4500

Therefore, the minimum sale required for the servant to earn a monthly income of 6000 is 4500.

Action: Answer("C")

Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: A
