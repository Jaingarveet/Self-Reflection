Question: Silu and Meenu were walking on the road.
Silu said, "I weigh 51 Kgs. How much do you weigh?"
Meenu replied that she wouldn't reveal her weight directly as she is overweight.
But she said, "I weigh 29 Kgs plus half of my weight. "How much does Meenu weigh?
Choices:
  A: 12
  B: 28
  C: 27
  D: 58
  E: 91
## Assistant 2:
  Thought: Let's use the information given in the problem to find Meenu's weight.
Meenu said that she weighs 29 Kgs plus half of her weight, which means she weighs 29 + (1/2)x, where x is her weight.
We know that Silu weighs 51 Kgs, so Meenu's weight is half of Silu's weight plus 29 Kgs.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
