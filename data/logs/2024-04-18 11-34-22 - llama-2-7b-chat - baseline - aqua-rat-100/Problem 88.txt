Question: A train running at a speed of 100 miles/hour, takes 10 hours to reach its destination. After covering quarter of the distance, it starts raining and the train has to be slowed to speed of 75 miles/hour. What is the total journey duration?
Choices:
  A: 10
  B: 11.5
  C: 12.5
  D: 13.5
  E: 15
## Assistant 2:
 Thought: 
The train's speed is reduced to 75 miles/hour after covering a quarter of the distance, which means it covers the remaining distance at a speed of 75 miles/hour.
The total distance traveled by the train is half of the total distance, which is equal to the distance traveled before the rain plus the distance traveled after the rain.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
