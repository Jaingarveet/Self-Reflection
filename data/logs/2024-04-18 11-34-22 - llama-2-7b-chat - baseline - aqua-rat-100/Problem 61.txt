Question: Kevin drove from A to B at a constant speed of 70 mph. Once he reached B, he turned right around with pause, and returned to A at a constant speed of 90 mph. Exactly 3 hours before the end of his trip, he was still approaching B, only 70 miles away from it. What is the distance between A and B?
Choices:
  A: 180
  B: 90
  C: 270
  D: 360
  E: None of the above
## Assistant 2:
  Great, let's solve this problem step by step!

We know that Kevin drove from A to B at a constant speed of 70 mph, so the distance between A and B is:

Distance = Speed x Time = 70 mph x 3 hours = 210 miles

Now, we are told that Kevin turned right around and returned to A at a constant speed of 90 mph. So, the time it took him to return to A is:

Time = Distance / Speed = 210 miles / 90 mph = 2.33 hours

We are also given that exactly 3 hours before the end of his trip, he was still approaching B, only 70 miles away from it. So, we can set up the following equation:

70 miles + 3 hours = x miles + 3 hours (where x is the distance between A and B)

Solving for x, we get:

x = 280 miles

Therefore, the distance between A and B is 280 miles.

Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
