Topic: Math
Question: A car is being driven, in a straight line and at a uniform speed, towards the base of a vertical tower. The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower?
Choices:
  A: 5(√3 + 1)
  B: 6(√3 + √2)
  C: 7(√3 – 1)
  D: 8(√3 – 2)
  E: None of these
## Assistant 2:
 Thought: The car is moving at a uniform speed, so the distance traveled in 10 minutes is equal to the speed multiplied by the time.
The angle of elevation changes from 45° to 60°, so the height of the tower is increasing at a rate of 15° per 10 minutes.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
