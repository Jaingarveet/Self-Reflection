Question: While selling a watch, a shopkeeper gives a discount of 5%. If he gives a discount of 7%, he earns Rs. 15 less as profit. The marked price of the watch is:
Choices:
  A: Rs. 697.50
  B: Rs. 712.50

  E: Rs. 780
## Assistant 2:
  Thought: Let's analyze the situation:

If the shopkeeper gives a discount of 5%, he will earn a profit of 5% of the marked price, which is Rs. 15.
So, the marked price of the watch is:

Marked price = Rs. 15 / (1 - 0.05) = Rs. 15 / 0.95 = Rs. 15.79

Action: Answer("B")
