Question: A hollow cube of size 5cm is taken, with the thickness of 1cm. It is made of smaller cubes of size 1cm .If the outer surface of the cube is painted how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted?
Choices:
  A: 438
  B: 550
  C: 500
  D: 450
  E: 498
## Assistant 2:
 Thought: The hollow cube has a size of 5cm, and the thickness is 1cm, making the volume of the cube 5cm x 5cm x 1cm = 25 cubic centimeters (cm³).
Since the cube is made of smaller cubes of size 1cm, the number of smaller cubes that can fit inside the hollow cube is 25 cm³ / 1 cm³ = 25.
The outer surface of the cube is painted, so the number of faces of the smaller cubes that remain unpainted is 25 - 6 (faces of the smaller cubes that are not painted) = 19.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: A
