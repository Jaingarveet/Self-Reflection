Question: John likes to have lightly flavored tea every evening. In a 50% strong milk tea, he replaces 15% of it with milk twice. Then, he replaces 10 percent of the resultant solution with more milk.
What is the final concentration of tea John drinks?
Choices:
  A: 15.38%
  B: 42%
  C: 39.86%
  D: 22.35%
  E: 32.51%
## Assistant 2:
  Thought:
John starts with a 50% strong milk tea, which means the original concentration of tea is 50%.

Step 1: John replaces 15% of the tea with milk, which means he dilutes the tea by 15%. So, the concentration of tea after this step is 50% x 0.85 = 42.5%.

Step 2: John replaces 10% of the resultant solution with more milk. This means he dilutes the tea further by 10%. So, the concentration of tea after this step is 42.5% x 0.9 = 38.75%.

Therefore, the final concentration of tea that John drinks is 38.75%.

Action: Answer("C")
