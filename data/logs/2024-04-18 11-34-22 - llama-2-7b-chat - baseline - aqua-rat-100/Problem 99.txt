Question: Let A and B be independent events with P (A) = 0.2 and P(B) = 0.8. Find P(A/B)?
Choices:
  A: 0.2
  B: 0.4
  C: 0.6
  D: 1.2
  E: 1.5
## Assistant 2:
  Great, let's work through this problem together!

The probability of an event A occurring given that event B has occurred is denoted as P(A/B).

We are given that A and B are independent events, so we can use the formula for conditional probability:

P(A/B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B)

We are also given the probabilities of A and B occurring:

P(A) = 0.2 and P(B) = 0.8

Now, we need to find the probability of both events A and B occurring together. We can do this by multiplying the probabilities of each event occurring:

P(A ∩ B) = P(A) × P(B) = 0.2 × 0.8 = 0.16

Now, we can plug this value into the formula for conditional probability:

P(A/B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B) = 0.16 / 0.8 = 0.2

So, the probability of event A occurring given that event B has occurred is 0.2.

The answer is (B): 0.2.
