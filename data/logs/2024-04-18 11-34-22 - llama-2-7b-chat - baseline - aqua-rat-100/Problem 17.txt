Question: A company produces 420 units of a particular computer component every month, at a production cost to the company of $110 per component, and sells all of the components by the end of each month. What is the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee that the yearly profit (revenue from sales minus production costs) will be at least $626,400 ?
Choices:
  A: 226
  B: 230
  C: 240
  D: 260
  E: 280
## Assistant 2:
  Great, let's solve this problem step by step!

The production cost per component is $110, and the company produces 420 units per month. So, the total production cost per month is:

420 units x $110 per unit = $46,800 per month

The company sells all the components by the end of each month, so the total revenue per month is:

420 units x selling price per unit = $46,800 per month

To guarantee a yearly profit of at least $626,400, we need to find the selling price per component that will result in a yearly revenue of at least:

$626,400 = 12 x $51,300 (since there are 12 months in a year)

Now, we can set up an equation based on the information given:

Revenue per month = Production cost per month

So, we can solve for the selling price per component:

Selling price per component = Revenue per month / Production cost per month

Substituting the values given in the question:

Selling price per component = $46,800 / $110 per unit = 426

So, the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee a yearly profit of at least $626,400 is:

Answer: B - 230

Therefore, the company should sell the components for at least $230 per unit to ensure a yearly profit of at least $626,400.
