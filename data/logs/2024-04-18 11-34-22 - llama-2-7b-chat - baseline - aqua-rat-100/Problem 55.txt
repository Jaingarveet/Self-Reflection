Question: If a man rows at the rate of 4 kmph in still water and his rate against the current is 2 kmph, then the man's rate along the current is:
Choices:
  A: 15 kmph
  B: 6 kmph
  C: 12 kmph
  D: 14 kmph
  E: 6 kmph
## Assistant 2:
 Thought: Let's analyze the problem step by step.
The man rows at a rate of 4 kmph in still water, which means he covers a distance of 4 km in 1 hour.
Now, if the current is flowing at a rate of 2 kmph, the man's rate against the current is also 2 kmph.
So, the distance he covers in 1 hour against the current is also 4 km.
Now, we need to find the man's rate along the current.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: E
Score: 0
