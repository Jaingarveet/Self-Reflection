Question: In a large forest, 300 deer were caught, tagged, and returned during 2001. During 2002, 500 deer were caught at random, of which only 20 had tags from the previous year. If the percent of deer in the forest that had tags during the second year and were caught in the 500 deer sample is representative of the percent of the total deer population in the forest with tags, what is the total deer population in the forest (assuming no change in population between 2001 and 2002)?
Choices:
  A: 300
  B: 500
  C: 5000
  D: 6000
  E: 7500
## Assistant 2:
  Great, let's work through this problem together!

So, we know that in 2001, 300 deer were caught, tagged, and returned. And in 2002, 500 deer were caught at random, of which only 20 had tags from the previous year.

To find the total deer population in the forest, we need to use the information that the percent of deer in the forest that had tags during the second year and were caught in the 500 deer sample is representative of the percent of the total deer population in the forest with tags.

Let's call the total deer population in the forest "x".

The proportion of deer in the forest with tags is the same in both years, so the number of deer with tags in the second year is also proportional to the total deer population in the forest.

So, the number of deer with tags in the second year is:

500 (deer caught in 2002) = 0.2x (total deer population in forest with tags)

Now, we can solve for "x" by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.2:

x = 5000

So, the total deer population in the forest is 5000.

Action: Answer("C")
