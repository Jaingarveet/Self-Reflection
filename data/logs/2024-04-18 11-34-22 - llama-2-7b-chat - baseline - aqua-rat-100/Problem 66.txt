## Assistant 2:
 Thought:
The club consists of members whose ages are in A.P. with a common difference of 3 months.
The youngest member is 7 years old, and the sum of the ages of all the members is 250.
Action:
Let the age of the nth member be x.
Then, the age of the (n+1)th member is x + 3.
The sum of the ages of all the members is:
x + (x + 3) + (x + 6) + ... + (x + 250) = 250

Combine like terms:
x + (x + 3) + (x + 6) + ... + (x + 250) = 250

The formula for an A.P. is:
a1 + a2 + ... + an = n(n + 1)(n + 2)/6

Substitute the values:
a1 = x, a2 = x + 3, a3 = x + 6, ..., an = x + 250

n = 18

Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
