Choices:
  A: 750

## Assistant 2:
 Thought: 
To find the amount Rahul will pay to clear the debt after 4 years with 6% per annum simple interest, we can use the formula:
A = P x R x T
Where:
A = amount paid
P = principal amount borrowed (Rs. 500 in this case)
R = interest rate per annum (6% in this case)
T = time in years (4 years in this case)

Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
