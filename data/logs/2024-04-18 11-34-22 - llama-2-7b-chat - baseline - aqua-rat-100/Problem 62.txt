Question: On a normal day Bill usually averages about 15 mph when riding his bicycle. On a windy day, his speed is reduced by 4 mph. How far can Bill travel on a windy day in 21 minutes? Round to the nearest hundredth.
Choices:
  A: 2 miles
  B: 2.25 miles
  C: 3.25 miles
  D: 3.85 miles
  E: 2.85 miles
## Assistant 2:
 Thought:
Bill's average speed on a normal day is 15 mph, and on a windy day, his speed is reduced by 4 mph. To find the distance traveled in 21 minutes, we need to calculate the total time taken to travel a certain distance at a reduced speed.

Action:
Let's first calculate the time taken to travel a distance of 1 mile at a reduced speed of 11 mph (15 mph - 4 mph).

Time = Distance / Speed = 1 mile / 11 mph = 0.09 miles/minute

Now, we know that Bill travels for 21 minutes, so the total distance traveled is:

Distance = Time x Speed = 0.09 miles/minute x 21 minutes = 1.89 miles

Action:
Now, let's choose the correct answer from the options provided.

Answer: B: 2.25 miles

Explanation: The correct answer is B, 2.25 miles, as it is the closest estimate to the actual distance traveled by Bill in 21 minutes, which is 1.89 miles.
## Result:
Agent Answer: None
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
