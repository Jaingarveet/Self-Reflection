Question: At what price should the Karan mark a sewing machine that costs him Rs. 1200/- so that even after offering a 20% discount, he makes 20% profit?
Choices:
  A: 1,879
  B: 1,875
  C: 1,876
  D: 1,872
  E: 1,800
## Assistant 2:
 Thought: To find the price at which Karan should mark the sewing machine to make a 20% profit after offering a 20% discount, we need to use the formula:

Selling price = Cost price + Profit margin - Discount

First, let's calculate the profit margin:

Profit margin = 20% of Cost price = 20% x Rs. 1200 = Rs. 240

Now, we need to find the selling price that will give Karan a 20% profit after offering a 20% discount:

Selling price = Cost price + Profit margin - Discount
= Rs. 1200 + Rs. 240 - 20% of Rs. 1200
= Rs. 1200 + Rs. 240 - Rs. 240
= Rs. 1200

So, the correct answer is (A) Rs. 1,879.
