Question: A company contracts to paint 3 houses. Mr.Brown can paint a house in 6 days while Mr.Black would take 8 days and Mr.Blue 12 days. After 8 days Mr.Brown goes on vacation and Mr. Black begins to work for a period of 6 days. How many days will it take Mr.Blue to complete the contract?
Choices:
  A: 7
  B: 8
  C: 10
  D: 11
  E: 12
## Assistant 2:
  Thought: To find out how many days it will take Mr.Blue to complete the contract, we need to consider the time taken by each painter and the sequence of their work.

Mr. Brown can paint a house in 6 days, Mr. Black takes 8 days, and Mr. Blue takes 12 days.

After 8 days, Mr. Brown goes on vacation, and Mr. Black begins to work for a period of 6 days.

So, the total time taken by Mr. Black to complete the contract is 8 + 6 = 14 days.

Now, Mr. Blue is left to complete the contract. He takes 12 days to complete a house, and there are 3 houses to be painted.

So, the total time taken by Mr.Blue to complete the contract is 3 x 12 = 36 days.
