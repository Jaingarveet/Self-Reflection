Question: 64 boys and 40 girls form a group for social work. During their membership drive, the same number of boys and girls joined the group. How many members does the group have now, if the ratio of boys to girls is 4:3?
Choices:
  A: 277
  B: 288
  C: 200
  D: 277
  E: 168
## Assistant 2:
  Thought: Let's use the ratio of boys to girls to find the total number of members in the group.

Ratio of boys to girls = 4:3

So, for every 4 boys, there are 3 girls.

Let's use this ratio to find the total number of members in the group:

Number of boys = 64 x 4 = 256
Number of girls = 64 x 3 = 192

Total number of members = Number of boys + Number of girls = 256 + 192 = 448

Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: E
Score: 0
