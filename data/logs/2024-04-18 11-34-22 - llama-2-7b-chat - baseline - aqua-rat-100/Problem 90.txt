## Assistant 2:
  Great, let's solve this problem step by step!

We know that the newspaper costs $4 on Sunday and $1 the rest of the days of the week.

If a hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week, then it will order:

Sunday papers = 2 x (total papers per week - Sunday papers)
= 2 x (7 - 4)
= 2 x 3
= 6 papers on Sunday

Now, we know that the hotel pays $210 per week for newspapers. So, the total cost of newspapers for the week is:

Total cost = Number of papers x Cost per paper
= 6 x $4
= $24

Now, we can find out how many papers the hotel buys on Monday:

Monday papers = Total cost / Cost per paper
= $24 / $1
= 24 papers on Monday

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 30.
