## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: If n is such that 36 ≤ n ≤ 72, then x = (n2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16) / (n+ 4√n+ 4) satisfies
Choices:
  A: 20 < x < 54
  B: 23 < x < 58
  C: 25 < x < 64
  D: 28 < x < 60
  E: None of these
## Assistant 2:
 Thought:
Let's analyze the expression for x:

x = (n2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16) / (n + 4√n + 4)

We know that 36 ≤ n ≤ 72, so n is between 36 and 72.

Let's simplify the expression:

x = (n2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16) / (n + 4√n + 4)

We can see that the expression is always positive, since the numerator and denominator are always positive.

Now, let's check the values of x for different values of n:

* When n = 36, x = 48 / 42 = 1.14
* When n = 42, x = 64 / 46 = 1.41
* When n = 50, x = 70 / 54 = 1.36
* When n = 60, x = 80 / 64 = 1.25
* When n = 72, x = 96 / 74 = 1.27

So, the values of x are between 1.14 and 1.27, inclusive.

Action: Answer("B")
