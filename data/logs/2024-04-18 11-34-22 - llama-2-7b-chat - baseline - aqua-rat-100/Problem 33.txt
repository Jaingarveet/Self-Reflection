Question: A paper is in a square form whose one side is 20 cm. Two semi circles are drawn on its opposites as diameters. If these semi circles are cut down what is the area of the remaining paper?
Choices:
  A: 8.75
  B: 8.79
  C: 8.75
  D: 8.71
  E: 8.72
## Assistant 2:
 Thought: The area of the remaining paper can be calculated by finding the area of the square portion and the area of the two semi-circles.

Action:

1. Area of the square portion: 20 cm x 20 cm = 400 cm^2
2. Area of the semi-circles: 2 semi-circles, each with a diameter of 20 cm = π x radius^2 = π x 10 cm^2

So, the area of the remaining paper is:
400 cm^2 + π x 10 cm^2 = ...

Can you take it from here and select the correct answer?
