Question: x men working x hours per day can do x units of a work in x days. How much work can be completed by y men working y hours per day in y days?
Choices:
  A: x2/y2 units
  B: y3/x2 units

## Assistant 2:
 Thought: The problem is based on the concept of work and the relationship between the number of workers, working hours, and the amount of work completed.

Let's analyze the given options:

A) x2/y2 units: This option suggests that the work completed by y men working y hours per day is equal to x2/y2 units. However, this is not the correct answer as the ratio of work completed does not change with the number of workers.

B) y3/x2 units: This option suggests that the work completed by y men working y hours per day is equal to y3/x2 units. This is also not the correct answer as the ratio of work completed does not change with the number of workers.

C) x3/y2 units: This option suggests that the work completed by y men working y hours per day is equal to x3/y2 units. This is the correct answer as the ratio of work completed does change with the number of workers.

D) y2/x2 units: This option suggests that the work completed by x men working x hours per day is equal to y2/x2 units. This is also not the correct answer as the ratio of work completed does not change with the number of workers.

E) None of these: This option is incorrect as at least one of the options (C) is the correct answer.

Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: B
