Question: Jack buys 18 sharpeners (white and brown) for rs. 100. If he pays 1 rupee more for each white than brown sharpeners. How many of white and how many brown sharpeners did he buy?
Choices:
  A: 10,8
  B: 9,8
  C: 7,8
  D: 5,6
  E: 11,12
## Assistant 2:
 Thought: Let's analyze the problem step by step. Jack buys 18 sharpeners, and he pays 1 rupee more for each white sharpeners than brown sharpeners. So, if he buys x white sharpeners, he will pay x + 1 rupees.

Let's assume the number of white sharpeners he buys is w. Then, the number of brown sharpeners he buys is 18 - w.

So, the total amount he pays is:

w(x + 1) + (18 - w)x = 100

Now, we need to find the values of w and x that satisfy the equation.

Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
