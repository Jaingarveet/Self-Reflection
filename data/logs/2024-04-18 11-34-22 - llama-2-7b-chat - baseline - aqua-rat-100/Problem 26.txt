Question: A wire in the shape of rectangle of length 27 cm and breadth 17 cm is rebent to form a square. What will be the measure of each side?
Choices:
  A: 9
  B: 11
  C: 22
  D: 25
  E: 31
## Assistant 2:
  Thought: To find the measure of each side of the square, we need to use the fact that the perimeter of a square is equal to the length of a side.

The perimeter of the original rectangle is 27 + 27 = 54 cm.
Since the wire is being rebent to form a square, the length and breadth of the square will be equal.
So, the length of each side of the square is half of the length of the original rectangle, which is 27 / 2 = 13.5 cm.

Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
