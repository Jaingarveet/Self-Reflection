## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: A rectangular solid, 3 x 4 x 15, is inscribed in a sphere, so that all eight of its vertices are on the sphere. What is the diameter of the sphere?
Choices:
  A:  13.3542
  B:  15.8113
  C:  18.3451
  D:  19.5667
  E:  20.8888
## Assistant 2:
  Thought: The volume of the rectangular solid is 3 x 4 x 15 = 120.
The volume of the sphere is 4/3 pi r^3, where r is the radius of the sphere.
Since all eight vertices of the solid are on the sphere, the radius of the sphere is equal to the length of the diagonal of the solid.
