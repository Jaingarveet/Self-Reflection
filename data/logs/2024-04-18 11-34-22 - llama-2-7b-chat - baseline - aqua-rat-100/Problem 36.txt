Question: In a chocolate store, all chocolates are either vanilla or cocoa flavored only. 10% of the chocolates are cocoa flavored, 90% of the rest are squashed. What percentage of the chocolates are both vanilla flavored and not squashed?
Choices:
  A: 1%
  B: 2%
  C: 5%
  D: 9%
  E: 10%
## Assistant 2:
 Thought: Let's break this problem down step by step.

We know that 10% of the chocolates are cocoa flavored, which means that 90% of the chocolates are not cocoa flavored.
We also know that 90% of the rest are squashed, which means that 10% of the chocolates are not squashed.
So, the total number of chocolates that are both vanilla flavored and not squashed is:
90% of 100% - 10% of 100% = 90% - 10% = 80%

Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
