Question: A starts a business with Rs.40,000. After 2 months, B joined him with Rs.60,000. C joined them after some more time with Rs.120,000. At the end of the year, out of a total profit of Rs.375,000, C gets Rs.150,000 as his share. How many months after B joined the business, did C join?
Choices:
  A: 2 months
  B: 4 months
  C: 23 months
  D: 24 months
  E: 84 months
## Assistant 2:
  Thought: Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* A started the business with Rs.40,000.
* B joined the business 2 months after A started.
* C joined the business after some more time (not specified).
* At the end of the year, C gets Rs.150,000 as his share of the total profit of Rs.375,000.

Action: Let's use the information to find out how many months after B joined the business did C join.

We know that B joined the business 2 months after A started, so B joined 2 + 2 = 4 months after A started.

We also know that C joined the business after some more time after B joined, but we don't know exactly how much more time.

Let's assume that C joined the business 4 months after B joined.

So, the time period between A starting the business and C joining is:

4 months (B joining) + 4 months (C joining) = 8 months.

Therefore, the answer is (E) 84 months.

Action: Answer("E")
## Result:
Agent Answer: E
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
