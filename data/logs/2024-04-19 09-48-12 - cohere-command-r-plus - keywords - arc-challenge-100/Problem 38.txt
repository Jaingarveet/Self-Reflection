## System:
You are an expert in Science.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")

Question: Red-clay bricks have a density of approximately 2000 kg/m^3. Air has a density of 1 kg/m^3. Which of the following has the lowest mass?
Choices:
  A: 2 m^3 of bricks
  B: 4 m^3 of bricks
  C: 6000 m^3 of air
  D: 10,000 m^3 of air
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Error Keywords:
- Scientific concept misunderstanding
- Density and mass relationship misunderstanding
- Calculation error

Solution: Red-clay bricks have a higher density than air, which means they have a greater mass per unit volume. Choice [REDACTED], 2 cubic meters of bricks, will have the lowest mass because it has the lowest volume of the high-density material.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Density is mass per unit volume.
This means that a higher density will result in a greater mass for the same volume.
Of the choices given, 2 m^3 of bricks will have the lowest mass since it is the smallest volume of the denser material.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
