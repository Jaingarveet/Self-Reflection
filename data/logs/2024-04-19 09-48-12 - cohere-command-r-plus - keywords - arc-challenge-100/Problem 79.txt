# Model: cohere-command-r-plus | Agent: keywords | Exam: arc-challenge-100 | Problem 79 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Science.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Science
Question: Which of these indicates a physical change that occurs during the process of digestion?
Choices:
  A: the addition of acids to create a ball of food
  B: the secretion of pepsin to change proteins to peptides
  C: the breakdown of food substances by digestive juices
  D: the squeezing of food through the intestines

 - Ignoring mechanical processes
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
During digestion, food is physically broken down into smaller pieces by mechanical processes such as chewing, mixing with digestive juices, and squeezing through the intestines. This facilitates the chemical processes of digestion, where acids and enzymes are secreted to break down nutrients.

Choice A describes the addition of acids, which is a chemical process, not a physical change.
Choice B and C refer to chemical processes as well, as they involve the secretion of enzymes and the use of digestive juices to break down nutrients.

Choice D is the correct answer as it describes a physical changeâ€”the mechanical process of moving food through the intestines by squeezing and pushing it, which breaks it down into smaller particles.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
