Context: Economics professor: Marty's Pizza and Checkers Pizza are the two major pizza parlors in our town. Marty's sold coupon books including coupons good for one large plain pizza at any local pizza parlor, at Marty's expense. But Checkers refused to accept these coupons, even though they were redeemed by all other local pizza parlors. Accepting them would have cost Checkers nothing and would have satisfied those of its potential customers who had purchased the coupon books. This shows that Checkers's motive in refusing to accept the coupons was simply to hurt Marty's Pizza.
Question: Which one of the following, if assumed, enables the economics professor's conclusion to be properly drawn?
Choices:
  A: Any company that refuses to accept coupons issued by a competitor when doing so would satisfy some of the company's potential customers is motivated solely by the desire to hurt that competitor.
  B: Any company that wishes to hurt a competitor by refusing to accept coupons issued by that competitor will refuse to accept them even when accepting them would cost nothing and would satisfy its potential customers.
  C: At least one company has refused to accept coupons issued by its major local competitor simply in order to hurt that competitor, even though those coupons were accepted by all other local competitors.
  D: Any company that accepts its major competitor's coupons helps its competitor by doing so, even if it also satisfies its own actual or potential customers.
  E: If accepting coupons issued by a competitor would not enable a company to satisfy its actual or potential customers, then that company's refusal to accept the coupons is motivated by the desire to satisfy customers.

Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Advice:
 - Always carefully identify the premises and conclusion of an argument.
 - Look for the gap between the premises and conclusion that needs to be bridged by an assumption.
 - Be cautious of answer choices that simply restate the conclusion or premises.
 - Eliminate answer choices that are out of scope, too broad, or unsupported by the given information.
 - The correct assumption should be a statement that, if true, enables the conclusion to be properly drawn from the premises.
## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
The key premises are:
1) Marty's sold coupon books for pizzas redeemable at any local pizza parlor. 
2) Checkers refused to accept these coupons, even though it would have cost them nothing and satisfied some potential customers.
3) All other local pizza parlors accepted the coupons.
The conclusion is:
Checkers's motive in refusing the coupons was simply to hurt Marty's Pizza.
To properly draw this conclusion, we need to assume something that bridges the gap between Checkers's specific actions (refusing the coupons despite no cost and customer satisfaction) and their motive (hurting Marty's).
Looking at the choices:
A is too broad - it assumes any refusal to accept a competitor's coupons is solely to hurt them. But there could be other reasons.
B is also too broad - it assumes any company wishing to hurt a competitor will always refuse their coupons. But they might try to hurt them in other ways.
C looks promising - it provides a specific example of a company (Checkers) refusing a competitor's coupons to hurt them, even when other competitors accepted them. This helps justify concluding Checkers's motive.
D is out of scope - the argument is not about whether accepting coupons helps competitors, but rather Checkers's motive for refusal.
E is also out of scope - the argument already states that accepting the coupons would have satisfied Checkers's potential customers.
Therefore, C provides the necessary assumption to conclude Checkers's motive was to hurt Marty's. If we assume at least one company has refused a competitor's coupons under the same circumstances simply to hurt them, it enables concluding the same about Checkers.
Action: Answer("C")
