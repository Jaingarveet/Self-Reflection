Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.

Topic: Law
Context: A shopping center has exactly seven spaces—space 1 through space 7—arranged in a straight row. Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
Question: If the shoe store is in space 2, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: The optometrist is in space 5.
  B: The pharmacy is in space 1.
  C: A restaurant is in space 3.
  D: The toy store is in space 6.
  E: The veterinarian is in space 4.
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Advice:
 - Always consider all possibilities before eliminating an answer choice.
 - Be thorough in your analysis and don't make hasty generalizations.
 - If a choice seems to violate a constraint, try to construct a counterexample to be certain.
 - Carefully apply each constraint to each answer choice to determine its validity.
 - If multiple choices seem possible, re-check the constraints to see if you missed any.
 - Take your time and think through each step carefully to avoid logical errors.
## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step, considering each constraint:
1. The pharmacy must be at one end (space 1 or 7) and a restaurant at the other end. 
2. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
3. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or veterinarian. 
4. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
5. The shoe store is given to be in space 2.
Now let's evaluate each answer choice:
A. The optometrist is in space 5. 
This is possible. The pharmacy could be in space 1 or 7, satisfying constraint 3. The restaurants could be in spaces 3 and 7 (or 1 and 5), meeting constraints 1 and 2. The toy store and vet can be arranged to satisfy constraint 4.
B. The pharmacy is in space 1.
This works. The pharmacy is at one end, meeting constraint 1. A restaurant can be in space 7, satisfying constraints 1 and 2. The optometrist or vet can be in space 3, next to the pharmacy, per constraint 3. The toy store and other business can be arranged in the remaining spaces to meet constraint 4.
C. A restaurant is in space 3.
This violates constraint 2. If a restaurant is in space 3, the other must be in space 6 or 7 to have 2 businesses between them. But space 7 must have a restaurant per constraint 1. So this is not possible.
D. The toy store is in space 6.
This could work. The pharmacy can be in space 1 or 7 with the restaurants in the other end space and space 4, meeting constraints 1-3. The vet can be in space 3 or 5, satisfying constraint 4. 
E. The veterinarian is in space 4.
This is possible. The pharmacy can be in space 1 with the optometrist in space 3, per constraint 3. Restaurants can occupy spaces 5 and 7, meeting constraints 1 and 2. The toy store goes in space 6, satisfying constraint 4.
In summary, choices A, B, D and E are all possible, while only C is impossible.
Action: Answer("C")
