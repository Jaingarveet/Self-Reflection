Question: In a chocolate store, all chocolates are either vanilla or cocoa flavored only. 10% of the chocolates are cocoa flavored, 90% of the rest are squashed. What percentage of the chocolates are both vanilla flavored and not squashed?
Choices:
  A: 1%
  B: 2%
  C: 5%
  D: 9%
  E: 10%
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Let X be the total number of chocolates.
90% of X are vanilla flavored, and 10% are cocoa flavored.
Of the vanilla chocolates, 90% are squashed, which means only 10% of 90% of X are not squashed.

Calculations:
Not squashed chocolates = 0.1 * 0.9 * X = 0.09X
Percentage of vanilla flavored and not squashed chocolates = (0.09X / X) * 100 = 9%

Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
