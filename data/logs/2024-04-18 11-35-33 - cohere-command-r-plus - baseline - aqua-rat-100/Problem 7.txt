## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: Amy is organizing her bookshelves and finds that she has 10 different types of books. She then codes each book with either a single letter or a pair of two different letters. If each type of book is uniquely represented by either a single letter or pair of letters, what is the smallest number of letters Amy will need to create the codes for all 10 types of books? (Assume the order of letters in a pair does not matter.)
Choices:
  A: 3
  B: 4
  C: 5
  D: 10
  E: 20
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Amy needs to create distinct codes for 10 different types of books using either a single letter or a pair of letters.

First, let's calculate the number of possible single letters:
- There are 26 choices for the first letter.

Now, let's calculate the number of possible pairs of two different letters:
- There are 26 choices for the first letter of the pair.
- There are 25 choices for the second letter of the pair (since it should be different from the first).
- The order of letters in a pair does not matter, so we divide by 2.
- So, there are 26 * 25 / 2 = 325 possible pairs.

Amy needs a total of 10 unique codes.

The smallest number of letters needed can be found by combining these options:
- She could use 10 single letters (A to J), but that would require more letters than necessary.
- She could use 1 single letter (A) and 9 letter pairs (AB, AC, AD, AE, AF, AG, AH, AI, AJ), which would require 1 + 2*9 = 20 letters.

So, the smallest number of letters Amy will need is 20.
