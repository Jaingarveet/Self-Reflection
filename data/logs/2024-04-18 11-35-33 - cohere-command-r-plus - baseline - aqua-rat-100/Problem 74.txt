## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Question: ABCDE is a regular pentagon with F at its center. How many different quadrilaterals can be formed by joining 4 of the points A,B,C,D,E and F?
Choices:
  A: 12
  B: 10
  C: 5
  D: 15
  E: 20
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
There are 5 points, and we need to choose any 4 of them to form a quadrilateral.
The number of ways to choose 4 out of 5 points = 5 x 4 / (2 x 1) = 10.
However, we need to exclude the quadrilaterals that include the center point F because they are not unique and are congruent to each other.
The number of quadrilaterals that include F = 4 (choose any 3 points and F is the 4th).
Thus, the total number of unique quadrilaterals = 10 - 4 = 6.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
