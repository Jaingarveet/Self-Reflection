Question: Arjun and Sajal are friends, each has some money. If Arun gives $30 to Sajal, the Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun. But, if Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal. How much money does each have?
Choices:
  A: 62, 35
  B: 62, 34
  C: 34, 62
  D: 42, 62
  E: 62, 42
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Let's assume Arjun has $x dollars, and Sajal has $y dollars.

Given that if Arjun gives $30 to Sajal, Sajal will have twice Arjun's remaining amount:
$y + $30 = 2($x - $30) 

Simplifying this equation, we get:
$y + $30 = $2x - $60
$y + $x = $2x - $30
$y = $x - $30

Now, we can use the second condition, where if Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as Sajal:
$x + $10 = 3($y - $10)

Simplifying this equation, we find:
$x + $10 = 3$y - $30
$x - $y = $30

Using the value of $y from the first equation:
$x - ($x - $30) = $30
$30 = $30

So, Arjun has $x = $62, and using the first equation, we find Sajal has $y = $34.

Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
