Question: One gram of a certain health food contains 9 percent of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E and 8 percent of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A. If vitamins E and A are to be obtained from no other source, how many grams of the health food must be eaten daily to provide at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins?
Choices:
  A: 8.5
  B: 10.5
  C: 12.5
  D: 14.5
  E: 16.5
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
To get 100% of the minimum daily requirement (MDR) of vitamin E, we need $\frac{100}{9} = 11.1$ grams of the health food.
To get 100% of the MDR of vitamin A, we need $\frac{100}{8} = 12.5$ grams of the health food.
To get at least the MDR of both vitamins, we need to consume 12.5 grams of the health food.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
