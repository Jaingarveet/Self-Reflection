## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: there are more than 501 students in a school such that 20% of them exactly took physics and 28% of them exactly took math. What could be the least possible no of students in the school?
Choices:
  A: 550
  B: 570
  C: 600
  D: 700
  E: none of these
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Let the total number of students be x.
The number of students who took physics = 20% of x = 0.2x
The number of students who took math = 28% of x = 0.28x
The number of students who took either physics or math = 0.2x + 0.28x = 0.48x
The number of students who took neither physics nor math = x - 0.48x = 0.52x

Since there are more than 501 students in the school,
0.52x > 501
Multiplying by 2 throughout, we get
x > 501 * 2 / 0.52 = 963.46
The least possible number of students in the school is 964.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: E
Score: 0
