Question: In IPL season, Sachin current batting average is 51. In the finals, he scores 78 runs, then is batting average will be 54. Find out the total number of matches played by Sachin in this season.
Choices:
  A: 6
  B: 8
  C: 9
  D: 10
  E: 11
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Let X be the number of matches played by Sachin so far.
The total number of runs scored by Sachin after X matches = 51 * X
After the finals (X + 1) match, the total number of runs scored by Sachin = (51 * X) + 78
His batting average after the finals = (Total runs) / (X + 1)
Given that this average is 54.

So, we have:
(51X + 78) / (X + 1) = 54
Solving this equation, we get X = 9.

So, Sachin has played a total of 9 matches so far in the season.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
