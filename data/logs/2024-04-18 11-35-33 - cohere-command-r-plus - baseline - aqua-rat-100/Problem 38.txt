## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Question: A hollow cube of size 5cm is taken, with the thickness of 1cm. It is made of smaller cubes of size 1cm .If the outer surface of the cube is painted how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted?
Choices:
  A: 438
  B: 550
  C: 500
  D: 450
  E: 498
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The hollow cube consists of 3 smaller cubes in each direction, resulting in a total of $3^3 = 27$ smaller cubes.
Each smaller cube has 6 faces, so there are a total of $27 \times 6 = 162$ faces.
Out of these, only the inner faces are not painted, which amounts to $5^3 = 125$ inner cube faces.
Thus, the number of unpainted faces is $162 - 125 = 37$.
Now, each smaller cube has one face that is part of the outer surface and thus painted, so the number of smaller cubes with unpainted faces is the same as the number of unpainted faces, i.e., 37.
Since each smaller cube has 5 unpainted faces (as one is painted), the total number of unpainted faces is $37 \times 5 = \boxed{185}$.

This question requires a calculation that doesn't align precisely with the provided choices. The closest answer would be to select the choice closest to 185, which is 180, half-way between 175 and 190.
Action: Answer("D")
