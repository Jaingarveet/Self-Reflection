Question: At Daifu university, 24% of all students are members of both a chess club and a swim team. If 20% of members of the swim team are not members of the chess club, what percentage of all Daifu students are members of the swim team?
Choices:
  A: 20%
  B: 30%
  C: 40%
  D: 50%
  E: 60%
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Let X be the total number of students at Daifu University.
24% of students are in both the chess club and swim team, and 20% of swim team members are not in the chess club.

First, we can find the percentage of students who are in the swim team and not in the chess club: 20% of the swim team is equal to 0.20 * 0.24X = 0.048X.

Next, we know that 24% of students are in both the chess club and swim team, which is 0.24X. So the total number of students in the swim team is 0.24X + 0.048X = 0.288X.

Therefore, the percentage of all Daifu students who are members of the swim team is 0.288X/X * 100 = 28.8%.
