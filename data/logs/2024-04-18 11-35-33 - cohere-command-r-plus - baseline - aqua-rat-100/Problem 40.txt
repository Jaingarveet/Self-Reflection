Question: Mark told John "If you give me half your money I will have Rs.75. John said, "if you give me one third of your money, I will have Rs.75/-. How much money did John have ?
Choices:
  A: 22
  B: 60
  C: 28
  D: 26
  E: 18
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Let's assume John has x amount of money.
According to Mark, if he gives John half of his money, Mark will have Rs. 75. So, Mark currently has: 
2x = 150
x = 75

According to John, if Mark gives him one-third of his money, John will have Rs. 75. So, John currently has: 
x - (1/3)*x = 75
2/3 * x = 75
x = 112.5

Now that we know Mark's and John's amounts, we can calculate the answer choices to check which one is correct.

A: 22 - Incorrect
B: 60 - Incorrect
C: 28 - Incorrect
D: 26 - Incorrect
E: 18 * Incorrect

Since none of the answer choices match our calculated amount, there must be an error in the question or the answer choices provided.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
## Result:
Agent Answer: N
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
