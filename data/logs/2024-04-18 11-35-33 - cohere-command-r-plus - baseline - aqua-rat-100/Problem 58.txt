## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: Two balls A and B rotate along a circular track. Ball A makes 2 full rotations in 26 minutes. Ball B makes 5 full rotation in 35 minutes. If they start rotating now from the same point, when will they be at the same starting point again?
Choices:
  A: 1 hour and 31 minutes
  B: 2 hour and 31 minutes
  C: 3 hour and 31 minutes
  D: 4 hour and 31 minutes
  E: 5 hour and 31 minutes
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
First, we need to find the period of each ball.

For ball A, it completes one full rotation in 13 minutes, as 26 minutes / 2 rotations = 13 minutes/rotation.
For ball B, it completes one full rotation in 7 minutes, as 35 minutes / 5 rotations = 7 minutes/rotation.

Now, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of these two periods to determine when they will be at the same starting point again.

The LCM of 13 and 7 is 91.

Therefore, it will take 91 minutes for the balls to return to their starting point simultaneously.

So, the answer is 1 hour and 31 minutes.
Action: Answer("A")
