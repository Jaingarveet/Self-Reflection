Question: 64 boys and 40 girls form a group for social work. During their membership drive, the same number of boys and girls joined the group. How many members does the group have now, if the ratio of boys to girls is 4:3?
Choices:
  A: 277
  B: 288
  C: 200
  D: 277
  E: 168
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Initially, the total number of members = 64 boys + 40 girls = 104 members.
Let's assume an equal number of boys and girls joined the group as x.
The ratio of boys to girls now is 4:3, so the number of boys to the total members is 4/7, and girls is 3/7.
This can be represented as:
(64 + x) / (40 + x) = 4/7
Simplifying this equation, we get:
3(64 + x) = 4(40 + x)
192 + 3x = 160 + 4x
3x - x = 160 - 192
2x = -32
x = 16
So, the number of new members that joined = 16.
Therefore, the total number of members now = 104 + 16 = 120.
