Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.

Question: Kevin drove from A to B at a constant speed of 70 mph. Once he reached B, he turned right around with pause, and returned to A at a constant speed of 90 mph. Exactly 3 hours before the end of his trip, he was still approaching B, only 70 miles away from it. What is the distance between A and B?
Choices:
  A: 180
  B: 90
  C: 270
  D: 360
  E: None of the above
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Let the distance be $x$ miles.
The time taken to travel from A to B is $\frac{x}{70}$ hours.
The time taken to travel from B back to A is $\frac{x}{90}$ hours.
The total trip time is $\frac{x}{70} + \frac{x}{90} = \frac{16x}{630} = \frac{8x}{315}$.
At 70 miles away from B, he had $3 - \frac{1}{6} = \frac{17}{6}$ hours remaining.
We can now set up the equation:
$$\frac{8x}{315} = \frac{17}{6} + \frac{x}{70}$$
Solving for $x$, we find $x = 270$ miles.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
