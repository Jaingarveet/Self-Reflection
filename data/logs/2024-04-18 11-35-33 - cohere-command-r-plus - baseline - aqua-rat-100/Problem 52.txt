## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: X and Y are two alloys which were made by mixing zinc and copper in the ratio 6:9 and 7:11, respectively. If 40 grams of alloy X and 60 grams of alloy Y are melted and mixed to form alloy Z, what is the ratio of zinc and copper in the alloy Z ?
Choices:
  A: 69:91
  B: 59:91
  C: 59:90
  D: 59:91
  E: 69:101
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Given,
Alloy X = Zn:Cu = 6:9
Alloy Y = Zn:Cu = 7:11
Alloy Z = (40g of X) + (60g of Y)

To find the ratio of Zn and Cu in Z, we need to find the total weight of Z and the weights of Zn and Cu in Z.

Weight of Z = 40 + 60 = 100g
Weight of Zn in Z = (6/15 * 40) + (7/18 * 60) = 46g
Weight of Cu in Z = (9/15 * 40) + (11/18 * 60) = 54g

Therefore, Zn:Cu in Z = 46:54
This can be simplified to 0.81:0.91

To get it into the required format, we can multiply by 100, giving us 81:91

Final answer: 81:91, which can be reduced to 69:81 by taking the common factor of 9.

Choice E is the closest answer, but it is still incorrect.

Action: Answer("E")
## Result:
Agent Answer: E
Correct Answer: B
