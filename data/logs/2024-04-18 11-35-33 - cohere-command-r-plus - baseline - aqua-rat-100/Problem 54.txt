Question: Silu and Meenu were walking on the road.
Silu said, "I weigh 51 Kgs. How much do you weigh?"
Meenu replied that she wouldn't reveal her weight directly as she is overweight.
But she said, "I weigh 29 Kgs plus half of my weight. "How much does Meenu weigh?
Choices:
  A: 12
  B: 28
  C: 27
  D: 58
  E: 91
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Let's represent Meenu's weight as 'x'.
According to the question, we can write the equation: 
x = 29 + x/2
Now, let's solve for x: 
2x = 29 + x
x = 29/2 = 14.5 kg
So, Meenu weighs 14.5 kg.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
