Question: An athlete runs M miles in 4 hours, then rides a bike N miles in the same number of hours. Which of the following represents the average speed, in miles per hour, for these two activities combined?
Choices:
  A: M + N / 8
  B: 2M + N / 8
  C: M + N / 4
  D: M + 3N / 8
  E: M + N / 5
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The average speed is calculated as the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken.
Given the athlete spends the same amount of time running and biking, the total time taken is 4 + 4 = 8 hours.
The total distance covered is M miles (running) + N miles (biking) = M + N miles.
Therefore, the average speed is (M + N miles) / 8 hours, which corresponds to choice A.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
