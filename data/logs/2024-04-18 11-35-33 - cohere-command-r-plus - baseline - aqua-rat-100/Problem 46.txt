Question: A man spends Rs. 3500 per month and saves 12 1/2% of his income. His monthly income is ?
Choices:
  A: Rs. 4400
  B: Rs. 4270

## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Let's call the man's monthly income x.
He saves 12.5% of x, which is 0.125x, and spends Rs. 3500.
So we can set up the equation: 
0.125x + Rs. 3500 = x

Now, simply solve for x: 
x = Rs. 4400
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
