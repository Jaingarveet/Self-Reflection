## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: A paper is in a square form whose one side is 20 cm. Two semi circles are drawn on its opposites as diameters. If these semi circles are cut down what is the area of the remaining paper?
Choices:
  A: 8.75
  B: 8.79
  C: 8.75
  D: 8.71
  E: 8.72
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The area of the square is $20 cm \times 20 cm = 400 cm^2$.
The area of each semi-circle is half of the area of a circle with a radius of $10 cm$.
The area of the circle is $\pi (10 cm)^2 = 100\pi cm^2$.
The area of each semi-circle is $\frac{100\pi cm^2}{2} = 50\pi cm^2$.
The area of the remaining paper is $400 cm^2 - (50\pi cm^2 \times 2) = 400 cm^2 - 100\pi cm^2$.
$100\pi$ is approximately $314.16$, so $400 cm^2 - 100\pi cm^2$ is approximately $87.5 cm^2$.
Action: Answer("C")
