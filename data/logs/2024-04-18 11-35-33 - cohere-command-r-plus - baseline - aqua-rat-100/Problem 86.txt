Question: While selling a watch, a shopkeeper gives a discount of 5%. If he gives a discount of 7%, he earns Rs. 15 less as profit. The marked price of the watch is:
Choices:
  A: Rs. 697.50
  B: Rs. 712.50
  C: Rs. 787.50
  D: Rs. 750
  E: Rs. 780
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Let the MP be Rs. x.
Discount = 5% = Rs. 5x/100
SP = Rs. (1 - 5/100)x = Rs. (95/100)x
Profit% = [(SP - CP)/CP] * 100
Profit% = [(95/100x - x)/x] * 100
Profit% = (5/100 * 100) = 5%
CP = Rs. (100/105) * x
When he gives a discount of 7%, then SP = Rs. (93/100)x
Profit% = [(93/100x - x)/x] * 100
Profit% = (3/100 * 100) = 3%
CP = Rs. (100/103) * x
(100/105 - 100/103) * x = Rs. 15
(3/315 * x) = Rs. 15
x = Rs. 750
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
