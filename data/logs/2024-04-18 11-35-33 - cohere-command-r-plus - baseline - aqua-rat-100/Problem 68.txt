## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.

Question: The greatest common factor of two positive integers is 11. The least common multiple of these two integers is 7700. If one of the integers is 350, what is the other?
Choices:
  A: 242
  B: 308
  C: 352
  D: 412
  E: 456
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Given the greatest common factor (GFC) of 11 and the least common multiple (LCM) of 7700, we can use the properties of these factors to find the other integer.

We know that GCF * LCM = Product of the two integers
11 * 7700 = 350 * unknown integer

Plugging in 350:
11 * 7700 = 350 * unknown integer
84700 = 350 * unknown integer
84700 / 350 = unknown integer

The unknown integer is 242
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
