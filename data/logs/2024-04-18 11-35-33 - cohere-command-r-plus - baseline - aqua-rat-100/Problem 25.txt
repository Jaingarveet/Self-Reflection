## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: A car is being driven, in a straight line and at a uniform speed, towards the base of a vertical tower. The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower?
Choices:
  A: 5(√3 + 1)
  B: 6(√3 + √2)
  C: 7(√3 – 1)
  D: 8(√3 – 2)
  E: None of these
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Let's denote the height of the tower as $h$ and the distance from the car to the base of the tower as $x$.
Using trigonometry, we can set up the following equations:
$\tan(45^{\circ}) = \frac{h}{x} \implies x = h$
$\tan(60^{\circ}) = \frac{h}{x - 10}$

Setting these equations equal to each other and solving for $h$, we get:
$h = x = 5\sqrt{3}$

Now, we can find how much farther the car has to travel:
$x - 10 = 5\sqrt{3} - 10 = 5(\sqrt{3} - 2)$

Therefore, it will take $\mathbf{8(√3 - 2)}$ more minutes for the car to reach the base of the tower.

Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
