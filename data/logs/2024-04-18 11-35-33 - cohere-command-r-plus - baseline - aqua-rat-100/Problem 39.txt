## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: Suppose you want to arrange your English, Hindi, Mathematics, History, Geography and Science books on a shelf. In how many ways can you do it ?
Choices:
  A: 520
  B: 720
  C: 920
  D: None
  E: Cannot be determined
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
This problem can be solved using the concept of permutations.

The number of ways to arrange the 6 books on a shelf is given by the formula for permutations:
P(n, r) = n! / (n - r)!

where:
- n is the total number of books, which is 6 in this case
- r is the number of books selected, which is also 6

Plugging in the values:
P(6, 6) = 6! / (6 - 6)! = 6! / 0! = 720

So, there are 720 ways to arrange the 6 books on the shelf.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
