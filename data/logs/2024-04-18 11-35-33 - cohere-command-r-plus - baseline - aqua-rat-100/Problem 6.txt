  C: 10
  D: 11
  E: 12
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
In 8 days, Mr. Brown would have painted 8/6 = 4/3 of a house.
In the next 6 days, Mr. Black works, painting 6/8 = 3/4 of a house.
Together, they have completed one house and 1/3 of another.
Mr. Blue works alone for the remaining period.
It will take him 12/8 * 8/3 = **16/3 = approximately 5.33** days to complete the contract.
Action: Answer("D")
