Question: x men working x hours per day can do x units of a work in x days. How much work can be completed by y men working y hours per day in y days?
Choices:
  A: x2/y2 units
  B: y3/x2 units
  C: x3/y2 units
  D: y2/x2 units
  E: None of these
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
This is a math problem that can be solved using a formula for time and work. 

Given that x men can do x units of work in x days, we can represent this as: 
x men * x hours/day * x days = x units 

This simplifies to: 
x^3 = x units 

Now, we want to find out how much work can be done by y men working y hours per day in y days. We can set up a similar equation: 
y men * y hours/day * y days = ? 

Multiplying these terms together gives: 
y^3 units 

Therefore, the final answer is y^3/x^3, which can be written as y^3/x^2 * 1/y. This matches choice B.

Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
