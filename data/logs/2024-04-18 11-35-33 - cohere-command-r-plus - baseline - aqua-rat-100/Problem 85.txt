Question: Consider there is an staircase elevator and you are coming down. If you walk 20 steps and stop, then you reach bottom in 10 minutes. If you walk 10 steps and stop, you reach to the ground in 20 minutes. What is the speed of the elevator?
Choices:
  A: 1 step/minute
  B: 2 step/minute
  C: 3 step/minute
  D: 4 step/minute
  E: None of the above
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
If you walk 20 steps, you are walking for an unknown duration at a speed of x steps/minute. This duration plus 10 minutes equals 10 minutes in total.
So, unknown duration + 10 = 10, therefore unknown duration = 0 minutes.
This means the elevator descends at a speed of 20 steps/10 minutes, or 2 steps/minute.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
