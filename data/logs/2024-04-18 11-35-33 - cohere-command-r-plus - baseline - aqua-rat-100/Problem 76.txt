# Model: cohere-command-r-plus | Agent: baseline | Exam: aqua-rat-100 | Problem 76 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:

Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")

Question: If n is such that 36 ≤ n ≤ 72, then x = (n2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16) / (n+ 4√n+ 4) satisfies
Choices:
  A: 20 < x < 54
  B: 23 < x < 58
  C: 25 < x < 64
  D: 28 < x < 60
  E: None of these
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
For the given range of n, we find the range of possible values for x.

Step 1: Simplify the expression for x:
= (n^2 + 2n + 8) / (n + 4)

Step 2: Find the range of values for the numerator and denominator separately:
Numerator (N): 
36^2 + 2*36*(36+4) + 16 = 1296 + 2880 + 16 = 4192
72^2 + 2*72*(72+4) + 16 = 5184 + 2160 + 16 = 7360
So, 4192 ≤ N ≤ 7360

Denominator (D): 
36 + 4*36^0.5 + 4 = 36 + 216^0.5 + 4 ≈ 36 + 64 + 4 = 104
72 + 4*72^0.5 + 4 = 72 + 288^0.5 + 4 ≈ 72 + 108 + 4 = 184
So, 104 ≤ D ≤ 184

Step 3: Now, find the range of values for x by dividing the ranges of N and D:
For the lower bound of x, divide the upper bound of D by the lower bound of N:
184/4192 ≤ x
≈ 0.0439 < x

For the upper bound of x, divide the lower bound of D by the upper bound of N:
104/7360 ≤ x
≈ 0.0141 < x

So, we've found that 0.0439 < x < infinity, which doesn't match any of the given ranges.

Action: Answer("E")
## Result:
Agent Answer: E
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
