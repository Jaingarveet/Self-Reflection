Choices:
  A: 74453

  E: 97656
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The total number of distinct bike numbers that can be formed is a combination of letters and numbers. With 2 letters followed by 2 numbers, there are 26 options for the first letter, 26 for the second letter (as they need to be distinct), 10 options for the first number, and 10 for the second number. So, the calculation is:
26 x 26 x 10 x 10 = 67600

Therefore, the answer is D: 65000, rounded to the nearest 10,000.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
