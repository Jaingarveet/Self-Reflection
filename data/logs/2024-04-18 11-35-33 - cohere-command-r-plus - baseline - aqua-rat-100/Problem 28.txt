# Model: cohere-command-r-plus | Agent: baseline | Exam: aqua-rat-100 | Problem 28 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: If the probability that Stock A will increase in value during the next month is 0.56, and the probability that Stock B will increase in value during the next month is 0.74. What is the greatest value for the probability that neither of these two events will occur?
Choices:
  A: 0.22
  B: 0.26
  C: 0.37
  D: 0.46
  E: 0.63
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The probability that neither event will occur is complementary to the probability that either Stock A or Stock B will increase in value.

Probability that either Stock A or Stock B will increase = 1 - Probability that neither will occur
Probability that neither will occur = 1 - Probability of either occurring

Given probabilities:
Probability of Stock A increasing = 0.56
Probability of Stock B increasing = 0.74

Probability of either Stock A or B increasing = 0.56 + 0.74 = 1.30

Since the probability cannot exceed 1, the greatest value for the probability that neither stock increases is 1 - 1.30 = 0.30, which is closest to choice B: 0.26.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
