Question: The price of a product is reduced by 30% . By what percentage should it be increased to make it 100%
Choices:
  A: 41.86%
  B: 42.86%
  C: 43.86%
  D: 44.86%
  E: 45.86%
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Let the original price be $100. A reduction of 30% would bring the price to $70. To increase this price back to $100, we need to calculate what percentage $30 is of the new price, $70:
$30 / $70 = 0.42857, which is approximately 42.86%.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
