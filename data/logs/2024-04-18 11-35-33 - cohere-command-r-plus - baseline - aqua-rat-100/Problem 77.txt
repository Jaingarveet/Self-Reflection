Question: The sum of the 5 consecutive two digit odd numbers when divided by 10 becomes a perfect square, which of the following can be one of these 5 numbers?
Choices:
  A: 47
  B: 91
  C: 41
  D: 67
  E: 44
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The average of the five consecutive odd numbers must be divisible by 10.
Let the first number be $x$, then the fifth number is $x+8$.
The average of these numbers is $\frac{x + (x + 8)}{2} = \frac{2x + 8}{2} = x + 4$.
For this to be divisible by 10, $x$ must end in a 6.
The only option with a 6 is **46**.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
