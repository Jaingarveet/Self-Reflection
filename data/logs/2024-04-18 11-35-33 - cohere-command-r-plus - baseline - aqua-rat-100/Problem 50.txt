Question: A ship went on a voyage. After it had traveled 180 miles a plane started with 10 times the speed of the ship. Find the distance when they meet from starting point.
Choices:
  A: 238
  B: 289
  C: 200
  D: 287
  E: 187
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Relative speed of the plane with respect to the ship = 10 * ship's speed - ship's speed = 9 * ship's speed.

Distance traveled by the ship when the plane starts = 180 miles.

Using the formula: Distance = Speed * Time
180 = ship's speed * Time
ship's speed = 20.

Now,
Distance traveled by the ship when they meet = Relative speed * Time
= 9 * ship's speed * Time
= 9 * 20 * Time
= 180 * Time

Total distance traveled when they meet = Distance traveled by the ship when the plane starts + Distance traveled by the ship when they meet
= 180 + 180 * Time
= 180 * (1 + Time)

Therefore, Time = 1.

Total distance traveled when they meet = 180 * 2 = 360 miles.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
