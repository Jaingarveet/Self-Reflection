Question: A number of friends decided to go on a picnic and planned to spend Rs. 96 on eatables. Four of them, however, did not turn up. As a consequence, the remaining ones had to contribute Rs. 4 extra, each. The number of those who attended the picnic was
Choices:
  A: 8
  B: 12
  C: 16
  D: 24
  E: 25
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Total expense = Rs. 96
Original contribution = Rs. 96 / n (where n is the number of friends)
After 4 friends did not show up: New contribution = Rs. (96 + 4*4) / (n-4) = Rs. 112 / (n-4)

We know that the new contribution is Rs. 4 more than the original contribution:
Rs. 112 / (n-4) = Rs. 96 / n + 4

Multiplying both sides by (n-4) * n:
112n - 448 = 96n - 384

Simplifying:
16n = 640
n = 40

Since n represents the original number of friends, the final answer must be n+4 = 44.
Action: Answer("E")
