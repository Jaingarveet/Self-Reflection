Question: An exam is given in a certain class. The average (arithmetic mean) of the highest score and the lowest score is equal to x. If the average score for the entire class is equal to y and there are z students in the class, where z > 5, then in terms of x, y, and z, what is the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers?
Choices:
  A: (zy – 2x)/z
  B: (zy – 2)/z
  C: (zx – y)/(z – 2)
  D: (zy – 2x)/(z -2)
  E: (zy – x)/(z + 2)
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The average of the highest and lowest scores is equal to x, so the highest score plus the lowest score = 2x.
Excluding these two scores, the sum of the remaining scores = zy - 2x.
Therefore, the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers = (zy - 2x) / (z - 2).
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
