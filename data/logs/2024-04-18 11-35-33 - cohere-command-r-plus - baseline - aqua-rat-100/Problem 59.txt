Question: 20 marbles were pulled out of a bag of only white marbles, painted black, and then put back in. Then, another 20 marbles were pulled out, of which 1 was black, after which they were all returned to the bag. If the percentage of black marbles pulled out the second time represents their percentage in the bag, how many marbles in total Q does the bag currently hold?
Choices:
  A: 40
  B: 200
  C: 380
  D: 400
  E: 3200
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The probability of pulling out a black marble the second time is 1/20.
This means that black marbles make up 1/20 of all the marbles in the bag.
We can set up the equation: 
1/20 = 21/Q, where 21 is the total number of black marbles (1 added after the second round).
Solving for Q, we get Q = 200.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
