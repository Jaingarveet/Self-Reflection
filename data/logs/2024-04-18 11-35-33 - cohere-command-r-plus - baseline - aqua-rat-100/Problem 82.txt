Question: A cow is tethered in the middle of a field with a 14 feet long rope. If the cow grazes 10 sq.ft. per day, then approximately what time will be taken by the cow to graze the whole field?
Choices:
  A: 51 days
  B: 61 days
  C: 71 days
  D: 81 days
  E: 91 days
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The cow is tethered in the middle of the field, so the field is roughly a circle.
The area of the field is approximately (7 feet radius)^2 * pi = 144.5 square feet.
Therefore, it will take approximately 144.5 / 10 = **14.45 days** for the cow to graze the whole field.
The closest answer is **A: 51 days**.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
