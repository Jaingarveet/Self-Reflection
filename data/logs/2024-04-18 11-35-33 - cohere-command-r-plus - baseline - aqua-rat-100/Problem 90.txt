Question: A newspaper costs $4 on Sunday and $1 the rest of the days of the week. If a hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week and pays $210 per week for newspapers, how many newspapers does it buy on Monday?
Choices:
  A: 15
  B: 30
  C: 45
  D: 60
  E: 75
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Let X be the number of newspapers bought on Monday (and the rest of the weekdays).
The number of newspapers bought on Sunday will be 2X.
Using the information provided, we can set up the following equation:
4 * 2X + $1 * (X * 5) = $210
Simplifying the equation:
8X + 5X = 210
13X = 210
X = 15
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
