Question: A train running at a speed of 100 miles/hour, takes 10 hours to reach its destination. After covering quarter of the distance, it starts raining and the train has to be slowed to speed of 75 miles/hour. What is the total journey duration?
Choices:
  A: 10
  B: 11.5
  C: 12.5
  D: 13.5
  E: 15
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Distance = Speed x Time = 100 x 10 = 1000 miles
When it is raining, the speed is 75 mph
Distance covered before rain = 1/4th of 1000 miles = 250 miles
Distance remaining = 1000 - 250 = 750 miles
Time taken to cover the remaining distance = Distance / Speed = 750 / 75 = 10 hours
Total journey duration = 1/4th distance at 100 mph + 3/4th distance at 75 mph
= 2.5 hours + 10 hours = **12.5 hours**
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
