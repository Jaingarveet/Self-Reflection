Question: A man divides Rs 8600 among 5 sons, 4 daughters and 2 nephews. If each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, and each son receives five as much as each nephew. How much does each daughter receive ?
Choices:
  A: Rs 400
  B: Rs 500
  C: Rs 600
  D: Rs 700
  E: Rs 800
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Total people = 5 + 4 + 2 = 11
Let the amount received by each nephew be x.
So, each daughter receives 4x and each son receives 5x.
5(5x) + 4(4x) + 2x = 8600
=> 25x + 16x + 2x = 8600
=> 43x = 8600
=> x = 200
Therefore, each daughter receives Rs 800.
Action: Answer("E")
