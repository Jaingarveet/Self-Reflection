Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I incorrectly calculated the average speed by not considering the total distance traveled. 
I knew the correct formula for average speed but did not apply it correctly.
Error Keywords:
 - Miscalculation
 - Formula application error
 - Distance calculation error
Solution:
The athlete runs M miles in 4 hours.
The athlete rides a bike N miles in 4 hours.
The total distance traveled is M + N miles.
The total time taken is 4 hours.
The average speed is (M + N) / 4 miles per hour.
Instructions:
1. Identify the total distance traveled by adding the distances traveled in each activity.
2. Identify the total time taken for both activities.
3. Divide the total distance traveled by the total time taken to calculate the average speed.
4. Express the average speed in miles per hour.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always identify the correct formula or equation to solve the problem.
 - Always apply the formula or equation correctly to the given values.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that average speed is calculated by dividing the total distance traveled by the total time taken.
