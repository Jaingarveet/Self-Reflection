## Assistant 2:
I understand. I will use my self-reflection to answer this question correctly.
**Error Keywords:**
* "Two semi circles are drawn on its opposites as diameters."
* "If these semi circles are cut down what is the area of the remaining paper?"
**Solution:**
1. Calculate the area of the square paper: 20 cm * 20 cm = 400 cm^2.
2. Calculate the area of one semi-circle: (π * 20^2) / 4 = 100π cm^2.
3. Calculate the area of two semi-circles: 2 * 100π cm^2 = 200π cm^2.
4. Subtract the area of the two semi-circles from the area of the square paper: 400 cm^2 - 200π cm^2 ≈ 8.75 cm^2.
**Instructions:**
* Carefully read the question and identify the key information.
* Draw a diagram to visualize the problem.
* Use the appropriate formulas to calculate the areas.
* Pay attention to units and round the final answer to the nearest hundredth.
**Advice:**
* Take your time and double-check your calculations.
* Make sure you understand the concepts involved in the problem.
* If you are unsure, ask for help or clarification.
**Action:** Answer("C")
