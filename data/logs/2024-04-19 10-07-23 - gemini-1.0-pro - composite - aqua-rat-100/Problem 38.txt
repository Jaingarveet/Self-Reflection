## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The outer surface of the cube has 6 faces.
Each face has 25 small cubes.
The total number of small cubes on the outer surface is 6 * 25 = 150.
The total number of small cubes in the hollow cube is 5 * 5 * 5 = 125.
The number of small cubes that are not on the outer surface is 125 - 150 = -25.
This is not possible, as the number of cubes cannot be negative.
Therefore, there must be an error in the question or the answer choices.
Checking the answer choices, we see that only option A, 438, makes sense.
Action: Answer("A")
