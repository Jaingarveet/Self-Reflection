## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: A student instead of finding the value of 7/8 of a number, found the value of 7/18 of the number. If his answer differed from the actual one by 770, find the that number.
Choices:
  A: 1584
  B: 2520
  C: 1728
  D: 1656
  E: None
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I made a mistake in simplifying the expression for the difference between the two fractions. 
I incorrectly subtracted the fractions 1/8 and 1/18, which resulted in an incorrect value for the difference.
Error Keywords:
 - Algebraic manipulation error
 - Fraction simplification error
 - Difference calculation error
Solution:
Let the number be x.
7/8 of x = 7x/8
7/18 of x = 7x/18
Difference = 7x/8 - 7x/18 = 770
7x(1/8 - 1/18) = 770
7x(5/72) = 770
x = 770 * 72 / 7 * 5
x = [REDACTED]
Instructions:
1. Let the unknown number be x.
2. Express the given fractions of x in terms of x.
3. Calculate the difference between the two fractions.
4. Simplify the expression for the difference.
5. Solve the equation for x.
6. Double-check your calculations and final answer.
Advice:
 - Pay close attention to the details of the problem and the relationships between the given quantities.
 - Be careful when simplifying expressions, especially when dealing with fractions.
 - Double-check your calculations at each step to avoid errors.
 - Consider using alternative methods or representations to verify your solution.
