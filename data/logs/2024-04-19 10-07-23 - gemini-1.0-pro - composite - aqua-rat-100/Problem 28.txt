## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: If the probability that Stock A will increase in value during the next month is 0.56, and the probability that Stock B will increase in value during the next month is 0.74. What is the greatest value for the probability that neither of these two events will occur?
Choices:
  A: 0.22
  B: 0.26
  C: 0.37
  D: 0.46
  E: 0.63
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I incorrectly calculated the probability of neither event occurring. 
I correctly calculated the probability of each event occurring but then incorrectly calculated the probability of neither event occurring.
Error Keywords:
 - Probability error
 - Calculation error
 - Logic error
Solution:
The probability that neither of these two events will occur is the probability that both stocks will decrease in value.
The probability that both stocks will decrease in value is the product of the probability that Stock [REDACTED] will decrease in value and the probability that Stock [REDACTED] will decrease in value.
The probability that Stock [REDACTED] will decrease in value is 1 - 0.56 = 0.44.
The probability that Stock [REDACTED] will decrease in value is 1 - 0.74 = [REDACTED].
The probability that both stocks will decrease in value is 0.44 * [REDACTED] = 0.1144.
The probability that neither of these two events will occur is 1 - 0.1144 = 0.8856.
Instructions:
1. Identify the probability of each event occurring.
2. Calculate the probability of neither event occurring by subtracting the probability of both events occurring from 1.
3. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
4. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that the probability of neither event occurring is the complement of the probability of both events occurring.
