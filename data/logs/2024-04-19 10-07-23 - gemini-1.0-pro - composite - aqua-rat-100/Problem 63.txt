Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I incorrectly calculated the number of matches lost by the tennis team. 
I knew the correct number of matches won and the percentage of matches lost, but I made a calculation error.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Percentage error
 - Division error
Solution:
The team won 20 matches.
The team lost [REDACTED]% of their matches.
Let X be the total number of matches played.
We know that 0.[REDACTED]X = 20 (matches lost = [REDACTED]% of matches played = 20 matches won)
Dividing both sides by 0.[REDACTED], we get X = 66.66 (total matches played)
Therefore, the team lost 66.66 - 20 = 46.66 matches.
Since we cannot have a fraction of a match, we round up to 4[REDACTED] matches lost.
Instructions:
