# Model: gemini-1.0-pro | Agent: composite | Exam: aqua-rat-100 | Problem 91 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")

Choices:
  A: 3km
  B: 2km
  C: 4km
  D: 5km
  E: 6km
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that the north and south movements would cancel each other out, resulting in a net movement of [REDACTED] east. However, the problem states that [REDACTED] travels [REDACTED] north, which means they end up [REDACTED] north of their starting point. Therefore, the north and south movements do not cancel each other out, and [REDACTED] is actually [REDACTED] north of their starting point.
Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation of problem statement
- Incorrect assumption
- Failure to account for all movements
Solution:
1. Identify the starting point of [REDACTED].
2. Identify the direction and distance of each movement.
3. Calculate the net movement in each direction (north-south and east-west).
4. Use the Pythagorean theorem to calculate the total distance from the starting point.
```
Net movement north: [REDACTED] north - [REDACTED] south = 0km
Net movement east: [REDACTED] east - [REDACTED] west = [REDACTED]
Total distance: sqrt(0^2 + 3^2) = [REDACTED]
```
Instructions:
1. Carefully read the problem statement and identify all relevant information.
2. Break down the problem into smaller, more manageable steps.
3. Calculate the net movement in each direction separately.
4. Use the appropriate formula (e.g., Pythagorean theorem) to calculate the total distance.
5. Double-check your calculations and reasoning before selecting an answer.
General Advice:
- Pay close attention to the wording of the problem statement.
- Avoid making assumptions that are not explicitly stated.
- Consider all possible movements and their impact on the final position.
- Use appropriate formulas and calculations to determine the final distance.
- Double-check your work to ensure accuracy.
