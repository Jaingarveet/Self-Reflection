Solution:
The sum of the 5 consecutive two-digit odd numbers when divided by 10 becomes a perfect square.
We need to find a two-digit odd number that is part of a set of 5 consecutive odd numbers whose sum, when divided by 10, results in a perfect square.
Let's start with option [REDACTED]: [REDACTED].
[REDACTED] is an odd number.
The next four consecutive odd numbers are 43, 45, [REDACTED], and 49.
The sum of these five numbers is 225.
225 divided by 10 is 22.5, which is not a perfect square.
Therefore, option [REDACTED] is not the correct answer.
We can repeat this process for the remaining options.
Only option [REDACTED], [REDACTED], satisfies the condition.
The sum of the five consecutive odd numbers starting from [REDACTED] is 335.
335 divided by 10 is 33.5, which is a perfect square (the square root of 33.5 is 5.78).
Therefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Identify the set of 5 consecutive two-digit odd numbers.
2. Calculate the sum of these numbers.
3. Divide the sum by 10.
4. Check if the result is a perfect square.
5. If the result is a perfect square, the corresponding starting number is the correct answer.
6. If the result is not a perfect square, repeat steps 1-5 for the remaining options.
Advice:
 - Always read the instructions carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that a perfect square is a number that can be obtained by squaring an integer.
 - Remember that the sum of an arithmetic series can be calculated using the formula: sum = (n/2)*(a + l), where n is the number of terms, a is the first term, and l is the last term.
