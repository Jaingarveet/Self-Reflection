Question: A car is being driven, in a straight line and at a uniform speed, towards the base of a vertical tower. The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower?
Choices:
  A: 5(√3 + 1)
  B: 6(√3 + √2)
  C: 7(√3 – 1)
  D: 8(√3 – 2)
  E: None of these

## Assistant 2:
I understand. I will try my best to answer this question correctly.
**Thought:**
* The car is moving at a uniform speed, so the distance traveled is proportional to the time elapsed.
* The angle of elevation is changing, which means the car is getting closer to the tower.
* We can use trigonometry to relate the angle of elevation, the distance traveled, and the height of the tower.
**Solution:**
Let:
* $h$ be the height of the tower.
* $d$ be the distance traveled by the car.
* $t$ be the time elapsed.
From the given information, we have:
* $\tan 45^\circ = \frac{h}{d_1}$
* $\tan 60^\circ = \frac{h}{d_2}$
where $d_1$ is the distance traveled in the first 10 minutes and $d_2$ is the distance traveled in the next $t$ minutes.
Since the car is moving at a uniform speed, we have:
* $\frac{d_1}{10} = \frac{d_2}{t}$
Solving for $d_2$, we get:
* $d_2 = \frac{10t}{d_1}$
Substituting $d_1$ and $d_2$ into the equations above, we get:
* $1 = \frac{h}{d_1}$
* $\sqrt{3} = \frac{h}{\frac{10t}{d_1}}$
Solving for $t$, we get:
* $t = \frac{10}{\sqrt{3}}$
Therefore, the car will reach the base of the tower after an additional $\boxed{\frac{10}{\sqrt{3}}}$ minutes.
**Action:** Answer("A")
