## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Roy has 5 tablets and he needs to take one tablet every 15 minutes.
To consume all the tablets, he will need to take the first tablet, then wait 15 minutes, take the second tablet, wait another 15 minutes, and so on.
This means he will take 15 minutes for the first tablet, another 15 minutes for the second tablet, and so on until he finishes all 5 tablets.
Therefore, the total time it will take Roy to consume all the tablets is 5 tablets * 15 minutes/tablet = 75 minutes.
Action: Answer("B")

Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: E
