 - Always consider the clinical context and choose the investigation that will provide the most valuable information for diagnosis and treatment planning.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: Ultrasound (USG) is the investigation of choice for pyloric stenosis. It is a safe, non-invasive, and easily accessible imaging modality that can provide real-time images of the pylorus and surrounding structures. USG can detect hypertrophic pyloric stenosis and assess the thickness of the pyloric muscle, the length of the channel, and the presence of any complications.
