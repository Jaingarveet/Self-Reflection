Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Advice:
- Consider the anatomical context and unique characteristics of the surgical site when evaluating potential complications. 
- Recognize that while general surgical complications are important, certain procedures carry specific risks due to the anatomy involved. 
- Always review potential complications for each procedure, especially those related to the unique aspects of the anatomy being operated on.
## Assistant 2:
Reflection: Infection and hemorrhage are general risks of any surgical procedure, so they are less likely to be the correct answer for a question seeking a "major complication" of a specific surgery. Obstruction is not a common complication of cyst-gastrostomy for pseudo pancreatic cysts, and is more of a complication associated with other procedures. Fistula formation is a known and significant risk due to the proximity of the stomach and pancreas, and the potential for an abnormal connection to form during the procedure. Therefore, the correct answer is C: Fistula.

Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
