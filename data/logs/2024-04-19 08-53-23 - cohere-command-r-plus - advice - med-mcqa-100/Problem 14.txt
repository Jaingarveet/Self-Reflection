# Model: cohere-command-r-plus | Agent: advice | Exam: med-mcqa-100 | Problem 14 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Medicine.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:
Topic: Geography
Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Medicine
Subtopic: Biochemistry
Question: In anaerobic glycolysis, end product is -
Choices:
  A: 2 ATP + 2 NAD
  B: 2 ATP
  C: 2 ATP + 2 NADH
  D: 4 ATP + 2 FADH2
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Advice:
- Read the question carefully and identify the biological process in question.
- Recall the end products of anaerobic glycolysis, including energy molecules and electron carriers.
- Consider the reduced and oxidized forms of electron carriers, such as NADH and NA[REDACTED].
- Pay attention to the specific molecules listed in the answer choices and their roles in the process.
- Avoid making assumptions and overlooking details; carefully evaluate each answer choice.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Anaerobic glycolysis produces 2 ATP and 2 NADH as end products.

ATP (adenosine triphosphate) is an energy-carrying molecule, and NADH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) is an electron carrier.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
