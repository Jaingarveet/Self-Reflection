# Model: cohere-command-r-plus | Agent: advice | Exam: med-mcqa-100 | Problem 12 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Medicine.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:
Topic: Geography
Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Medicine
Subtopic: Biochemistry
Question: Aminoacyl t-RNA is not require for ?
Choices:
  A: Proline
  B: Lysine
  C: Hydroxylysine
  D: Methionine
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Advice:
 - Familiarize yourself with the fundamental processes of protein translation and the role of aminoacyl t-RN[REDACTED].
 - Understand the distinction between standard and non-standard amino acids, as well as the timing of post-translational modifications.
 - Be cautious of overgeneralizing; always consider the possibility of exceptions or unique cases.
 - When faced with multiple choices, systematically evaluate each option and apply the relevant principles to identify the correct answer.
## Assistant 2:
Reflection: I made a mistake in my previous response. I overlooked the fact that certain amino acids can undergo modifications after being incorporated into a growing polypeptide chain. While it is true that aminoacyl t-RNA is typically required for the incorporation of amino acids during protein translation, there are exceptions. In this case, hydroxylysine is a modified amino acid that is formed through a post-translational modification of lysine. Therefore, aminoacyl t-RNA is not directly required for the incorporation of hydroxylysine into a protein chain.

Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
