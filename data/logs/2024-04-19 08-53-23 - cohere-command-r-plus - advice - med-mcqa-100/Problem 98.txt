## Assistant 2:
Thought: Pyloric stenosis is a condition that causes a blockage in the pylorus, the passage between the stomach and the small intestine. The classic X-ray feature of pyloric stenosis is the "string sign," which is the appearance of a thickened muscular layer of the pylorus. This can be seen on an upper GI series or a barium swallow study. The "string sign" is caused by the barium contrasting the narrowed channel. Another common X-ray finding in pyloric stenosis is a "single bubble appearance," where there is gas in the stomach but not in the distal bowel.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

A: Single bubble appearance

Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
