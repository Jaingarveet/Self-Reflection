## Assistant 2:
Thought:
To solve this problem, I need to expand the equation $(a x+2)(b x+7)$ and compare it to $15 x^{2}+c x+14$.
Expanding the equation gives $a b x^{2}+7 a x+2 b x+14$.
Since $a+b=8$, I can substitute $a=8-b$ into the equation to get $8 b x-b^{2} x+14 a-14 b+14$.
Comparing the coefficients of $x^{2}$ gives $a b=15$, so $b=\frac{15}{a}$.
Substituting this into the equation gives $8 \frac{15}{a} x-\frac{15^{2}}{a^{2}} x+14 a-14 \frac{15}{a}+14$.
Comparing the coefficients of $x$ gives $c=8 \frac{15}{a}-\frac{15^{2}}{a^{2}}+14$.
Solving for $a$ gives $a=\frac{15}{2}$ or $a=10$.
Substituting these values into the equation for $c$ gives $c=3$ or $c=21$.
