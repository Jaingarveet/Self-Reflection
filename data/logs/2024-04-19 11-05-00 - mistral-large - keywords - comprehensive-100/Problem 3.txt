## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The sales person gets a 10% commission on each sale, so for each $250 sale, they make $25 in commission.
To reach a salary of at least $1000, they need to make $1000 / $25 = 40 sales.
Action: Answer("D")

Self-reflection:
I previously made a calculation error when dividing $1000 by $25. I incorrectly calculated the result as 25 instead of 40. To avoid this mistake in the future, I will double-check my arithmetic and make sure I am dividing correctly.
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
