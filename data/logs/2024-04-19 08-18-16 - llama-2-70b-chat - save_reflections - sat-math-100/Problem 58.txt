## Get Reflection:
  Explanation:
I made a mistake in my reasoning and chose the wrong answer.
The correct answer is indeed A: $a>b$.

Error Keywords:
- Misunderstanding of the problem
- Incorrect application of inequalities
- Failure to consider all possible cases

Solution:
Let's analyze the given system of inequalities:

$$\begin{aligned}
y & <-x+a \\
y & >x+b
\end{aligned}$$

We can rewrite the first inequality as:

$$y-x+a>0$$

And the second inequality as:

$$y-x+b<0$$

Now, let's add the two inequalities:

$$y-x+a+y-x+b>0+0$$

Simplifying, we get:

$$2y-2x+a+b>0$$

Since $(0,0)$ is a solution, we can substitute $x=0$ and $y=0$ into the above inequality:

$$0-2(0)+a+b>0$$

Simplifying, we get:

$$a+b>0$$

Now, we can compare the magnitudes of $a$ and $b$:

If $a>b$, then $a+b>b>0$.
If $b>a$, then $a+b>a>0$.
If $|a|>|b|$, then $a+b>b>0$.
If $a=-b$, then $a+b=0$, which is not true.

Therefore, the relationship between $a$ and $b$ that must be true is:

$$a>b$$

Instructions:

1. Analyze the given system of inequalities.
2. Rearrange the inequalities to eliminate one variable.
3. Substitute the values of the variables that satisfy the system.
4. Compare the magnitudes of the coefficients of the variables.
5. Choose the correct answer based on the comparison.

Advice:

- Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
- Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
- Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
- Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
- Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
- Consider all possible cases and compare the magnitudes of the coefficients carefully.
