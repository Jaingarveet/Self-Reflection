## Get Reflection:
  Explanation:
I made a mistake in my calculation. I misunderstood the expression and combined the like terms incorrectly.
The correct solution is:

$$\left(x^{2} y-3 y^{2}+5 x y^{2}\right)-\left(-x^{2} y+3 x y^{2}-3 y^{2}\right)$$

$$= x^{2} y-3 y^{2}+5 x y^{2}-x^{2} y+3 x y^{2}-3 y^{2}$$

$$= 2 x^{2} y+2 x y^{2}-2 y^{2}$$

The expression is equivalent to choice C: $2 x^{2} y+2 x y^{2}$.

Error Keywords:

* Combining like terms error
* Calculation error
* Algebraic manipulation error

Solution:

1. Write the expression as given.
2. Combine like terms correctly.
3. Simplify the expression.

Instructions:

1. Always read the expression carefully.
2. Identify the like terms.
3. Combine the like terms correctly.
4. Simplify the expression.
5. Double-check your calculation.

Advice:

* Always work step-by-step through the calculation.
* Never assume the solution without showing the work.
* Always check your calculation for errors.
* Practice simplifying algebraic expressions regularly.
