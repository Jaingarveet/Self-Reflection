## Get Reflection:
  Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I misunderstood the concept of sampling and its relation to the population.
I thought that option A was the best choice because it seemed to be the most straightforward method to gather information from a single store and generalize it to the entire population.
However, I realize now that this method is not appropriate because it only provides information about one store, and we cannot generalize the results to the entire population.

Error Keywords:

* Sampling error
* Representative sample
* Generalization error

Solution:
To estimate the proportion of all employees of the company who are satisfied with their job, we need to select a sample that is representative of the population of all employees.
Option B is the best choice because it selects 10 employees from each store at random, which provides a more representative sample of the population.

Instructions:

1. Identify the population of interest (all employees of the company).
2. Determine the sampling method (random sampling).
3. Select a random sample of employees from each store.
4. Ensure that the sample is representative of the population.
5. Administer the survey to the selected employees.
6. Calculate the proportion of employees who are satisfied with their job.
7. Generalize the results to the entire population.

Advice:

* Always understand the concept of sampling and its relation to the population.
* Always choose a sampling method that is appropriate for the population and the research question.
* Always ensure that the sample is representative of the population.
* Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
* Always consider potential sources of error and bias in your sampling method.
