## Get Reflection:
  Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I misunderstood the equation that represents the total amount paid so far.
I thought the total amount paid so far was $30w$, but it should be $30w + 60$, since the initial payment of $60$ is included in the total amount paid.
Therefore, the correct equation to find the number of weekly payments required to complete the purchase is:
$300 = 30w + 60$
Error Keywords:
- Misunderstanding of the equation
- incorrect representation of the total amount paid so far
Solution:
The correct equation is:
$300 = 30w + 60$
We can solve for $w$ by subtracting $60$ from both sides:
$240 = 30w$
Dividing both sides by $30$:
$8 = w$
Therefore, the number of weekly payments required to complete the purchase is 8.
Instructions:
1. Write the equation for the total cost of the television.
2. Represent the weekly payment and initial payment.
3. Write the equation that represents the total amount paid so far.
4. Solve for the number of weekly payments required to complete the purchase.
5. Check your answer by plugging it into the original equation.
