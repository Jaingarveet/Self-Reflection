## Get Reflection:
  Explanation:
I made a mistake in my calculation. I misunderstood the equation and wrote the wrong expression for v.
The correct expression for v is v = (h - k) / t + 16t, not v = (h + k) / t - 16t.
Error Keywords:
- Calculation error
- Equation manipulation error
- Algebraic error
Solution:
We are given the equation:

h = -16t^2 + vt + k

We can isolate v by rearranging the equation:

v = (h - k) / t + 16t

Instructions:
1. Rearrange the equation to isolate v.
2. Simplify the expression for v.
3. Check your work by plugging in values for h, t, and k.
Advice:
- Always read the equation carefully and understand the variables.
- Always use the correct formula or equation to solve the problem.
- Always check your work to ensure accuracy.
- Don't assume the correct answer without verifying it through calculation.
- Practice solving similar problems to build your math skills.
