## Get Reflection:
  Explanation:
I made a mistake in my calculation of the values of $a$ and $b$.
I incorrectly solved for $a$ and $b$ as $a=3$ and $b=5$.
The correct solution for $a$ and $b$ is $a=5$ and $b=3$.
Error Keywords:
- Calculation error
- Algebraic error
- Solution error

Solution:
We can start by expanding the given expression:

$(a x+2)(b x+7) = a b x^{2} + (a+b) x + 2 b x + 14$

Since $a+b=8$, we can substitute this into the expression above:

$a b x^{2} + (8) x + 2 b x + 14 = 15 x^{2} + c x + 14$

Now, equating the coefficients of the two expressions, we get:

$a b = 15$
$2 b = c$

Solving for $a$ and $b$, we get:

$a = 5$
$b = 3$

Therefore, the two possible values for $c$ are:

$c = 2 \times 3 = 6$
$c = 5 \times 3 = 15$

Action: Answer("B")

Instructions:

1. Expand the given expression: $(a x+2)(b x+7) = a b x^{2} + (a+b) x + 2 b x + 14$
2. Substitute $a+b=8$ into the expression: $a b x^{2} + (8) x + 2 b x + 14 = 15 x^{2} + c x + 14$
3. Equate the coefficients of the two expressions: $a b = 15$, $2 b = c$
4. Solve for $a$ and $b$: $a = 5$, $b = 3$
5. Determine the two possible values for $c$: $c = 2 \times 3 = 6$, $c = 5 \times 3 = 15$
6. Choose the correct answer: Answer("B")

Advice:

- Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
- Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
- Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
- Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
- Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
- Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them.
