## Get Reflection:
  Explanation:
I made a mistake in my calculation. I misunderstood the question and wrote equation (1) as X + Y = 120,000, which is not correct. The correct equation would be X = Y + 20,000, since the population of City X increased by 20% and the population of City Y decreased by 10%.

Error Keywords:

* Misunderstanding the question
* Incorrect equation
* Calculation error

Solution:
Let's call the population of City X "X" and the population of City Y "Y".
We know that X = Y + 20,000 (since the population of City X increased by 20%)
We also know that X + Y = 120,000 (since the populations are equal)
X = Y + 20,000 ... (1)
X + Y = 120,000 ... (2)
Subtracting (1) from (2), we get:
Y = 100,000

Now we can find the population of City Y in 2010:
Y = 100,000 - 10% of 100,000
Y = 100,000 - 10,000
Y = 90,000

Instructions:

1. Read the question carefully and understand the problem.
2. Write down the correct equation based on the information given.
3. Solve for the variable (Y) in the equation.
4. Calculate the population of City Y in 2010.
5. Choose the answer that matches the calculated result.

Advice:

* Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
* Always write down the correct equation based on the information given.
* Always solve for the variable (Y) in the equation.
* Always calculate the population of City Y in 2010.
* Always choose the answer that matches the calculated result.
* Be careful when working with percentages and equations.
