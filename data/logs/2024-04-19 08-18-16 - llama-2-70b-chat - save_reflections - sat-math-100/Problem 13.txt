## Get Reflection:
  Explanation:
I made a mistake in my calculation. I squared both sides of the equation, which led to an incorrect solution.

Error Keywords:

* Squaring both sides
* Incorrect calculation

Solution:
We are given the equation:

$$\sqrt{k+2}-x=0$$

If we substitute $x=9$, we get:

$$\sqrt{k+2}-9=0$$

We can solve this equation by adding 9 to both sides:

$$\sqrt{k+2}=9$$

Square rooting both sides, we get:

$$k+2=81$$

Subtracting 2 from both sides, we get:

$$k=79$$

Therefore, the value of $k$ is 79.

Instructions:

1. Substitute the given value of $x$ into the equation.
2. Add $9$ to both sides of the equation.
3. Square root both sides of the equation.
4. Subtract $2$ from both sides of the equation.
5. Solve for $k$.

Advice:

* Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
* Be cautious when squaring both sides of an equation, as it can introduce errors.
* Check your calculations carefully, especially when solving for a constant.
* Use the correct order of operations when solving equations.
* Double-check your final answer to ensure it is correct.
