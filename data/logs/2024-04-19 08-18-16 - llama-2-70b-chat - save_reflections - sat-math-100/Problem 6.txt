## Get Reflection:
  Explanation:
I made a mistake in my calculation. 
I incorrectly solved for x, which led to an incorrect solution for the price per pound of beef.
Error Keywords:
- Calculation error
- Algebraic error
- Equation-solving error
Solution:
We are given two equations:
b = 2.35 + 0.25x
c = 1.75 + 0.40x

We want to find when the price per pound of beef is equal to the price per pound of chicken.

We can set up an equation:
b = c

Substituting b and c with their equations:
2.35 + 0.25x = 1.75 + 0.40x

0.25x = 0.40x

x = 4

Now, we can find the price per pound of beef when x = 4:
b = 2.35 + 0.25(4)
b = 2.35 + 1.00
b = 3.35

Therefore, the price per pound of beef when it was equal to the price per pound of chicken was $\$3.35$.

Instructions:
1. Set up an equation for the given problem.
2. Solve the equation for x.
3. Substitute x into one of the original equations to find the desired price.
4. Check your answer by plugging it into the other original equation.
5. Be careful when solving equations, and double-check your work.
