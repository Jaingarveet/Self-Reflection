3. Remember that placenta previa can cause an unstable lie, even if other symptoms are not present.
4. Choose the answer that is the most likely cause of the condition based on the information given in the question.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
An unstable lie in pregnancy refers to a situation where the baby's position changes frequently. This can be due to several reasons. 
A: Oligohydramnios - This is a condition where there is less amniotic fluid around the baby. This could potentially cause an unstable lie as the baby has more room to move around.
B: Placenta Previa - This is a condition where the placenta covers the cervix. This could potentially cause an unstable lie as the baby may not be able to settle into a stable position due to the placenta's position.
C: Pelvic Tumor - A tumor in the pelvis could potentially cause an unstable lie as it may interfere with the baby's ability to settle into a stable position.
D: Uterine anomalies - Anomalies or abnormalities in the shape or structure of the uterus could potentially cause an unstable lie as they may interfere with the baby's ability to settle into a stable position.
Considering the options, Oligohydramnios seems to be the most likely cause of an unstable lie in a multigravida woman with previous normal deliveries.
