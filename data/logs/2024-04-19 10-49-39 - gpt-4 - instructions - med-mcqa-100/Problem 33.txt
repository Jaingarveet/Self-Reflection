Thought: 
Cicatricial pemphigoid, also known as mucous membrane pemphigoid, is an autoimmune blistering disease. In this condition, the body's immune system produces antibodies that attack certain proteins in the skin and mucous membranes. These proteins are located in the basement membrane, which is the layer of tissue that separates the outer layer of skin from the underlying tissues. The specific antigen that is targeted in cicatricial pemphigoid is BP antigen 1 & 2.
