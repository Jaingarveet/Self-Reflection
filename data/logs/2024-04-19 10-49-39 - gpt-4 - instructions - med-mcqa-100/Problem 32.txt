The question does not provide the biopsy findings, which would be crucial in making a diagnosis. However, based on the symptoms of nasal obstruction, nasal discharge, and sometimes blood-tinged discharge, the most likely diagnosis among the given options is Wegener's granulomatosis. This condition, also known as Granulomatosis with polyangiitis, often affects the respiratory tract and can cause symptoms such as those described in the question. The other options are less likely based on the given symptoms.
