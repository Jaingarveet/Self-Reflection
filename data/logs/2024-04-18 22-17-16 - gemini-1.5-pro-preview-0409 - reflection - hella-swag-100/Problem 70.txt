## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:** I focused too narrowly on the literal action of hair styling and missed the implied purpose which was to showcase the completed hairstyle. This led me to neglect the possibility of the woman turning to reveal the final look.
**Error Keywords:**
*   **Comprehension Error:** Misinterpreting the goal of the scenario.
*   **Assumption Error:** Assuming the camera perspective remains static.
*   **Limited Scope:** Focusing on the action without considering the broader context. 
## Step-by-Step Solution
1.  **Identify the situation:** A woman is having her hair styled while facing away from the camera.
2.  **Consider the purpose:** The scene likely aims to present the final hairstyle.
3.  **Analyze options:** 
    *   Option A aligns with showcasing the completed style.
    *   Option B only describes the ongoing process, not the outcome.
    *   Options C and D introduce unrelated actions.
4.  **Choose the most likely completion:** Option A, where the woman turns to reveal the finished hairstyle, best fits the scenario's purpose. 
## Instructions for Future Similar Problems
