## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")

Topic: Math
Question: At its maximum speed, a space shuttle can travel 700m high in 40 seconds. It will also take 5 seconds to pass a point. What then is the length of the space shuttle?
Choices:
  A: 50 m
  B: 75 m
  C: 100 m
  D: 125 m
  E: 150 m
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Identify the type of motion described in the problem (vertical or horizontal).
2. Determine if the given information is relevant to the motion that determines the length of the object.
3. If the information is not directly relevant, consider if there is a way to relate the given information to the desired information.
4. If there is no way to relate the information, recognize that the problem cannot be solved with the given information.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
1. The problem describes both vertical motion (700m high in 40 seconds) and horizontal motion (passing a point in 5 seconds).
2. The length of the space shuttle is relevant to its horizontal motion, not its vertical motion.
3. There is no information provided about the horizontal speed of the space shuttle, only the time it takes to pass a point. 
4. Without the horizontal speed, we cannot determine the length of the space shuttle.
