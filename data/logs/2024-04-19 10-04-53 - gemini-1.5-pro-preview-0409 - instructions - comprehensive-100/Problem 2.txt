## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: A straight picket fence is composed of x pickets each of which is 1/2 inch wide. If there are 6 inches of space between each pair of pickets, which of the following represents the length of fence in feet?
Choices:
  A: 13x/2
  B: 13x/2 - 6
  C: 13x/24
  D: (13x+1)/24
  E: (13x-12)/24
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Determine the width of each picket-space unit (picket width + space width).
2. Identify the number of pickets (x).
3. Calculate the number of spaces between the pickets (x-1).
4. Determine the total number of picket-space units (pickets + spaces).
5. Multiply the width of each unit by the total number of units to get the length in inches.
6. Convert the length from inches to feet by dividing by 12.
7. Simplify the expression for the length in feet.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Following the instructions:
1. Each picket-space unit is 0.5 inches (picket) + 6 inches (space) = 6.5 inches wide.
2. The number of pickets is x.
3. The number of spaces between pickets is x-1.
4. The total number of picket-space units is x (pickets) + (x-1) (spaces) = 2x-1.
5. The total length in inches is 6.5 * (2x-1) = 13x - 6.5 inches.
6. Converting to feet: (13x - 6.5 inches) / 12 inches/foot = (13x - 6.5)/12 feet.
7. This expression doesn't match any of the options exactly. However, we can multiply both numerator and denominator by 2 to get rid of the decimal: (26x - 13)/24 feet. 
Action: Answer("E")
