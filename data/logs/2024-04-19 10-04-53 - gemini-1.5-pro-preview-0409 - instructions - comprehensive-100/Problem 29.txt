## Assistant 2:
## Reflection on Previous Attempt:
In my previous attempt, I likely focused too much on individual conditions and failed to consider the combined effect of all requirements on the possible selections. This led me to overlook a scenario that violated one or more of the constraints. 
To avoid repeating this mistake, I will:
1. **Analyze each option systematically:** I will carefully examine each choice against all the given conditions to ensure it doesn't violate any of them.
2. **Consider combined effects:** I will pay close attention to how the selection of works from one category (e.g., French novels) impacts the available choices in other categories (e.g., Russian novels, plays).
3. **Look for contradictions:** I will specifically search for scenarios that might seem plausible at first glance but contradict one or more of the given requirements upon closer examination.
**Now, let's analyze the options:**
