## System:
You are an expert in Law.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Law
Context: Of the eight students—George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert—in a seminar, exactly six will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
Question: If George, Nina, and Robert give reports and they do so on different days from one another, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Helen gives a report on Wednesday.
  B: Nina gives a report on Monday.
  C: Nina gives a report on Tuesday.
  D: Olivia gives a report on Monday.
  E: Robert gives a report on Wednesday.

## Assistant 2:
## Reflection on Previous Attempt:
**Error Analysis:**
In my previous attempt, I likely focused too much on the individual constraints without considering the combined implications and the specific requirement of George, Nina, and Robert presenting on different days. This led to overlooking a crucial possibility and selecting an answer choice that contradicted the given conditions.
**Key Learnings:**
1. **Interconnected Conditions:** The conditions in this problem are interconnected, and satisfying one often influences the possibilities for others. Analyzing them in isolation can lead to errors.
2. **Process of Elimination:**  Carefully eliminating options based on the given constraints is crucial. Each eliminated option provides further information about the remaining possibilities.
3. **Specific Requirements:**  Always pay close attention to the specific requirements of the question. In this case, the requirement of George, Nina, and Robert presenting on different days significantly narrows down the options.
**Improved Approach:**
1. **Analyze Combined Implications:**  Consider how the conditions interact with each other and create a timeline or table to visualize the possibilities.
2. **Eliminate Options Systematically:** Use the given constraints to eliminate options that violate any of the conditions.
3. **Focus on Specific Requirements:**  Ensure that the chosen answer satisfies the specific requirement of George, Nina, and Robert presenting on different days. 
**Applying Learnings to the Current Question:**
Using the improved approach, I will carefully analyze the conditions and their combined implications, systematically eliminate options, and ensure the chosen answer satisfies the specific requirement of the question.
