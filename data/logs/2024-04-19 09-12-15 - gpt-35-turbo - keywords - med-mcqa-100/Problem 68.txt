## System:
You are an expert in Medicine.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Assistant 2:
Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly. I chose option A: Suxamethonium as the shortest acting skeletal muscle relaxant. However, upon reflection, I realized that suxamethonium is actually an ultra-short-acting muscle relaxant, not a short-acting one. Suxamethonium works by depolarizing the neuromuscular junction, causing muscle relaxation. It has a very rapid onset of action, but its duration of action is very short. 
Action: Answer("B") 
The correct answer is B: Mivacurium. Mivacurium is a short-acting non-depolarizing muscle relaxant. It works by blocking the action of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction, causing muscle relaxation. Its onset of action is rapid, and its duration of action is short, making it a useful muscle relaxant for short procedures.
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
