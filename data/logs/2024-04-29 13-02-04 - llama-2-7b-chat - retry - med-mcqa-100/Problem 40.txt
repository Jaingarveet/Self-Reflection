## Assistant 2:

Subtopic: Biochemistry
Question: Not raised in liver disorder is/are:
Choices:
A: Lipase
B: ALP
C: AST
D: ALT

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I have reflected on the problem, my solution, and the correct answer.

In my previous answer, I selected option A: Lipase. However, I realized that lipase is not raised in liver disorder. Lipase is an enzyme that is produced in the pancreas and plays a crucial role in digestion, but it is not associated with liver disorders.

The correct answer is option D: ALT (Alanine Transaminase). ALT is an enzyme that is produced in the liver and is elevated in liver disorders, such as hepatitis and cirrhosis.

I apologize for my previous mistake and hope this answer is correct.
## Result:
