Question: Commonest cause for grommet insertion is
Choices:
  A: Secretory otitis media
  B: Otosclerosis
  C: CSOM
  D: Cholesteatoma

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly as D: Cholesteatoma. However, upon further reflection, I realize that the correct answer is A: Secretory otitis media.

The commonest cause for grommet insertion is secretory otitis media, which is a type of middle ear infection that occurs when there is a buildup of fluid in the middle ear. This condition is caused by a blockage in the Eustachian tube, which connects the middle ear to the back of the throat. The blockage can be caused by a variety of factors, including colds, allergies, and sinus infections.

In contrast, otosclerosis is a condition in which there is abnormal bone growth in the middle ear, which can cause hearing loss and other symptoms. CSOM (Chronic Suppurative Otitis Media) is a type of middle ear infection that occurs when there is a persistent discharge of pus from the middle ear. Cholesteatoma is a condition in which there is an abnormal growth of skin cells in the middle ear, which can cause hearing loss and other symptoms.

Therefore, the correct answer is A: Secretory otitis media.
