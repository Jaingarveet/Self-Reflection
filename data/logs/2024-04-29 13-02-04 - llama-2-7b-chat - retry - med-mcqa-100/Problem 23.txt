Question: Expanisle type osseous metastases are characteristic of primary malignancy of:
Choices:
  A: Kidney
  B: Bronchus
  C: Breast
  D: Prostate

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I have reflected on the problem, my solution, and the correct answer.

When I first saw the question, I immediately thought of breast cancer as the primary malignancy that can cause expansile type osseous metastases. However, upon further reflection, I realized that this answer is incorrect.

Expanisle type osseous metastases are actually characteristic of primary malignancy of the prostate. This is because the prostate gland is located near the bones of the spine and pelvis, and metastases from prostate cancer can spread to these bones, causing expansile type osseous metastases.

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) Prostate.

Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
