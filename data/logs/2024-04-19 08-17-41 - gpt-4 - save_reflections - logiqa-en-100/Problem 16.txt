## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misinterpreted the economist's hypothesis. I focused on the economic benefits (employment and taxes) that polluting industries could bring to developing countries, rather than considering the implicit assumption about the relative importance of a good natural environment for people in developed and developing countries.
Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation
- Implicit assumption
- Relative importance
Solution:
The economist's hypothesis is based on the idea that transferring polluting industries from developed to developing countries can increase total global welfare. This is because developed countries benefit from an improved natural environment, while developing countries, despite suffering environmental pollution, gain employment and increased taxes. This implies that a good natural environment is more important for people in developed countries than people in developing countries (A), which is the correct answer.
Instructions:
1. Read the context and question carefully.
2. Identify the main argument or hypothesis presented.
3. Consider the implicit assumptions in the argument.
4. Compare these assumptions with the answer choices.
5. Choose the answer that best matches the implicit assumption in the argument.
Advice:
- Always read the question and context carefully.
- Try to identify the implicit assumptions in the argument.
- Don't focus solely on explicit information; consider the underlying implications.
- Compare these assumptions with the answer choices before making a decision.
- Practice more logic-based questions to improve your ability to identify implicit assumptions.
