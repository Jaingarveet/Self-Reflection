## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misunderstood the logical implications of the statements. I assumed that if Green Island can increase productivity by 20%, it will not go bankrupt, which is not necessarily true based on the information given.
Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation
- Logical implication error
- Conditional reasoning error
Solution:
The statement says that if Green Island can increase productivity by 10%, it can also achieve a 20% increase. It also says that Green Island must increase productivity by 10% to avoid bankruptcy. Therefore, if Green Island cannot achieve a 20% increase, which is a higher threshold than the necessary 10%, it will certainly not meet the minimum requirement of 10% and will go bankrupt. So, the correct answer is A.
Instructions:
1. Understand the logical implications of the statements.
2. Identify the necessary conditions for Green Island to avoid bankruptcy.
3. Understand the relationship between a 10% increase and a 20% increase in productivity.
4. Determine the implications if Green Island cannot achieve a 20% increase in productivity.
5. Choose the answer that logically follows from the given statements.
Advice:
- Always read the question carefully and understand the logical implications of the statements.
- Understand the difference between necessary and sufficient conditions.
- Be careful with conditional reasoning and understand the implications of not meeting a condition.
- Always double-check your reasoning before choosing an answer.
