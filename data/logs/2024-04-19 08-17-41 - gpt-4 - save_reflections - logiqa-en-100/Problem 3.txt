# Model: gpt-4 | Task: save_reflection | Exam: logiqa-en-100 | Problem 3 of 100
## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I misunderstood the question. The paragraph does not guarantee success, but it suggests that excelling in at least one area could lead to huge profits. I incorrectly chose an answer that implied a necessity for success, rather than a potential for profit.
Error Keywords:
- Comprehension error
- Interpretation error
- Contextual understanding error
Solution:
The paragraph suggests that excelling in at least one area (product quality, speed, cost, or added value) could lead to huge profits. This is closest to the meaning of choice C, which states that if your company does the best thing in at least one thing, it will definitely make huge profits.
