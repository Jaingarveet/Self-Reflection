## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misinterpreted the method Xiao Wang used to refute Xiao Chen's views. I thought Xiao Wang was providing an alternative explanation, but in reality, he was pointing out that Xiao Chen's argument lacked persuasiveness because it was based on the assumption that people normally don't observe comets far away from the sun.
Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation
- Argument analysis
- Refutation method
Solution:
Xiao Wang refutes Xiao Chen's views by pointing out that the observation of the comet's flicker was not unusual but was the result of continuous and careful tracking observation. This suggests that the flicker might have been observed before if such careful observation had been done. However, this doesn't provide an alternative explanation, but rather points out that Xiao Chen's argument is lacking in persuasion because it's based on an assumption. Therefore, the correct answer is B: pointed out that Xiao Chen's argument is clearly lacking in persuasion.
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and understand the views of each person.
2. Identify the method used by one person to refute the other's views.
3. Determine whether the refutation is based on pointing out ambiguity, lack of persuasion, contradiction, disagreement with conclusion, or agreement with conclusion but with a different explanation.
4. Choose the answer that best describes the refutation method.
Advice:
- Always read the question carefully and understand the context.
- Pay attention to the method used to refute an argument, not just the content of the argument.
- Understand the difference between providing an alternative explanation and pointing out a lack of persuasion.
- Practice more questions on argument analysis to improve your understanding of different refutation methods.
