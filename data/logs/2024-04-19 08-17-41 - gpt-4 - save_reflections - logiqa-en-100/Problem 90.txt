# Model: gpt-4 | Task: save_reflection | Exam: logiqa-en-100 | Problem 90 of 100
## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misinterpreted the implications of the statement. I assumed that the country could still maintain its economic development, albeit with some difficulty, rather than concluding that it could not maintain either its economic development or social stability.
Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation
- Incorrect inference
- Logic error
Solution:
The statement suggests that maintaining economic development requires strengthening the competitiveness of domestic enterprises. However, maintaining social stability requires establishing social security systems, which reduces the competitiveness of enterprises. This creates a paradox where the country cannot maintain both its economic development and social stability simultaneously. Therefore, the correct answer is that this country cannot maintain its economic development or maintain its social stability.
Instructions:
1. Read the statement carefully and understand the problem.
2. Identify the key elements in the statement.
3. Understand the relationship between these elements.
4. Draw logical conclusions based on these relationships.
5. Choose the answer that best matches your conclusion.
Advice:
- Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
- Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
- Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
- Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
- Always double-check your conclusions and final answer.
- Remember that in logic problems, the correct answer is often the one that best fits all the given information.
