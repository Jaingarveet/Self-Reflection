# Model: gpt-4 | Task: save_reflection | Exam: logiqa-en-100 | Problem 51 of 100
## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I overlooked the first condition that H and Y must be allocated in the same department. I focused on the condition that if X is in the same department as F, then W must be in the production department, and concluded that W cannot be in the public relations department. However, I failed to consider that if X and F are in the production department, and W is also in the production department, then there is no room for H in the production department, given that H and Y must be together.
Error Keywords:
- Overlooking information
- Misinterpretation of conditions
- Logical reasoning error
Solution:
Given that X and F are in the same department, and F must be in the production department, X is also in the production department. According to condition (3), W must also be in the production department. This means that three people (F, X, W) are already in the production department. Since H and Y must be in the same department, and the production department is full, H cannot be in the production department. Therefore, the statement "H is assigned to the production department" cannot be true.
Instructions:
1. Understand the conditions given in the problem.
2. Identify the department where X and F are assigned.
3. Apply the conditions to the given scenario.
4. Determine the possible assignments for each candidate.
5. Identify the statement that contradicts the possible assignments.
Advice:
- Always read and understand all the conditions given in the problem.
- Apply each condition to the given scenario.
- Consider all possible assignments for each candidate.
- Identify contradictions between the conditions and the possible assignments.
- Practice logical reasoning problems to improve your skills.
