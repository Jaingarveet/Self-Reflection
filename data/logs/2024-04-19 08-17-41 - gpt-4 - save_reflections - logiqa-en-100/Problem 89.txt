# Model: gpt-4 | Task: save_reflection | Exam: logiqa-en-100 | Problem 89 of 100
## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I misunderstood the conditions given in the problem. I thought that the conditions were possibilities rather than requirements. This led me to incorrectly conclude that none of the options must be true.
Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation
- Logic error
- Condition misunderstanding
Solution:
Given the conditions, Dr. Zhang can only treat male patients. J is a male child, and if Dr. Zhang treats J, he must also treat an adult male. This is possible and must be true because Dr. Zhang can treat up to two patients and both must be male. Therefore, J must be treated by Dr. Zhang.
Instructions:
1. Understand the conditions given in the problem.
2. Identify the constraints for each doctor.
3. Identify the gender and age of each patient.
4. Match the patients with the doctors based on the conditions.
5. Check each option against the conditions and the patient-doctor assignments.
6. Choose the option that must be true based on the conditions and assignments.
Advice:
- Always read the question and conditions carefully.
- Understand the constraints and conditions before attempting to solve the problem.
- Break down complex problems into simpler parts.
- Check each option against the conditions and assignments.
- Be aware of the difference between possibilities and requirements in logic problems.
