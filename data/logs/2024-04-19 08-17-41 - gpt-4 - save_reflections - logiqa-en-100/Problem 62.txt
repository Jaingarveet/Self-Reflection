# Model: gpt-4 | Task: save_reflection | Exam: logiqa-en-100 | Problem 62 of 100
## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I focused on the expert's opinion about the cause of the salamander's decline (being trampled by cattle and sheep) and chose the option that directly contradicted this. However, the question asked for the option that would raise the most doubts about the expert's opinion. The correct answer (B) introduces a new potential cause for the decline (changes in the water environment), which would indeed raise more doubts about the expert's opinion than my chosen answer.
Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation
- Reading comprehension
- Logic error
Solution:
The expert's opinion is that the northern salamanders in Xinjiang are declining because they are being trampled by cattle and sheep. The option that raises the most doubts about this opinion would be the one that introduces a new potential cause for the decline that the expert did not consider. Option B introduces the idea that changes in the water environment could be causing the decline, which raises more doubts about the expert's opinion than the other options.
Instructions:
1. Understand the expert's opinion.
2. Understand what the question is asking - in this case, which option raises the most doubts about the expert's opinion.
3. Evaluate each option in terms of how much it would raise doubts about the expert's opinion.
4. Choose the option that introduces a new potential cause for the decline that the expert did not consider.
Advice:
- Always read the question carefully and make sure you understand what it is asking.
- Consider all the options before making a choice.
- Don't just look for options that directly contradict the expert's opinion, but also consider options that introduce new information that the expert did not consider.
- Practice logic problems regularly to improve your reasoning skills.
