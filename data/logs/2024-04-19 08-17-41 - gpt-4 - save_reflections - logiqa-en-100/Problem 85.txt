# Model: gpt-4 | Task: save_reflection | Exam: logiqa-en-100 | Problem 85 of 100
## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I misunderstood the logical implications of the conditions. I incorrectly inferred that if paper E is not used, then paper K is not necessary. However, the condition only states that if paper E is used, then paper K must be used. It does not imply the reverse. 
Error Keywords:
- Logical error
- Inference error
- Conditional statement error
Solution:
From the context, we know that paper E cannot be used. This means that paper F can be used, but it doesn't necessarily mean that paper K cannot be used. From point (2), we know that either paper G or paper H can be used, but not both, and not with paper J. From point (3), we know that if paper G is not used, then paper K is not necessary. Since paper E is not used and paper G is not necessary, then paper K is not necessary. Therefore, no paper J, but paper K.
Instructions:
1. Understand the conditions given in the problem.
2. Identify the implications of each condition.
3. Be careful with conditional statements. The reverse of a conditional statement is not necessarily true.
4. Apply the conditions to the choices given.
5. Choose the answer that is consistent with all the conditions.
Advice:
- Always read the question carefully and understand the conditions.
- Be careful with conditional statements. The reverse of a conditional statement is not necessarily true.
- Apply logical reasoning to solve the problem.
- Double-check your answer to ensure it is consistent with all the conditions.
