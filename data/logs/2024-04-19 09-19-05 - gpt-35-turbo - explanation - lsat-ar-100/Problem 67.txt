Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
My reasoning was incorrect because I did not consider all possible scenarios. 
I assumed that the first batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Monday or Tuesday, but it could also be made on Wednesday or Thursday. 
I also did not consider the possibility that the first batch of peanut butter cookies could be made on Friday.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then the first batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Monday or Tuesday. 
If the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Monday, then the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Tuesday, and the first batch of sugar cookies must be made on Wednesday. This means that the second batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Thursday, which contradicts the given conditions. Therefore, the first batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Tuesday.
If the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Tuesday, then the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Wednesday, and the first batch of sugar cookies must be made on Thursday. This means that the second batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Friday, and the second batch of sugar cookies must be made on Monday. Therefore, at least two batches of cookies are made on Monday.
Action: Answer("C")
