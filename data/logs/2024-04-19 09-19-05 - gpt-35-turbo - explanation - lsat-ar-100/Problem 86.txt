Context: A loading dock consists of exactly six bays numbered 1 through 6 consecutively from one side of the dock to the other. Each bay is holding a different one of exactly six types of cargoâ€”fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles. The following apply: The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock. The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles. The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel. The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
Question: If bay 4 is holding produce, then for exactly how many of the six bays is the type of cargo that bay is holding completely determined?

Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I made an error in my reasoning. I forgot to consider the fact that the bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel. Therefore, if bay 4 is holding produce, then the bay holding textiles must be bay 3. The bay holding livestock must be bay 2 and the bay holding grain must be bay 1. The bay holding fuel must be bay 6. Therefore, the type of cargo for bays 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 is completely determined.
