Topic: Law
Context: Of the eight students—George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert—in a seminar, exactly six will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
Question: If Helen, Kyle, and Lenore, not necessarily in that order, give the three morning reports, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Helen gives a report on Monday.
  B: Irving gives a report on Monday.
  C: Irving gives a report on Wednesday.
  D: Kyle gives a report on Tuesday.

Explanation:
I misinterpreted the question and did not consider all possible scenarios. 
I assumed that George would give the afternoon report on Tuesday, but he could give the morning report instead. 
I also did not consider the possibility that Nina might not give a report at all.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
If Helen, Kyle, and Lenore give the three morning reports, then George, Nina, Olivia, and Robert must give the afternoon reports. 
George cannot give an afternoon report, so he must give a morning report on either Monday or Wednesday. 
If George gives a morning report on Monday, then Irving and Helen must give afternoon reports on Monday, and Nina and Olivia must give afternoon reports on Tuesday. This means that Robert would have to give an afternoon report on Wednesday, which is not allowed. 
Therefore, George must give a morning report on Wednesday. 
If Irving gives an afternoon report on Monday, then Helen must give an afternoon report on Tuesday, which means that Irving cannot give a report on Tuesday. Therefore, Irving must give a report on Wednesday. 
If Kyle gives a report on Tuesday, then Nina cannot give a report, which means that Helen and Irving must both give reports on Wednesday. This is not allowed because George is already giving a report on Wednesday. 
Therefore, Kyle must give a report on Wednesday. 
Action: Answer("E")
