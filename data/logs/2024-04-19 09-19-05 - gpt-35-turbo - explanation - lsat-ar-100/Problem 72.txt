## Assistant 2:
Thought:
If the optometrist is next to the shoe store, then the shoe store must be in either space 2 or space 6.
If the shoe store is in space 2, then the optometrist must be in space 1 or space 3.
If the optometrist is in space 1, then the pharmacy must be in space 2, which violates the constraint that the pharmacy must be at one end of the row.
Therefore, the optometrist must be in space 3.
If the optometrist is in space 3, then the pharmacy must be in space 2 or space 4.
If the pharmacy is in space 2, then the veterinarian must be in space 1, which violates the constraint that the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
Therefore, the pharmacy must be in space 4.
If the pharmacy is in space 4, then the veterinarian must be in space 3 or space 5.
If the veterinarian is in space 3, then the toy store must be in space 2, which violates the constraint that the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
Therefore, the veterinarian must be in space 5.
If the veterinarian is in space 5, then the toy store must be in space 4 or space 6.
If the toy store is in space 4, then the two restaurants must be in spaces 1, 2, and 3, which violates the constraint that the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
Therefore, the toy store must be in space 6.
If the toy store is in space 6, then the two restaurants must be in spaces 1, 2, and 3 or spaces 4, 5, and 6.
If the two restaurants are in spaces 1, 2, and 3, then the shoe store must be in space 7, which violates the constraint that one of the restaurants must be at the other end of the row.
Therefore, the two restaurants must be in spaces 4, 5, and 6.
If the two restaurants are in spaces 4, 5, and 6, then the shoe store must be in space 1.
Therefore, the businesses immediately on either side of the optometrist and the shoe store are the pharmacy and the toy store.
