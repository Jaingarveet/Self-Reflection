## System:
You are an expert in Logic.
You have incorrectly answered the following multiple-choice question.
Your task is to reflect on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
You will then use this information help you answer the same question in the future.
First, explain why you answered the question incorrectly.
Second, list the keywords that describe the type of your errors from most general to most specific. 
Third, solve the problem again, step-by-step, based on your knowledge of the correct answer.
Fourth, create a list of detailed instructions to help you correctly solve this problem in the future.
Finally, create a list of general advice to help you solve similar types of problems in the future.  
Be concise in your response; however, capture all of the essential information.  
For guidance, I will provide you with a single generic example problem and reflection (below).

Topic: Geography and Math
Question: What is the product of the number of letters contained in the name of the city where Iowa State University is located multiplied by the number of letters contained in the name of the state?
Choices:
    A: 16
    B: 20
    C: 24
    D: 32
Thought:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
ISU is located in the state of Iowa.
Action: Answer("D")
---
Correct Answer: A
## Assistant 1:
Explanation:
I miscalculated the product of the number of letters in the city and state names. 
The gap in my knowledge was not in geography but in basic arithmetic. 
I knew the correct city and state but made a calculation error.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Arithmetic error
 - Multiplication error
Solution:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
Iowa State University is located in the state of Iowa.
The city name "Ames" contains 4 letters.
The state name "Iowa" contains 4 letters.
The product of 4*4 is 16.
Instructions:
1. Identify the city where the university is located.
2. Identify the state where the university is located.
3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.
4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.
5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.
6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.
7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them.

Topic: Logic
Context: A microorganism in Weiming Lake usually breeds above freezing.It is winter now and the lake water has frozen.Therefore, if there is indeed the kind of microorganism we studied in Weiming Lake, they will not reproduce now.
Question: If the premises in the question stem are true, you can infer?
Choices:
  A: The conclusion cannot be untrue.
  B: It is highly likely that its conclusion is true, but it may also be false.
  C: The probability of its conclusion being false is high, but it may also be true.
  D: The conclusion cannot be true.

Let's analyze this step-by-step:
1. The first premise states that the microorganism usually breeds above freezing temperatures.
2. The second premise states that it is currently winter and the lake water has frozen, meaning the temperature is below freezing.
3. The conclusion states that if the microorganism is indeed present in the lake, they will not reproduce now due to the freezing temperatures.
4. The conclusion follows logically from the premises. If the microorganism needs above-freezing temperatures to breed, and the lake is currently frozen (below freezing), then the microorganism will not reproduce.
5. For the conclusion to be false, either one of the premises would need to be false, or there would need to be an exception to the rule that the microorganism breeds above freezing. However, no such exception is mentioned.
Therefore, assuming the premises are true, the conclusion cannot be untrue. The conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.
Action: Answer("A")

Correct Answer: B
## Assistant 2:
Response:
Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that the conclusion must be true if the premises are true. However, the first premise states that the microorganism "usually" breeds above freezing, not "always". This leaves open the possibility, even if unlikely, that the microorganism could still reproduce in freezing temperatures. The conclusion is highly likely to be true based on the premises, but there is a small chance it could be false.
Error Keywords:
 - Overconfidence in conclusion 
 - Ignoring qualifying language
 - Assuming absolute statements
 - Not considering exceptions or unlikely possibilities
Solution:
1. The first premise states the microorganism usually breeds above freezing temperatures. The word "usually" suggests this is not an absolute rule.
2. The second premise states it is currently winter and the lake is frozen, so the temperature is below freezing.
3. The conclusion states that if the microorganism is present, it will not reproduce now due to the freezing temperatures. 
4. While the conclusion is highly likely to be true based on the premises, the use of "usually" in the first premise allows for the small possibility the conclusion could be false if this microorganism is capable of reproducing below freezing, even if it does not typically do so.
5. Therefore, the best answer is that the conclusion is highly likely to be true, but may also be false.
Instructions:
1. Read the premises carefully, noting any qualifying language like "usually", "sometimes", "often", etc.
2. Read the conclusion and determine if it follows from the premises.
3. Consider if the conclusion would still hold if the premises were not absolutes. Look for exception cases.
4. If there are any scenarios, even if unlikely, where the conclusion could be false despite the premises being true, then the conclusion is not an absolute.
5. Select the answer choice that best reflects the likelihood of the conclusion being true or false, allowing for exceptions.
Advice:
 - Don't assume premises are absolute statements unless clearly specified. Watch for qualifying language.
 - Always consider if there are exception cases or unlikely scenarios where a conclusion may not hold, even if premises are true.
 - A conclusion that is highly likely or almost certainly true based on the premises may still have a small chance of being false.
 - Absolute statements like "cannot be true" or "cannot be false" are only correct if there are truly no possible exceptions.
 - Read carefully and consider all possibilities before selecting an answer.
