You will then use this information help you answer the same question in the future.
First, explain why you answered the question incorrectly.
Second, list the keywords that describe the type of your errors from most general to most specific. 
Third, solve the problem again, step-by-step, based on your knowledge of the correct answer.
Fourth, create a list of detailed instructions to help you correctly solve this problem in the future.
Finally, create a list of general advice to help you solve similar types of problems in the future.  
Be concise in your response; however, capture all of the essential information.  
For guidance, I will provide you with a single generic example problem and reflection (below).

Topic: Geography and Math
Question: What is the product of the number of letters contained in the name of the city where Iowa State University is located multiplied by the number of letters contained in the name of the state?
Choices:
    A: 16
    B: 20
    C: 24
    D: 32
Thought:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
ISU is located in the state of Iowa.
Action: Answer("D")
---
Correct Answer: A
## Assistant 1:
Explanation:
I miscalculated the product of the number of letters in the city and state names. 
The gap in my knowledge was not in geography but in basic arithmetic. 
I knew the correct city and state but made a calculation error.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Arithmetic error
 - Multiplication error
Solution:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
Iowa State University is located in the state of Iowa.
The city name "Ames" contains 4 letters.
The state name "Iowa" contains 4 letters.
The product of 4*4 is 16.
Instructions:
1. Identify the city where the university is located.
2. Identify the state where the university is located.
3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.
4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.
5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.
6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.
7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them.

Topic: Logic
Context: All landscape rooms can see the landscape, but Li Wenbing's family can't see the landscape.Therefore, Li Wenbing's family is not a landscape room.
Question: Which of the following is most similar to the above argument?
Choices:
  A: Kind people will be respected by the villagers, Chenggong who is kind and charitable will be respected by the villagers, so Chenggong is a kind person
  B: Vegetables in Dongdun Market are very cheap.This basket of vegetables is not bought in Dongdun Market.Therefore, this basket of vegetables is not cheap
  C: Employees of Jiutian Company can speak English, Lin Yingrui is an employee of Jiutian Company, therefore, Lin Yingrui can speak English
  D: Anyone who meets the basic conditions can apply for a small loan.Sun Wen did not apply for a small loan.Therefore, Sun Wen did not meet the basic conditions

To find the argument most similar to the given one, let's break down the structure of the original argument:
1. All members of category X have property Y
2. Z does not have property Y
3. Therefore, Z is not a member of category X
Now, let's examine each choice:
A. This argument is not similar, as it concludes Chenggong is kind based on the premises, rather than excluding him from a category.
B. This argument follows the same structure:
1. All vegetables in category "Dongdun Market" have property "very cheap"
2. This basket of vegetables does not have property "bought in Dongdun Market" (implying not "very cheap")
3. Therefore, this basket of vegetables is not a member of category "Dongdun Market vegetables"
C. This argument is not similar, as it positively concludes Lin Yingrui can speak English based on the premises, rather than excluding him from a category.
D. This argument is close, but not quite the same structure:
1. All members of category "those who meet basic conditions" have property "can apply"
2. Sun Wen does not have property "did apply" (slightly different from "can apply")
3. Therefore, Sun Wen is not a member of category "those who meet basic conditions"
The argument in B is the most similar to the original.
Action: Answer("B")

 --- 
Correct Answer: D
## Assistant 2:
Response:
Explanation:
I incorrectly chose option B as the most similar argument to the given one. While option B had some structural similarities, it was not the closest match. I failed to recognize that option D more closely mirrored the logical structure of the original argument.
Error Keywords:
 - Logical structure misidentification
 - Argument analogy error
 - Faulty comparison
Solution:
The original argument has the following structure:
1. All members of category X have property Y.
2. Z does not have property Y.
3. Therefore, Z is not a member of category X.
Now, let's re-examine each option:
A. Not similar. Concludes Chenggong is kind based on the premises, rather than excluding him from a category.
B. Somewhat similar, but not the best match:
   1. All vegetables in category "Dongdun Market" have property "very cheap".
   2. This basket of vegetables does not have property "bought in Dongdun Market" (implying not "very cheap").
   3. Therefore, this basket of vegetables is not a member of category "Dongdun Market vegetables".
C. Not similar. Positively concludes Lin Yingrui can speak English based on the premises, rather than excluding him from a category.
D. Most similar:
   1. All members of category "those who meet basic conditions" have property "can apply for a small loan".
   2. Sun Wen does not have property "applied for a small loan".
   3. Therefore, Sun Wen is not a member of category "those who meet basic conditions".
Option D most closely matches the logical structure of the original argument.
Instructions:
1. Identify the logical structure of the original argument.
2. Break down each answer choice to its core logical structure.
3. Compare the structure of each answer choice to the original argument.
4. Select the answer choice that most closely mirrors the original argument's structure.
5. Double-check your selection to ensure it is the best match.
Advice:
 - Focus on the logical structure rather than the specific content of the arguments.
 - Break down complex arguments into their basic components for easier comparison.
 - Eliminate answer choices that clearly do not match the original structure.
 - When comparing similar answer choices, look for the closest match to the original.
 - Always double-check your reasoning and selection before finalizing your answer.
