First, explain why you answered the question incorrectly.
Second, list the keywords that describe the type of your errors from most general to most specific. 
Third, solve the problem again, step-by-step, based on your knowledge of the correct answer.
Fourth, create a list of detailed instructions to help you correctly solve this problem in the future.
Finally, create a list of general advice to help you solve similar types of problems in the future.  
Be concise in your response; however, capture all of the essential information.  
For guidance, I will provide you with a single generic example problem and reflection (below).

Topic: Geography and Math
Question: What is the product of the number of letters contained in the name of the city where Iowa State University is located multiplied by the number of letters contained in the name of the state?
Choices:
    A: 16
    B: 20
    C: 24
    D: 32
Thought:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
ISU is located in the state of Iowa.
Action: Answer("D")
---
Correct Answer: A
## Assistant 1:
Explanation:
I miscalculated the product of the number of letters in the city and state names. 
The gap in my knowledge was not in geography but in basic arithmetic. 
I knew the correct city and state but made a calculation error.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Arithmetic error
 - Multiplication error
Solution:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
Iowa State University is located in the state of Iowa.
The city name "Ames" contains 4 letters.
The state name "Iowa" contains 4 letters.
The product of 4*4 is 16.
Instructions:
1. Identify the city where the university is located.
2. Identify the state where the university is located.
3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.
4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.
5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.
6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.
7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them.

Topic: Logic
Context: The Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge, built in 1968, has a clear height of 24 meters in the Fengshui area.Theoretically, it can pass a maximum of 3,000 tons of ships.Today, with the rapid economic development, it has become a building that “cuts the waist” of the Yangtze River waterway and hinders the passage of giant ships.A bridge expert asserted that the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge must be demolished and rebuilt in order to dredge the golden waterways of the Yangtze River completely.
Question: If any of the following is true, can you raise the most doubts about this expert's point of view?
Choices:
  A: Due to the inability of large ships to pass through the Nanjing Bridge, a large number of exported goods in the middle and upper reaches of the Yangtze River can only be taken by road or railway.
  B: 99% of international ships entering the Yangtze River are moored at ports below the Nanjing Bridge, and dozens of foreign trade terminals above Nanjing rarely have large external ships berthed.
  C: It is not enough to dismantle only the Nanjing Bridge.The Yangtze River Bridge, which was built in Wuhu, Tongling, Anqing and other places, has a clear height of 24 meters.
  D: Shipbuilding technology is highly developed, and 8000-ton ships designed for adapting to the passage of the Yangtze River abroad have passed through Nanjing to Wuhan.

To raise the most doubt about the expert's view that the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge must be demolished and rebuilt to allow giant ships to pass, we should look for information that suggests demolishing the bridge may not be necessary or effective.
Choice B states that 99% of international ships entering the Yangtze River moor at ports below the Nanjing Bridge, and foreign trade terminals above Nanjing rarely have large ships. This suggests there may not be a strong need for giant ships to travel past Nanjing, calling into question the necessity of demolishing the bridge.
Choices A and C support the expert's view by pointing out issues caused by the bridge's low clearance. Choice D is less relevant as it doesn't directly address the need to demolish this specific bridge.
Therefore, choice B raises the most doubt about the expert's assertion.
Action: Answer("B")

 --- 
Correct Answer: D
## Assistant 2:
Response:
Explanation:
I selected an answer that seemed to support the expert's view rather than cast doubt on it. Choice B suggests demolishing the bridge may not be necessary, while I failed to recognize that Choice D provides evidence directly contradicting the expert's claim that the bridge must be demolished to allow giant ships to pass.
Error Keywords:
 - Misinterpreting answer choices
 - Failing to identify contradictory evidence 
 - Focusing on irrelevant information
 - Confirmation bias
Solution:
The expert asserts the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge must be demolished and rebuilt to allow giant ships to pass. 
Choice A supports this view by noting goods must be transported by road/rail due to large ships being unable to pass.
Choice B casts some doubt by suggesting few large ships travel above Nanjing.
Choice C also supports the expert by pointing out other bridges have the same low 24m clearance. 
However, Choice D directly contradicts the expert's key claim by stating that 8000-ton ships designed for the Yangtze have already passed through Nanjing to Wuhan. This proves giant ships can in fact pass under the bridge, so demolishing it is not necessary.
Therefore, Choice D raises the most doubt about the expert's view.
Instructions:
1. Read the question and expert's claim carefully.
2. For each answer choice, determine if it supports, opposes, or is irrelevant to the expert's view.
3. Look for choices that provide direct evidence contradicting a key part of the expert's assertion.
4. Avoid choices that seem relevant but don't actually disprove the main claim.
5. Avoid focusing only on choices that confirm your initial thoughts.
6. Select the choice that most strongly calls the expert's conclusion into question.
Advice:
 - Always read the full question and understand the key claim you are evaluating.
 - Always consider each answer choice carefully and look for direct evidence that contradicts the main assertion.
 - Never just pick an answer because it seems related to the topic or matches your first instinct.
 - Always be on the lookout for your own potential biases and try to set them aside.
 - Never ignore an answer choice just because it doesn't fit your initial assumptions.
