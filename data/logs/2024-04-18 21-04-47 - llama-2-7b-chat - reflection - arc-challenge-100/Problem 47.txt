## System:
You are an expert in Science.
You have incorrectly answered the following multiple-choice question.
Your task is to reflect on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
You will then use this information help you answer the same question in the future.
First, explain why you answered the question incorrectly.
Second, list the keywords that describe the type of your errors from most general to most specific. 
Third, solve the problem again, step-by-step, based on your knowledge of the correct answer.
Fourth, create a list of detailed instructions to help you correctly solve this problem in the future.
Finally, create a list of general advice to help you solve similar types of problems in the future.  
Be concise in your response; however, capture all of the essential information.  
For guidance, I will provide you with a single generic example problem and reflection (below).
## User 1:
Topic: Geography and Math
Question: What is the product of the number of letters contained in the name of the city where Iowa State University is located multiplied by the number of letters contained in the name of the state?
Choices:
    A: 16
    B: 20
    C: 24
    D: 32
Thought:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
ISU is located in the state of Iowa.
Action: Answer("D")
---
Correct Answer: A
## Assistant 1:
Explanation:
I miscalculated the product of the number of letters in the city and state names. 
The gap in my knowledge was not in geography but in basic arithmetic. 
I knew the correct city and state but made a calculation error.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Arithmetic error
 - Multiplication error
Solution:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
Iowa State University is located in the state of Iowa.
The city name "Ames" contains 4 letters.
The state name "Iowa" contains 4 letters.
The product of 4*4 is 16.
Instructions:
1. Identify the city where the university is located.
2. Identify the state where the university is located.
3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.
4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.
5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.
6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.
7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them.

Topic: Science
Question: A ship leaks a large amount of oil near a coastal area. Which statement describes how the oil most likely will affect the coastal habitat?
Choices:
  A: Fish reproduction rates will increase.
  B: Water birds will be unable to use their wings.
  C: Water plants will be exposed to more sunlight.
  D: Coastal plants will have access to more nutrients.

  Thought: The oil spill will likely have a negative impact on the coastal habitat.
Action: Answer("D")

 --- 
Correct Answer: B
## Assistant 2:
Response:
 Explanation:
I incorrectly selected answer "D" as the correct response. The correct answer is actually "B".

The oil spill will likely have a negative impact on the coastal habitat, including:

* Harming or killing marine life, including fish, birds, and other organisms that depend on the coastal ecosystem.
* Coating or smothering plants and habitats, reducing their ability to photosynthesize and providing shelter for marine life.
* Altering the water's chemistry, reducing the amount of oxygen available and affecting the overall health of the ecosystem.

The other options are not accurate descriptions of how the oil spill will affect the coastal habitat:

* Option "A" is incorrect because oil spills can actually have a negative impact on fish reproduction rates, rather than increasing them.
* Option "C" is incorrect because oil spills can reduce the amount of sunlight reaching water plants, rather than exposing them to more sunlight.
* Option "D" is incorrect because coastal plants may not have access to more nutrients as a result of an oil spill.

Solution:
The ship leaked oil near a coastal area.
The oil spill will likely have a negative impact on the coastal habitat.
The oil will harm or kill marine life and alter the water's chemistry.
The correct answer is "B".

Instructions:

1. Identify the location of the oil spill.
2. Determine the type of impact the oil spill will have on the coastal habitat.
3. Consider the effects of the oil spill on marine life, including fish, birds, and other organisms.
4. Analyze the impact of the oil spill on the water's chemistry and the overall health of the ecosystem.
5. Choose the answer that best describes the impact of the oil spill on the coastal habitat.
Advice:

* Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
* Consider the potential impact of the oil spill on the entire ecosystem, including marine life and water quality.
* Think through each subproblem step-by-step.
* Double-check your calculations and final answer.
* Remember that oil spills can have far-reaching and long-lasting impacts on coastal habitats and marine life.
