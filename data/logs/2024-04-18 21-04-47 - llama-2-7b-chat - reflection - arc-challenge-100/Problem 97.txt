Finally, create a list of general advice to help you solve similar types of problems in the future.  
Be concise in your response; however, capture all of the essential information.  
For guidance, I will provide you with a single generic example problem and reflection (below).
## User 1:
Topic: Geography and Math
Question: What is the product of the number of letters contained in the name of the city where Iowa State University is located multiplied by the number of letters contained in the name of the state?
Choices:
    A: 16
    B: 20
    C: 24
    D: 32
Thought:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
ISU is located in the state of Iowa.
Action: Answer("D")
---
Correct Answer: A
## Assistant 1:
Explanation:
I miscalculated the product of the number of letters in the city and state names. 
The gap in my knowledge was not in geography but in basic arithmetic. 
I knew the correct city and state but made a calculation error.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Arithmetic error
 - Multiplication error
Solution:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
Iowa State University is located in the state of Iowa.
The city name "Ames" contains 4 letters.
The state name "Iowa" contains 4 letters.
The product of 4*4 is 16.
Instructions:
1. Identify the city where the university is located.
2. Identify the state where the university is located.
3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.
4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.
5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.
6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.
7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them.

Topic: Science
Question: What is the first step of the process in the formation of sedimentary rocks?
Choices:
  A: erosion
  B: deposition
  C: compaction
  D: cementation

  Thought: The first step in the formation of sedimentary rocks is deposition.

Action: Answer("B")

 --- 
Correct Answer: A
## Assistant 2:
Response:
 Explanation:
I incorrectly identified the first step in the formation of sedimentary rocks. I thought the correct answer was deposition, but the correct answer is actually erosion.

Error Keywords:

* Erosion
* Deposition
* Compaction
* Cementation

Solution:
The first step in the formation of sedimentary rocks is erosion. Erosion involves the removal of rocks and minerals from their original location through natural processes such as wind, water, or ice. These particles are then transported to a new location, where they are deposited, compacted, and cemented together to form sedimentary rocks.

Instructions:

1. Identify the process that involves the removal of rocks and minerals from their original location.
2. Name the process that is the first step in the formation of sedimentary rocks.
3. Explain why the process you identified is the correct answer.
Advice:

* Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
* Break down complex questions into smaller, manageable parts.
* Use keywords from the question to help guide your answer.
* Double-check your answer to ensure accuracy.
* Remember that the first step in the formation of sedimentary rocks is erosion, not deposition.
