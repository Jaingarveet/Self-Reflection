## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The total price of the television is $300. The initial payment is $60. The weekly payments are $30. The equation to find the number of weekly payments, w, would be the total price equals the initial payment plus the product of the weekly payment and the number of weeks. This can be written as $300 = 60 + 30w.
Action: Answer("A")
