Topic: Math
Question: Alan drives an average of 100 miles each week. His car can travel an average of 25 miles per gallon of gasoline. Alan would like to reduce his weekly expenditure on gasoline by $\$ 5$. Assuming gasoline costs $\$ 4$ per gallon, which equation can Alan use to determine how many fewer average miles, $m$, he should drive each week?
Choices:
  A: $\frac{25}{4} m=95$
  B: $\frac{25}{4} m=5$
  C: $\frac{4}{25} m=95$
  D: $\frac{4}{25} m=5$
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Understand the question and what is being asked.
2. Identify the given values: cost of gasoline, miles per gallon, and the amount Alan wants to reduce his expenditure by.
3. Calculate the number of gallons less Alan should use each week by dividing the amount he wants to reduce his expenditure by the cost of gasoline.
4. Set up the equation to find the number of fewer miles he should drive each week. The equation should be (cost of gasoline / miles per gallon) * m = amount Alan wants to reduce his expenditure by.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Alan wants to reduce his weekly expenditure on gasoline by $5. Since gasoline costs $4 per gallon, this means he wants to use 5/4 = 1.25 gallons less each week. His car can travel an average of 25 miles per gallon of gasoline, so to find out how many fewer miles he should drive, we multiply the number of gallons less he should use by the number of miles per gallon. This gives us (4/25)*m = 1.25, which simplifies to (4/25)*m = 5.
Action: Answer("D")
