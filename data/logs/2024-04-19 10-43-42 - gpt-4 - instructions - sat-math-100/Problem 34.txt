Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Understand the problem and identify the given information.
2. Calculate the percentage of the original price that the sale price represents.
3. Divide the sale price by this percentage (in decimal form) to find the original price.
4. Write your answer in the correct format: 'Action: Answer("[ANSWER_CHOICE]")'.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The sale price of the book is 60% of the original price (100% - 40% = 60%). 
So, to find the original price, we divide the sale price by 0.60 (60% in decimal form).
Calculation: 
18 รท 0.60 = 30
Action: Answer("C")
