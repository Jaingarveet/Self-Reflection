# Model: cohere-command-r-plus | Agent: keywords | Exam: sat-math-100 | Problem 35 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:
Topic: Geography
Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: $$\sqrt{4 x}=x-3$$What are all values of $x$ that satisfy the given equation?I. 1II. 9
Choices:
  A: I only
  B: II only
  C: I and II
  D: Neither I nor II

Error Keywords:
- Algebraic error
- Quadratic equation error
- Invalid solution error
## Assistant 2:
Reflection: I made an algebraic error when simplifying the equation. The correct equation should be $x=\frac{16}{\left(x-3\right)^{2}}$. This can be further simplified to $x^{2}-6 x-16=0$, which then factors into $(x-4)(x+4)=0$. So, the solutions for $x$ are 4 and -4. Therefore, the correct answer is "B: II only" since only option II, or 9, is a valid solution.

Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
