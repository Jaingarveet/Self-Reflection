Question: Mr. Kohl has a beaker containing $n$ milliliters of solution to distribute to the students in his chemistry class. If he gives each student 3 milliliters of solution, he will have 5 milliliters left over. In order to give each student 4 milliliters of solution, he will need an additional 21 milliliters. How many students are in the class?
Choices:
  A: 16
  B: 21
  C: 23
  D: 26

Reflection: I made an algebraic error in my previous solution.

The correct way to solve this is to set up and solve a system of equations.

Let $x$ be the number of students in the class.

The first piece of information tells us that $n = 3x + 5$. 

The second piece of information tells us that $n + 21 = 4x$. 

Subtracting the first equation from the second gives us $21 = x + 20$, so $x = 1$. 

This means there is only 1 student in the class, which is not possible given the constraints of the problem. 

Re-evaluating the equations, we can see that the second equation should be $n + 21 = 4(x+1)$, as Mr. Kohl needs an additional 21 milliliters to increase the amount given to each student from 3 to 4, and he also now has one additional student. 

Solving this equation gives us $n = 99$, and substituting into the first equation gives us $99 = 3x + 5$, so $x = 31$. 

Therefore, there are $32$ students in the class, and the answer is D: 32 students.

Thought: Setting up a system of equations is still the correct approach. 

Let $x$ be the number of students in Mr. Kohl's chemistry class. 

We can set up two equations based on the information provided: 
1. $n = 3x + 5$ (each student receives 3 milliliters, and there are $x$ students, leaving 5 milliliters remaining)
2. $n + 21 = 4(x + 1)$ (Mr. Kohl needs 21 more milliliters to give each student 4 milliliters, and he now has one more student, $x + 1$)

Solving the second equation for $n$, we get $n = 4x + 16$. Substituting this into the first equation, we get $4x + 16 = 3x + 5$. Combining like terms, we get $x = 11$. 

Therefore, there are $11$ students in the class.
Action: Answer("B")
