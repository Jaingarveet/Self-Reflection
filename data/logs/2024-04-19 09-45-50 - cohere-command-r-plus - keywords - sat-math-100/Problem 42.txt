## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Error Keywords:

- System of equations error

Solution: We are given the equation:
$(a x+2)(b x+7)=15 x^{2}+c x+14$

Expanding the left side:
$(a x+2)(b x+7)=abx^2 + 7ax + 2bx + 14$

Comparing coefficients:
$ab = 15$
$7a = c$
$2b = 14 \Rightarrow b = 7$

We are also given $a + b = 8$. Plugging in $b = 7$:
$a + 7 = 8 \Rightarrow a = 1$

Now, we can find the value of $c$ from the equation $7a = c$:
$7a = c \Rightarrow c = 7a$
$c = 7(1) = 7$

So, the two possible values for $c$ are both 7. The correct answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED], as these are the only options that yield a value of 7 when added together.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
$ab = 15$ and $a + b = 8$ means $a$ and $b$ are factors of $15$ that add up to $8$. The factors are $5$ and $3$.
$a + b = 8$ means $a = 1$ and $b = 7$ or $a = 7$ and $b = 1$.

$7a = c$ means $c$ is $7$ or $1$.
The two possible values for $c$ are $1$ and $7$.
The correct answer is "A" because $1$ and $7$ sum to $8$, and the two values must sum to $ab = 15$.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
