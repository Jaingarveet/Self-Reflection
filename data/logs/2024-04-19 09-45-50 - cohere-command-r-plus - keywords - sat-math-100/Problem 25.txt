## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

## Assistant 2:
Reflection: I made an algebraic error in expanding the equation. The correct steps are as follows:

Given equations:
\begin{align*}
y & = x^2 \\
2y + 6 & = 2x + 6
\end{align*}

Substitute $y = x^2$ into the second equation:
\[ 2(x^2) + 6 = 2x + 6 \]

Simplify:
\[ 2x^2 - 2x = 0 \]

Factor and solve for $x$:
\[ 2x(x - 1) = 0 \]
\[ x = 0 \text{ or } x = 1 \]

Since $x > 0$ from the problem statement, $x = 1$.

Now we can find $y$ by plugging $x = 1$ into either equation:
\[ y = 1^2 = 1 \]

So, $x = 1$ and $y = 1$, and the value of $xy$ is $1 \times 1 = \boxed{1}$. Therefore, the correct answer is A: 1.
