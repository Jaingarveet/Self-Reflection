Question: A television with a price of $\$ 300$ is to be purchased with an initial payment of $\$ 60$ and weekly payments of $\$ 30$. Which of the following equations can be used to find the number of weekly payments, $w$, required to complete the purchase, assuming there are no taxes or fees?
Choices:
  A: $300=30 w-60$
  B: $300=30 w$
  C: $300=30 w+60$
  D: $300=60 w-30$

## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
To find the number of weekly payments required to complete the purchase, we need to use the equation that represents this situation accurately.

The total cost of the television ($$\$ 300$$) is the sum of the initial payment ($$\$ 60$$) and the weekly payments of $$\$ 30$$ for a certain number of weeks ($$w$$).

So, the equation should be:
$$300 = 60 + 30w$$

Simplifying this equation, we get:
$$240 = 30w$$

Now, dividing both sides by 30, we find:
$$w = 8$$

This means it will take 8 weekly payments of $\$30$ each to complete the purchase.

Choice A represents a incorrect equation where the weekly payment is subtracted from the television price.
Choice B suggests that the television price is equal to the weekly payment, which is incorrect.
Choice D has a sign error and implies that the weekly payment is subtracted from the initial payment, which is not the case.

Therefore, the correct answer is Choice C, as it represents the correct equation for finding the number of weekly payments needed to complete the purchase.
