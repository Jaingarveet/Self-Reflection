## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Assistant 2:
Reflection: I made a multiplication error when calculating the value of $w$. The correct answer is $w = \frac{4}{5}$.

Thought: 
To find the value of $w$, we need to isolate it. 

$\frac{3}{5} w = \frac{4}{3}$

Multiplying both sides by $\frac{5}{3}$ to solve for $w$:

$\frac{3}{5} w \cdot \frac{5}{3} = \frac{4}{3} \cdot \frac{5}{3}$
$w = \frac{20}{3} \div 5$
$w = \frac{4}{3} \cdot \frac{5}{5}$
$w = \frac{4}{3} \cdot 1$
$w = \frac{4}{3}$

So, the correct answer is $w = \frac{4}{3}$, which is not an option. I must have made a mistake somewhere. Let's review the steps and double-check the calculations.

Action: Answer("B")
