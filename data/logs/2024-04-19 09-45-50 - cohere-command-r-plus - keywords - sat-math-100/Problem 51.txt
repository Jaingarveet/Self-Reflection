# Model: cohere-command-r-plus | Agent: keywords | Exam: sat-math-100 | Problem 51 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: $$\begin{aligned}& 2 x-3 y=-14 \\& 3 x-2 y=-6\end{aligned}$$If $(x, y)$ is a solution to the system of equations above, what is the value of $x-y$ ?
Choices:
  A: -20
  B: $\quad-8$
  C: -4
  D: 8
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.

Solution: Solving the system of equations:

$$\begin{aligned}
& 2 x-3 y=-14 \quad \cdot 3 \\
& 3 x-2 y=-6 \quad \cdot 2 \\
\end{aligned}$$

We get:

$$\begin{aligned}
& 6 x-9 y=[REDACTED]2 \\
& 6 x[REDACTED] y=-12
\end{aligned}$$

Subtracting the equations eliminates the $x$ variable:

$$\begin{aligned}
9 y - 4 y &= [REDACTED]2 - (-12) \\
5 y &= -30 \\
y &= -6
\end{aligned}$$

Plugging $y = -6$ into either original equation to solve for $x$:

$$\begin{aligned}
2x - 3(-6) &= -14 \\
2x + 1[REDACTED] &= -14 \\
2x &= -32 \\
x &= -16
\end{aligned}$$

Now, we can find the value of $x - y$:

$$x - y = -16 - (-6) = -10 + 6 = [REDACTED]$$
