## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Solution: Solving the system of equations step by step: 

$\begin{array}{r}
3x + 4y = -23 \quad \cdot2 \\
6x + 8y = -46 \\
\end{array}$

$\begin{array}{r}
2y - x = -19 \quad \cdot4 \\
8y - 4x = -76 \\
\end{array}$

Adding the two equations eliminates $y$:
$6x + 8y + 8y - 4x = -46 - 76$
$14y = -122$
$y = -\frac{122}{14} = -8.71$ (rounded to two decimal places)

Now, plug $y$ into one of the original equations to find $x$:
$3x + 4y = -23$
$3x + 4(-8.71) = -23$
$3x - 34.84 = -23$
$3x = 11.84$
$x = \frac{11.84}{3} \approx 3.95$ (rounded to two decimal places)

So, the solution is $(x, y) \approx (3.95, -8.71)$, which is closest to choice **B**.
