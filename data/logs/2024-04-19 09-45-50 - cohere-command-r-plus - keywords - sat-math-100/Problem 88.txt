## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Question: $$h=-4.9 t^{2}+25 t$$The equation above expresses the approximate height $h$, in meters, of a ball $t$ seconds after it is launched vertically upward from the ground with an initial velocity of 25 meters per second. After approximately how many seconds will the ball hit the ground?
Choices:
  A: 3.5
  B: 4.0
  C: 4.5
  D: 5.0

## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The ball hits the ground when its height is zero. Setting $h = 0$, we can solve for $t$ using the quadratic formula:
$$t = \frac{-(-25) \pm \sqrt{(-25)^2 - 4(-4.9)(0)}}{2(-4.9)}$$
$$t = \frac{25 \pm \sqrt{625}}{-9.8}$$
$$t = \frac{25 \pm 25}{-9.8}$$
$t$ is approximately 3.5 or 1.0 seconds.

The correct answer is A: 3.5.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
