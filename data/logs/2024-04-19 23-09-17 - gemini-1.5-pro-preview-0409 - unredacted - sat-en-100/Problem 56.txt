Topic: English
Context: Even then my only friends were made of paper and ink. At school I had learned to read and write long before the other children. Where my school  friends saw notches of ink on incomprehensiblepages, I saw light, streets, and people. Words and the mystery of their hidden science fascinated me, and I saw in them a key with which I could unlock a boundless world, a safe haven from that home, those streets, and those troubled days in which even Icould sense that only a limited fortune awaited me. My father didn't like to see books in the house. There was something about them-apart from the letters he could not decipher-that offended him. He used to tell me that as soon as I was ten he would 15 send me off to work and that I'd better get rid of all my scatterbrained ideas if I didn't want to end up a loser, a nobody. I used to hide my books under the mattress and wait for him to go out or fall asleep so that I could read. Once he caught me reading at night20 and flew into a rage. He tore the book from my hands and flung it out of the window."If I catch you wasting electricity again, reading all this nonsense, you'll be sorry."My father was not a miser and, despite the 25 hardships we suffered, whenever he could he gave me a few coins so that I could buy myself some treats like the other children. He was convinced that I spent them on licorice sticks, sunflower seeds, or sweets, but I would keep them in a coffee tin under the bed, 30 and when I'd collected four or five reales I'd secretly rush out to buy myself a book.My favorite place in the whole city was the Sempere \& Sons bookshop on Calle Santa Ana. It smelled of old paper and dust and it was my35 sanctuary, my refuge. The bookseller would let me sit on a chair in a corner and read any book I liked to my heart's content. He hardly ever allowed me to pay for the books he placed in my hands, but when he wasn't looking I'd leave the coins I'd managed to 40 collect on the counter before I left. It was only small change-if I'd had to buy a book with that pittance, I would probably have been able to afford only a booklet of cigarette papers. When it was time for me to leave, I would do so dragging my feet, a weight on $45 \mathrm{my}$ soul. If it had been up to me, I would have stayed there forever.One Christmas Sempere gave me the best gift I have ever received. It was an old volume, read and experienced to the full.50 "Great Expectations, by Charles Dickens," I read on the cover.I was aware that Sempere knew a few authors who frequented his establishment and, judging by the care with which he handled the volume, I thought 55 perhaps this Mr. Dickens was one of them."A friend of yours?""A lifelong friend. And from now on, he's your friend too." That afternoon I took my new friend home, 60 hidden under my clothes so that my father wouldn't see it. It was a rainy winter, with days as gray as lead, and I read Great Expectations about nine times, partly because I had no other book at hand, partly because I did not think there could be a better one in 65 the whole world and I was beginning to suspect that Mr. Dickens had written it just for me. Soon I was convinced that I didn't want to do anything else in life but learn to do what Mr. Dickens had done.

## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:**
I focused too narrowly on the act of payment and the narrator's intent to pay less than expected. I failed to consider the larger context of the value of the books and the meager sum the narrator could afford.
**Error Keywords:**
*   Misinterpretation
*   Ignoring context
*   Overlooking implied meaning
**Solution:**
1.  **Reread the relevant passage:** Focus on the description of the narrator's payment and the value of the books.
2.  **Analyze the narrator's financial situation:** He saves small amounts of money given for treats and can only afford "a booklet of cigarette papers" with that amount.
3.  **Consider the value of the books:** The bookshop is described as containing valuable old books, and the narrator is allowed to read any book he wants.
4.  **Compare the narrator's payment to the value of the books:** The small amount of money is clearly much less than the actual worth of the books.
5.  **Choose the answer reflecting the significant difference in value:** Option D accurately describes the situation.
**Instructions for Future Questions:**
1.  Read the entire passage and question carefully.
2.  Identify key details and their relationships within the context.
3.  Consider the implied meaning and author's intent beyond the literal words.
4.  Evaluate each answer choice against the full understanding of the passage.
5.  Choose the answer that best reflects the overall context and nuances of the text.
**General Advice for Similar Problems:**
*   **Develop a holistic understanding of the text:** Pay attention to the setting, characters, plot, and themes.
*   **Consider the author's purpose and point of view:** Analyze the language and tone to grasp the underlying message.
*   **Think critically and avoid assumptions:** Don't jump to conclusions based on limited information.
*   **Practice active reading and comprehension skills:** Engage with the text by asking questions and making inferences. 
*   **Expand vocabulary and knowledge of literary devices:** This enhances understanding of complex texts.
