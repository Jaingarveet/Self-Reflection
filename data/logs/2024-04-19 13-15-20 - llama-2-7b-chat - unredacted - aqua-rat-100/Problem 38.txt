## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I correctly answered the question by using the information provided to calculate the number of faces of the smaller cubes that remain unpainted.

Error Keywords:
 - Misunderstanding the problem
 - Calculation error
 - Counting error
Solution:
The hollow cube has a size of 5cm, and the thickness is 1cm, making the volume of the cube 5cm x 5cm x 1cm = 25 cm³.
The cube is made of smaller cubes of size 1cm, so the number of smaller cubes that can fit inside the hollow cube is 25 cm³ / 1 cm³ = 25.
The outer surface of the cube is painted, so the number of faces of the smaller cubes that remain unpainted is 25 - 6 (faces of the smaller cubes that are not painted) = 19.
Instructions:
1. Calculate the volume of the hollow cube.
2. Determine the number of smaller cubes that can fit inside the hollow cube.
3. Calculate the number of faces of the smaller cubes that remain unpainted.
4. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that the number of faces of a cube is 6, regardless of its size.

Question: A hollow cube of size 5cm is taken, with the thickness of 1cm. It is made of smaller cubes of size 1cm .If the outer surface of the cube is painted how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted?

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly. I misunderstood the problem and calculated the number of faces of the smaller cubes incorrectly.

Error Keywords: Misunderstanding the problem, Calculation error, Counting error

Solution:
To calculate the number of faces of the smaller cubes that remain unpainted, we need to first calculate the volume of the hollow cube. The volume of the hollow cube is 5cm x 5cm x 1cm = 25 cm³.
Since the cube is made of smaller cubes of size 1cm, the number of smaller cubes that can fit inside the hollow cube is 25 cm³ / 1 cm³ = 25.
The outer surface of the cube is painted, so the number of faces of the smaller cubes that remain unpainted is 25 - 6 (faces of the smaller cubes that are not painted) = 19.

Therefore, the answer is (D) 19.

Advice: Always read the question carefully and understand the problem. Decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps. Think through each subproblem step-by-step. Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning. Always double-check your calculations and final answer. Remember that the number of faces of a cube is 6, regardless of its size.
