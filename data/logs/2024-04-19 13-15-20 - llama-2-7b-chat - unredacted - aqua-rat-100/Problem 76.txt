Question: If n is such that 36 ≤ n ≤ 72, then x = (n2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16) / (n+ 4√n+ 4) satisfies
Choices:
  A: 20 < x < 54
  B: 23 < x < 58
  C: 25 < x < 64
  D: 28 < x < 60
  E: None of these
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
You have correctly analyzed the expression for x and determined the range of values for x based on the values of n. However, you made a small mistake in your calculation for n = 72.

Here's the correct calculation for n = 72:

x = (722 + 2√72(72 + 4) + 16) / (72 + 4√72 + 4)
= (504 + 144 + 16) / (76 + 32 + 4)
= 1.29

So, the correct answer is (D) 28 < x < 60.

Solution:

Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
Iowa State University is located in the state of Iowa.
The city name "Ames" contains 4 letters.
The state name "Iowa" contains 4 letters.
The product of 4*4 is 16.

Instructions:

1. Identify the city where the university is located.
2. Identify the state where the university is located.
3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.
4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.
5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.
6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.
7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.

Advice:

* Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
* Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
* Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
* Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
* Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
* Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them.

Question: If n is such that 36 ≤ n ≤ 72, then x = (n2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16) / (n+ 4√n+ 4) satisfies

Action: Answer("D")

Explanation:

To solve this problem, we need to determine the value of x based on the values of n. We can start by simplifying the expression for x:

x = (n2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16) / (n+ 4√n+ 4)

We know that 36 ≤ n ≤ 72, so we can substitute these values into the expression for x:

x = (362 + 2√36(36 + 4) + 16) / (36 + 4√36 + 4)
= (252 + 144 + 16) / (36 + 12 + 4)
= 1.29

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 28 < x < 60.

Error Keywords:

* Calculation error
* Miscalculation
* Incorrect reasoning

Solution:

To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps outlined in the instructions:

1. Identify the city where the university is located: Ames
2. Identify the state where the university is located: Iowa
3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city: 4 letters
4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state: 4 letters
5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state: 4*4 = 16
6. Work step-by-step through our mathematical calculations:

x = (722 + 2√72(72 + 4) + 16) / (72 + 4√72 + 4)
= (504 + 144 + 16) / (76 + 32 + 4)
= 1.29

Therefore, the answer is (D) 28 < x < 60.

* Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
* Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
* Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
* Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
