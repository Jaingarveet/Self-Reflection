## Assistant 2:
  Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly as (A) 56. Upon reviewing my solution, I realized that I made a mistake in calculating the perimeter of the original square cloth.

To find the perimeter of the original square cloth, we need to find the perimeter of the rectangle that is formed by trimming 4 feet from one edge of the square. The perimeter of a rectangle is found by adding the lengths of all four sides.

So, the perimeter of the original square cloth is:
Perimeter = 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 16 feet

Now, we need to cut the rectangle in half to form two triangles. The perimeter of each triangle is half the perimeter of the original rectangle, or:
Perimeter of each triangle = 16 / 2 = 8 feet

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 58.

I apologize for any confusion caused by my previous incorrect answer. Thank you for giving me another chance to solve the problem correctly!
