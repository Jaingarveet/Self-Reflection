Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
You are correct that the monthly sales should be $20,000 to reach a monthly salary of $1500. However, the answer I provided is incorrect. The correct answer is (D) $20,000.

Here's why:

You set up the equation correctly:

$500 + (monthly sales x 5%) = $1500

Subtracting $500 from both sides gives you:

$500 + (monthly sales x 5%) = $1000

Dividing both sides by 5% gives you:

Monthly sales = $20,000

Great job!

## Assistant 2:
  Thank you for the feedback and tips! I'll make sure to keep them in mind as I work through similar problems in the future.

Now, let's apply the steps to solve the original problem:

Question: What should the monthly sales be so that the monthly salary of a shop assistant reaches $1500?

Step 1: Read the question carefully and understand what is being asked.
The question asks us to find the monthly sales that will result in a monthly salary of $1500 for a shop assistant.

Step 2: Set up the equation or formula that will help us solve the problem.
We know that the monthly salary of the shop assistant is the sum of a fixed salary of $500 plus 5% of all monthly sales. So, we can set up the equation:

$500 + (monthly sales x 5%) = $1500

Step 3: Isolate the variable or term we want to solve for.
We want to find the monthly sales that will result in a monthly salary of $1500, so we need to isolate the variable "monthly sales".

Step 4: Use algebraic manipulation to solve for the variable or term we are trying to find.
We can subtract $500 from both sides of the equation to get:

$500 + (monthly sales x 5%) = $1000

Then, we can divide both sides of the equation by 5% to get:

Monthly sales = $20,000

Step 5: Check our answer to make sure it is reasonable and makes sense in the context of the problem.
In this case, it makes sense that the monthly sales would need to be at least $20,000 to result in a monthly salary of $1500 for a shop assistant.

Therefore, the answer is (D) $20,000.
