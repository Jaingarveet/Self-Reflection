Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I made a mistake in my calculation. I incorrectly calculated the percentage of chocolates that are both vanilla flavored and not squashed.

The correct calculation is:

90% of 100% - 10% of 100% = 90% - 10% = 80%

So, the percentage of chocolates that are both vanilla flavored and not squashed is 80%.

Question: In a chocolate store, all chocolates are either vanilla or cocoa flavored only. 10% of the chocolates are cocoa flavored, 90% of the rest are squashed. What percentage of the chocolates are both vanilla flavored and not squashed?

Action: Answer("B")

Explanation:

To find the percentage of chocolates that are both vanilla flavored and not squashed, we need to calculate the percentage of chocolates that are not squashed and then multiply it by the percentage of vanilla flavored chocolates.

Let's first calculate the percentage of chocolates that are not squashed:

90% of 100% - 10% of 100% = 90% - 10% = 80%

So, 80% of the chocolates are not squashed.

Next, let's calculate the percentage of vanilla flavored chocolates:

10% of 100% = 10%

So, 10% of the chocolates are vanilla flavored.

Now, let's multiply the percentage of chocolates that are not squashed by the percentage of vanilla flavored chocolates:

80% x 10% = 8%

Therefore, the percentage of chocolates that are both vanilla flavored and not squashed is 8%.

Solution:

I apologize for my mistake earlier. Here is the correct solution:

Step 1: Identify the city where the university is located.
The city where Iowa State University is located is Ames.

Step 2: Identify the state where the university is located.
The state where Iowa State University is located is Iowa.

Step 3: Count the number of letters in the name of the city.
The name "Ames" contains 4 letters.

Step 4: Count the number of letters in the name of the state.
The name "Iowa" contains 4 letters.

Step 5: Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.
4 x 4 = 16

Step 6: Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.

Step 7: Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.

Step 8: Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.

Answer: B
