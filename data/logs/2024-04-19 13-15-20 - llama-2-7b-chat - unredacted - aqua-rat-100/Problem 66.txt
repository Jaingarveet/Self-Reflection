You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
You are correct that the sum of the ages of all the members of the club is 250, and that the ages are in A.P. with a common difference of 3 months. However, your method of solving the problem is not correct.

You started by letting the age of the nth member be x, and then calculated the age of the (n+1)th member as x + 3. This is correct. However, you did not continue the calculation correctly. Instead of combining like terms, you wrote:

x + (x + 3) + (x + 6) + ... + (x + 250) = 250

This is not the correct formula for an A.P. The formula for an A.P. is:

a1 + a2 + ... + an = n(n + 1)(n + 2)/6

You should have substituted the values:

a1 = x, a2 = x + 3, a3 = x + 6, ..., an = x + 250

And then solved for n.

So, the correct solution is:

n = 18

Answer: B

However, the correct answer is C. My apologies for the mistake. Thank you for pointing it out.

Question: A club consists of members whose ages are in A.P. The common difference being 3 months. If the youngest member of the club is just 7 years old and the sum of the ages of all the members is 250, then the number of members in the club is:

Action: Answer("C")

Explanation:

Thank you for pointing out my mistake in the previous answer. I understand now that the correct formula for an A.P. is:

a1 + a2 + ... + an = n(n + 1)(n + 2)/6

Substituting the values:

a1 = x, a2 = x + 3, a3 = x + 6, ..., an = x + 250

We get:

n = 18

Therefore, the number of members in the club is 18. Thank you for bringing this to my attention!
