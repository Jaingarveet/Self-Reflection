## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: There are 10 oranges in a basket. Find the no. of ways in which 2 oranges are chosen from the basket?
Choices:
  A: 45
  B: 90
  C: 120
  D: 150
  E: 180

Explanation:
I misunderstood the problem and applied the wrong combinatorial principle. I thought the problem was asking for the number of ways to choose 2 oranges from a basket of 10 oranges, which is a classic problem in combinatorics. However, the correct approach is to use the principle of permutations, as we are counting the number of ways to arrange 2 oranges from the basket.

Error Keywords:

* Combinatorics
* Permutations
* Misapplication of principles

Solution:
To find the number of ways to choose 2 oranges from a basket of 10 oranges, we need to use the principle of permutations. There are 10 oranges in the basket, and we need to arrange 2 of them in a particular order. Therefore, the number of ways to choose 2 oranges from the basket is:

10C2 = 10 × 9 = 90

Instructions:

1. Identify the principle of combinatorics or permutations that applies to the problem.
2. Count the number of elements in the set (in this case, the number of oranges in the basket).
3. Use the principle of combinatorics or permutations to calculate the number of ways to choose a subset of that size.
4. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
5. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:

* Always read the question carefully and understand the problem before answering.
* Use the correct principle of combinatorics or permutations for the problem.
* Count the number of elements in the set and use it to calculate the number of ways to choose a subset of that size.
* Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
* Remember that the number of ways to choose a subset of a set is calculated using the principle of permutations.
