Action: Answer("C")
## Assistant 2:
  Reflection:

I previously answered this question incorrectly, and upon reviewing my solution, I realized that I made a mistake in calculating the area of the remaining paper. Here's how I arrived at the correct answer:

The square paper has a side length of 20 cm, so its area is 20 cm x 20 cm = 400 cm^2.

When two semi-circles are drawn as diameters, the area of the remaining paper is the difference between the area of the original square and the area of the two semi-circles.

The area of each semi-circle is equal to half the area of the original square, since the semi-circles are drawn as diameters. Therefore, the area of each semi-circle is 400 cm^2 / 2 = 200 cm^2.

So, the area of the remaining paper is 400 cm^2 - 200 cm^2 = 200 cm^2.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 200 cm^2.
