Explanation:
Great, let's break down the solution step by step!

Step 1: Identify the greatest common factor (GCF) of the two positive integers. In this case, the GCF is 11.

Step 2: Divide both integers by their GCF to simplify the problem. Let's say the smaller integer is x, then the larger integer is 3x.

Step 3: Find the least common multiple (LCM) of 3x and x. We can do this by multiplying both integers together: 3x × x = 7700.

Step 4: Simplify the equation by multiplying both sides by 3: x × x = 23100.

Step 5: Find the value of x by dividing both sides by 2: x = 11550.

Step 6: Find the value of the other integer by using the fact that the GCF of 3x and x is 11: 3x = 31550.

Action: Answer("B")

Correct Answer: A

Great job! You have successfully solved the problem using the steps provided. Remember to always break down complex problems into smaller, manageable steps to ensure accuracy and clarity in your reasoning.
