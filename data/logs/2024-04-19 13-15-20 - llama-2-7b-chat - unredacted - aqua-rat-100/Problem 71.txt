Explanation:
To find the time it takes for the cars to meet, we need to use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

In this case, the distance between the two cars is 50 miles (which is equal to 80.47 kilometers). The speed of the first car is 12 mph, and the speed of the second car is 13 mph.

Time = 80.47 km / (12 mph + 13 mph)
Time = 80.47 km / 25 mph
Time = 3.22 hours

Therefore, the cars will meet after 3.22 hours (or 3 hours and 12 minutes) of driving.

I hope this revised solution is correct! Let me know if you have any further questions.
