Explanation:
You are correct! Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Arjun gives $30 to Sajal, so Sajal now has $60 left.
2. Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, so Arjun now has $30.

Now, let's use the information that Sajal has $60 left, and Arjun has $30 to find the initial amounts of money each had:

Sajal had $60 - $30 = $30 initially.
Arjun had $30 initially.

So, the correct answer is (C) $34, $62.
