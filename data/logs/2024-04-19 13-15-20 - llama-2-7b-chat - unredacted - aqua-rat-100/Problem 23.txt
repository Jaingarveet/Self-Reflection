Explanation:
I made a mistake in my solution to the problem. I correctly identified the formula to find the cost price of the article, but I made an error in my calculations.

The correct formula to find the cost price of the article is:

Cost price = Selling price / (1 + Profit percentage)

Substituting the given values, we get:

Cost price = Rs.360 / (1 + 0.20)
= Rs.360 / 1.20
= Rs.300

However, the correct answer is (B) Rs.300.

Error Keywords:

* Calculation error
* Arithmetic error
* Misapplication of formula

Advice:

* Always double-check your calculations, especially when working with percentages.
* Make sure to apply the formula correctly and accurately.
* Use the correct formula for the problem, and avoid using shortcuts or assumptions that are not justified.
* Take your time and work step-by-step through the problem to ensure accuracy.
