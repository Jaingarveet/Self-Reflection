Question: In a chocolate store, all chocolates are either vanilla or cocoa flavored only. 10% of the chocolates are cocoa flavored, 90% of the rest are squashed. What percentage of the chocolates are both vanilla flavored and not squashed?
Choices:
  A: 1%
  B: 2%
  C: 5%
  D: 9%
  E: 10%
## Assistant 2:
Let's approach this step-by-step:
1. First, let's find the percentage of vanilla flavored chocolates:
   - 10% of the chocolates are cocoa flavored
   - So, the remaining 90% must be vanilla flavored
2. Now, out of these 90% vanilla flavored chocolates, 90% are squashed:
   - 90% of 90% = 0.9 Ã— 0.9 = 0.81 = 81%
   - This means 81% of all chocolates are vanilla flavored and squashed
3. To find the percentage of chocolates that are vanilla flavored and not squashed:
   - Total vanilla flavored chocolates = 90%
   - Vanilla flavored and squashed chocolates = 81%
   - So, vanilla flavored and not squashed chocolates = 90% - 81% = 9%
Therefore, 9% of the chocolates are both vanilla flavored and not squashed.
