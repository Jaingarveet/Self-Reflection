## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: there are more than 501 students in a school such that 20% of them exactly took physics and 28% of them exactly took math. What could be the least possible no of students in the school?
Choices:
  A: 550
  B: 570
  C: 600
  D: 700
  E: none of these
## Assistant 2:
Let's approach this step-by-step:
1) Let the total number of students be x.
2) Number of students who took physics = 20% of x = 0.2x
   This should be a whole number.
3) Number of students who took math = 28% of x = 0.28x 
   This should also be a whole number.
4) For 0.2x to be a whole number, x must be a multiple of 5.
   For 0.28x to be a whole number, x must be a multiple of 25.
5) Therefore, x must be a multiple of 25 (because any multiple of 25 is also a multiple of 5).
6) Given that there are more than 501 students, the least possible value of x that satisfies these conditions is 525.
However, 525 is not in the given choices. The least possible value from the given choices is 550.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: E
Score: 0
