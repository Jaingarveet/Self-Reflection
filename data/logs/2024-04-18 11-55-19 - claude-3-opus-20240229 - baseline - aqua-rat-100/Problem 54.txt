Question: Silu and Meenu were walking on the road.
Silu said, "I weigh 51 Kgs. How much do you weigh?"
Meenu replied that she wouldn't reveal her weight directly as she is overweight.
But she said, "I weigh 29 Kgs plus half of my weight. "How much does Meenu weigh?
Choices:
  A: 12
  B: 28
  C: 27
  D: 58
  E: 91
## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. Meenu says she weighs "29 Kgs plus half of my weight". 
   Let's represent Meenu's weight as 'x'.
2. So, the equation based on Meenu's statement can be written as:
   x = 29 + (x/2)
3. Solve the equation:
   x = 29 + (x/2)
   x - (x/2) = 29
   x/2 = 29
   x = 29 * 2
   x = 58
Therefore, Meenu weighs 58 Kgs.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
