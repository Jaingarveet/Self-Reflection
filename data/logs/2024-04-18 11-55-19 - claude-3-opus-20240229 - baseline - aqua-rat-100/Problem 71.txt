Topic: Math
Question: Two cars start at the same time from opposite ends of a highway that is 50 miles long. One car is riding at 12 mph and the second car is riding at 13 mph. How long after they begin will they meet?
Choices:
  A:  1
  B:  1.25
  C:  1.50
  D:  1.75
  E:  2
## Assistant 2:
Let's approach this step-by-step:
1) Let the time when the cars meet be t hours.
2) In t hours, the first car covers a distance of 12t miles, and the second car covers a distance of 13t miles.
3) When they meet, the total distance covered by both cars together will be 50 miles (the length of the highway).
4) So, we can write the equation:
   12t + 13t = 50
5) Simplifying:
   25t = 50
6) Solving for t:
   t = 50/25 = 2
Therefore, the cars will meet 2 hours after they begin.
Action: Answer("E")
