Question: Mark told John "If you give me half your money I will have Rs.75. John said, "if you give me one third of your money, I will have Rs.75/-. How much money did John have ?
Choices:
  A: 22
  B: 60
  C: 28
  D: 26
  E: 18
## Assistant 2:
Let's solve this step-by-step:
1. Let's say John has x rupees.
2. Mark says if John gives him half of x, Mark will have 75 rupees. This means:
   (Mark's current money) + x/2 = 75
3. John says if Mark gives him one-third of his current money, John will have 75 rupees. This means:
   x + (Mark's current money)/3 = 75
4. From equation 2, we can say that Mark's current money is (75 - x/2).
5. Substituting this in equation 3:
   x + (75 - x/2)/3 = 75
6. Solving this equation:
   x + 25 - x/6 = 75
   6x + 150 - x = 450
   5x = 300
   x = 60
Therefore, John has 60 rupees.
Action: Answer("B")
