Question: Six pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as do two rolls. Three rolls contain the same amount of falafel as five baguettes do. Two baguettes contain the same amount of falafel as how many pita breads?
Choices:
  A: 12/25
  B: 3/2
  C: 3
  D: 2
  E: 25/3
## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1) Let's assign variables:
   Let p = number of pita breads
   Let r = number of rolls
   Let b = number of baguettes
2) From the given information:
   6p = 2r (six pita breads have the same amount of falafel as two rolls)
   3r = 5b (three rolls have the same amount of falafel as five baguettes)
3) We want to find how many pita breads have the same amount of falafel as two baguettes. Let's call this number x.
   So, xp = 2b
4) From the first equation, we can express r in terms of p:
   6p = 2r
   r = 3p
5) Substituting this into the second equation:
   3(3p) = 5b
   9p = 5b
6) Now, we have xp = 2b and 9p = 5b. We can solve for x:
   xp = 2b
   x(9p) = x(5b) (multiplying both sides by x)
   9xp = 10b (using the fact that xp = 2b)
   9x = 10
   x = 10/9
Therefore, two baguettes contain the same amount of falafel as 10/9 pita breads.
Looking at the choices, the closest answer is B: 3/2, which is equal to 1.5. 10/9 is approximately 1.11, which is closer to 1 than to 1.5.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: C
