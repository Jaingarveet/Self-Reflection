Question: 30 is subtracted from a number, it is reduced to its one third. What is the value of 50% of that number?
Choices:
  A: 22.5
  B: 84
  C: 21
  D: 24
  E: 25
## Assistant 2:
Let's solve this step-by-step:
1. Let the original number be x.
2. According to the question, when 30 is subtracted from x, it becomes one-third of x.
   Mathematically, x - 30 = x/3
3. Solve the equation:
   x - 30 = x/3
   3x - 90 = x
   2x = 90
   x = 45
4. So, the original number is 45.
5. The question asks for 50% of 45.
   50% of 45 = 0.5 Ã— 45 = 22.5
Therefore, the correct answer is 22.5.
Action: Answer("A")
