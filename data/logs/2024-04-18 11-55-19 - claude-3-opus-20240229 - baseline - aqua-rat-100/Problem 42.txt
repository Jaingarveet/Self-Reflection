Question: A straight picket fence is composed of x pickets each of which is 1/2 inch wide. If there are 6 inches of space between each pair of pickets, which of the following represents the length of fence in feet?
Choices:
  A: 13x/2
  B: 13x/2 - 6
  C: 13x/24
  D: (13x+1)/24
  E: (13x-12)/24
## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) Each picket is 1/2 inch wide.
2) There are 6 inches of space between each pair of pickets.
3) So, the total width of one picket plus one space is 1/2 + 6 = 13/2 inches.
4) If there are x pickets, the total width of all pickets and spaces is 13x/2 inches.
5) But the question asks for the length of the fence in feet.
6) To convert inches to feet, we need to divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot).
7) So, the length of the fence in feet is (13x/2) / 12 = 13x/24 feet.
Action: Answer("C")
