Question: An athlete runs M miles in 4 hours, then rides a bike N miles in the same number of hours. Which of the following represents the average speed, in miles per hour, for these two activities combined?
Choices:
  A: M + N / 8
  B: 2M + N / 8
  C: M + N / 4
  D: M + 3N / 8
  E: M + N / 5
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1) The athlete spends a total of 8 hours on these activities (4 hours running and 4 hours biking).
2) The total distance covered is M miles running + N miles biking, which is M + N miles.
3) Average speed is calculated by dividing the total distance by the total time.
4) So, the average speed for these two activities combined would be:
   (Total Distance) / (Total Time) = (M + N) / 8
5) Looking at the choices, the one that matches this expression is choice A: M + N / 8.
Therefore, the correct answer is A.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
