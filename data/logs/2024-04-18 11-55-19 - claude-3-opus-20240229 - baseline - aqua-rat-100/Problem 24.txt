Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.

Question: An exam is given in a certain class. The average (arithmetic mean) of the highest score and the lowest score is equal to x. If the average score for the entire class is equal to y and there are z students in the class, where z > 5, then in terms of x, y, and z, what is the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers?
Choices:
  A: (zy – 2x)/z
  B: (zy – 2)/z
  C: (zx – y)/(z – 2)
  D: (zy – 2x)/(z -2)
  E: (zy – x)/(z + 2)
## Assistant 2:
Let's approach this step-by-step:
1) Let's say the highest score is H and the lowest score is L. We are given that the average of H and L is x:
   (H + L)/2 = x
2) The sum of all scores in the class is zy, since y is the average score and there are z students.
3) If we remove the highest and lowest scores, the sum of the remaining scores would be zy - H - L.
4) The number of remaining students after removing the highest and lowest scorers is z - 2.
5) The average of the remaining scores is the sum of the remaining scores divided by the number of remaining students:
   (zy - H - L)/(z - 2)
6) We can substitute H + L with 2x based on the information from step 1:
   (zy - 2x)/(z - 2)
This matches choice D.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
