Question: A square piece of cloth is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge to form a rectangular piece, which is then cut diagonally in half to create two triangles. If the area of each of triangle is 70 square feet, what was the perimeter (in feet) of the original piece of square cloth?
Choices:
  A: 56
  B: 58
  C: 60
  D: 62
  E: 64
## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's approach this step-by-step:
1. Let's say the original square cloth had a side length of x feet.
2. After trimming 4 feet on one edge, the rectangular piece has dimensions of x feet by (x - 4) feet.
3. This rectangle is cut diagonally to form two triangles. Each triangle has a base of x feet and a height of (x - 4) feet.
4. We're told that the area of each triangle is 70 square feet. The area of a triangle is given by the formula: Area = (1/2) * base * height
5. Substituting the values:
   70 = (1/2) * x * (x - 4)
   140 = x^2 - 4x
   x^2 - 4x - 140 = 0
6. This is a quadratic equation. We can solve it using the quadratic formula:
   x = [-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)] / 2a
   Here, a = 1, b = -4, c = -140
7. Solving:
   x = [4 ± √(16 + 560)] / 2
   x = [4 ± √576] / 2
   x = [4 ± 24] / 2
   x = 14 or -10
8. Since the side length can't be negative, x must be 14.
9. The perimeter of the original square cloth is 4 times the side length. So, the perimeter is 4 * 14 = 56 feet.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
