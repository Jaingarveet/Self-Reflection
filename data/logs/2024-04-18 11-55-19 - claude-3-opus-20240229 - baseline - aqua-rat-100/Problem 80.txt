Question: Jack buys 18 sharpeners (white and brown) for rs. 100. If he pays 1 rupee more for each white than brown sharpeners. How many of white and how many brown sharpeners did he buy?
Choices:
  A: 10,8
  B: 9,8
  C: 7,8
  D: 5,6
  E: 11,12
## Assistant 2:
Let's approach this step-by-step:
1. Let the number of white sharpeners be x and the number of brown sharpeners be y.
2. We know that the total number of sharpeners is 18, so x + y = 18.
3. Let the cost of each brown sharpener be z rupees. Then, each white sharpener costs (z + 1) rupees.
4. The total cost of all sharpeners is 100 rupees, so we can write the equation:
   x(z + 1) + yz = 100
5. We have two equations:
   x + y = 18
   x(z + 1) + yz = 100
6. Substituting y = 18 - x in the second equation:
   x(z + 1) + (18 - x)z = 100
   xz + x + 18z - xz = 100
   x + 18z = 100
7. We can't solve this equation further as we have two unknowns (x and z). However, we can try the given options to see which one satisfies the equation.
8. Trying option A: 10 white and 8 brown sharpeners
   10 + 18z = 100
   18z = 90
   z = 5
   Each brown sharpener costs 5 rupees and each white sharpener costs 6 rupees.
   Total cost = 10 × 6 + 8 × 5 = 60 + 40 = 100 rupees
   This satisfies the given conditions.
None of the other options satisfy the given conditions.
Action: Answer("A")
