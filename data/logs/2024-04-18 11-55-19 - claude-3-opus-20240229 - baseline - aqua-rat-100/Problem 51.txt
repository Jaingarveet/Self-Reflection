## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: R, S, T, and U are points on a line, and U is the midpoint of line segment ST. If the lengths of line segments RS, RT, and ST are 5, 17, and 22, respectively. What is the length of line segment RU?
Choices:
  A: 6
  B: 7
  C: 8
  D: 9
  E: 10
## Assistant 2:
Let's approach this step-by-step:
1) We know that U is the midpoint of ST. This means that SU = UT = ST/2.
2) The length of ST is given as 22. So, SU = UT = 22/2 = 11.
3) We also know that RT = 17. Since RT = RU + UT, we can write:
   17 = RU + 11
4) Solving for RU:
   RU = 17 - 11 = 6
Therefore, the length of line segment RU is 6.
Action: Answer("A")
