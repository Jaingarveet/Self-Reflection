## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: A starts travel towards south 3km, then travel 5 km towards east, and again travels 3 km to north, and finally travels 2km towards west. In the end how far from is A from home?
Choices:
  A: 3km
  B: 2km
  C: 4km
  D: 5km
  E: 6km
## Assistant 2:
Let's break this down step-by-step:
1. A starts by traveling 3 km south. This can be represented as -3 on a vertical axis.
2. Then A travels 5 km east. This can be represented as +5 on a horizontal axis.
3. Next, A travels 3 km north. This cancels out the initial 3 km south, so A is now back at 0 on the vertical axis.
4. Finally, A travels 2 km west. This can be represented as -2 on the horizontal axis.
So, A's final position is 0 on the vertical axis (no net north/south movement) and +3 on the horizontal axis (5 km east - 2 km west).
To find the straight-line distance from home, we can use the Pythagorean theorem:
distance^2 = 0^2 + 3^2
distance^2 = 9
distance = sqrt(9) = 3
Therefore, at the end of the journey, A is 3 km away from home.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
