Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")

Question: One gram of a certain health food contains 9 percent of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E and 8 percent of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A. If vitamins E and A are to be obtained from no other source, how many grams of the health food must be eaten daily to provide at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins?
Choices:
  A: 8.5
  B: 10.5
  C: 12.5
  D: 14.5
  E: 16.5
## Assistant 2:
Let's approach this step-by-step:
1) Let the required number of grams be x.
2) For vitamin E, 9% of x must be at least 100% of the daily requirement. 
   So, 0.09x ≥ 100, or x ≥ 100/0.09 ≈ 1111.11
3) For vitamin A, 8% of x must be at least 100% of the daily requirement.
   So, 0.08x ≥ 100, or x ≥ 100/0.08 = 1250
4) To satisfy both conditions, we need the larger of these two values.
   1250 > 1111.11, so x must be at least 1250.
5) Looking at the choices, 12.5 grams is the smallest amount that's at least 1250 grams.
Action: Answer("C")
