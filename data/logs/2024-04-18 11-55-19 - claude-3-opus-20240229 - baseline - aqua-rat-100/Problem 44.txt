Question: 8 man work for 6 days to complete a work. How many men are required to complete same work in 1/2 day.
Choices:
  A: 93 men
  B: 94 men
  C: 95 men
  D: 96 men
  E: 97 men
## Assistant 2:
Let's approach this step-by-step:
1. First, let's calculate the total man-days required to complete the work:
   * 8 men work for 6 days
   * Total man-days = 8 × 6 = 48 man-days
2. Now, we need to find how many men are required to complete the same work in 1/2 day:
   * Let the required number of men be x
   * Since the total man-days must remain the same:
     x men × 1/2 day = 48 man-days
     x × 1/2 = 48
     x = 48 ÷ 1/2 = 48 × 2 = 96
Therefore, 96 men are required to complete the same work in 1/2 day.
Action: Answer("D")
