Topic: Math
Question: A rectangular piece of 150 sq m has a length which is 1m more than the 4 times the breadth. What is the perimeter of the piece?
Choices:
  A: 60 m
  B: 61 m
  C: 62 m
  D: 63 m
  E: 64 m
## Assistant 2:
Let's approach this step-by-step:
1. Let the breadth of the rectangle be x meters.
2. Then, the length will be (4x + 1) meters.
3. The area of the rectangle is given as 150 sq m. So, we can write:
   x(4x + 1) = 150
4. Expanding the equation:
   4x^2 + x - 150 = 0
5. Solving this quadratic equation:
   (4x - 15)(x + 10) = 0
   So, x = 15/4 or -10
   Since breadth can't be negative, x = 15/4 = 3.75 m
6. The length is 4x + 1 = 4(3.75) + 1 = 16 m
7. Perimeter of a rectangle is 2(length + breadth)
   = 2(16 + 3.75)
   = 2(19.75)
   = 39.5 m
The closest option to 39.5 m is 40 m.
