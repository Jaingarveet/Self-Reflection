Question: A newspaper costs $4 on Sunday and $1 the rest of the days of the week. If a hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week and pays $210 per week for newspapers, how many newspapers does it buy on Monday?
Choices:
  A: 15
  B: 30
  C: 45
  D: 60
  E: 75
## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1. Let the number of newspapers bought on Monday (and the other weekdays) be x.
2. On Sunday, the hotel buys 2x newspapers.
3. The total cost for a week is $210. This includes the cost for Sunday and the other 6 days.
We can set up an equation:
- Cost of Sunday papers: 2x * $4 = $8x
- Cost of weekday papers: 6x * $1 = $6x
- Total cost: $8x + $6x = $210
4. Simplify the equation:
   $14x = $210
5. Solve for x:
   x = $210 / $14 = 15
Therefore, the hotel buys 15 newspapers on Monday.
