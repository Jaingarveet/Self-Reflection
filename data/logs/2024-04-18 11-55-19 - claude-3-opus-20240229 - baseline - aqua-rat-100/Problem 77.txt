## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: The sum of the 5 consecutive two digit odd numbers when divided by 10 becomes a perfect square, which of the following can be one of these 5 numbers?
Choices:
  A: 47
  B: 91
  C: 41
  D: 67
  E: 44
## Assistant 2:
Let's approach this step-by-step:
1) The question is about 5 consecutive odd numbers. Let's represent these numbers as: 
   (n-4), (n-2), n, (n+2), (n+4), where n is an odd number.
2) The sum of these numbers is:
   (n-4) + (n-2) + n + (n+2) + (n+4) = 5n
3) We are told that when this sum is divided by 10, it becomes a perfect square. 
   In other words, 5n/10 = n/2 is a perfect square.
4) For n/2 to be a perfect square, n must be an even number. But we know that n is an odd number (given in the question). 
   The only way for an odd number divided by 2 to be a perfect square is if the odd number itself is a perfect square.
5) So, n must be an odd perfect square. The odd perfect squares are: 1, 9, 25, 49, 81, 121, ...
6) Now, we need to check which of the given options, when substituted for n, makes all 5 numbers two-digit numbers.
   If n = 9, the numbers are 5, 7, 9, 11, 13 (not all two-digit numbers).
   If n = 25, the numbers are 21, 23, 25, 27, 29 (all two-digit numbers).
   If n = 49, the numbers are 45, 47, 49, 51, 53 (all two-digit numbers).
   If n = 81, the numbers are 77, 79, 81, 83, 85 (all two-digit numbers).
7) Among the given options, 47 is present in the series when n = 49.
Therefore, 47 can be one of the 5 consecutive odd numbers.
