## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Question: X and Y are two alloys which were made by mixing zinc and copper in the ratio 6:9 and 7:11, respectively. If 40 grams of alloy X and 60 grams of alloy Y are melted and mixed to form alloy Z, what is the ratio of zinc and copper in the alloy Z ?
Choices:
  A: 69:91
  B: 59:91
  C: 59:90
  D: 59:91
  E: 69:101
## Assistant 2:
Let's approach this step-by-step:
1. In alloy X, the ratio of zinc to copper is 6:9. This means that in 15 parts of alloy X, 6 parts are zinc and 9 parts are copper.
   - In 40 grams of alloy X, there are (6/15) * 40 = 16 grams of zinc and (9/15) * 40 = 24 grams of copper.
2. In alloy Y, the ratio of zinc to copper is 7:11. This means that in 18 parts of alloy Y, 7 parts are zinc and 11 parts are copper.
   - In 60 grams of alloy Y, there are (7/18) * 60 = 23.33 grams of zinc and (11/18) * 60 = 36.67 grams of copper.
3. In alloy Z, which is formed by mixing 40 grams of alloy X and 60 grams of alloy Y:
   - Total zinc = 16 grams (from X) + 23.33 grams (from Y) = 39.33 grams
   - Total copper = 24 grams (from X) + 36.67 grams (from Y) = 60.67 grams
4. The ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z is 39.33 : 60.67, which can be simplified to 59 : 91.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
