Question: There are 10 oranges in a basket. Find the no. of ways in which 2 oranges are chosen from the basket?
Choices:
  A: 45
  B: 90
  C: 120
  D: 150
  E: 180
## Assistant 2:
To find the number of ways to choose 2 oranges from a basket of 10 oranges, we can use the combination formula:
nCr = n! / (r! * (n-r)!)
where n is the total number of items (10 oranges) and r is the number of items being chosen (2 oranges).
Plugging in the values:
10C2 = 10! / (2! * (10-2)!)
     = 10! / (2! * 8!)
     = (10 * 9 * 8!) / (2 * 1 * 8!)
     = 90 / 2
     = 45
Therefore, there are 45 ways to choose 2 oranges from a basket of 10 oranges.
Action: Answer("A")
