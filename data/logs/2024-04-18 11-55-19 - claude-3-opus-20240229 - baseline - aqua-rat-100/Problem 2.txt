Question: The average (arithmetic mean) of the weight of 10 vehicles is 12.2 tons. The average weight of the group of vehicles increased by 2.6 tons after a new heavy duty truck was added to the group? What is the weight in tons of the heavy duty truck?
Choices:
  A: 40.8
  B: 41.6
  C: 42.2
  D: 43.5
  E: 44.8
## Assistant 2:
Let's approach this step-by-step:
1. Initially, there are 10 vehicles with an average weight of 12.2 tons.
2. Let the weight of the heavy duty truck be x tons.
3. After adding the truck, the new average weight is 12.2 + 2.6 = 14.8 tons.
4. We can set up an equation based on the new average:
   (12.2 × 10 + x) ÷ 11 = 14.8
5. Simplify:
   (122 + x) ÷ 11 = 14.8
6. Multiply both sides by 11:
   122 + x = 14.8 × 11
   122 + x = 162.8
7. Subtract 122 from both sides:
   x = 162.8 - 122
   x = 40.8
Therefore, the weight of the heavy duty truck is 40.8 tons.
Action: Answer("A")
