Question: A wire in the shape of rectangle of length 27 cm and breadth 17 cm is rebent to form a square. What will be the measure of each side?
Choices:
  A: 9
  B: 11
  C: 22
  D: 25
  E: 31
## Assistant 2:
Let's approach this step-by-step:
1. The wire forms a rectangle with length 27 cm and breadth 17 cm.
2. To find the perimeter of the rectangle, we use the formula: 
   Perimeter = 2 * (length + breadth)
             = 2 * (27 + 17)
             = 2 * 44
             = 88 cm
3. Now, the wire is rebent to form a square. The perimeter of the square will be the same as the perimeter of the rectangle, which is 88 cm.
4. To find the side length of the square, we divide the perimeter by 4 (as a square has 4 equal sides):
   Side length = Perimeter / 4
               = 88 / 4
               = 22 cm
Therefore, each side of the square will measure 22 cm.
Action: Answer("C")
