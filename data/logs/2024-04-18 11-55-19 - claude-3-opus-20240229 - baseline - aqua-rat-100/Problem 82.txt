Question: A cow is tethered in the middle of a field with a 14 feet long rope. If the cow grazes 10 sq.ft. per day, then approximately what time will be taken by the cow to graze the whole field?
Choices:
  A: 51 days
  B: 61 days
  C: 71 days
  D: 81 days
  E: 91 days
## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's approach this step-by-step:
1. The cow is tethered with a 14 feet long rope. This means the cow can graze in a circular area with a radius of 14 feet.
2. The area of a circle is given by the formula: A = πr², where r is the radius.
   
   Area = π * 14² = 616 sq.ft. (rounded to the nearest whole number)
3. The cow grazes 10 sq.ft. per day. To find the time taken to graze the whole field, we need to divide the total area by the area grazed per day.
   Time = Total Area / Area grazed per day
        = 616 / 10
        = 61.6 days
4. Rounding 61.6 to the nearest option given, we get 61 days.
Action: Answer("B")
