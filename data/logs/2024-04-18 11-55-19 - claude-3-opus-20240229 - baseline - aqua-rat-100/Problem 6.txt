Question: A company contracts to paint 3 houses. Mr.Brown can paint a house in 6 days while Mr.Black would take 8 days and Mr.Blue 12 days. After 8 days Mr.Brown goes on vacation and Mr. Black begins to work for a period of 6 days. How many days will it take Mr.Blue to complete the contract?
Choices:
  A: 7
  B: 8
  C: 10
  D: 11
  E: 12
## Assistant 2:
Let's approach this step-by-step:
1. Find the portion of a house each painter can paint in a day:
   - Mr. Brown: 1/6 house per day
   - Mr. Black: 1/8 house per day
   - Mr. Blue: 1/12 house per day
2. In the first 8 days, Mr. Brown paints:
   - 8 × (1/6) = 4/3 houses
3. In the next 6 days, Mr. Black paints:
   - 6 × (1/8) = 3/4 house
4. Total houses painted by Mr. Brown and Mr. Black:
   - 4/3 + 3/4 = 25/12 houses
5. Number of houses left for Mr. Blue to paint:
   - 3 - 25/12 = 11/12 house
6. Time taken by Mr. Blue to paint the remaining:
   - 11/12 ÷ (1/12) = 11 days
Therefore, it will take Mr. Blue 11 days to complete the contract.
