## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: A point on the edge of a fan blade that is rotating in a plane 10 centimeters from the center of the fan. What is the distance traveled, in centimeters, by this point after 30 seconds when the fan runs at the rate of 300 revolutions per minutes?
Choices:
  A: 750pi
  B: 1500pi
  C: 1875pi
  D: 3000pi
  E: 7500pi
## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1. The fan is rotating at 300 revolutions per minute (rpm).
2. We want to know the distance traveled after 30 seconds, which is half a minute.
3. In half a minute, the fan will make 300/2 = 150 revolutions.
4. The point is 10 centimeters from the center, so it travels a circle with radius 10 cm.
5. The circumference of this circle is 2 * pi * r = 2 * pi * 10 = 20 * pi cm.
6. In one revolution, the point travels 20 * pi cm.
7. In 150 revolutions, the point will travel 150 * 20 * pi = 3000 * pi cm.
Therefore, the correct answer is:
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
