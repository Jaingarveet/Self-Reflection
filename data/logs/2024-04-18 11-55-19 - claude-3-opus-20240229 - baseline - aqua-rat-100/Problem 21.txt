## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: x men working x hours per day can do x units of a work in x days. How much work can be completed by y men working y hours per day in y days?
Choices:
  A: x2/y2 units
  B: y3/x2 units
  C: x3/y2 units
  D: y2/x2 units
  E: None of these
## Assistant 2:
Let's approach this step-by-step:
1) In the first scenario, x men working x hours per day for x days complete x units of work.
2) So, the total man-hours in the first scenario is x * x * x = x^3.
3) In the second scenario, y men are working y hours per day for y days.
4) So, the total man-hours in the second scenario is y * y * y = y^3.
5) Assuming the work done is proportional to the man-hours (which is a reasonable assumption), we can set up a proportion:
   x units of work / x^3 man-hours = ? units of work / y^3 man-hours
6) Cross-multiplying, we get:
   x * y^3 = ? * x^3
7) Solving for ?, we get:
   ? = (x * y^3) / x^3 = y^3 / x^2
Therefore, the correct answer is B: y^3 / x^2 units of work will be completed in the second scenario.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
