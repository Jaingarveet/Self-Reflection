Question: The bus fare for two persons for travelling between Agra and Aligarh id four-thirds the train fare between the same places for one person. The total fare paid by 6 persons travelling by bus and 8 persons travelling by train between the two places is Rs.1512. Find the train fare between the two places for one person?
Choices:
  A: 126
  B: 77
  C: 88
  D: 66
  E: 54
## Assistant 2:
Let's solve this step-by-step:
1. Let the train fare for one person be Rs. x.
2. The bus fare for two persons is four-thirds of the train fare for one person. So, the bus fare for two persons is (4/3)x.
3. The bus fare for one person is half of the bus fare for two persons, which is (4/3)x ÷ 2 = (2/3)x.
4. The total fare paid by 6 persons travelling by bus and 8 persons travelling by train is Rs. 1512.
   * 6 persons travelling by bus: 6 × (2/3)x = 4x
   * 8 persons travelling by train: 8 × x = 8x
   * Total fare: 4x + 8x = 1512
5. Simplify the equation:
   * 12x = 1512
   * x = 1512 ÷ 12
   * x = 126
Therefore, the train fare between the two places for one person is Rs. 126.
