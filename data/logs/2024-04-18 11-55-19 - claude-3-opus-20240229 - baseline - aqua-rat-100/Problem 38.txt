Question: A hollow cube of size 5cm is taken, with the thickness of 1cm. It is made of smaller cubes of size 1cm .If the outer surface of the cube is painted how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted?
Choices:
  A: 438
  B: 550
  C: 500
  D: 450
  E: 498
## Assistant 2:
Let's approach this step-by-step:
1) The cube has a side length of 5cm, and the thickness is 1cm. This means the hollow part has a side length of 3cm (5cm - 2 * 1cm).
2) The total number of 1cm cubes in a 5cm cube is 5^3 = 125.
3) The number of 1cm cubes in the hollow part is 3^3 = 27.
4) So, the number of 1cm cubes that make up the hollow cube is 125 - 27 = 98.
5) Each 1cm cube has 6 faces. So, the total number of faces of the 1cm cubes is 98 * 6 = 588.
6) The outer surface of the big cube consists of 5 * 5 * 6 = 150 faces of the 1cm cubes.
7) Therefore, the number of faces of the 1cm cubes that remain unpainted is 588 - 150 = 438.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
