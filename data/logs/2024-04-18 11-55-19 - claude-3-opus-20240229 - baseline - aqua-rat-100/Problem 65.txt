## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: I know a 5 digit number having a property that with a 1 after it, it is three times as large as it would be with a 1 before it.
What is that number?
Choices:
  A: 42857
  B: 32456
  C: 76523
  D: 24567
  E: 43566
## Assistant 2:
Let's approach this step-by-step:
1) Let the 5-digit number be represented as 'abcde'.
2) With a 1 after it, the number becomes 'abcde1'.
3) With a 1 before it, the number becomes '1abcde'.
4) According to the question, 'abcde1' = 3 * '1abcde'
5) In mathematical terms:
   
   100000a + 10000b + 1000c + 100d + 10e + 1 = 3(100000 + 10000a + 1000b + 100c + 10d + e)
   
   Simplifying:
   
   100001a + 10010b + 1100c + 110d + 11e = 300000 + 30000a + 3000b + 300c + 30d + 3e
   
   99999a + 9990b + 900c + 90d + 9e = 300000
6) Dividing both sides by 9:
   
   11111a + 1110b + 100c + 10d + e = 33333
7) The only 5-digit number that satisfies this equation is 42857.
Therefore, the 5-digit number is 42857.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
