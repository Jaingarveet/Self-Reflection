## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Topic: Math
Question: A rectangular solid, 3 x 4 x 15, is inscribed in a sphere, so that all eight of its vertices are on the sphere. What is the diameter of the sphere?
Choices:
  A:  13.3542
  B:  15.8113
  C:  18.3451
  D:  19.5667
  E:  20.8888
## Assistant 2:
Let's approach this step-by-step:
1) The rectangular solid is a cuboid with dimensions 3, 4, and 15. 
2) The diameter of the sphere will be equal to the diagonal of the cuboid. This is because the diagonal connects two opposite vertices, which are on the surface of the sphere.
3) We can find the diagonal using the 3D Pythagorean theorem:
   diagonal^2 = 3^2 + 4^2 + 15^2
4) Simplifying:
   diagonal^2 = 9 + 16 + 225 = 250
5) Taking the square root of both sides:
   diagonal = sqrt(250) = 5 * sqrt(10)
6) Now, let's compare this value with the given choices. We can see that 5 * sqrt(10) is approximately equal to 15.8113.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
