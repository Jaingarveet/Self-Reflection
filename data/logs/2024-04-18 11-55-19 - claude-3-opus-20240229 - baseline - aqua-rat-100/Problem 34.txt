Question: A book was sold for Rs 27.50 with a profit of 10%. If it were sold for Rs. 25.75, then would have been percentage of profit and loss ?
Choices:
  A: 2% Profit
  B: 3% Profit
  C: 2% Loss
  D: 3% Loss
  E: 4% Loss
## Assistant 2:
Let's approach this step-by-step:
1. Let the cost price of the book be Rs. x.
2. The book was sold for Rs. 27.50 with a profit of 10%. So, the selling price is 110% of the cost price.
   27.50 = 110% of x
   27.50 = 1.1x
   x = 27.50 / 1.1
   x = 25
So, the cost price of the book is Rs. 25.
Now, if the book is sold for Rs. 25.75, then:
Selling price = Rs. 25.75
Cost price = Rs. 25
Profit/Loss % = (Selling price - Cost price) / Cost price * 100
             = (25.75 - 25) / 25 * 100
             = 0.75 / 25 * 100
             = 0.03 * 100
             = 3%
Since the selling price is more than the cost price, it's a profit.
Action: Answer("B")
