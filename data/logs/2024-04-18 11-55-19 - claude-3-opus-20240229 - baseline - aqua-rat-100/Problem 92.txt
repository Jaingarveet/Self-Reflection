Question: A sales person gets a 10% commission on each sale he makes. How many sales of $250 each must he make in order to reach a salary of at least $1000?
Choices:
  A: 15
  B: 24
  C: 25
  D: 40
  E: 52
## Assistant 2:
Let's approach this step-by-step:
1. The salesperson gets a 10% commission on each sale.
2. Each sale is worth $250.
3. To calculate the commission for one sale:
   * Commission = 10% of $250
   * 10% is equivalent to 0.1
   * Commission = 0.1 ร $250 = $25
4. The salesperson wants to reach a salary of at least $1000.
5. To find the number of sales needed, divide the target salary by the commission per sale:
   * Number of sales = Target salary รท Commission per sale
   * Number of sales = $1000 รท $25 = 40
Therefore, the salesperson must make 40 sales of $250 each to reach a salary of at least $1000.
