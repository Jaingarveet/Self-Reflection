## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: If n is such that 36 ≤ n ≤ 72, then x = (n2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16) / (n+ 4√n+ 4) satisfies
Choices:
  A: 20 < x < 54
  B: 23 < x < 58
  C: 25 < x < 64
  D: 28 < x < 60
  E: None of these
## Assistant 2:
Let's approach this step-by-step:
1) First, let's simplify the expression for x:
   x = (n^2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16) / (n + 4√n + 4)
     = (n^2 + 2n√n + 8√n + 16) / (n + 4√n + 4)
     = (n(n + 2√n + 8) + 16) / (n + 4√n + 4)
     = (n(n + 2√n + 8) + 16) / (n + 4(√n + 1))
     = (n^2 + 2n√n + 8n + 16) / (n + 4√n + 4)
2) Now, let's consider the lower and upper bounds of n:
   For n = 36:
   x = (36^2 + 2*36*√36 + 8*36 + 16) / (36 + 4*√36 + 4)
     = (1296 + 432 + 288 + 16) / (36 + 24 + 4)
     = 2032 / 64
     = 31.75
   For n = 72:
   x = (72^2 + 2*72*√72 + 8*72 + 16) / (72 + 4*√72 + 4)
     = (5184 + 1224 + 576 + 16) / (72 + 34 + 4)
     = 7000 / 110
     = 63.64
3) Therefore, for 36 ≤ n ≤ 72, x lies between 31.75 and 63.64.
4) Looking at the choices, the only one that fits this range is C: 25 < x < 64.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
