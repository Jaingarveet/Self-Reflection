Question: A ship went on a voyage. After it had traveled 180 miles a plane started with 10 times the speed of the ship. Find the distance when they meet from starting point.
Choices:
  A: 238
  B: 289
  C: 200
  D: 287
  E: 187
## Assistant 2:
Let's approach this step-by-step:
1. Let the distance traveled by the plane be x miles.
2. Since the plane's speed is 10 times the ship's speed, the time taken by the plane to travel x miles is the same as the time taken by the ship to travel the remaining distance (x - 180) miles.
3. If the ship's speed is y miles per hour, then the plane's speed is 10y miles per hour.
4. Time taken by ship to travel (x - 180) miles = (x - 180) / y
5. Time taken by plane to travel x miles = x / 10y
6. Equating these times:
   (x - 180) / y = x / 10y
7. Cross multiply:
   10x - 1800 = x
   9x = 1800
   x = 200
Therefore, they will meet when the plane has traveled 200 miles from the starting point.
Action: Answer("C")
