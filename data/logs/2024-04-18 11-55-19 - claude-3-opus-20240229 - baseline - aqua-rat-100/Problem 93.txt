Question: [5 + ? × 19 - 15 - 7]/[13 × 13 - 156] = 6
Choices:
  A: 4
  B: 4.5
  C: 5
  D: 5.5
  E: 6.5
## Assistant 2:
Let's solve this step-by-step:
1. The equation is in the form: [5 + ? × 19 - 15 - 7]/[13 × 13 - 156] = 6
2. Simplify the denominator first:
   13 × 13 - 156 = 169 - 156 = 13
3. Multiply both sides by the denominator to isolate the numerator:
   [5 + ? × 19 - 15 - 7] = 6 × 13 = 78
4. Simplify the left side:
   5 + ? × 19 - 15 - 7 = ? × 19 - 17
5. Add 17 to both sides:
   ? × 19 = 78 + 17 = 95
6. Divide both sides by 19:
   ? = 95 ÷ 19 = 5
Therefore, the correct answer is C: 5.
Action: Answer("C")
