## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: If a man rows at the rate of 4 kmph in still water and his rate against the current is 2 kmph, then the man's rate along the current is:
Choices:
  A: 15 kmph
  B: 6 kmph
  C: 12 kmph
  D: 14 kmph
  E: 6 kmph
## Assistant 2:
Let's approach this step-by-step:
1. Let the speed of the current be x kmph.
2. The man's speed in still water is given as 4 kmph.
3. His speed against the current is given as 2 kmph.
We know that when rowing against the current, the effective speed is the difference between the rowing speed and the current speed. So:
4. Man's speed against current = Man's speed in still water - Current speed
   2 = 4 - x
   x = 4 - 2 = 2
So, the speed of the current is 2 kmph.
Now, when rowing along the current, the effective speed is the sum of the rowing speed and the current speed. So:
5. Man's speed along current = Man's speed in still water + Current speed
                             = 4 + 2 = 6
Therefore, the man's speed along the current is 6 kmph.
Action: Answer("B")
