Question: A jeep travels a certain distance taking 6 hours in the forward journey. During the return journey, it increased its speed by 12km/hr and took 4 hours. What is the distance travelled by the jeep?
Choices:
  A: 126km
  B: 144km
  C: 127km
  D: 228km
  E: 128km
## Assistant 2:
Let's approach this step-by-step:
1. Let the distance be x km and the speed of the jeep in the forward journey be y km/hr.
2. In the forward journey, Distance = Speed × Time
   So, x = y × 6 ...(Equation 1)
3. In the return journey, the speed is (y + 12) km/hr.
   So, x = (y + 12) × 4 ...(Equation 2)
4. From Equation 1: y = x/6
   Substituting this in Equation 2:
   x = (x/6 + 12) × 4
   x = 2x/3 + 48
   x - 2x/3 = 48
   x/3 = 48
   x = 48 × 3 = 144
Therefore, the distance travelled by the jeep is 144 km.
Action: Answer("B")
