Question: A starts a business with Rs.40,000. After 2 months, B joined him with Rs.60,000. C joined them after some more time with Rs.120,000. At the end of the year, out of a total profit of Rs.375,000, C gets Rs.150,000 as his share. How many months after B joined the business, did C join?
Choices:
  A: 2 months
  B: 4 months
  C: 23 months
  D: 24 months
  E: 84 months
## Assistant 2:
Let's approach this step-by-step:
1. A's investment = Rs. 40,000 for 12 months = 40,000 × 12 = 480,000
2. B's investment = Rs. 60,000 for (12 - 2) months = 60,000 × 10 = 600,000
3. C's investment = Rs. 120,000 for x months, and C's share of profit is Rs. 150,000
Now, the ratio of profits will be the same as the ratio of investments. So:
A : B : C = 480,000 : 600,000 : 120,000x
We know C's share is Rs. 150,000 out of the total profit of Rs. 375,000. So:
120,000x / (480,000 + 600,000 + 120,000x) = 150,000 / 375,000
Solving this equation:
120,000x = 150,000 × (480,000 + 600,000 + 120,000x) / 375,000
120,000x = 180,000 + 225,000 + 90,000x
30,000x = 405,000
x = 13.5
So, C joined 13.5 months after A started the business, or 11.5 months after B joined.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
