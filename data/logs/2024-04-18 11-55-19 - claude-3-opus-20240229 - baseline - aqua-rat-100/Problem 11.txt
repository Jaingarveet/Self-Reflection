Question: A rectangle has a length of 8 centimeters and a width of 3 centimeters. Find the perimeter.
Choices:
  A: 18cm
  B: 22cm
  C: 20cm

## Assistant 2:
To find the perimeter of a rectangle, we use the formula:
Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)
Given:
- Length = 8 cm
- Width = 3 cm
Plugging in the values:
Perimeter = 2 * (8 cm + 3 cm)
          = 2 * (11 cm)
          = 22 cm
Action: Answer("B")
