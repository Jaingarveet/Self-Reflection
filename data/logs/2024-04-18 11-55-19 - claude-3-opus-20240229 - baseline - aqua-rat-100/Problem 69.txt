Question: A bookshelf contains 45 books, 30 of which are hardcover and 20 of which are fiction. What is the maximum number of books that are both hardcover and fiction?
Choices:
  A: 10
  B: 15
  C: 18
  D: 20
  E: 30
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1) There are 45 books total on the shelf.
2) 30 of these books are hardcover.
3) 20 of these books are fiction.
4) If we want the maximum number of books that are both hardcover and fiction, we should assume that as many of the fiction books as possible are also hardcover.
5) There are 20 fiction books. So at most, 20 of the hardcover books could also be fiction.
6) However, we need to check if this is possible given the total number of hardcover books. There are 30 hardcover books total, which is more than 20. So it is possible for all 20 fiction books to also be hardcover.
Therefore, the maximum number of books that are both hardcover and fiction is 20.
Action: Answer("D")
