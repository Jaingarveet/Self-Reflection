Question: A number of friends decided to go on a picnic and planned to spend Rs. 96 on eatables. Four of them, however, did not turn up. As a consequence, the remaining ones had to contribute Rs. 4 extra, each. The number of those who attended the picnic was
Choices:
  A: 8
  B: 12
  C: 16
  D: 24
  E: 25
## Assistant 2:
Let's approach this step-by-step:
1. Let the number of friends who attended the picnic be x.
2. Initially, each person's contribution was supposed to be 96/x.
3. After 4 friends didn't show up, each person's contribution became (96/(x-4)) + 4.
4. Since the total amount spent remains the same, we can equate the two:
   x * (96/x) = (x-4) * ((96/(x-4)) + 4)
5. Simplifying:
   96 = 96 + 4(x-4)
   96 = 96 + 4x - 16
   16 = 4x
   x = 4
6. So, initially there were 4 + 4 = 8 friends planning to attend the picnic.
Action: Answer("A")
