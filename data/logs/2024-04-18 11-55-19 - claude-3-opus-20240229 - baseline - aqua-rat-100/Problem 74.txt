## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: ABCDE is a regular pentagon with F at its center. How many different quadrilaterals can be formed by joining 4 of the points A,B,C,D,E and F?
Choices:
  A: 12
  B: 10
  C: 5
  D: 15
  E: 20
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1) There are 6 points in total: A, B, C, D, E, and F.
2) To form a quadrilateral, we need to choose 4 out of these 6 points.
3) In mathematics, the number of ways to choose r objects from a set of n objects is denoted by $\binom{n}{r}$ and is calculated as:
   $\binom{n}{r} = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$
4) In this case, n = 6 (total number of points) and r = 4 (number of points needed for a quadrilateral).
5) So, the number of different quadrilaterals is:
   $\binom{6}{4} = \frac{6!}{4!(6-4)!} = \frac{6!}{4!2!} = \frac{6 \cdot 5}{2 \cdot 1} = 15$
Therefore, the correct answer is D: 15.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
