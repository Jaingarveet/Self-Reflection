Question: When I was 2 years old, my brother was half my age. Now I am 60 years old, how old is my brother?
Choices:
  A: A)59
  B: B)69
  C: C)79
  D: D)89
  E: E)99
## Assistant 2:
Let's approach this step-by-step:
1. When you were 2 years old, your brother was half your age. So, when you were 2, your brother was 1 year old.
2. The age difference between you and your brother is 2 - 1 = 1 year.
3. This age difference will always remain the same.
4. Now, you are 60 years old. To find your brother's age, we subtract the age difference from your current age:
   
   Your brother's age = 60 - 1 = 59 years old
Therefore, your brother is 59 years old now.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
