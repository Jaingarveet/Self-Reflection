Question: A club consists of members whose ages are in A.P. The common difference being 3 months. If the youngest member of the club is just 7 years old and the sum of the ages of all the members is 250, then number of members in the club are :
Choices:
  A: 18
  B: 20
  C: 25
  D: 26
  E: 27
## Assistant 2:
Let's approach this step-by-step:
1. Let the number of members in the club be n.
2. The ages are in Arithmetic Progression (A.P.) with a common difference of 3 months, which is 0.25 years.
3. The youngest member is 7 years old, so the first term (a) of the A.P. is 7.
4. The sum of the ages of all members is 250.
We know the formula for the sum of an A.P. is:
Sum = n/2 * [2a + (n-1)d], where a is the first term, d is the common difference, and n is the number of terms.
Substituting the values:
250 = n/2 * [2*7 + (n-1)*0.25]
250 = n/2 * [14 + 0.25n - 0.25]
250 = n/2 * [13.75 + 0.25n]
500 = n * [13.75 + 0.25n]
500 = 13.75n + 0.25n^2
This is a quadratic equation. Let's solve it:
0.25n^2 + 13.75n - 500 = 0
Using the quadratic formula:
n = [-13.75 ± √(13.75^2 - 4*0.25*-500)] / (2*0.25)
  = [-13.75 ± √(189.0625 + 500)] / 0.5
  = [-13.75 ± √689.0625] / 0.5
  = [-13.75 ± 26.25] / 0.5
The two solutions are:
n1 = (-13.75 + 26.25) / 0.5 = 25
n2 = (-13.75 - 26.25) / 0.5 = -80 (discarded as number of members can't be negative)
Therefore, the number of members in the club is 25.
Action: Answer("C")
