## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Topic: Math
Question: Points A, B, C, D lie in this order on the circumference of a circle. Minor arc AC is 160°, and minor arc BD is 150°. If B bisects minor arc AC, then what is the measure of minor arc AD?
Choices:
  A: 80°
  B: 130°
  C: 140°
  D: 160°
  E: 220°
## Assistant 2:
Let's approach this step-by-step:
1) If B bisects minor arc AC, then minor arc AB is half of minor arc AC.
   Minor arc AB = 160° / 2 = 80°
2) In a circle, the sum of opposite arcs is 360°. So, major arc AC = 360° - 160° = 200°.
3) Since B bisects minor arc AC, it also bisects major arc AC.
   Major arc AB = 200° / 2 = 100°
4) Minor arc BD is given as 150°.
5) To find minor arc AD, we need to subtract minor arc BD from major arc AB.
   Minor arc AD = Major arc AB - Minor arc BD
                = 100° - 150°
                = -50°
6) However, the measure of an arc cannot be negative. This means that D is actually on the major arc AB, not the minor arc AB.
7) So, to find the actual measure of minor arc AD, we need to subtract minor arc BD from the full circle:
   Minor arc AD = 360° - 150°
                = 210°
8) The closest answer to 210° is 220°.
