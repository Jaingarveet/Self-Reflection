Question: 20 marbles were pulled out of a bag of only white marbles, painted black, and then put back in. Then, another 20 marbles were pulled out, of which 1 was black, after which they were all returned to the bag. If the percentage of black marbles pulled out the second time represents their percentage in the bag, how many marbles in total Q does the bag currently hold?
Choices:
  A: 40
  B: 200
  C: 380
  D: 400
  E: 3200
## Assistant 2:
Let's approach this step-by-step:
1. Initially, the bag had only white marbles. Let's say the total number of marbles was Q.
2. 20 marbles were pulled out, painted black, and put back. So now, the bag has 20 black marbles and (Q-20) white marbles, still totaling Q marbles.
3. In the second draw, 20 marbles were pulled out, of which 1 was black. This represents the percentage of black marbles in the bag.
4. The percentage of black marbles in the second draw = 1/20 = 5%
5. If 5% of the marbles are black, and there are 20 black marbles in total, then:
   20 = 5% of Q
   20 = 0.05Q
   Q = 20/0.05 = 400
Therefore, the bag currently holds 400 marbles in total.
Action: Answer("D")
