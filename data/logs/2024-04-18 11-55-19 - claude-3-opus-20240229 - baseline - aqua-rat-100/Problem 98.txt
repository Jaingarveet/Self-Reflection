Question: At 6% per annum simple interest, Rahul borrowed Rs. 500. What amount will he pay to clear the debt after 4 years
Choices:
  A: 750
  B: 700
  C: 620
  D: 600
  E: None of these
## Assistant 2:
To calculate the amount Rahul will pay to clear the debt, we need to find the simple interest and add it to the principal amount.
Given:
- Principal (P) = Rs. 500
- Rate of interest (r) = 6% per annum
- Time (t) = 4 years
The formula for simple interest is:
Simple Interest (SI) = (P × r × t) / 100
Calculation:
SI = (500 × 6 × 4) / 100
SI = 12,000 / 100
SI = 120
The total amount to be paid = Principal + Simple Interest
Total amount = 500 + 120 = Rs. 620
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
