## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: The greatest common factor of two positive integers is 11. The least common multiple of these two integers is 7700. If one of the integers is 350, what is the other?
Choices:
  A: 242
  B: 308
  C: 352
  D: 412
  E: 456
## Assistant 2:
Let's approach this step-by-step:
1) Let's call the two integers a and b. We know that a = 350.
2) The greatest common factor (GCF) of a and b is 11. This means that 11 is the largest number that divides both a and b.
3) The least common multiple (LCM) of a and b is 7700. This means that 7700 is the smallest number that is divisible by both a and b.
4) We know that for any two numbers, their product is equal to the product of their GCF and LCM. In other words:
   a * b = GCF(a, b) * LCM(a, b)
5) Substituting the known values:
   350 * b = 11 * 7700
6) Solving for b:
   b = (11 * 7700) / 350
     = 84700 / 350
     = 242
Therefore, the other integer is 242.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
