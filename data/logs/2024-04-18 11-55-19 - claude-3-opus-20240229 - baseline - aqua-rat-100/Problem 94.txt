## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: Find the total no. of distinct bike no.'s that can beformed using 2 letters followed by 2 no.'s. How many letters need to be distinct?
Choices:
  A: 74453
  B: 64543
  C: 74325
  D: 65000
  E: 97656
## Assistant 2:
Let's approach this step-by-step:
1) First, let's consider the number of possibilities for the letters. If the letters need to be distinct, then for the first letter we have 26 choices (assuming we are using the English alphabet), and for the second letter we have 25 choices (because we can't use the same letter again). So, the total number of distinct letter combinations is:
   26 * 25 = 650
2) Now, for the numbers, we have 10 choices for each position (0 to 9). The numbers don't need to be distinct, so for two numbers we have:
   10 * 10 = 100
3) According to the fundamental counting principle, to find the total number of possible combinations, we multiply the number of choices for each position. So, the total number of distinct bike numbers is:
   650 * 100 = 65,000
Therefore, the correct answer is D: 65000.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
