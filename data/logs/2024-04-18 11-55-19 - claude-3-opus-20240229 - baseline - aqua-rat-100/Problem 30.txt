Question: Roy was suffering from severe headaches. He went to see his doctor and the doctor gave him 5 tablets asking him to take one tablet every 15 minutes.
How much time will it take Roy to consume all the 5 tablets?
Choices:
  A: 45 Min
  B: 75 Min
  C: 90 Min
  D: 120 Min
  E: 60 Min
## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. Roy needs to take one tablet every 15 minutes.
2. He has a total of 5 tablets to take.
To find the total time, we can calculate:
* Time between each tablet = 15 minutes
* Number of intervals between tablets = Number of tablets - 1 
   * Because for 5 tablets, there are 4 intervals: 
     * 1st tablet -> 15 min -> 2nd tablet -> 15 min -> 3rd tablet -> 15 min -> 4th tablet -> 15 min -> 5th tablet
So, number of intervals = 5 - 1 = 4 intervals
Total time = Number of intervals × Time between each tablet
            = 4 × 15 minutes
            = 60 minutes
Therefore, it will take Roy 60 minutes to consume all 5 tablets.
Action: Answer("E")
