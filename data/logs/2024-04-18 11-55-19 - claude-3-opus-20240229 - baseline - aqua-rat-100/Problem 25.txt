## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Question: A car is being driven, in a straight line and at a uniform speed, towards the base of a vertical tower. The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower?
Choices:
  A: 5(√3 + 1)
  B: 6(√3 + √2)
  C: 7(√3 – 1)
  D: 8(√3 – 2)
  E: None of these
## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's approach this step-by-step:
1) Let the height of the tower be h and the uniform speed of the car be v. 
   Also, let the distance of the car from the base of the tower at the start be x.
2) At the start, tan(45°) = h/x. Therefore, x = h.
3) After 10 minutes, tan(60°) = h/(x - 10v). 
   Therefore, √3 = h/(x - 10v).
4) Substituting x = h from step 2, we get:
   √3 = h/(h - 10v)
   √3(h - 10v) = h
   √3h - 10√3v = h
   √3h - h = 10√3v
   (√3 - 1)h = 10√3v
5) Now, let's find the additional time taken. If the remaining distance is y, then:
   y = (√3 - 1)h = 10√3v
   Therefore, the additional time = y/v = 10√3(√3 - 1) minutes
6) Simplifying, 10√3(√3 - 1) = 10(3 - √3) = 30 - 10√3 = 10(3 - √3)
Therefore, the car will reach the base of the tower in 10(3 - √3) more minutes.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
