Question: If Raj was one-third as old as Rahim 5 years back and Raj is 17 years old now, How old is Rahim now?
Choices:
  A: 37
  B: 41
  C: 40
  D: 42
  E: 43
## Assistant 2:
Let's solve this step-by-step:
1. Understand the given information:
   * Raj is 17 years old now.
   * 5 years ago, Raj was one-third of Rahim's age.
2. Find Raj's age 5 years ago:
   * Raj's age 5 years ago = 17 - 5 = 12 years old
3. Set up an equation based on the information:
   * Let Rahim's age 5 years ago be x.
   * Raj's age 5 years ago was one-third of Rahim's age 5 years ago.
   * So, 12 = x/3
4. Solve the equation to find Rahim's age 5 years ago:
   * 12 = x/3
   * 12 Ã— 3 = x
   * x = 36
   * Rahim was 36 years old 5 years ago.
5. Find Rahim's current age:
   * Rahim's current age = Rahim's age 5 years ago + 5
   * Rahim's current age = 36 + 5 = 41 years old
Therefore, Rahim is 41 years old now.
