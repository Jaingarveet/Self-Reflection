Question: A cyclist travels at 12 miles per hour. How many minutes will it take to travel 48 miles?
Choices:
  A: 1
  B: 240
  C: 30
  D: 60
  E: 120
## Assistant 2:
To solve this problem, let's use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed
Given:
- Speed = 12 miles per hour
- Distance = 48 miles
Step 1: Convert the speed from miles per hour to miles per minute.
12 miles per hour = 12 miles / 60 minutes = 0.2 miles per minute
Step 2: Use the formula Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 48 miles / 0.2 miles per minute
Time = 240 minutes
Therefore, it will take the cyclist 240 minutes to travel 48 miles at a speed of 12 miles per hour.
Action: Answer("B")
