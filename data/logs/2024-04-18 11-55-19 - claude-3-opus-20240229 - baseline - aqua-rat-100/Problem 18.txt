Question: The price of a product is reduced by 30% . By what percentage should it be increased to make it 100%
Choices:
  A: 41.86%
  B: 42.86%
  C: 43.86%
  D: 44.86%
  E: 45.86%
## Assistant 2:
Let's approach this step-by-step:
1) Let's say the original price of the product is 100 units.
2) After a 30% reduction, the price would be 70 units. (100 - 30% of 100 = 70)
3) Now, we need to find the percentage increase needed to go from 70 units back to the original 100 units.
4) The increase needed is 100 - 70 = 30 units.
5) To calculate the percentage increase, we divide the increase by the current price and multiply by 100:
   
   Percentage increase = (Increase / Current Price) * 100
                       = (30 / 70) * 100
                       = 0.4286 * 100
                       = 42.86%
Therefore, the price should be increased by approximately 42.86% to return to the original price.
Action: Answer("B")
