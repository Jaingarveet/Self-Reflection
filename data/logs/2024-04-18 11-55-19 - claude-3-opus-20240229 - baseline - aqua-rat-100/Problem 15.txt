Question: Add: +45 and -30
Choices:
  A: -30
  B: +30
  C: 0
  D: 15
  E: -15
## Assistant 2:
To add +45 and -30, we can use the rules for adding integers with different signs:
1. Find the absolute values of the numbers:
   |+45| = 45
   |-30| = 30
2. Subtract the smaller absolute value from the larger:
   45 - 30 = 15
3. The result takes the sign of the number with the larger absolute value. Since +45 has a larger absolute value than -30, the result will be positive.
Therefore, +45 + (-30) = +15
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
