## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: Amy is organizing her bookshelves and finds that she has 10 different types of books. She then codes each book with either a single letter or a pair of two different letters. If each type of book is uniquely represented by either a single letter or pair of letters, what is the smallest number of letters Amy will need to create the codes for all 10 types of books? (Assume the order of letters in a pair does not matter.)
Choices:
  A: 3
  B: 4
  C: 5
  D: 10
  E: 20
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1) If Amy uses only single letters, she would need 10 letters to uniquely code each type of book. But the question suggests we can use pairs of letters too.
2) If Amy uses only pairs of letters, she would need 5 letters. This is because with 5 letters, there are 10 unique pairs (5C2 = 10).
3) However, the question asks for the smallest number of letters needed. So we should consider using a mix of single letters and pairs.
4) Let's say Amy uses 4 letters: A, B, C, and D. With these, she can create 6 unique pairs: AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, CD. Along with the 4 single letters, this gives her 10 unique codes, which is exactly what she needs.
5) If she used only 3 letters, she could make only 3 single letter codes and 3 pair codes (3C2 = 3), for a total of 6 codes. This is not enough.
Therefore, the smallest number of letters Amy needs is 4.
Action: Answer("B")
