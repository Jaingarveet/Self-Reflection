Question: 64 boys and 40 girls form a group for social work. During their membership drive, the same number of boys and girls joined the group. How many members does the group have now, if the ratio of boys to girls is 4:3?
Choices:
  A: 277
  B: 288
  C: 200
  D: 277
  E: 168
## Assistant 2:
Let's approach this step-by-step:
1. Initially, there were 64 boys and 40 girls in the group.
2. During the membership drive, the same number of boys and girls joined. Let's call this number x.
3. After the drive, the ratio of boys to girls is 4:3.
Let's set up an equation based on the ratio:
(64 + x) / (40 + x) = 4 / 3
Cross multiply:
3(64 + x) = 4(40 + x)
192 + 3x = 160 + 4x
Solve for x:
192 - 160 = 4x - 3x
32 = x
So, 32 boys and 32 girls joined during the membership drive.
4. Calculate the total number of members now:
Boys: 64 + 32 = 96
Girls: 40 + 32 = 72
Total: 96 + 72 = 168
Action: Answer("E")
## Result:
Agent Answer: E
Correct Answer: E
Score: 1
