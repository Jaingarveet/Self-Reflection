Question: At what price should the Karan mark a sewing machine that costs him Rs. 1200/- so that even after offering a 20% discount, he makes 20% profit?
Choices:
  A: 1,879
  B: 1,875
  C: 1,876
  D: 1,872
  E: 1,800
## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's approach this step-by-step:
1. Let the marked price be Rs. x
2. After offering a 20% discount, the selling price will be 80% of x, i.e., 0.8x
3. For making a 20% profit, the selling price should be 120% of the cost price, i.e., 1.2 * 1200 = Rs. 1440
So, we can write the equation:
0.8x = 1440
Solving for x:
x = 1440 / 0.8
x = 1800
Therefore, the marked price should be Rs. 1800 to make a 20% profit after offering a 20% discount.
Action: Answer("E")
