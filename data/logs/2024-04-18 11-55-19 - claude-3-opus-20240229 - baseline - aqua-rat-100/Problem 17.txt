Question: A company produces 420 units of a particular computer component every month, at a production cost to the company of $110 per component, and sells all of the components by the end of each month. What is the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee that the yearly profit (revenue from sales minus production costs) will be at least $626,400 ?
Choices:
  A: 226
  B: 230
  C: 240
  D: 260
  E: 280
## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1. The company produces 420 units per month.
2. The production cost per unit is $110.
3. They want a yearly profit of at least $626,400.
To find the minimum selling price, we need to:
1. Calculate the yearly production
2. Calculate the yearly production cost
3. Add the desired profit to the yearly production cost
4. Divide the result by the yearly production to get the minimum selling price per unit
Calculations:
1. Yearly production = 420 units/month * 12 months = 5,040 units
2. Yearly production cost = 5,040 units * $110/unit = $554,400
3. Total revenue needed = Yearly production cost + Desired profit
   = $554,400 + $626,400 = $1,180,800
4. Minimum selling price per unit = Total revenue needed / Yearly production
   = $1,180,800 / 5,040 units = $234.29 per unit
The minimum selling price needs to be at least $234.29.
Looking at the choices, the minimum selling price that guarantees the desired profit is $240.
