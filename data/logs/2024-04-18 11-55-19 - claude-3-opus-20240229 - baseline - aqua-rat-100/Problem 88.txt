Question: A train running at a speed of 100 miles/hour, takes 10 hours to reach its destination. After covering quarter of the distance, it starts raining and the train has to be slowed to speed of 75 miles/hour. What is the total journey duration?
Choices:
  A: 10
  B: 11.5
  C: 12.5
  D: 13.5
  E: 15
## Assistant 2:
Let's approach this step-by-step:
1. Let the total distance be x miles.
2. At a speed of 100 miles/hour, the train takes 10 hours to cover the distance. So, x = 100 * 10 = 1000 miles.
3. The train covers 1/4 of the distance (250 miles) at 100 miles/hour. This takes 250/100 = 2.5 hours.
4. For the remaining 3/4 of the distance (750 miles), the train's speed is reduced to 75 miles/hour due to rain. 
   The time taken to cover this distance is 750/75 = 10 hours.
5. The total journey duration is the sum of the time taken for the first 1/4 of the journey and the remaining 3/4 of the journey.
   Total duration = 2.5 hours + 10 hours = 12.5 hours.
Action: Answer("C")
