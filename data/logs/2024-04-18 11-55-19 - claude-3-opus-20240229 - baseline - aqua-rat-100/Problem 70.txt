Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.

Question: In a railway station, there are two trains going. One in the harbor line and one in the main line, each having a frequency of 10 minutes. The main line service starts at 5 o'clock and the harbor line starts at 5.02 A.M. A man goes to the station every day to catch the first train that comes. What is the probability of the man catching the first train?
Choices:
  A: 0.9
  B: 0.8
  C: 0.6
  D: 0.65
  E: 1.5
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1) The main line train comes every 10 minutes, starting at 5:00 AM. So it comes at 5:00, 5:10, 5:20, and so on.
2) The harbor line train also comes every 10 minutes, but it starts at 5:02 AM. So it comes at 5:02, 5:12, 5:22, and so on.
3) For the man to catch the first train, he needs to arrive at the station before 5:02 AM. If he arrives at 5:02 AM or later, he will catch the harbor line train.
4) In a 10-minute interval, the probability of him arriving before 5:02 AM is 8/10 or 0.8. This is because there are 8 minutes (from 5:00 to 5:02 and from 5:10 to 5:12) out of the 10 minutes where he would catch the main line train.
5) Therefore, the probability of the man catching the first (main line) train is 0.8.
Action: Answer("B")
