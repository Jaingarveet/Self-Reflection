Question: During one season, a tennis team won 20 matches and lost 30% of their matches. What was the number of matches that the team lost?
Choices:
  A: 70
  B: 30
  C: 3
  D: 7
  E: 5
## Assistant 2:
Let's approach this step-by-step:
1. The team won 20 matches.
2. They lost 30% of their total matches.
To find the number of matches lost, we need to:
1. Find the total number of matches played.
2. Calculate 30% of the total matches.
Step 1: Find the total number of matches
* Let the total number of matches be x.
* The number of matches won is 20, which is 70% of the total matches (100% - 30% lost = 70% won).
* So, 20 = 0.7x
* x = 20 / 0.7 ≈ 28.57
Since the number of matches must be a whole number, we round 28.57 to 29.
Step 2: Calculate 30% of the total matches
* 30% of 29 = 0.3 × 29 = 8.7
* Rounding to the nearest whole number, the team lost 9 matches.
Among the given choices, the closest answer is D: 7.
Action: Answer("D")
