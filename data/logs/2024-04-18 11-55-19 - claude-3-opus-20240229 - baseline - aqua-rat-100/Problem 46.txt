Question: A man spends Rs. 3500 per month and saves 12 1/2% of his income. His monthly income is ?
Choices:
  A: Rs. 4400
  B: Rs. 4270
  C: Rs. 4000
  D: Rs. 3937.50
  E: None of these
## Assistant 2:
Let's approach this step-by-step:
1. Let the man's monthly income be x.
2. He saves 12.5% of his income, which means he spends 100% - 12.5% = 87.5% of his income.
3. His monthly spending is Rs. 3500, which is 87.5% of his income.
4. So, we can write the equation: 0.875x = 3500
5. Solving for x: x = 3500 / 0.875 = 4000
Therefore, the man's monthly income is Rs. 4000.
Action: Answer("C")
