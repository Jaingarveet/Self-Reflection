Question: Alex and Jacob works at a toy shop that make toys. Alex takes 7 hours to make a toy, and Jacob takes 9 hours to make a toy. During a month, both of them makes 35 toys in total. If both of them have worked for almost similar number of hours how many toys have been prepared by Jacob?
Choices:
  A: 15
  B: 16
  C: 17
  D: 18
  E: 19
## Assistant 2:
Let's approach this step-by-step:
1. Let's assume Jacob made x toys. Then, Alex made (35 - x) toys.
2. Since they worked for almost the same number of hours, we can set up an equation:
   7(35 - x) ≈ 9x
3. Simplify the left side of the equation:
   245 - 7x ≈ 9x
4. Add 7x to both sides:
   245 ≈ 16x
5. Divide both sides by 16:
   x ≈ 15.3125
6. Since x represents the number of toys Jacob made, it must be a whole number. The closest whole number to 15.3125 is 15.
Therefore, Jacob made approximately 15 toys.
Action: Answer("A")
