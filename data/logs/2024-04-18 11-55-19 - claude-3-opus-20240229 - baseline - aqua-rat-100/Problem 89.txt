Question: Calculate the maximum distance you can travel with $8.50 on a cab which charges $3.50 for the first quarter-mile and 10 cents for each additional quarter mile.
Choices:
  A: 11.75 miles
  B: 12.75 miles
  C: 17.75 miles
  D: 14.75 miles
  E: 10.75 miles
## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1. The cab charges $3.50 for the first quarter-mile. So after the first quarter-mile, you have $8.50 - $3.50 = $5.00 left.
2. Each additional quarter-mile costs 10 cents. To find how many additional quarter-miles you can travel with the remaining $5.00, we divide:
   
   $5.00 รท $0.10 per quarter-mile = 50 additional quarter-miles
3. So in total, you can travel:
   
   First quarter-mile + Additional quarter-miles = Total quarter-miles
   1 + 50 = 51 quarter-miles
4. To convert quarter-miles to miles, we divide by 4:
   
   51 quarter-miles รท 4 = 12.75 miles
Therefore, the maximum distance you can travel with $8.50 is 12.75 miles.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
