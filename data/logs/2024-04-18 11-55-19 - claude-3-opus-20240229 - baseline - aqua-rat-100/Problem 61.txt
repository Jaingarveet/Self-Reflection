## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.

Topic: Math
Question: Kevin drove from A to B at a constant speed of 70 mph. Once he reached B, he turned right around with pause, and returned to A at a constant speed of 90 mph. Exactly 3 hours before the end of his trip, he was still approaching B, only 70 miles away from it. What is the distance between A and B?
Choices:
  A: 180
  B: 90
  C: 270
  D: 360
  E: None of the above
## Assistant 2:
Let's approach this step-by-step:
1. Let the distance between A and B be x miles.
2. Kevin's speed from A to B is 70 mph, so the time taken for this part of the journey is x/70 hours.
3. Kevin's speed from B to A is 90 mph, so the time taken for this part of the journey is x/90 hours.
4. The total journey time is x/70 + x/90 hours.
5. 3 hours before the end of his trip, Kevin was 70 miles away from B. This means he had 70 miles left to reach B, and then x miles to reach A.
6. In these 3 hours, he covered 70 miles at 70 mph (which took 1 hour) and x miles at 90 mph (which took x/90 hours).
7. So, 1 + x/90 = 3
8. Solving this equation: x/90 = 2, so x = 180
Therefore, the distance between A and B is 180 miles.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
