## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")

Question: A wire in the shape of rectangle of length 27 cm and breadth 17 cm is rebent to form a square. What will be the measure of each side?
Choices:
  A: 9
  B: 11
  C: 22
  D: 25
  E: 31
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
The total area of the rectangle is 27 cm x 17 cm = 45[REDACTED] sq. cm. When the rectangle is rebent into a square, the area remains the same. Therefore, the area of the square is also 45[REDACTED] sq. cm. 

To find the length of one side of the square, we divide the area by the length of one side: 
45[REDACTED] sq. cm / side = side^2

side^2 = 45[REDACTED]
side = √45[REDACTED] ≈ 21.4 cm

Since we need an integer side length, we round down to the nearest integer: 21 cm.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: The area of the rectangle is length x breadth = 27 x 17 = 459 sq. cm. When the rectangle is rebent into a square, the area remains the same. So, the area of the square is also 459 sq. cm. 

To find the length of one side of the square, we take the square root of the area: sqrt(459) ≈ 21.4 cm. 

Since we need an integer side length, we round down to the nearest integer: 21 cm.
Action: Answer("E")
