Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
Original contribution = Rs. 96 / n 

After 4 friends did not show up: 
New contribution = Rs. (96 + 4*4) / (n-4) = Rs. 144 / (n-4) 

We set up the equation: 
Rs. 144 / (n-4) = Rs. 96 / n + 4 

Multiplying both sides by (n-4) yields: 
144 = 96 + 4n 

Subtracting 96 from both sides: 
4[REDACTED] = 4n 

Dividing by 4: 
n = [REDACTED] 

The number of friends who attended the picnic is n = [REDACTED].
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The number of friends who attended the picnic can be found by setting up and solving an equation.

Original contribution per person = Rs. 96 / n

After 4 friends didn't show up:
New contribution per person = Rs. (96 + 4*4) / (n-4) = Rs. 144 / (n-4)

We set up the equation:
Rs. 144 / (n-4) = Rs. 96 / n + 4

Multiplying both sides by (n-4):
144 = 96 + 4n

Subtracting 96 from both sides:
48 = 4n

Dividing by 4:
n = 12

So, the number of friends who attended the picnic was 12.
Action: Answer("B")
