Question: A straight picket fence is composed of x pickets each of which is 1/2 inch wide. If there are 6 inches of space between each pair of pickets, which of the following represents the length of fence in feet?
Choices:
  A: 13x/2
  B: 13x/2 - 6
  C: 13x/24

  E: (13x-12)/24
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
Each picket plus the space is 6.5 inches. 
The total length of the fence is (6+1/2)x inches = 13/2*x inches.
To convert this to feet, we multiply by 1/12 or simplify and multiply by 0.5 feet.
So, the answer is ([REDACTED])*0.5 feet, which simplifies to [REDACTED] feet.

Thought: 
Each picket plus the space is 6.5 inches. 
The total length of the fence is (6+1/2)x inches = 13/2*x inches.
To convert this to feet, we multiply by 1/12 or simplify and multiply by 0.5 feet.
So, the answer is (13/2*x)*0.5 feet, which simplifies to 13x/24 feet.
