Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
The time interval between each tablet consumption is 15 minutes. 
To find the total time to consume all 5 tablets, we recognize that '15 minutes' is a quarter of an hour, and therefore, 5 tablets will take 5 * 15 minutes = 5 * 1/4 hours = 5/4 hours.
Converting this fraction to minutes, we get 5/4 hours * 60 minutes = 75/4 minutes = 18.75 minutes.
So, the correct answer is 75 minutes, or choice [REDACTED].
## Assistant 2:
Thought: The time interval between each tablet is 15 minutes, so to find the total time, we multiply: 5 tablets * 15 minutes/tablet = 75 minutes.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: E
Score: 0
