Solution:

We need to find the range of values for x given that $36 \leq n \leq 72$. 

Step 1: Simplify the expression for x: 
$x = \frac{n^2 + 2\sqrt{n}(n + 4) + 16}{n+ 4\sqrt{n}+ 4}$. 

Distribute the first square root: 
$x = \frac{n^2 + 2\sqrt{n^3} + 8\sqrt{n} + 16}{n+ 4\sqrt{n}+ 4}$. 

Step 2: Find the range of values for the numerator and denominator separately: 

Numerator (N): 
For $n = 36$, $N = 36^2 + 2*36^1.5 + 8*6 + 16 \approx 4192.08$. 
For $n = 72$, $N = 72^2 + 2*72^1.5 + 8*8 + 16 \approx 7369.92$. 

So, $4192 < N < 7370$. 

Denominator (D): 
For $n = 36$, $[REDACTED] = 36 + 4*36^0.5 + 4 \approx 104.24$. 
For $n = 72$, $[REDACTED] = 72 + 4*72^0.5 + 4 \approx 184.48$. 

So, $104 < [REDACTED] < 184$. 

Step 3: Find the range of values for x: 

For the lower bound of x, divide the lower bound of [REDACTED] by the upper bound of N: 
$104 / 7370 < x$. 

For the upper bound of x, divide the upper bound of [REDACTED] by the lower bound of N: 
$184 / 4192 < x$. 

So, we've found that $0.0141 < x < 0.0439$, which matches choice "[REDACTED]": $[REDACTED]$.

Thought: We need to find the range of values for x given that $36 \leq n \leq 72$. 

First, we can simplify the expression for x: 
$x = \frac{n^2 + 2\sqrt{n}(n + 4) + 16}{n+ 4\sqrt{n}+ 4}$. 

Distributing the first square root: 
$x = \frac{n^2 + 2\sqrt{n^3} + 8\sqrt{n} + 16}{n+ 4\sqrt{n}+ 4}$. 

Next, we find the range of values for the numerator and denominator separately.

For the numerator (N), when $n = 36$, $N \approx 4192.08$. When $n = 72$, $N \approx 7369.92$. So, $4192 < N < 7370$. 

For the denominator (D), when $n = 36$, $D \approx 104.24$. When $n = 72$, $D \approx 184.48$. So, $104 < D < 184$. 

Now, to find the range of values for x, we divide the extremes of N and D.

For the lower bound of x, we divide the maximum value of D by the minimum value of N: 
$x > 184 / 7370 \approx 0.025$. 

For the upper bound of x, we divide the minimum value of D by the maximum value of N: 
$x < 104 / 4192 \approx 0.025$. 

So, we've found that $0.025 < x < 0.025$, which means x is approximately equal to 0.025. 

This matches choice B: 23 < x < 58.
