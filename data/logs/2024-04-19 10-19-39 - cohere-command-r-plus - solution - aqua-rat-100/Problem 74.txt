## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

  A: 12
  B: 10
  C: 5
  D: 15

Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
There are [REDACTED] choices for the first point and 4 choices for the second point. For the third point, there are 3 choices, and for the fourth point, there are 2 choices. The number of ways to choose 4 out of [REDACTED] points is calculated as [REDACTED] x 4 x 3 x 2 = [REDACTED]0. However, this includes quadrilaterals with intersecting sides, which cannot be formed. 

There are 4 choices for the first point ([REDACTED], [REDACTED], [REDACTED], D), and for the second point, there are 3 choices ([REDACTED], [REDACTED], D). The third point has 2 choices, and the fourth point is determined. This results in 4 x 3 x 2 = 24 quadrilaterals with intersecting sides. 

To find the total number of valid quadrilaterals, subtract the intersecting ones from the total: [REDACTED]0 - 24 = 96. 

Now, we need to consider the quadrilaterals that include point F. There are [REDACTED] choices for the three remaining points, resulting in [REDACTED] valid quadrilaterals that include the center point. 

Therefore, the final count of unique quadrilaterals is 96 + [REDACTED] = **[REDACTED]1**.
