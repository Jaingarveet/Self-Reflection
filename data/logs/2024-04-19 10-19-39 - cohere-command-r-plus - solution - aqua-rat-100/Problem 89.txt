Solution:
The cab charges $3.50 for the first quarter-mile and $0.10 for each additional quarter-mile. 

Let's calculate the cost for distances varying by a quarter-mile, starting from 1 quarter-mile and ending at 35 quarter-miles (9 miles), with a step of 1 quarter-mile. 

1/4 mile: $3.50
2/4 miles: $3.60
...
34/4 miles: $7.40
35/4 miles: $7.50

With a budget of $8.50, we can afford the fare up to 35/4 miles, which is equivalent to 8.75 miles. Therefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED], including the initial quarter-mile.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: To maximize distance, we need to travel in quarter-mile increments to avoid paying extra for fractions of a quarter mile. 

The fare for the first quarter-mile is a flat rate of $3.50. For the next 5 quarter-miles, the fare is $0.10 each, bringing us to 6 quarter-miles or 1.5 miles for $4.00. 

Continuing in this pattern, we can travel 11 quarter-miles for $8.00, and the next quarter-mile will cost $8.10. As $8.10 is the closest we can get to our budget without going over, this is the maximum distance. 

Converting 11 quarter-miles to miles, we get 11 / 4 = 2.75 miles. Adding the quarter-mile included in the flat rate brings us to a final answer of 3.00 miles.
