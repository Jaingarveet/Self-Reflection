Question: A square piece of cloth is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge to form a rectangular piece, which is then cut diagonally in half to create two triangles. If the area of each of triangle is 70 square feet, what was the perimeter (in feet) of the original piece of square cloth?
Choices:
  A: 56
  B: 58
  C: 60
  D: 62
  E: 64
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
Let's break down the problem step by step: 

1. We know that the area of each triangle is $70$ square feet, and we want to find the area of the original square. Since the diagonal cut divides the rectangle into two equal triangles, we know that the area of the rectangle is also $70 \times 2 = 140$ square feet. 

2. Now, we need to find the side length of the original square. The rectangle formed after trimming the square has dimensions $x$ and $x-4$, where $x$ is the side length of the original square. We know that the area of the rectangle is $140$ square feet, so we can set up the equation: 
   $x(x-4) = 140$ 

3. Solving the quadratic equation, we find that $x = 12$. This is the side length of the original square. 

4. To find the perimeter of the square, we multiply the side length by $4$: 
   $4 \times 12 = \text{[REDACTED] feet}$. 

So, the correct answer is $\text{[REDACTED] feet}$.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The side length of the square is 12 feet (as calculated in the reflection).
The perimeter of the square is 4 * 12 = 48 feet.
