## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

  E: 25/3
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
Given:
6 pita breads = [REDACTED] rolls
[REDACTED] rolls = 5 baguettes

Step 1: Find the equivalence for [REDACTED] baguettes:
[REDACTED] baguettes = 5/[REDACTED] rolls (given: [REDACTED] rolls = 5 baguettes)

Step [REDACTED]: Find the equivalence for 5/[REDACTED] rolls in pita breads:
5/[REDACTED] rolls = 6/5 * 5/[REDACTED] pita breads = [REDACTED] pita breads

Therefore, [REDACTED] baguettes are equivalent to [REDACTED] pita breads.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
2 baguettes = 2 * (5/3 rolls) = 10/3 rolls
10/3 rolls = 6/5 * 10/3 pita breads = 12/5 pita breads

So, 2 baguettes contain the same amount of falafel as 12/5 pita breads.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
