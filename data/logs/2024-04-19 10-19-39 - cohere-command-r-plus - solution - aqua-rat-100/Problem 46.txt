Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
Let's call the man's monthly income 'x'. 
He saves 12.5% of 'x', which is 0.125x, and this amount is not spent. So, his expenses are Rs. 3500, and his income is x. 

We can set up the equation: 
x - 0.125x = Rs. 3500 

Now, simply solve for x: 
0.875x = Rs. 3500 
x = Rs. 3500 / 0.875 
x = [REDACTED]
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Monthly expense = Rs. 3500
The rate of saving = 12.5/100 = 12.5%

Let his monthly income be Rs x
Saving = 12.5% of income = Rs (12.5/100)x = Rs (1/8)x

Therefore, expenditure = income - saving 
=> Rs (7/8)x = Rs 3500
=> x = 3500 * 8/7 
=> x = Rs. 4400
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
