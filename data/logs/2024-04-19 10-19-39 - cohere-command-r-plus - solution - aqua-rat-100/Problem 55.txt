## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: If a man rows at the rate of 4 kmph in still water and his rate against the current is 2 kmph, then the man's rate along the current is:
Choices:
  A: 15 kmph
  B: 6 kmph
  C: 12 kmph
  D: 14 kmph
  E: 6 kmph
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
Let the man's rate along the current be "x" kmph and the current's rate be "y" kmph.
We can set up a system of equations based on the given information:
x - y = 2 (the man's rate against the current)
x + y = 4 (the man's rate in still water)

Adding these equations, we get:
2x = 6
x = 3

Substituting x into the equation x + y = 4:
3 + y = 4
y = 1

Now, we can find the man's rate along the current:
x = 3 kmph

Therefore, the correct answer is **[REDACTED]: 3 kmph**.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Let the speed of the current be x kmph
Then, the man's speed along the current = (x + 4) kmph

Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: E
Score: 0
