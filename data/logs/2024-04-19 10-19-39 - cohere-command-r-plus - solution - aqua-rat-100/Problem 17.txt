Question: A company produces 420 units of a particular computer component every month, at a production cost to the company of $110 per component, and sells all of the components by the end of each month. What is the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee that the yearly profit (revenue from sales minus production costs) will be at least $626,400 ?
Choices:
  A: 226
  B: 230
  C: 240
  D: 260
  E: 280

You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:

The company produces 420 units of the component monthly, so the yearly production is 420 * 12 = 5040 components. 

To make a profit of at least $626,400, the revenue from sales must exceed the production costs by this amount. 

Total production costs are 5040 * $110 = $554,400 

So, the total sales revenue required is $626,400 + $554,400 = $1,180,800 

Now, to find the minimum selling price per component, we divide the total sales revenue by the number of components produced and sold monthly: 

$1,180,800 / 420 = $[REDACTED]0 / 9 = $311.11 (rounded to the nearest cent) 

So, the correct answer is [REDACTED].
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The company wants to make a profit of at least $626,400 in a year.
First, we calculate the total cost of production for a year: 
$110/component * 420 components/month * 12 months = $554,400

Now, we can calculate the total revenue required for the year: 
Profit + Costs = Revenue 
$626,400 + $554,400 = $1,180,800

Finally, we can find the minimum selling price by dividing the total revenue by the number of components sold in a year (which is also 420 * 12 = 5040): 
$1,180,800 / 5040 = $234

So, the company must sell each component for at least $234 to make a profit of $626,400, which is not an option. The closest option is $20 more, making the answer $254.
