Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:

Let's assume John has x amount of money. 

According to Mark, if John gives him half of John's money, Mark will have Rs. 75. So, from Mark's perspective: 
John's contribution = 1/2 * x
Mark already had: 75 - (1/2)x

According to John, if he receives one-third of Mark's money, he will have Rs. 75. So, from John's perspective: 
John's original amount + (1/3) of Mark's money = Rs. 75
This can be written as: x + (1/3)(2x - 75) = 75

Now, we can solve for x: 
75 = x + (2/3)x - 25
75 = (5/3)x - 25
100 = (5/3)x
x = [REDACTED]
## Assistant 2:
Thought: John has Rs. 60.

Reflection: I made a mistake in my previous attempt by incorrectly assuming that Mark's initial amount was Rs. 75. I should have recognized that Mark's statement refers to his amount after receiving money from John, not his initial amount. To correctly solve the problem, I should have set up two equations based on both Mark's and John's perspectives and then solved for the variable representing John's money.
