Solution:

Let's assume Jack bought x white sharpeners and (18-x) brown sharpeners. 

From the question, we can write the equations: 

x + (18-x) = 18       (this is simply combining like terms, and it ensures the total number of sharpeners is 18)

x + 1 + (18-x) = 100  (the cost of white sharpeners is 1 rupee more, and the total cost is rs. 100)

Solving the equations, we find x = 10 and thus, 18-x = 8.
