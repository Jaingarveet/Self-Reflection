Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
The initial group has 64 boys and 40 girls, totaling 104 members. During the drive, an equal number of boys and girls joined to establish a new ratio of 4:3 (boys to girls). 

To find the total number of members now, we can use the ratio: 
Total members = (4/7) * Initial members 
Total members = (4/7) * 104 
Total members = [REDACTED]
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Initially, there are 64+40 = 104 members. 
Let x be the number of new boys and girls that joined.
After the drive:
(64+x) boys / (40+x) girls = 4/3
3(64+x) = 4(40+x)
192+3x = 160+4x
3x-x = 160-192
2x = -32
x = -16
This is not possible since the number of new boys and girls cannot be negative.
Therefore, the answer is B: 288.
Action: Answer("B")

Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: E
