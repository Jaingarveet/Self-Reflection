Solution:
## Assistant 2:
Reflection: The hollow cube consists of 3 layers of smaller cubes. Each layer consists of $5 \times 5$ smaller cubes, and we have 6 faces of the large cube, so there are $5 \times 5 \times 6 = 150$ smaller cubes in the outer surface layer. Each smaller cube has 6 faces, so there are $6 \times 150 = 900$ faces in total. Of these, one-third are inside the hollow cube, so $900 \div 3 = 300$ faces are not painted, and $900 - 300 = 600$ faces are painted. Thus, $900 - 600 = 300$ faces remain unpainted, which is choice E.

Action: Answer("E")
