## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:

  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: A starts travel towards south 3km, then travel 5 km towards east, and again travels 3 km to north, and finally travels 2km towards west. In the end how far from is A from home?
Choices:
  A: 3km
  B: 2km
  C: 4km
  D: 5km
  E: 6km

You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
[REDACTED] travels 3 km south, 5 km east, 3 km north, and 2 km west. The net displacement to the south and north cancels out, leaving [REDACTED] 3 km to the east and 2 km to the north of the starting point. These displacements are not perpendicular, so we calculate them separately. Thus, [REDACTED] is 3 km away from home.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The traveler's net displacement is 3km to the east and 2km to the north. 
These displacements are perpendicular, so we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the distance from the home position, which is 3km.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
