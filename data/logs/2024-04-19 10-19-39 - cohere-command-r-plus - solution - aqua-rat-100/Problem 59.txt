Question: 20 marbles were pulled out of a bag of only white marbles, painted black, and then put back in. Then, another 20 marbles were pulled out, of which 1 was black, after which they were all returned to the bag. If the percentage of black marbles pulled out the second time represents their percentage in the bag, how many marbles in total Q does the bag currently hold?
Choices:
  A: 40
  B: 200
  C: 380
  D: 400
  E: 3200
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
There are 20 black marbles in the bag after the second round. 
The probability of pulling out a black marble the second time is still 1/20. 
This probability represents the ratio of black marbles to all marbles in the bag. 
So, we set up the equation: 1/20 = 20/Q. 
Solving for Q, we get Q = [REDACTED]0.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The probability of pulling out a black marble is 1/20, meaning there are 20 black marbles in the bag. 
We set up the equation: 1/20 = 20/Q, where Q is the total number of marbles in the bag. 
Solving for Q, we get Q = 400.
Action: Answer("D")
