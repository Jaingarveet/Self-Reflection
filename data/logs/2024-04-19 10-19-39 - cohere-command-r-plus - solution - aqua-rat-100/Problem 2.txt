Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
The average of the 10 vehicles' weights is $12.2$ tons, so their total weight is $10 \times 12.2 = 122$ tons. After adding the new truck, the average weight increased to $12.2 + 2.6 = 14.8$ tons, and the total weight increased to $14.8 \times 11 = 162.8$ tons. The weight of the new heavy-duty truck is $162.8 - 122 = \mathbf{[REDACTED]}$ tons.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The total weight of the 11 vehicles is 162.8 tons (14.8 multiplied by 11), and the total weight of the original 10 vehicles is 122 tons (12.2 multiplied by 10). 
The weight of the new truck is the difference between these two totals, which is 40.8 tons.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
