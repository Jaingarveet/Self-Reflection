## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The book was on sale for 40% off its original price. This means that the sale price of the book is 60% of the original price. If the sale price is $18.00, we can find the original price by dividing the sale price by 60% (or 0.60).
Calculation: 
Original Price = Sale Price / 0.60 = $18.00 / 0.60 = $30.00
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
