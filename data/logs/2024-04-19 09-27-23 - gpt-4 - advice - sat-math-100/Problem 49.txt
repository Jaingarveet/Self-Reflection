# Model: gpt-4 | Agent: advice | Exam: sat-math-100 | Problem 49 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

- Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
- Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
- Be careful when combining like terms in an equation.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The given equation is a rational equation. To solve for 'a', we can equate the numerators and the denominators on both sides of the equation since the denominators are already the same. 
The numerator on the left side is 24x^2 + 25x - 47 and on the right side is -8x - 3. Equating these gives us the quadratic equation 24x^2 + 33x - 44 = 0.
The denominator on the left side is ax - 2 and on the right side is ax - 2. Equating these gives us a = a, which doesn't help us find the value of 'a'.
Solving the quadratic equation 24x^2 + 33x - 44 = 0 using the quadratic formula gives us x = [-33 ± sqrt((33)^2 - 4*24*(-44))]/(2*24). 
We know that x ≠ 2/a, so we substitute x = 2/a into the solutions for x and solve for 'a'. 
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
