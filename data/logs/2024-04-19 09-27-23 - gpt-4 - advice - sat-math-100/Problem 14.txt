## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The relationship between x and y is linear, so it can be represented by the equation y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept. 
The slope can be calculated by taking the difference in y-values divided by the difference in x-values between any two points. 
From the table, the difference in y-values between the points (a, 0) and (3a, -a) is -a - 0 = -a. The difference in x-values is 3a - a = 2a. So, the slope m = -a / 2a = -1/2.
The y-intercept is the value of y when x = 0. From the table, we can see that the y-intercept is not given. However, we can use the point (a, 0) and the slope to find the y-intercept. If we plug these values into the equation y = mx + b, we get 0 = -1/2*a + b. Solving for b gives b = a/2.
So, the equation of the line is y = -1/2*x + a/2. Multiplying through by 2 to get rid of the fractions gives 2y = -x + a. Rearranging terms gives x + 2y = a.
Action: Answer("A")
