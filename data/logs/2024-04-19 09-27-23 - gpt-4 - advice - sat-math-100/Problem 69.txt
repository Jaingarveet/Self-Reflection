Question: Alan drives an average of 100 miles each week. His car can travel an average of 25 miles per gallon of gasoline. Alan would like to reduce his weekly expenditure on gasoline by $\$ 5$. Assuming gasoline costs $\$ 4$ per gallon, which equation can Alan use to determine how many fewer average miles, $m$, he should drive each week?
Choices:
  A: $\frac{25}{4} m=95$
  B: $\frac{25}{4} m=5$
  C: $\frac{4}{25} m=95$
  D: $\frac{4}{25} m=5$

## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Alan wants to reduce his weekly expenditure on gasoline by $5. Since gasoline costs $4 per gallon, this means he wants to use 5/4 = 1.25 gallons less each week. Since his car can travel 25 miles per gallon, this means he wants to drive 1.25 * 25 = 31.25 miles less each week. So, we need to find an equation that represents this situation. 
The equation should be set up as follows: (miles driven)/(miles per gallon) = gallons used. We want to find the number of miles, m, that corresponds to 1.25 gallons less. So, the equation should be m/25 = 1.25, which simplifies to m = 31.25. 
Looking at the answer choices, none of them match this equation. However, if we multiply both sides of our equation by 4/25 (the cost per mile), we get (4/25)m = 5, which matches choice D.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
