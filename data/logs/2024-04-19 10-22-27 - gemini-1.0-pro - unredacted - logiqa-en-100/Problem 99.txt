Topic: Logic
Context: Conne Levi with a "moe" look looks like other newborns.But because it is the world's first test-tube baby screened by next-generation gene sequencing technology, his advent has attracted the attention of experts and scholars.Not long ago, this news detonated the audience at the "European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology Annual Meeting" held in London, England.And ordinary people also believe that humans may usher in the era of "customized babies".
Question: Which of the following, if true, would best refute the views of ordinary people?
Choices:
  A: "Artificial" genetic screening does not rule out that there will be loopholes; in natural conception, the guidelines for survival of the fittest in nature seem to be more subtle and effective
  B: It can be seen from the development history of modern science and technology that technological development is often faster than human cognition, and sometimes technology will go further and deviate from the track of human cognition
  C: Gene screening is mainly to avoid reproductive defects, this technology brings opportunities for human eugenics and eugenics; as for "customized babies", the concept of cloning is more involved, the two should not be confused
  D: "Customized babies" have not been tried globally, this concept also challenges the most controversial human reproductive ethics

Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I incorrectly focused on the ethical concerns surrounding "customized babies" rather than the specific issue of gene screening.
Error Keywords:
 - Misinterpretation of the question
 - Irrelevant reasoning
 - Ignoring key details
Solution:
The views of ordinary people are that humans may usher in the era of "customized babies".
Option A refutes this by stating that genetic screening does not guarantee perfection and natural selection may be more effective.
Option B refutes this by stating that technology can sometimes deviate from human expectations.
Option C refutes this by stating that gene screening is mainly for avoiding defects and "customized babies" are more related to cloning.
Option D refutes this by stating that "customized babies" are not yet a reality and raise ethical concerns.
The correct answer is C because it directly addresses the issue of gene screening and its limitations in creating "customized babies".
Instructions:
1. Carefully read the question and identify the specific issue being addressed.
2. Analyze each answer choice and determine how it relates to the issue.
3. Choose the answer choice that directly refutes the given view.
