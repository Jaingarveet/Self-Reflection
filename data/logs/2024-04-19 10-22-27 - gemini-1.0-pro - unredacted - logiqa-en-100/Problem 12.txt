# Model: gemini-1.0-pro | Agent: unredacted | Exam: logiqa-en-100 | Problem 12 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Logic.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:
Topic: Geography
Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Logic
Context: Most people think that the thinking of scientists is based on strict logical reasoning, not on image thinking means such as analogy, intuition, and epiphany.However, research shows that Nobel Prize winners make more use of these image thinking methods than general scientists.Therefore, image thinking methods help to achieve major scientific breakthroughs.
Question: The above conclusion is based on which of the following assumptions?
Choices:
  A: Organized, step-by-step reasoning is essential for general scientific research.
  B: Nobel Prize winners have the ability to think creatively through analogy, intuition, and insight.
  C: Nobel winners have made major scientific breakthroughs.
  D: Nobel Prize winners are smarter and harder than ordinary scientists.
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
## Explanation:
My initial answer was incorrect because I focused on the **method** of thinking (image thinking) instead of the **outcome** (major scientific breakthroughs). The conclusion explicitly states that image thinking helps achieve breakthroughs, implying that Nobel Prize winners, who have achieved breakthroughs, must have used image thinking more.
## Error Keywords:
* **Focus on method instead of outcome**
* **Misinterpreting the causal relationship**
* **Ignoring explicit statements in the context**
## Solution:
1. Identify the conclusion: Image thinking methods help achieve major scientific breakthroughs.
2. Identify the evidence: Nobel Prize winners make more use of image thinking methods than general scientists.
3. Analyze the relationship: The evidence suggests that Nobel Prize winners, who have achieved breakthroughs, use image thinking more.
4. Identify the assumption: The conclusion assumes that Nobel Prize winners have made major scientific breakthroughs.
## Instructions:
1. Carefully read the conclusion and identify the main point.
2. Analyze the evidence provided and its connection to the conclusion.
3. Look for the underlying assumption that links the evidence to the conclusion.
4. Choose the answer that explicitly states the assumed connection.
## General Advice:
* Pay close attention to the wording of the conclusion and the evidence.
* Distinguish between methods, outcomes, and the relationships between them.
* Identify the missing link that connects the evidence to the conclusion.
* Look for the answer that explicitly states the assumed connection.
* Avoid focusing on irrelevant details or making unwarranted assumptions.
## Assistant 2:
Action: Answer("C")
