## System:
You are an expert in Logic.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Logic
Context: There are five volcanic islands E, F, G, H, and I in the east coast of a country.They are arranged in a straight line from north to south, and they are found? (1) F is adjacent to H and is on the north side of H.(2) I and E are adjacent.(3) G is somewhere in the north of F.
Question: If it is found that G is the northernmost island, how many possible arrangements are there for this group of islands?
Choices:
  A: 2
  B: 3
  C: 4
  D: 5
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that the given information only allowed for one possible arrangement of the islands. I failed to consider the possibility of different arrangements within the constraints provided.
Error Keywords:
- Oversimplification
- Lack of consideration of alternative possibilities
- Misinterpretation of constraints
Solution:
G is the northernmost island.
F is adjacent to H and is on the north side of H.
I and E are adjacent.
Based on these constraints, there are four possible arrangements:
1. G-F-H-E-I
2. G-H-F-E-I
3. G-F-E-H-I
4. G-E-F-H-I
Instructions:
1. Carefully analyze all given information and identify the constraints they impose on the possible arrangements.
2. Consider all possible arrangements that satisfy the given constraints.
3. Do not jump to conclusions based on limited information.
4. Systematically explore all possibilities within the given constraints.
5. Double-check your analysis to ensure that you have not overlooked any valid arrangements.
Advice:
- When solving logic problems, pay close attention to the details and implications of each piece of information provided.
- Consider all possible scenarios that satisfy the given constraints, even if they seem unlikely at first glance.
- Avoid making assumptions or jumping to conclusions without sufficient evidence.
- Use a systematic approach to explore all possibilities and eliminate those that violate the given constraints.
- Double-check your analysis and reasoning to ensure that you have not made any errors in your logic.
