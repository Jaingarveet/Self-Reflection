## System:
You are an expert in Logic.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## User 2:
Topic: Logic
Context: There must be an outside world, because if there is something outside me that can shine or reflect, shining the light into my eyes, which gives me a visual experience, I ca nâ€™t see the buildings, the crowds and the stars these things.And, not only have visual experience like me, but others also have such visual experience; book knowledge also tells us repeatedly that there is an outside world outside of us.
Question: Which of the following does not constitute doubt or rebuttal to the above argument?
Choices:
  A: To use sensory evidence to explain the existence of the external world requires presupposing the existence of the external world in the mind.
  B: How do you prove that others have similar visual experience to you?
  C: Since the visual experience is reliable, Mirage is not a so-called illusion, but a real existence.
  D: If there is no external world and natural science knowledge is not a true reflection of it, then why does natural science achieve such great success in practice?
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I incorrectly identified option D as supporting the argument when it actually strengthens the argument for the existence of an external world.
Error Keywords:
 - Misinterpretation of argument
 - Failure to identify supporting evidence
Solution:
The argument claims that the existence of an external world is proven by visual experiences and scientific knowledge.
Option A points out a circular reasoning in the argument.
Option B questions the reliability of visual experiences.
Option C is irrelevant to the argument.
Option D strengthens the argument by pointing out the success of natural science in practice, which would be difficult to explain without an external world.
Instructions:
1. Carefully read the argument and identify its main claim.
2. Analyze each option to determine whether it supports, weakens, or is irrelevant to the argument.
3. Be cautious of options that appear to support the argument but actually strengthen it.
4. Consider the implications of each option in relation to the main claim of the argument.
5. Choose the option that most clearly constitutes doubt or rebuttal to the argument.
Advice:
 - Pay close attention to the wording of the argument and the answer choices.
 - Consider the logical structure of the argument and how each option interacts with it.
 - Be wary of options that seem intuitively appealing but do not directly address the argument.
 - Remember that the goal is to identify the option that casts doubt on or refutes the argument, not necessarily the option that is most obviously wrong.
