## Assistant 2:
Thought: To answer this question, we need to consider the conditions provided and identify which of the statements contradicts them.

Condition 1: Franco does not testify on the same day as Garcia.

Condition 2: Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.

Condition 3: Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.

Condition 4: Hong does not testify on Monday.

Condition 5: At least one witness testifies on Monday.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Franco is the only witness scheduled to testify on Monday.
This is possible without violating the conditions.

Option B: Franco and Iturbe testify on the same day.
This violates Condition 1, as Franco and Garcia cannot testify on the same day.

Option C: Garcia and Hong testify on Tuesday.
This is possible, with the remaining two witnesses on Tuesday being Jackson and either Franco or Hong, without violating any conditions.

Option D: Garcia testifies on Monday, and Hong testifies on Wednesday.
This is possible, with Franco, Iturbe, and either Hong or Jackson testifying on Wednesday, without violating any conditions.

Option E: Jackson testifies on Tuesday, and two witnesses testify on Monday.
This is possible, with two of Franco, Garcia, and Hong testifying on Monday and the remaining one testifying on Wednesday, without violating any conditions.

Therefore, the statement that cannot be true is Option B, as it contradicts Condition 1.
