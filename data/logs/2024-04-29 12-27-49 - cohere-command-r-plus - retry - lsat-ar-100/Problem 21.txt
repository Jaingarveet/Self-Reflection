Context: A government needs to assign new ambassadors to Venezuela, Yemen, and Zambia. The candidates for these ambassadorships are Jaramillo, Kayne, Landon, Novetzke, and Ong. One ambassador will be assigned to each country, and no ambassador will be assigned to more than one country. The assignment of the ambassadors must meet the following constraints: Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships. If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne. If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen. If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
Question: If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then the other two ambassadors assigned could be
Choices:
  A: Jaramillo and Landon
  B: Jaramillo and Novetzke
  C: Kayne and Landon
  D: Kayne and Novetzke

## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
If Ong is the ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne cannot be the ambassador to Yemen. This means that Kayne could be the ambassador to Zambia, but this would violate the constraint that Landon must be assigned to Zambia if he is assigned at all. Therefore, Kayne cannot be an ambassador at all.

Jaramillo and Kayne cannot both be assigned as ambassadors because this would violate the constraint that either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, must be assigned. Therefore, Jaramillo also cannot be an ambassador.

This leaves Landon (who must go to Zambia), Novetzke, and Ong (who must go to Venezuela) as the three ambassadors.
Action: Answer("E")
