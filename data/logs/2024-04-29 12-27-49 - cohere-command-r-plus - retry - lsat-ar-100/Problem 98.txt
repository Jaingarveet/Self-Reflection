## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
From the information provided, we know that J must be shown in the evening and K cannot be shown in the morning. This means that K must be shown in the afternoon or evening, which in turn means that A is true - K is shown at some time after J is shown.

B is false because L could be shown in the morning, before J, and still satisfy the given rules. 
C is false because J is shown in the evening, so it is not possible for J to be shown before P. 
D is false because M could be shown directly after L, which would mean that N and O are shown before M. 
E is false because K is shown before M, so it is not possible for both N and P to be shown after K and still satisfy the rule that L must be shown before M.
Action: Answer("A")
