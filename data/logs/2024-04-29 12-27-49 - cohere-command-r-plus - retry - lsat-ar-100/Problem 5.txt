## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
We know the following:
- There are three shelves, and at least two books are placed on each shelf.
- More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
- Book I is placed on the middle shelf.
- Book K is placed on a higher shelf than book F.
- Book O is placed on a higher shelf than book L.
- Books F and M are placed on the same shelf.

From these conditions, we can deduce that:
- Book F cannot be on the middle or bottom shelves, as it is on the same shelf as book M, and there must be at least two books on each shelf. So, book F is on the top shelf.
- Book K must be on a higher shelf than book F, so it is either on the middle or bottom shelf.
- Book O must be on a higher shelf than book L, so it could be on the middle or bottom shelf.

Therefore, statement A is true: O is placed on a higher shelf than M. This is because book M is on the same shelf as book F, which is on a lower shelf than book O.

Statement B may or may not be true, depending on where book G is placed. We don't have enough information to determine the relative positions of books G and K.

Statement C is false because book I is on the middle shelf, and we don't know the position of book C relative to book F.

Statement D is false because we don't know the positions of books G and O relative to each other.

Statement E is true because book F is on the top shelf, and book L cannot be on the middle or top shelves as it is lower than book O.

So, the correct answer is A and E.

Action: Answer("A,E")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
