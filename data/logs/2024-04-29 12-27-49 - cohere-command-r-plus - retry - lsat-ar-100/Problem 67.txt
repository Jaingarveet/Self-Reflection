## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
We know that at least one batch of cookies is made on Monday, and the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday. If no cookies are made on Wednesday, then Tuesday and Friday are the only remaining days to fulfill the requirement of three batches of each cookie being made each week. Therefore, it must be true that at least two batches of cookies are made on both Tuesday and Friday. While it is possible that more than two batches are made on these days, we cannot determine that exactly three batches are made without additional information.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
