The patient's symptoms of right-sided nasal obstruction, nasal discharge, and sometimes blood-tinged discharge suggest an inflammatory or infectious etiology. The biopsy findings are not provided in the question, but I recall that Rhinosporidiosis is a chronic granulomatous infection that commonly affects the nasal mucosa and presents with similar symptoms. The characteristic spores of Rhinosporidium seeberi on histopathology can confirm the diagnosis.
