Instructions:

1. Identify the patient's gestational age and gravidity.
2. Identify the patient's presenting symptom (unstable lie).
3. Consider all possible causes of an unstable lie in a multigravida at 34 weeks.
4. Analyze each possible cause and its likelihood based on the patient's history.
5. Choose the most likely cause based on the analysis.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The patient is a multigravida at 34 weeks gestation with a previous history of two normal deliveries. The presenting symptom is an unstable lie.
Possible causes of an unstable lie at this gestational age include oligohydramnios, placenta previa, pelvic tumor, and uterine anomalies.
Oligohydramnios is a condition characterized by a decrease in amniotic fluid volume, which can cause an unstable lie. However, it is not typically associated with a history of normal deliveries.
Placenta previa is a condition where the placenta implants in the lower uterine segment, covering the cervix. It can cause vaginal bleeding and is a risk factor for preterm delivery, but it is not typically associated with an unstable lie.
Pelvic tumors can cause an unstable lie by displacing the uterus, but they are rare and not typically associated with a history of normal deliveries.
Uterine anomalies, such as a bicornuate or septate uterus, can cause an unstable lie by altering the shape of the uterus. They are also associated with an increased risk of preterm delivery and malpresentation.
Based on the patient's history of normal deliveries and the presenting symptom of an unstable lie, uterine anomalies are the most likely cause.
