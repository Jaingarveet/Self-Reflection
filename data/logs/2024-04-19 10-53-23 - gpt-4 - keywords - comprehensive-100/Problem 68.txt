## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The line passes through the origin, so the slope of the line is determined by the points (0,0) and (2,k) or (k,32). The slope of a line is given by the formula (y2-y1)/(x2-x1). So, the slope is either k/2 or 32/k. Since the line passes through the origin, these two slopes should be equal. Therefore, k/2 = 32/k. Solving this equation for k gives k^2 = 64, so k = 8 or k = -8. Since k is not negative in the choices, k = 8.
Action: Answer("C")
