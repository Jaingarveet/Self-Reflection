## User 2:
Topic: Law
Context: Of the eight students—George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert—in a seminar, exactly six will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
Question: If George, Nina, and Robert give reports and they do so on different days from one another, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Helen gives a report on Wednesday.
  B: Nina gives a report on Monday.
  C: Nina gives a report on Tuesday.
  D: Olivia gives a report on Monday.
  E: Robert gives a report on Wednesday.

## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Given that George, Nina, and Robert give reports on different days, and George can only report on Tuesday, this means Nina and Robert must report on Monday and Wednesday. However, since Nina's report requires Helen and Irving to report the next day (unless Nina reports on Wednesday), Nina cannot report on Monday as this would require Helen and Irving to report on Tuesday, which is reserved for George. Therefore, Nina must report on Wednesday and Robert on Monday. This means Helen cannot report on Wednesday as Nina's report does not require Helen and Irving to report the next day. Therefore, the only possible answer is that Olivia gives a report on Monday.
Action: Answer("D")
