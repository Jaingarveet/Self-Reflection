## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: At its maximum speed, a space shuttle can travel 700m high in 40 seconds. It will also take 5 seconds to pass a point. What then is the length of the space shuttle?
Choices:
  A: 50 m
  B: 75 m
  C: 100 m
  D: 125 m
  E: 150 m

## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The space shuttle's maximum speed is 700m/40s = 17.5 m/s. 
If it takes 5 seconds to pass a point, then the length of the shuttle is 17.5 m/s * 5s = 87.5 m. 
However, this is not one of the options, which suggests that there may be a rounding error. 
The closest option to 87.5 m is 75 m, but this is still a significant difference. 
Therefore, I must have made a calculation error in my previous attempt. 
Let's try again: 
The speed of the shuttle is 700m/40s = 17.5 m/s. 
If it takes 5 seconds to pass a point, then the length of the shuttle is 17.5 m/s * 5s = 87.5 m. 
This time, the calculation is correct, but the answer is still not one of the options. 
This suggests that the question may be flawed, or that I am misunderstanding it. 
However, since I must choose an answer, I will choose the closest option to my calculated answer.
Action: Answer("B")
