## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The equation $(a x+2)(b x+7)=15 x^{2}+c x+14$ can be expanded to $abx^2 + (7a + 2b)x + 14 = 15x^2 + cx + 14$. 
Since the coefficients on the left and right sides of the equation must be equal for all values of x, we have $ab = 15$ and $7a + 2b = c$. 
We also know that $a + b = 8$. 
We can solve these equations to find the possible values of c. 
First, we can express b in terms of a using the equation $a + b = 8$, which gives $b = 8 - a$. 
Substituting this into the equation $ab = 15$, we get $a(8 - a) = 15$, which simplifies to $a^2 - 8a + 15 = 0$. 
Solving this quadratic equation gives $a = 3$ or $a = 5$. 
Substituting these values into the equation $7a + 2b = c$, we get $c = 7*3 + 2*(8 - 3) = 21 + 10 = 31$ when $a = 3$, and $c = 7*5 + 2*(8 - 5) = 35 + 6 = 41$ when $a = 5$. 
So the two possible values for c are 31 and 41.
