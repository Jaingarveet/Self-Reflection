Question: If the above statement is true, which of the following statements cannot be false?

Reflection:

I previously answered this question incorrectly, and upon reflection, I realized that I made a mistake in my reasoning. Here is my self-reflection:

I mistakenly assumed that statement B was true, which led me to choose option A as the correct answer. However, upon further analysis, I realized that statement B is actually false. A listed company can indeed need financing even if it has dividends. Therefore, option B is not a valid choice.

So, the correct answer is option C: A listed company does not need to issue new stocks, or is not a company with dividends.

Explanation:
The statement "If a company has a dividend, it does not need funds" is the key to this question. If a company has a dividend, it means that it has already distributed some of its profits to its shareholders. Therefore, it may not need as much financing as a company that does not have a dividend. However, this does not mean that the company does not need any financing at all. A listed company may still need financing for various reasons, such as expanding its operations, investing in new projects, or repaying debts.

Therefore, option C is the correct answer. A listed company does not need to issue new stocks, or it is not a company with dividends.
## Result:

Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
