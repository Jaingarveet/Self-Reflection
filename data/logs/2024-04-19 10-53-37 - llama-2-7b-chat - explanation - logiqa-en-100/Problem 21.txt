Context: Xiao Chen?

Reflection:

I previously answered this question incorrectly, selecting choice A: Point out that the key concepts used by Xiao Chen are ambiguous. However, upon further reflection, I realize that this answer is not the best choice.

The correct answer is choice C: pointed out that Xiao Chen's arguments contradict themselves. Xiao Wang's method of refuting Xiao Chen's views is to highlight the inconsistency in Xiao Chen's argument. Xiao Chen claims that the flickering light of the comet is an unusual scene, but Xiao Wang points out that this is not the case as comets are not typically observed far away from the sun. By highlighting this inconsistency, Xiao Wang is able to refute Xiao Chen's argument.
