A: Li and Liu were hired by the same unit.
B: Wang, Zhao, and Liu were all hired by Tianji.
C: Only Liu was hired by Tian Xuan.
D: Only Wang was hired by Tianxuan.

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand that my solution was incorrect. Here is my reflection on the problem:

I mistakenly assumed that Li and Liu were hired by the same unit, which led me to choose option A. However, the information provided in the question states that Li was hired by Tianshu, and Liu was hired by Tianxuan, which means that they were not hired by the same unit.

Therefore, the correct answer is option C: Only Liu was hired by Tian Xuan.

Explanation:
The correct answer is option C, as only Liu was hired by Tian Xuan. Li was hired by Tianshu, and Zhao and Wang were not hired by the same unit. Therefore, the other options are not correct.
## Result:
