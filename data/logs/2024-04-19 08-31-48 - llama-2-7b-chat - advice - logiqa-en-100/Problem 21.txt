Reflection:

I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I realized that I misunderstood the context of the problem. I selected option A, which is incorrect. The correct answer is option C, which states that Xiao Wang pointed out that Xiao Chen's arguments contradict themselves.

Here's how I arrived at this answer:

Xiao Wang's method of refuting Xiao Chen's views is to point out that Xiao Chen's arguments are contradictory. Xiao Chen argues that the flickering light observed in the comet's orbit far from the sun is an unusual scene, but Xiao Wang disagrees with this conclusion. Xiao Wang points out that comets are normally not observed far away from the sun, which contradicts Xiao Chen's argument. Therefore, Xiao Wang's method of refuting Xiao Chen's views is to highlight the inconsistency in Xiao Chen's arguments.

[REDACTED]

In conclusion, the correct answer is option C, which states that Xiao Wang pointed out that Xiao Chen's arguments contradict themselves.
## Result:
