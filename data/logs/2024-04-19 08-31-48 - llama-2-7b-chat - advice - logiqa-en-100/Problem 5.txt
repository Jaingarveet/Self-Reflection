  D: Freedom of expression is insufficient to satisfy the needs of the masses, and good social order is also essential.

Self-Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, selecting choice B: Free speech ultimately tends to disrupt social order, and good social order is a prerequisite for meeting the needs of the masses. However, upon further reflection, I realize that this choice cannot weaken the argument. The argument states that free speech is essential for the government to hear the demands of the people, which can help the government meet their needs. Disrupting social order may hinder the government's ability to hear these demands, but it does not necessarily negate the need for free speech.

Therefore, the correct answer is choice D: Freedom of expression is insufficient to satisfy the needs of the masses, and good social order is also essential. This choice acknowledges that free speech is important for the government to hear the demands of the people, but also recognizes that good social order is necessary to ensure that these demands can be met.
## Result:
