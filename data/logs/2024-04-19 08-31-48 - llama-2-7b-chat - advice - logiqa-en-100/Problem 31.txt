  B: Opposite the degraded grasslands of Hulunbeier and Xilinguole in Inner Mongolia, the grasslands of Mongolian grassland are about 1 meter high.
  C: On the almost uninhabited border line of 10 kilometers wide between China and Mongolia, grass still maintains the height of the 1950s.

  Thought: Upon further reflection, I realize that the opinions expressed in the passage are not necessarily accurate. The statements provided do not necessarily prove that sand and dust storms are caused by grassland degradation and desertification.

Action: Answer("D")

Self-Reflection:

1. The first statement, "In the 1950s, grass in Xilin Gol grassland in Inner Mongolia was as tall as a horse's belly, and now grass can't even cover mice," is not a reliable source of information as it is from an unverified source. [REDACTED]
2. The second statement, "Opposite the degraded grasslands of Hulunbeier and Xilinguole in Inner Mongolia, the grasslands of Mongolian grassland are about 1 meter high," is also not a reliable source of information as it is based on anecdotal evidence. [REDACTED]
3. The third statement, "On the almost uninhabited border line of 10 kilometers wide between China and Mongolia, grass still maintains the height of the 1950s," is not a relevant factor in determining the cause of sand and dust storms. [REDACTED]
4. The fourth statement, "The increase in dust storms is mainly due to human factors such as overloaded grazing and predatory management of grasslands," is the most logical explanation for the increase in sand and dust storms in the Inner Mongolia region. [REDACTED]

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) The increase in dust storms is mainly due to human factors such as overloaded grazing and predatory management of grasslands.
