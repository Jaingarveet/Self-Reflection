## User 2:
Topic: Logic
Context: The Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge, built in 1968, has a clear height of 24 meters in the Fengshui area.Theoretically, it can pass a maximum of 3,000 tons of ships.Today, with the rapid economic development, it has become a building that “cuts the waist” of the Yangtze River waterway and hinders the passage of giant ships.A bridge expert asserted that the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge must be demolished and rebuilt in order to dredge the golden waterways of the Yangtze River completely.
Question: If any of the following is true, can you raise the most doubts about this expert's point of view?
Choices:
  A: Due to the inability of large ships to pass through the Nanjing Bridge, a large number of exported goods in the middle and upper reaches of the Yangtze River can only be taken by road or railway.
  B: 99% of international ships entering the Yangtze River are moored at ports below the Nanjing Bridge, and dozens of foreign trade terminals above Nanjing rarely have large external ships berthed.
  C: It is not enough to dismantle only the Nanjing Bridge.The Yangtze River Bridge, which was built in Wuhu, Tongling, Anqing and other places, has a clear height of 24 meters.
  D: Shipbuilding technology is highly developed, and 8000-ton ships designed for adapting to the passage of the Yangtze River abroad have passed through Nanjing to Wuhan.

Question: Can you raise the most doubts about this expert's point of view?

Reflection:
After initially answering the question incorrectly, I reflected on the problem and my solution. I realized that the expert's point of view is not entirely accurate. Here are the reasons why:

A: Due to the inability of large ships to pass through the Nanjing Bridge, a large number of exported goods in the middle and upper reaches of the Yangtze River can only be taken by road or railway.

REDACTED

B: 99% of international ships entering the Yangtze River are moored at ports below the Nanjing Bridge, and dozens of foreign trade terminals above Nanjing rarely have large external ships berthed.

REDACTED

C: It is not enough to dismantle only the Nanjing Bridge. The Yangtze River Bridge, which was built in Wuhu, Tongling, Anqing, and other places, has a clear height of 24 meters.

REDACTED

D: Shipbuilding technology is highly developed, and 8000-ton ships designed for adapting to the passage of the Yangtze River abroad have passed through Nanjing to Wuhan.

REDACTED

Conclusion:
Based on my reflection, the expert's point of view is not entirely accurate. The Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge is not the only obstacle hindering the passage of giant ships on the Yangtze River. Other bridges along the river, such as the Yangtze River Bridge in Wuhu, Tongling, Anqing, and other places, also have a clear height of 24 meters, which can also hinder the passage of large ships. Additionally, shipbuilding technology has advanced significantly, and 8000-ton ships designed for adapting to the passage of the Yangtze River have passed through Nanjing to Wuhan. Therefore, demolishing and rebuilding the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge may not completely solve the problem of hindering the passage of giant ships on the Yangtze River.
