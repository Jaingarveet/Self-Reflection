## System:
You are an expert in Math.
You have incorrectly answered the following multiple-choice question.
Your task is to reflect on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
You will then use this information help you answer the same question in the future.
First, explain why you answered the question incorrectly.
Second, list the keywords that describe the type of your errors from most general to most specific. 
Third, solve the problem again, step-by-step, based on your knowledge of the correct answer.
Fourth, create a list of detailed instructions to help you correctly solve this problem in the future.
Finally, create a list of general advice to help you solve similar types of problems in the future.  
Be concise in your response; however, capture all of the essential information.  
For guidance, I will provide you with a single generic example problem and reflection (below).

Topic: Geography and Math
Question: What is the product of the number of letters contained in the name of the city where Iowa State University is located multiplied by the number of letters contained in the name of the state?
Choices:
    A: 16
    B: 20
    C: 24
    D: 32
Thought:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
ISU is located in the state of Iowa.
Action: Answer("D")
---
Correct Answer: A
## Assistant 1:
Explanation:
I miscalculated the product of the number of letters in the city and state names. 
The gap in my knowledge was not in geography but in basic arithmetic. 
I knew the correct city and state but made a calculation error.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Arithmetic error
 - Multiplication error
Solution:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
Iowa State University is located in the state of Iowa.
The city name "Ames" contains 4 letters.
The state name "Iowa" contains 4 letters.
The product of 4*4 is 16.
Instructions:
1. Identify the city where the university is located.
2. Identify the state where the university is located.
3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.
4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.
5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.
6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.
7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them.

Topic: Math
Question: \begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}\hlineList A & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 \\\hlineList B & 2 & 3 & 3 & 4 & 4 & 5 \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}The table above shows two lists of numbers. Which of the following is a true statement comparing list $\mathrm{A}$ and list B ?
Choices:
  A: The means are the same, and the standard deviations are different.
  B: The means are the same, and the standard deviations are the same.
  C: The means are different, and the standard deviations are different.
  D: The means are different, and the standard deviations are the same.

Thought:
The mean of list A is 3.5.
The mean of list B is 3.83.
The standard deviation of list A is 1.71.
The standard deviation of list B is 0.83.
Action: Answer("C")

Correct Answer: A
## Assistant 2:
Response:
Explanation:
I incorrectly calculated the means and standard deviations of the two lists.
I made a calculation error in finding the mean of list A and the standard deviation of list B.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Mean calculation error
 - Standard deviation calculation error
Solution:
The mean of list A is 3.5.
The mean of list B is 3.83.
The standard deviation of list A is 1.71.
The standard deviation of list B is 0.83.
The means are different, and the standard deviations are different.
Instructions:
1. Calculate the mean of list A.
2. Calculate the mean of list B.
3. Calculate the standard deviation of list A.
4. Calculate the standard deviation of list B.
5. Compare the means and standard deviations of the two lists.
6. Choose the answer that accurately reflects the comparison of the means and standard deviations.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that the mean is the average of a set of numbers, and the standard deviation is a measure of how spread out the numbers are.
