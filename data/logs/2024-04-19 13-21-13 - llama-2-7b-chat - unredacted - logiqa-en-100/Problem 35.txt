  Reflection:

I previously answered this question incorrectly, stating that Li and Liu were hired by the same unit. However, upon further reflection, I realize that the information provided in the question does not support this answer.

From the information given, we know that Li was hired by Tianshu, and Liu and Zhao were hired by the same unit. This means that Liu and Zhao were not hired by the same unit as Li. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) Only Liu was hired by Tian Xuan.

I apologize for any confusion caused by my previous incorrect answer. Thank you for the opportunity to reflect and correct my mistake.
