Context: Xiao Chen? At present, part of the orbit of Comet 1996D3 is far from the sun, but recently it can be found to emit flickering light through the solar telescope.In the past, people never observed such flashes of comets far away from the sun, so this flicker must be an unusual scene.Xiao Wang? Normally people don't observe comets far away from the sun.The 1996D3 comet flicker light discovered this time was obtained by continuous and careful tracking observation.
Question: Which of the following most accurately summarizes the method Xiao Wang used to refute Xiao Chen's views?
Choices:
  A: Point out that the key concepts used by Xiao Chen are ambiguous.
  B: pointed out that Xiao Chen's argument is clearly lacking in persuasion.
  C: pointed out that Xiao Chen's arguments contradict themselves.
  D: Disagree with Xiao Chen's conclusion, and put forward another explanation for Xiao Chen's argument.E.Agree with Xiao Chen's conclusion, but put forward another explanation for Xiao Chen's argument.

Great, you have correctly answered the question!

The correct answer is (B) pointed out that Xiao Chen's argument is clearly lacking in persuasion. Xiao Wang refuted Xiao Chen's views by pointing out the contradiction in his arguments. Xiao Chen claimed that the 1996D3 comet flicker light was discovered through continuous and careful tracking observation, but people normally don't observe comets far away from the sun. This contradiction in arguments suggests that Xiao Chen's views are incorrect.

Well done! Here are some additional questions to help you reinforce your understanding of the topic:

1. What is the main point of contention between Xiao Chen and Xiao Wang?
2. How did Xiao Wang refute Xiao Chen's views?
3. What does the passage suggest about the reliability of Xiao Chen's argument?

I hope you find these questions helpful! Let me know if you have any other questions or need further clarification on any of the concepts.
## Assistant 2:
  Reflection:

I previously answered this question incorrectly, and then I reflected on the problem, my solution, and the correct answer.

The main point of contention between Xiao Chen and Xiao Wang is that Xiao Chen claimed that the 1996D3 comet flicker light was discovered through continuous and careful tracking observation, but people normally don't observe comets far away from the sun. Xiao Wang refuted Xiao Chen's views by pointing out the contradiction in his arguments, suggesting that Xiao Chen's views are incorrect.

To answer the additional questions,

1. The main point of contention between Xiao Chen and Xiao Wang is that Xiao Chen claimed that the 1996D3 comet flicker light was discovered through continuous and careful tracking observation, but people normally don't observe comets far away from the sun.
2. Xiao Wang refuted Xiao Chen's views by pointing out the contradiction in his arguments, suggesting that Xiao Chen's views are incorrect.
3. The passage suggests that Xiao Chen's argument is unreliable because it is based on a contradiction, and Xiao Wang's explanation is more plausible.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions or need further clarification on any of the concepts.
