Great job! You have identified the correct reasoning that shows the argument made by Taiwan independence elements is not valid.

The flaw in their argument is that they are making a blanket statement that all people under the jurisdiction of the People's Republic of China are Chinese, without considering the complex history and political dynamics of the region. Taiwan is a separate political entity with its own government, economy, and culture, and its people have the right to self-determination. Therefore, the argument that Taiwanese are not Chinese is valid.

Well done! Here are some additional tips to help you with logic questions:

1. Read the question carefully: Make sure you understand what the question is asking. Pay attention to the language used and the context of the question.
2. Identify the conclusion: Determine what the argument is trying to prove. Identify the conclusion and the premises used to support it.
3. Look for flaws in the argument: Identify any inconsistencies, contradictions, or logical fallacies in the argument. Consider alternative perspectives and evaluate the strength of the argument.
4. Use logical reasoning: Use logical reasoning to evaluate the argument. Consider the premises, the conclusion, and any assumptions made. Use logical operators such as "and," "or," and "not" to construct your argument.
5. Practice, practice, practice: The more you practice, the better you will become at evaluating arguments and identifying flaws. Try practicing with different types of questions and scenarios to improve your skills.

Keep up the good work!

  Thank you for the feedback and additional tips! I'm glad I could identify the correct reasoning that shows the argument made by Taiwan independence elements is not valid. Here is my reflection on the question:

Reflection:

After re-reading the question and the options, I realized that the correct answer is (D) Criminal behaviors are not necessarily illegal behaviors, and violations should not be condemned by the society. The argument made by Taiwan independence elements is flawed because they are making a blanket statement that all people under the jurisdiction of the People's Republic of China are Chinese, without considering the complex history and political dynamics of the region. Taiwan is a separate political entity with its own government, economy, and culture, and its people have the right to self-determination. Therefore, the argument that Taiwanese are not Chinese is valid.

To improve my logic skills, I will continue to practice evaluating arguments and identifying flaws. I will also try to be more mindful of the language used in the question and the context of the argument. Thank you for the additional tips and for providing feedback on my response.
