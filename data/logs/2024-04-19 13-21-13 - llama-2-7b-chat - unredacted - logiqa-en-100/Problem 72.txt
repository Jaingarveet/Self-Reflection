Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
Liu Xiang's words do not constitute a rebuttal to Assertion C, that most track and field champions are black athletes.

Liu Xiang's statement "Who said Asians can't be the sprint king ?! As long as I am there! You believe me!" is not a response to Assertion C, as it does not address or refute the idea that most track and field champions are black athletes. In fact, Liu Xiang's statement could be seen as reinforcing Assertion C, as he is highlighting the underrepresentation of Asians in the sport of track and field.

On the other hand, Assertion A, that only black athletes can become track and field champions, is directly challenged by Liu Xiang's words, as he is an Asian athlete who has won the championship and broken the Olympic record.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) Most track and field champions are black athletes.

Advice:

* Always carefully read the question and understand the context of the passage.
* Identify the assertions being made in the passage and determine which one the author's words are most likely to be a rebuttal to.
* Use critical thinking to evaluate the author's words and determine whether they constitute a rebuttal to the assertions being made.
* Remember that a rebuttal must directly address and refute the assertion being made, rather than simply challenging it.
