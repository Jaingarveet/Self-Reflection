Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
You have provided a logical and well-structured problem. Here's my analysis:

The information given in the problem:

1. Chessman A defeated Chessman B.
2. Chessman B applauded Chessman C.

Inference:

1. Chessman C is a strong player, as Chessman B applauded him.
2. Chessman A has not been defeated yet, which means it has a good chance of winning.

Conclusion:
Based on the information provided, it is possible that both Chess Armor and Chessman C could win the match, or Chessman C could win, or Chess Armor could win. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) Chess armor is likely to win, but it is also possible to lose.

Your answer, (C) The two will be tied, is also a valid conclusion, as there is no information to suggest that one player is significantly stronger than the other. However, based on the information provided, the most likely outcome is that Chess Armor will win, but there is a possibility that Chessman C could also win.
