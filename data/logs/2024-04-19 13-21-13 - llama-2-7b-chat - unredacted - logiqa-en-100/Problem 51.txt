Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand why. I made a mistake in my reasoning and overlooked an important constraint in the problem.

To solve this problem, we need to follow the given constraints:

1. H and Y must be allocated in the same department.
2. F and G cannot be allocated in the same department.
3. If X is allocated in the sales department, W is allocated in the production department.
4. F must be allocated in the production department.

From these constraints, we can deduce the following:

* H and Y must be allocated in the same department, so they cannot be allocated in different departments.
* F and G cannot be allocated in the same department, so they must be allocated in different departments.
* If X is allocated in the sales department, W must be allocated in the production department, since W is the only remaining candidate in the production department.
* F must be allocated in the production department, since it is the only remaining candidate in this department.

Therefore, the correct answer is B: H is assigned to the production department.

I hope this reflection helps me improve my problem-solving skills and accuracy in the future. Thank you for providing the feedback!
