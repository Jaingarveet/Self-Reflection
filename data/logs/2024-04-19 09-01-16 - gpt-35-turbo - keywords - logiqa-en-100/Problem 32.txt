## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The passage states that in a society with a solid cultural environment, people know how to respect themselves, others, and nature. It also provides examples of how this respect is demonstrated. 
Option A cannot be derived from the passage because it contradicts the statement that a person who is careful has taste. 
Option B can be derived from the passage because it states that a person who is overbearing is immoral, which is consistent with the passage's statement that people in a solid cultural environment know how to respect others. 
Option C can be derived from the passage because it states that if humans plunder nature, there will be no sustainable life, which is consistent with the passage's statement that people in a solid cultural environment know how to respect nature. 
Option D cannot be derived from the passage because it states that a person who is immoral is overbearing and careful, which is not necessarily true based on the information provided in the passage.
