## Assistant 2:
Thought:
To form the team, we need to consider all the given conditions.
E or F has one person to participate, but not both. So, either E or F will be selected.
One of J or K will participate, but not both. So, either J or K will be selected.
If J participates, then G participates. So, if J is selected, then G will also be selected.
Unless F participates, M does not participate. So, if F is not selected, then M will not be selected.
Using these conditions, we can eliminate some choices:
- A: F and H cannot be selected together because E or F has one person to participate, but not both.
- C: G and M cannot be selected together because unless F participates, M does not participate.
- D: H and M cannot be selected together because unless F participates, M does not participate.
So, the only possible choice is B: G and J.
If J is selected, then G will also be selected. And, either E or F will be selected. So, the team can be formed by selecting G, J, and either E or F. 
Action: Answer("B")
