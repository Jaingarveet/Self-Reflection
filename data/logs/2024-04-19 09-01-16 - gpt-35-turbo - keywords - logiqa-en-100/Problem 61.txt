## Assistant 2:
Thought:
I made an error in my previous answer, so I need to re-analyze the problem.
There are three departments, and each department is in charge of three general manager assistants.
Only one assistant general manager is in charge of three departments at the same time.
F and M are not in charge of the same department.
H and I are not in charge of the same department.
Action: 
If F and M are not in charge of the same department, then they are in charge of different departments. 
Thus, F is in charge of a department with two other general manager assistants, and M is in charge of a different department with two other general manager assistants.
Since each department is in charge of three general manager assistants, there must be one assistant general manager who is in charge of both F and M's departments.
Therefore, either I or H must be in charge of the department with F and M.
However, H and I are not in charge of the same department, so I cannot be in charge of the department with F and M.
Thus, H must be in charge of the department with F and M.
Therefore, F and H are in charge of the same department.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
