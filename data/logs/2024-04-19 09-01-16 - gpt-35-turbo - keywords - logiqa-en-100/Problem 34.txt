Thought:
The sentence is about not doing something to others that you wouldn't want done to you.
Option A is incorrect because it implies that only those who do what they want can do it to others, which is not a logical inference from the sentence.
Option B is incorrect because it suggests that if you want something, you should give it to others, which is not related to the sentence.
Option C is incorrect because it implies that you should only treat others if you want to, which is not the same as not doing something to others that you wouldn't want done to you.
Option D is incorrect because it suggests that whatever is applied to people should be what they want, which is not related to the sentence.
