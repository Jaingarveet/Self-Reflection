## Assistant 2:
Thought:
To replace a member of the group, we need to ensure that all the given conditions are still met.
Printing group: F, H, L, M
Binding group: G, H, J
Condition 1 is met since each group has at least 3 employees.
Condition 2 is met since F is in the printing group and K cannot be in the same group as F.
Condition 3 is met since J is in the binding group and if K is in a certain group, J must also be in this group.
Condition 4 is met since M is in the printing group and is at least one of the members of these two groups.
Condition 5 is not met since there are no same employees in both groups.
To meet condition 5, we need to replace H with K in the binding group.
Printing group: F, H, L, M
Binding group: G, J, K
Now all the conditions are met.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
