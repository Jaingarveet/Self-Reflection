## Assistant 2:
Thought:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, so I need to reflect on my mistake.
From the statements of the three professors, we know that the champion is not Tsinghua University team, Zhejiang University team, or China University of Science and Technology team.
Only one of the professors made a correct prediction, and the other two were wrong.
Professor Sun's statement contradicts Professor Zhao's statement, so one of them must be wrong.
Professor Qian's statement does not contradict either of the other two statements.
Therefore, the University of Science and Technology of China is the only team left that could be the champion.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
