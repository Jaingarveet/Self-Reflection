## Assistant 2:
Thought:
To explain the seemingly contradictory phenomenon, we need to find a statement that can reconcile the fact that 63% of respondents favored college students as nanny, but nearly 60% said "no" when asked if they would ask college students to be nanny. 
Option A is irrelevant to the phenomenon.
Option B is not related to the phenomenon.
Option C provides a possible explanation that some respondents think college students should do housekeeping work, but others think college students cannot provide better housekeeping services. This can explain why some respondents favored college students as nanny but would not ask them to be nanny.
Option D is irrelevant to the phenomenon.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
