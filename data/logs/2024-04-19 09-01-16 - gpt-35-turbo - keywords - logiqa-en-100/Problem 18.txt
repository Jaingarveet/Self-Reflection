## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The stem presents a dilemma for the celebrity, where both options have negative consequences.
Option A is an incorrect assumption because the stem does not provide enough information to conclude that the celebrity cannot stop the gossip news from damaging her personal reputation.
Option B is a misinterpretation because the stem clearly states that the gossip news puts the celebrity in an awkward situation, which implies that the reputation of a celebrity can be affected by gossip news in the media.
Option C is the best answer because the stem suggests that the celebrity has to choose between two bad options, and clarifying the truth is presented as the best strategy.
Option D is an overgeneralization because the stem does not provide any information about the actions of the celebrity's friends.
Action: Answer("C")
