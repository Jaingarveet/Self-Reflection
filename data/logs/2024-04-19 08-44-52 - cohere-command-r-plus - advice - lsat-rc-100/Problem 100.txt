Context: In studying the autobiographies of Native Americans, most scholars have focused on as-told-to life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators—that emerged from "bicultural composite authorship." Limiting their studies to such written documents, these scholars have overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history. In addition, they have failed to address the cultural constructs of the highly diverse Native American peoples, who prior to contact with nonindigenous cultures did not share with Europeans the same assumptions about self, life, and writing that underlie the concept of an autobiography— that indeed constitute the English word's root meaning. The idea of self was, in a number of pre-contact Native American cultures, markedly inclusive: identity was not merely individual, but also relational to a society, a specific landscape, and the cosmos. Within these cultures, the expression of life experiences tended to be oriented toward current events: with the participation of fellow tribal members, an individual person would articulate, reenact, or record important experiences as the person lived them, a mode of autobiography seemingly more fragmented than the European custom of writing down the recollections of a lifetime. Moreover, expression itself was not a matter of writing but of language, which can include speech and signs. Oral autobiography comprised songs, chants, stories, and even the process whereby one repeatedly took on new names to reflect important events and deeds in one's life. Dance and drama could convey personal history; for example, the advent of a vision to one person might require the enactment of that vision in the form of a tribal pageant. One can view as autobiographical the elaborate tattoos that symbolized a warrior's valorous deeds, and such artifacts as a decorated shield that communicated the accomplishments and aspirations of its maker, or a robe that was emblazoned with the pictographic history of the wearer's battles and was sometimes used in reenactments. Also autobiographical, and indicative of high status within the tribe, would have been a tepee painted with symbolic designs to record the achievements and display the dreams or visions of its owner, who was often assisted in the painting by other tribal members. A tribe would, then, have contributed to the individual's narrative not merely passively, by its social codes and expectations, but actively by joining in the expression of that narrative. Such intercultural collaboration may seem alien to the European style of autobiography, yet any autobiography is shaped by its creator's ideas about the audience for which it is intended; in this sense, autobiography is justly called a simultaneous individual story and cultural narrative. Autobiographical expressions by early Native Americans may additionally have been shaped by the cultural perspectives of the people who transmitted them.
Question: Which one of the following would be most consistent with the ideas about identity that the author attributes to pre-contact Native American cultures?
Choices:
  A: A person who is born into one tribe but is brought up by members of another tribe retains a name given at birth.
  B: A pictograph that represents a specific person incorporates the symbol for a constellation.
  C: A similar ritual for assuming a new name is used in diverse communities.
  D: A name given to one member of a community cannot be given to another member of the same community.
  E: A decorated shield that belonged to an individual cannot be traced to a particular tribe.

## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The author attributes a concept of identity to pre-contact Native American cultures that is relational and inclusive, encompassing connections to society, landscape, and the cosmos. This perspective stands in contrast to the individualistic assumptions about self often associated with European cultures.

Choice A describes a situation where an individual's name, a marker of personal identity, is retained despite their adoption into another tribe. This suggests a more static and individual-centric understanding of identity, which doesn't align with the fluid and relational concept described by the author.

Choice B connects a specific individual to a constellation, indicating a relational understanding of identity that extends beyond the earthly realm and includes cosmic elements. This is consistent with the author's attribution of a holistic view of self, encompassing the individual's relationship to the cosmos.

Choice C suggests that diverse communities share a similar ritual for assuming new names, implying a level of cultural relativity and a dynamic understanding of identity that can be shaped by communal practices. This aligns with the author's description of identity as being influenced by social codes and expressions.

Choice D implies that personal names function as unique identifiers within a community, suggesting a more individualized concept of identity. While this may be influenced by cultural expectations, it doesn't fully capture the relational and holistic nature described by the author.

Choice E contradicts the author's perspective by suggesting that an individual's possessions cannot be traced to a specific tribe. The author emphasizes the importance of relational identity, including societal connections, which would imply that an individual's artifacts should reflect their tribal affiliation.

Therefore, the correct answer is choice B.

Reflection: My previous mistake may have resulted from oversimplifying the author's perspective and not fully grasping the depth of the cultural constructs described. I overlooked the significance of the relational and cosmic aspects of identity, focusing more on individual-centric interpretations. This question serves as a reminder to carefully consider the nuances presented in the text and to avoid projecting my own cultural assumptions onto the author's arguments.
