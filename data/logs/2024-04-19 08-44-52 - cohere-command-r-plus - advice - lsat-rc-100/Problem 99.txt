Context: In studying the autobiographies of Native Americans, most scholars have focused on as-told-to life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators—that emerged from "bicultural composite authorship." Limiting their studies to such written documents, these scholars have overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history. In addition, they have failed to address the cultural constructs of the highly diverse Native American peoples, who prior to contact with nonindigenous cultures did not share with Europeans the same assumptions about self, life, and writing that underlie the concept of an autobiography— that indeed constitute the English word's root meaning. The idea of self was, in a number of pre-contact Native American cultures, markedly inclusive: identity was not merely individual, but also relational to a society, a specific landscape, and the cosmos. Within these cultures, the expression of life experiences tended to be oriented toward current events: with the participation of fellow tribal members, an individual person would articulate, reenact, or record important experiences as the person lived them, a mode of autobiography seemingly more fragmented than the European custom of writing down the recollections of a lifetime. Moreover, expression itself was not a matter of writing but of language, which can include speech and signs. Oral autobiography comprised songs, chants, stories, and even the process whereby one repeatedly took on new names to reflect important events and deeds in one's life. Dance and drama could convey personal history; for example, the advent of a vision to one person might require the enactment of that vision in the form of a tribal pageant. One can view as autobiographical the elaborate tattoos that symbolized a warrior's valorous deeds, and such artifacts as a decorated shield that communicated the accomplishments and aspirations of its maker, or a robe that was emblazoned with the pictographic history of the wearer's battles and was sometimes used in reenactments. Also autobiographical, and indicative of high status within the tribe, would have been a tepee painted with symbolic designs to record the achievements and display the dreams or visions of its owner, who was often assisted in the painting by other tribal members. A tribe would, then, have contributed to the individual's narrative not merely passively, by its social codes and expectations, but actively by joining in the expression of that narrative. Such intercultural collaboration may seem alien to the European style of autobiography, yet any autobiography is shaped by its creator's ideas about the audience for which it is intended; in this sense, autobiography is justly called a simultaneous individual story and cultural narrative. Autobiographical expressions by early Native Americans may additionally have been shaped by the cultural perspectives of the people who transmitted them.

## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The phrase "bicultural composite authorship" refers to the collaboration between Native Americans and non-Native American scholars in creating autobiographies. It involves the oral communication and personal history of Native Americans being translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native Americans, resulting in a final written product that blends two distinct cultural perspectives.

Choice A is incorrect because it suggests that the author from one culture solely relies on artifacts and oral traditions without actively contributing to the final written product.

Choice B is incorrect because "bicultural composite authorship" doesn't necessarily involve two individuals from different cultures contributing equally. Instead, it often involves a Native American storyteller and a non-Native American recorder/editor.

Choice C is incorrect because the passage suggests that the identities of the contributors can be determined, even if their individual writings cannot be separated.

Choice D is correct. It accurately describes the process of "bicultural composite authorship," where the original narrative emerges from a Native American cultural context and is then edited and revised by a non-Native American collaborator.

Choice E is incorrect because it suggests a direct oral communication between the two individuals from different cultures, while "bicultural composite authorship" involves a more complex process of translation, recording, and editing.

Therefore, the correct answer is D.
