Topic: Law
Context: Professor: It has been argued that freedom of thought is a precondition for intellectual progress, because freedom of thought allows thinkers to pursue their ideas, regardless of whom these ideas offend, in whatever direction they lead. However, it is clear that one must mine the full implications of interrelated ideas to make intellectual progress, and for this, thinkers need intellectual discipline. Therefore, this argument for freedom of thought fails.
Question: The conclusion drawn by the professor follows logically if which one of the following is assumed?
Choices:
  A: Thinkers who limit their line of thought to a particular orthodoxy are hindered in their intellectual progress.
  B: Thinkers can mine the full implications of interrelated ideas only in the context of a society that values intellectual progress.
  C: In societies that protect freedom of thought, thinkers invariably lack intellectual discipline.
  D: Freedom of thought engenders creativity, which aids the discovery of truth.
  E: Without intellectual discipline, thinkers can have no freedom of thought.
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that the argument was about the relationship between freedom of thought and intellectual discipline. However, the argument was about the failure of the argument for freedom of thought. 
The gap in my knowledge was in understanding the argument structure and the conclusion. 
The correct answer is [REDACTED] because it supports the idea that societies that protect freedom of thought may lack intellectual discipline, which is necessary for intellectual progress. 
Error Keywords:
 - Misunderstanding the argument structure
 - Incorrect assumption
 - Lack of attention to the conclusion
Solution:
The conclusion drawn by the professor follows logically if we assume that in societies that protect freedom of thought, thinkers invariably lack intellectual discipline. This assumption supports the idea that intellectual discipline is necessary for intellectual progress, and that freedom of thought alone is not sufficient. 
Instructions:
1. Read the argument carefully and identify the conclusion.
2. Identify the premises that support the conclusion.
3. Understand the relationship between the premises and the conclusion.
4. Identify the assumption that is necessary for the conclusion to follow logically.
5. Choose the answer that supports the assumption.
6. Double-check your answer to ensure that it is consistent with the argument.
Advice:
 - Always read the argument carefully and understand the conclusion.
 - Pay attention to the structure of the argument and the relationship between the premises and the conclusion.
 - Identify the assumption that is necessary for the conclusion to follow logically.
 - Choose the answer that supports the assumption.
 - Double-check your answer to ensure that it is consistent with the argument.
