Topic: Law
Context: To accommodate the personal automobile, houses are built on widely scattered lots far from places of work and shopping malls are equipped with immense parking lots that leave little room for wooded areas. Hence, had people generally not used personal automobiles, the result would have to have been a geography of modern cities quite different from the one we have now.
Question: The argument's reasoning is questionable because the argument
Choices:
  A: infers from the idea that the current geography of modern cities resulted from a particular cause that it could only have resulted from that cause
  B: infers from the idea that the current geography of modern cities resulted from a particular cause that other facets of modern life resulted from that cause
  C: overlooks the fact that many technological innovations other than the personal automobile have had some effect on the way people live
  D: takes for granted that shopping malls do not need large parking lots even given the use of the personal automobile
  E: takes for granted that people ultimately want to live without personal automobiles

Explanation:
I incorrectly chose answer choice [REDACTED] because I focused on the fact that the argument did not consider other technological innovations that may have affected the way people live.

Error Keywords:
 - Misunderstanding the argument's main point
 - Ignoring the argument's assumptions
 - Focusing on a minor detail instead of the main point
Solution:
The argument suggests that personal automobiles have had a significant impact on the geography of modern cities. However, the argument assumes that personal automobiles are the only cause of the current geography of modern cities, without considering other possible causes. Therefore, the argument's reasoning is questionable because it [REDACTED].
