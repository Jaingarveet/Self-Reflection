Context: Archaeologist: The mosaics that were removed from Zeugma, the ancient city now flooded by the runoff from Turkey's Birecik Dam, should have been left there. We had all the information about them that we needed to draw archaeological conclusions, and future archaeologists studying the site, who may not have access to our records, might be misled by their absence.
Question: Which one of the following, if assumed, most helps to justify the reasoning in the archaeologist's argument?
Choices:
  A: The only considerations that bear upon the question of whether the mosaics should have been removed are archaeological.
  B: Archaeologists studying a site can tell whether or not that site had been flooded at some time.
  C: The materials used in the construction of a mosaic are readily apparent when the mosaic is examined in its original location.
  D: Archaeological sites from which artifacts have been removed rarely mislead archaeologists who later study the site.
  E: The removal of artifacts from archaeological sites rarely has any environmental impact.
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I incorrectly chose answer choice [REDACTED], which is irrelevant to the archaeologist's argument. The archaeologist is concerned about the potential for future archaeologists to be misled by the absence of the mosaics, not about the potential for misleading interpretations of the site due to the removal of artifacts. The correct answer is [REDACTED] because it directly supports the archaeologist's argument that the decision to remove the mosaics should have been based solely on archaeological considerations. 
Error Keywords:
 - Misunderstanding the argument
 - Irrelevant answer choice
 - Lack of attention to detail
Solution:
The archaeologist argues that the mosaics should have been left in their original location to avoid misleading future archaeologists who may not have access to their records. To justify this reasoning, we need an assumption that supports the idea that removing artifacts from archaeological sites can lead to misleading conclusions. Answer choice [REDACTED] is the correct answer because it directly supports the archaeologist's argument that the decision to remove the mosaics should have been based solely on archaeological considerations. 
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and identify the argument being made.
2. Identify the evidence and conclusion of the argument.
3. Evaluate each answer choice and eliminate irrelevant or incorrect choices.
4. Choose the answer choice that best supports the argument being made.
Advice:
 - Pay close attention to the argument being made and the evidence provided.
 - Evaluate each answer choice carefully and eliminate irrelevant or incorrect choices.
 - Look for answer choices that directly support the argument being made.
 - Be aware of answer choices that are irrelevant or that may be true but do not support the argument being made.
