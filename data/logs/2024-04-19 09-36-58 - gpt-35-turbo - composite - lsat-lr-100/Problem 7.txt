Topic: Law
Context: Radio producer: Our failure to attract new listeners over the past several years has forced us to choose between devoting some airtime to other, more popular genres of music, and sticking with classical music that appeals only to our small but loyal audience. This audience, however loyal, did not generate enough advertising revenue for us to pay our bills, so if we appeal to them alone, our station risks going out of business. We should not take that risk. We should, therefore, devote some airtime to other, more popular genres of music.
Question: Which one of the following arguments is most similar in its pattern of reasoning to that used by the radio producer?
Choices:
  A: We should either buy blinds for the windows or make full-length curtains. Blinds would be very expensive to purchase. Thus, if cost is our greatest concern, we should make curtains.
  B: We should either make curtains for the windows or buy blinds. Since the windows are not standard sizes, if we buy blinds we will have to special order them. Since we do not have time to wait for special orders, we should make the curtains.
  C: For the living room windows, we can make curtains or valances or both. We want to have privacy; and while curtains provide privacy, valances do not. So we should make curtains but not valances.
  D: Since we have very little fabric, we will have to either buy more, or make valances instead of curtains. However, if we use this fabric to make valances, then we will have to buy blinds. Since it would be hard to buy fabric that matches what we already have, we should buy blinds.
  E: We should either buy blinds or make curtains for the windows. If we buy blinds but do not make valances, the windows will look bare. We should not have bare windows. So if we do not make the curtains, we should make the valances.
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I incorrectly chose option [REDACTED] because it presents a choice between two options and eliminates one based on a specific reason. However, the reason for eliminating one option in option [REDACTED] is different from the reason for eliminating one option in the radio producer's argument. In option [REDACTED], the more expensive option is eliminated because of cost concerns, while in the radio producer's argument, the less popular option is eliminated because it does not generate enough revenue. Option [REDACTED] is the most similar in pattern of reasoning to the radio producer's argument because it presents a choice between two options and eliminates one based on a specific reason that is relevant to the situation at hand.
Error Keywords:
 - Reasoning error
 - Pattern recognition error
 - Specific reason error
Solution:
The radio producer is faced with a choice between two options, one of which is more popular but less loyal, and the other is less popular but more loyal. The producer chooses the more popular option because it generates more revenue. Option [REDACTED] is the most similar in pattern of reasoning to the radio producer's argument because it presents a choice between two options and eliminates one based on a specific reason that is relevant to the situation at hand.
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and understand the problem.
2. Identify the two options presented in the argument.
3. Identify the reason for eliminating one of the options.
4. Look for an answer choice that presents a similar pattern of reasoning.
5. Identify the two options presented in the answer choice.
6. Identify the reason for eliminating one of the options.
7. Compare the reason for eliminating one of the options in the answer choice to the reason for eliminating one of the options in the radio producer's argument.
8. Choose the answer choice that presents the most similar pattern of reasoning to the radio producer's argument.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always identify the two options presented in the argument.
 - Always identify the reason for eliminating one of the options.
 - Look for an answer choice that presents a similar pattern of reasoning.
 - Compare the reason for eliminating one of the options in the answer choice to the reason for eliminating one of the options in the original argument.
 - Choose the answer choice that presents the most similar pattern of reasoning to the original argument.
