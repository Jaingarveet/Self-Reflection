Topic: Law
Context: When a group is unable to reach a consensus, group members are often accused of being stubborn, bullheaded, or unyielding. Such epithets often seem abusive, are difficult to prove, and rarely help the group reach a resolution. Those who wish to make such an accusation stick, however, should choose "unyielding," because one can always appeal to the fact that the accused has not yielded; obviously if one acknowledges that a person has not yielded, then one cannot deny that the person is unyielding, at least on this issue.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately descrthes the argumentative technique employed above?
Choices:
  A: rejecting a factic on the grounds that it constitutes an attack on the character of a person and has no substance in :fact
  B: rejecting a factic on the grounds that the factic makes it virtually imposSlble for the group to reach a consensus on the issue in question
  C: conditionally advocating a factic on the grounds that it results in an accusation that is less offensive than the alternatives
  D: conditionally advocating a factic on the grounds that it results in an argument that would help the group to reach a consensus on the issue in question
  E: conditionally advocating a factic on the grounds that it results in an argument for which one could not consistently accept the premise but deny the conclusion

Explanation:
I incorrectly chose answer choice [REDACTED] because I did not fully understand the argumentative technique employed in the passage. The author is not advocating for a factic that would help the group reach a consensus, but rather suggesting a way to make an accusation stick. The author is conditionally advocating for a factic on the grounds that it results in an argument for which one could not consistently accept the premise but deny the conclusion. The author is suggesting that the term "unyielding" is the best choice for an accusation because it is difficult to deny that someone has not yielded.
