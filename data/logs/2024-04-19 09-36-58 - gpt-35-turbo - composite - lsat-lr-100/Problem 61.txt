Topic: Law
Context: In a recent study, each member of two groups of people, Group A (composed of persons sixty-five to seventy-five years old) and Group B (composed of college students), was required to make a telephone call to a certain number at a specified time. The time when each call was initiated was recorded electronically. Group A proved far better at remembering to make a telephone call precisely at a specified time than did Group B. There were fourteen lapses in Group B but only one lapse in Group A. Clearly, at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages.
Question: Which one of the following, if all of them are true, is LEAST helpful in establishing that the conclusion above is properly drawn?
Choices:
  A: There was the same number of people in each group.
  B: The same group of researchers answered the calls made by the callers in both study groups.
  C: Among the college students there were no persons more than forty years old.
  D: Both groups had unrestricted access to telephones for making the required calls.
  E: The members of the two groups received their instructions approximately the same amount of time before they were to make their telephone calls.
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I incorrectly identified option [REDACTED] as the least helpful in establishing the conclusion. However, option [REDACTED] is the least helpful because it does not relate to memory or the ability to remember to make a telephone call at a specified time. 
My error was in not carefully considering each option and its relevance to the conclusion. 
Error Keywords:
 - Careless mistake
 - Misreading the question
 - Not considering all options
Solution:
The conclusion is that at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages, based on the fact that Group [REDACTED] (composed of persons sixty-five to seventy-five years old) performed better than Group [REDACTED] (composed of college students) in remembering to make a telephone call precisely at a specified time.
Option [REDACTED] is the least helpful in establishing the conclusion because it does not relate to memory or the ability to remember to make a telephone call at a specified time.
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and understand the problem.
2. Consider each option and its relevance to the conclusion.
3. Eliminate options that are clearly helpful in establishing the conclusion.
4. Identify the option that is least helpful in establishing the conclusion.
5. Double-check your reasoning to ensure accuracy.
6. Choose the option that matches your conclusion.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always consider each option and its relevance to the conclusion.
 - Never rush through the options or make careless mistakes.
 - Always double-check your reasoning to ensure accuracy.
 - Remember that the correct answer is not always the most obvious one.
