Context: Editorial: Painting involves a sequential application of layers, each of which adheres satisfactorily only if the underlying layer has been properly applied. Education is, in this respect, like the craft of painting. Since the most important steps in painting are preparation of the surface to be painted and application of the primer coat, it makes sense to suppose that .
Question: Which one of the following most logically completes the editorial's argument?
Choices:
  A: in the educator's initial contact with a student, the educator should be as undemanding as possible
  B: students who have a secure grasp of the fundamentals of a subject are likely to make progress in that subject
  C: educators who are not achieving the goals they intended should revise their teaching methods
  D: teaching new students is rewarding but much more difficult than teaching more advanced students
  E: the success of a student's overall educational experience depends above all upon that student's initial educational experience

Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
## Explanation:
My initial answer was incorrect because I focused on the analogy of painting and education without considering the specific context of the editorial. While the analogy highlights the importance of a strong foundation, the editorial emphasizes the **lasting impact of initial educational experiences**.
## Error Keywords:
* **Misinterpretation of analogy:** I focused on the general analogy rather than the specific point about initial experiences.
* **Ignoring context:** I failed to consider the editorial's specific argument about the foundation's impact.
* **Logical reasoning error:** I did not connect the analogy to the conclusion about initial experiences.
## Solution:
1. **Identify the editorial's main argument:** The editorial argues that initial educational experiences have a significant impact on a student's overall educational journey.
2. **Connect the analogy to the argument:** The analogy of painting emphasizes the importance of a strong foundation, which aligns with the editorial's focus on initial experiences.
3. **Analyze the answer choices:** Only option E directly connects the importance of initial experiences to the overall success of a student's education.
4. **Choose the answer that best reflects the editorial's argument:** Option E is the most logically consistent answer based on the editorial's context and the analogy.
## Instructions:
1. **Read the editorial carefully and identify the main argument.**
2. **Analyze the analogy and its connection to the argument.**
3. **Evaluate each answer choice in the context of the editorial's argument.**
4. **Choose the answer that best reflects the editorial's conclusion based on the analogy and logical reasoning.**
## General Advice:
* **Pay close attention to the context and specific arguments presented in the editorial.**
* **Use analogies as a guide but don't rely solely on them for your answer.**
* **Analyze each answer choice carefully and consider its logical connection to the editorial's argument.**
* **Prioritize answers that directly address the editorial's main point and conclusion.**
* **Be mindful of potential logical fallacies and misinterpretations of the analogy.**
