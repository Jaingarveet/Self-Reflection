Topic: Law
Context: Economics professor: Marty's Pizza and Checkers Pizza are the two major pizza parlors in our town. Marty's sold coupon books including coupons good for one large plain pizza at any local pizza parlor, at Marty's expense. But Checkers refused to accept these coupons, even though they were redeemed by all other local pizza parlors. Accepting them would have cost Checkers nothing and would have satisfied those of its potential customers who had purchased the coupon books. This shows that Checkers's motive in refusing to accept the coupons was simply to hurt Marty's Pizza.
Question: Which one of the following, if assumed, enables the economics professor's conclusion to be properly drawn?
Choices:
  A: Any company that refuses to accept coupons issued by a competitor when doing so would satisfy some of the company's potential customers is motivated solely by the desire to hurt that competitor.
  B: Any company that wishes to hurt a competitor by refusing to accept coupons issued by that competitor will refuse to accept them even when accepting them would cost nothing and would satisfy its potential customers.
  C: At least one company has refused to accept coupons issued by its major local competitor simply in order to hurt that competitor, even though those coupons were accepted by all other local competitors.
  D: Any company that accepts its major competitor's coupons helps its competitor by doing so, even if it also satisfies its own actual or potential customers.
  E: If accepting coupons issued by a competitor would not enable a company to satisfy its actual or potential customers, then that company's refusal to accept the coupons is motivated by the desire to satisfy customers.

## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:**
My initial analysis focused solely on the specific case of Checkers and Marty's Pizza, overlooking the broader principle the professor was trying to establish. I mistakenly assumed that Option C directly supported the professor's conclusion about Checkers's motive, without considering the broader context of the statement.
**Error Keywords:**
* **Overgeneralization:** Applying a specific observation (Checkers's refusal) to a broader conclusion (any company refusing coupons is motivated by malice).
* **Ignoring context:** Failing to consider the professor's overall argument and focusing solely on the isolated case.
* **Misinterpretation:** Mistakenly interpreting Option C as directly supporting the professor's conclusion about Checkers's specific motive.
**Solution:**
1. **Identify the professor's main argument:** The professor argues that refusing competitor coupons can be motivated solely by harming the competitor, even when it benefits the refusing company's customers.
2. **Analyze each option in relation to the argument:**
    * **A:** This option aligns with the professor's argument. It states that any company refusing coupons that would satisfy its customers could be motivated solely by harming the competitor.
    * **B:** This option is too specific to Checkers's case and doesn't address the broader principle.
    * **C:** This option provides an example but doesn't establish the general principle.
    * **D:** This option focuses on the competitor's benefit, not the refusing company's motive.
    * **E:** This option focuses on customer satisfaction, not the motive behind refusing coupons.
3. **Choose the option that best supports the professor's argument:** Option A aligns most closely with the professor's claim that refusing coupons can be solely motivated by harming the competitor.
**Instructions for Future Reference:**
1. **Read the question and answer choices carefully.** Pay attention to the overall argument and the specific details provided.
2. **Identify the key issue or principle being addressed.** Don't get caught up in specific examples or scenarios.
3. **Analyze each answer choice in relation to the main issue.** Consider how each option supports or contradicts the argument.
4. **Choose the answer that best aligns with the overall argument or principle.** Don't be swayed by options that focus on specific details or irrelevant factors.
**General Advice for Similar Problems:**
* **Focus on the main argument or principle, not just specific examples.**
* **Consider the broader context and implications of the question.**
* **Analyze each answer choice carefully and eliminate those that are irrelevant or contradictory.**
* **Choose the answer that best supports the overall argument or principle.**
* **Be mindful of common logical fallacies and biases.**
By following these steps and applying this advice, I can improve my ability to answer similar questions correctly in the future.
