## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:** I incorrectly identified the point of contention between Peter and Yoko. While Peter advocates for the inclusion of clearly immoral characters to teach consequences, Yoko acknowledges their continued presence while highlighting a shift towards less frightening portrayals. My focus on Peter's argument led me to overlook Yoko's contrasting view, resulting in a misinterpretation of their disagreement.
**Error Keywords:**
* **Misinterpretation:** Failing to grasp the full context and nuances of the arguments.
* **Confirmation bias:** Focusing on Peter's statement and overlooking Yoko's contrasting view.

1. **Identify individual arguments:** Clearly distinguish Peter's and Yoko's positions.
2. **Analyze points of agreement/disagreement:** Determine where their views converge and diverge.
