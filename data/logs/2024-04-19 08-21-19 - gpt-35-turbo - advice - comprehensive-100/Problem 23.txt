Context: On the first day of a two-day study for a cycling magazine, four riders—Reynaldo, Seamus, Theresa, and Yuki—will each test one of four bicycles—F, G, H, and J.

The correct answer to the previous question was D, which means that Yuki cannot test H on the first day.
Reynaldo cannot test F, which means that Reynaldo can test any of the other three bicycles on the first day.
Yuki cannot test J, which means that Yuki can test any of the other three bicycles on the first day.
Theresa must test H on the first day, which means that Theresa cannot test any of the other three bicycles on the first day.
The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day, which means that Seamus cannot test the same bicycle as Yuki on the first day.
Seamus can test any of the three bicycles that Reynaldo, Theresa, or Yuki do not test on the first day.
