Topic: Logic
Context: The late famous logician Jin Yuelin of China heard the words "Money is like dung" and "Friends are worth a thousand dollars" when he was a child, and found that there are logical problems because they can lead to the absurd conclusion of "friends are like dung".
Question: Since the conclusion of "friends like dung" is not true, it can be logically derived?
Choices:
  A: The expression "money is like dung" is false.
  B: If a friend is indeed worth a lot of money, then money is not like dung.
  C: The statement that "friends are valuable" is true.
  D: The words "Money is like dung" and "Friends are worth a thousand dollars" are either true or false.

 - Eliminate options that are clearly false or irrelevant.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The conclusion "friends are like dung" is not true, so it cannot be logically derived.
Option A is not necessarily true, as the truth value of "money is like dung" is not given.
Option B is not a logical explanation for the problem, as it does not address the contradiction.
Option C is not necessarily true, as the truth value of "friends are valuable" is not given.
Option D is not a logical explanation for the problem, as it does not address the contradiction.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
