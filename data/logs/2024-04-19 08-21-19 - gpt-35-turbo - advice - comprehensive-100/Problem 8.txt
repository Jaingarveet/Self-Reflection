## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let's use the formula: time = distance / speed
Let's call the time it takes for the two cars to meet "t".
Let's call the distance the first car travels "d1".
Let's call the distance the second car travels "d2".
We know that d1 + d2 = 50 miles.
We also know that d1 = 12t and d2 = 13t.
Substituting these values into the first equation, we get 12t + 13t = 50.
Simplifying, we get 25t = 50, which means t = 2.
Action: Answer("E")
