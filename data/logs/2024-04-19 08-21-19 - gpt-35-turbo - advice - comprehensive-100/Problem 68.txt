## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")

Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always check your work and double-check your calculations.
 - Always substitute your answer choices back into the original problem to check if they are valid.
 - Remember that a repeated root is possible, but not the only solution.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The line passes through the origin, so the equation of the line is $y = mx$. 
Substituting the given points, we get $k = 2m$ and $32 = km$. 
Solving for $m$, we get $m = \frac{32}{k}$. 
Substituting this into the first equation, we get $y = \frac{32}{k}x$. 
Since the line passes through the origin, we have $k = 2m = \frac{64}{k}$. 
Solving for $k$, we get $k^2 = 64$, so $k = \pm 8$. 
Therefore, the answer is either $\textbf{(C)}$ or $\textbf{(E)}$.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
