The six targets are set according to the following conditions: None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.

## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The question asks which target cannot be set for more than one of the clients.
The targets are 1-day, 2-day, and 3-day for both website and voicemail.
The constraints are:
- None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
- Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
- Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
A 1-day website target can be set for all clients.
A 2-day voicemail target can be set for all clients.
A 2-day website target cannot be set for Solide because Truvest's website target must be shorter than Solide's website target.
A 3-day voicemail target can be set for all clients.
A 3-day website target cannot be set for Truvest because Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
Action: Answer("C")
