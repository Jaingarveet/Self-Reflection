## System:
You are an expert in Medicine.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Assistant 2:
Reflection:
Aminoacyl t-RNA is required for protein synthesis. It is responsible for carrying the amino acid to the ribosome where it is added to the growing protein chain. Each amino acid has its own specific aminoacyl t-RNA synthetase enzyme that attaches it to the correct t-RNA molecule. 
Advice:
The question is asking for the amino acid that does not require aminoacyl t-RNA. Therefore, we need to identify the amino acid that can be incorporated into the protein chain without the help of aminoacyl t-RNA. 
Action: Answer("A") 
Proline is the only amino acid that does not require aminoacyl t-RNA for its incorporation into the protein chain.
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
