## Assistant 2:
Reflection:
Hypophosphatemic Vitamin D Resistant Rickets is a genetic disorder that affects the bones. It is caused by mutations in the PHEX gene, which is located on the X chromosome. This disorder is inherited in an X-linked dominant pattern, which means that a mutation in one copy of the gene is enough to cause the disorder. Females are more likely to be affected than males because they have two X chromosomes. The symptoms of this disorder include bowed legs, short stature, dental problems, and bone pain.
