## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let the number of members in the club be n.
The youngest member is 7 years old, so the ages of the members can be represented by the A.P. 7, 7 + 3, 7 + 6, ..., 7 + 3(n - 1).
The sum of an A.P. is given by the formula S = n/2(2a + (n - 1)d), where a is the first term, d is the common difference, and n is the number of terms.
Substituting the given values, we get 250 = n/2(2(7) + (n - 1)(3)).
Simplifying the equation, we get 5n^2 - 35n - 1000 = 0.
Using the quadratic formula, we get n = 20 or n = -25.
Since the number of members cannot be negative, the answer is n = 20.
Action: Answer("B")
