## Assistant 2:
Thought:
If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then there are only six students left who can give reports: George, Helen, Irving, Nina, Olivia, and Robert. 
We know that George can only give a report on Tuesday, and Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports. 
If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. 
Therefore, we can consider two scenarios: 
Scenario 1: Nina gives a report on Monday or Wednesday. 
Scenario 2: Nina does not give a report. 
Scenario 1: 
If Nina gives a report on Monday or Wednesday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on the next day. 
Therefore, Helen and Irving cannot give reports on Monday or Wednesday. 
Thus, the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, could be given by:
A: Helen, George, and Nina (Helen cannot give a report on Monday)
B: Irving, Robert, and Helen (Helen cannot give a report on Monday)
C: Nina, Helen, and Olivia (Nina cannot give a report on Tuesday)
D: Olivia, Robert, and Irving (N/A)
E: Robert, George, and Helen (Helen cannot give a report on Monday)
Scenario 2:
If Nina does not give a report, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on the next day, regardless of which day it is. 
Thus, the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, could be given by:
A: Helen, George, and Nina (Nina cannot give a report)
B: Irving, Robert, and Helen (N/A)
C: Nina, Helen, and Olivia (Nina cannot give a report)
D: Olivia, Robert, and Irving (N/A)
E: Robert, George, and Helen (Nina cannot give a report)
Action: Answer("B")
