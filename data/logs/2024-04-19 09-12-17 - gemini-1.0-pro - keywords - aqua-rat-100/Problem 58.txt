## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Choices:
  A: 1 hour and 31 minutes
  B: 2 hour and 31 minutes
  C: 3 hour and 31 minutes
  D: 4 hour and 31 minutes
  E: 5 hour and 31 minutes

## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
I previously answered this question incorrectly because I made a mistake in calculating the time it takes for each ball to complete one full rotation.
To find the time it takes for each ball to complete one full rotation, we can divide the total time by the number of rotations.
For ball A, it takes 26 minutes / 2 rotations = 13 minutes per rotation.
For ball B, it takes 35 minutes / 5 rotations = 7 minutes per rotation.
To find the time it takes for both balls to be at the same starting point again, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 13 minutes and 7 minutes.
The LCM of 13 minutes and 7 minutes is 91 minutes.
Therefore, the balls will be at the same starting point again after 91 minutes.
Action: Answer("E")
