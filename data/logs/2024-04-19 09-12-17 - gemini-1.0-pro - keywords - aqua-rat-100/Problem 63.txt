## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The team lost 30% of their matches, which means they lost 30/100 * total matches.
Let x be the total number of matches.
The team lost 0.3x matches.
We know they won 20 matches, so they lost x - 20 matches.
Setting these two expressions equal to each other, we get:
0.3x = x - 20
Solving for x, we get:
0.7x = 20
x = 28.57
Since the number of matches must be a whole number, we round up to 29.
Therefore, the team lost 0.3 * 29 = 8.7 matches.
Since we can't have a fraction of a match, we round up to 9 matches.
Action: Answer("D")
