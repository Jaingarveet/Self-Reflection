## Assistant 2:
I understand. I will use my self-reflection to answer this question correctly.
**Self-reflection:**
* **Error:** I made a calculation error in my previous attempt.
* **Solution:** I need to carefully calculate the measure of minor arc AD.
* **Correct answer:** The correct answer is 130°.
**Answer:**
**Action: Answer("B")**
**Explanation:**
* Minor arc AC is 160°, and minor arc BD is 150°.
* Since B bisects minor arc AC, then minor arc AB = minor arc BC = 160° / 2 = 80°.
* Therefore, minor arc AD = minor arc AB + minor arc BD = 80° + 150° = 230°.
* However, since minor arc AD is part of the whole circle, its measure is less than 360°.
* Therefore, the measure of minor arc AD is 360° - 230° = 130°.
**Conclusion:**
I have carefully reviewed my previous error and corrected my calculations. The correct answer to the question is 130°.
