## Assistant 2:
I understand. I will use my self-reflection to answer this question correctly.
**Self-Reflection:**
* **Error:** I incorrectly identified the capital of Maryland as Baltimore instead of Annapolis.
* **Cause:** I did not carefully consider the information provided in the question.
* **Correction:** I will pay closer attention to the details of the question and ensure that my answer is consistent with the information provided.
**Answer:**
**Thought:**
* The area of each triangle is 70 square feet, so the area of the original square cloth was 140 square feet (70 * 2).
* Since the area of a square is calculated as side * side, the side of the original square cloth was the square root of 140, which is approximately 11.83 feet.
* If the square cloth was trimmed by 4 feet on one edge, the new length of that edge is 11.83 - 4 = 7.83 feet.
* The perimeter of the original square cloth was 4 * 11.83 = 47.32 feet.
* However, since the cloth was trimmed, the new perimeter is 2 * (7.83 + 11.83) = 39.32 feet.
**Action:** Answer("E")
