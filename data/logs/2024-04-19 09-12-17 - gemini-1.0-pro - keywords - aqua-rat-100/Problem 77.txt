## Assistant 2:
I understand. I will use my self-reflection to answer this question correctly.
**Self-reflection:**
* **Error:** I previously answered the question incorrectly.
* **Reason for error:** I did not consider the condition that the sum of the 5 numbers when divided by 10 should be a perfect square.
* **Correct approach:**
    * Find the sum of 5 consecutive odd numbers.
    * Check if the sum is divisible by 10.
    * If the sum is divisible by 10, check if the quotient is a perfect square.
**Solution:**
Let the 5 consecutive odd numbers be x, x + 2, x + 4, x + 6, and x + 8.
The sum of the 5 numbers is:
x + (x + 2) + (x + 4) + (x + 6) + (x + 8) = 5x + 20
For the sum to be divisible by 10, 5x must be divisible by 10. This means x must be an even number.
Let x = 44. Then the 5 numbers are 44, 46, 48, 50, and 52.
The sum of the 5 numbers is 240.
240/10 = 24, which is a perfect square.
Therefore, the correct answer is E: 44.
**Action:** Answer("E")
