## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Assistant 2:
Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly because I misinterpreted the information given. I incorrectly assumed that U was the midpoint of line segment RT instead of line segment ST. This led me to choose the wrong answer.
To avoid making the same mistake again, I will carefully read the problem and make sure I understand the information given before attempting to solve it. I will also pay close attention to the wording of the problem, especially when it comes to key terms like "midpoint."
Here is my step-by-step solution to the problem:
1. Identify the given information:
   - R, S, T, and U are points on a line.
   - U is the midpoint of line segment ST.
   - The lengths of line segments RS, RT, and ST are 5, 17, and 22, respectively.
2. Determine the length of line segment SU:
   - Since U is the midpoint of line segment ST, the lengths of line segments SU and UT are equal.
   - Therefore, the length of line segment SU is half the length of line segment ST, which is 22/2 = 11.
3. Determine the length of line segment RU:
   - The length of line segment RU is the sum of the lengths of line segments RS and SU.
   - Therefore, the length of line segment RU is 5 + 11 = 16.
Therefore, the length of line segment RU is 16.
Action: Answer("E")
