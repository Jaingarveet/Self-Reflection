Self-reflection:
* I made a calculation error in my previous attempt.
* I did not correctly calculate the cost price of the book.
* I need to be more careful with my calculations.
Thought process:
* The cost price of the book is Rs. 27.50 / 1.1 = Rs. 25.
* If the book were sold for Rs. 25.75, the profit would be Rs. 25.75 - Rs. 25 = Rs. 0.75.
* The percentage profit would be Rs. 0.75 / Rs. 25 * 100% = 3%.
Action: Answer("B")
