## Assistant 2:
I understand. I will use my self-reflection to answer this question correctly.
**Self-reflection:**
* **Error:** I made a proportion error in my previous attempt. I incorrectly assumed that 6 pita breads were equivalent to 2 rolls, when in fact, the problem states that 6 pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as 2 rolls.
* **Misinterpretation:** I misinterpreted the problem by focusing on the number of pita breads and rolls instead of the amount of falafel they contain.
* **Incorrect assumption:** I made an incorrect assumption that the amount of falafel in each pita bread and roll was the same.
**Corrected solution:**
1. **Set up the proportions:**
    * 6 pita breads = 2 rolls
    * 3 rolls = 5 baguettes
    * 2 baguettes = x pita breads
2. **Cross-multiply and solve for x:**
    * 6 * 3 * 2 = 2 * 5 * x
    * x = 36 / 10
    * x = 18 / 5
Therefore, 2 baguettes contain the same amount of falafel as **18/5 pita breads**.
**Action: Answer("E")**
