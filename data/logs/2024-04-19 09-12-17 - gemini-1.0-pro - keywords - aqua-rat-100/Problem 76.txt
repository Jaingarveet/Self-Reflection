# Model: gemini-1.0-pro | Agent: keywords | Exam: aqua-rat-100 | Problem 76 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:
Topic: Geography
Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math

Choices:
  A: 20 < x < 54
  B: 23 < x < 58
  C: 25 < x < 64
  D: 28 < x < 60
  E: None of these

## Assistant 2:
I understand. I will try my best to answer this question correctly.
**Thought:**
1. **Simplify the expression:**
   - First, factor the numerator:
     ```
     n^2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16 = (n + √n + 4)(n + √n + 4)
     ```
   - Then, factor the denominator:
     ```
     n + 4√n + 4 = (√n + 2)(√n + 2)
     ```
   - Substitute the factored expressions:
     ```
     x = [(n + √n + 4)(n + √n + 4)] / [(√n + 2)(√n + 2)]
     ```
   - Cancel common factors:
     ```
     x = n + √n + 4
     ```
2. **Find the range of x:**
   - Since 36 ≤ n ≤ 72, we have:
     - 6 ≤ √n ≤ 8
     - 6 + √n + 4 ≤ x ≤ 8 + √n + 4
     - 10 ≤ x ≤ 18
**Action:** Answer("E")
## Result:
Agent Answer: E
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
