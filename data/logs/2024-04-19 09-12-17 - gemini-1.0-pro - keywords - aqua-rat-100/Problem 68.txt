## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Assistant 2:
Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly because I misidentified the relationship between the greatest common factor (GCF) and the least common multiple (LCM) of two integers. I incorrectly assumed that the LCM was always a multiple of the GCF, which is not always the case.
To correctly answer this question, I need to consider the following:
* The GCF of two integers is the largest integer that divides both integers evenly.
* The LCM of two integers is the smallest integer that is a multiple of both integers.
* The product of the GCF and LCM of two integers is equal to the product of the two integers.
In this case, the GCF of the two integers is 11, and the LCM is 7700. The product of the GCF and LCM is 11 * 7700 = 84700.
Since one of the integers is 350, the other integer must be 84700 / 350 = 242.
Therefore, the other integer is 242.
Action: Answer("A")
