## Assistant 2:
I understand. I will try my best to answer this question correctly.
**Reflection:**
* **Error:** I made a calculation error in my previous attempt.
* **Reason:** I did not correctly apply the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.
* **Correction:** I will carefully review the formula and ensure I use it correctly this time.
**Solution:**
Let's denote the number of members in the club as n.
The sum of an arithmetic series is given by:
```
S = n/2 * [2a + (n-1)d]
```
where:
* S is the sum of the series
* n is the number of terms
* a is the first term
* d is the common difference
In this case, we have:
* S = 250 years
* a = 7 years
* d = 3 months = 0.25 years
Substituting these values into the formula, we get:
```
250 = n/2 * [2 * 7 + (n-1) * 0.25]
```
Simplifying the equation, we get:
```
500 = n * (14 + 0.25n - 0.25)
500 = n * (13.75 + 0.25n)
```
Rearranging the equation, we get:
```
0.25n^2 + 13.75n - 500 = 0
```
This is a quadratic equation that can be solved using the quadratic formula:
```
n = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a
```
where:
* a = 0.25
* b = 13.75
* c = -500
Substituting these values into the formula, we get:
```
n = (-13.75 ± √(13.75^2 - 4 * 0.25 * -500)) / 2 * 0.25
n = (-13.75 ± √(189.0625 + 500)) / 0.5
n = (-13.75 ± √689.0625) / 0.5
n = (-13.75 ± 26.25) / 0.5
```
We get two possible solutions:
* n = 25
* n = -20
Since the number of members cannot be negative, the correct answer is:
**Action: Answer("C")**
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
