Context: The number of crocodiles in the North Atlantic Ocean has declined sharply, but the number of seals has increased significantly at almost the same time.Some people say that it is the seal that caused the reduction of crocodiles.This argument is difficult to establish because seals rarely feed on crocodiles.
Question: Which of the following, if true, would most weaken the above argument?
Choices:
  A: Seawater pollution causes more damage to crocodiles than seals.
  B: Despite the sharp decrease in the number of crocodiles and the increase in the number of seals, there are still fewer seals in the North Atlantic Ocean than crocodiles.
  C: Before the number of seals increased, the number of crocodiles in the North Atlantic Ocean decreased.
  D: Crocodiles only eat capelin, and capelin is also the main food for seals.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The argument claims that the increase in seals caused the decrease in crocodiles.
Choice A: Seawater pollution affects crocodiles more than seals, but it doesn't explain the correlation between seals and crocodiles.
Choice B: The number of seals is still less than crocodiles, but it doesn't explain the impact of seals on crocodiles.
Choice C: The decrease in crocodiles happened before the increase in seals, which weakens the argument that seals caused the decrease.
Choice D: Crocodiles and seals compete for the same food source, which strengthens the argument that seals caused the decrease in crocodiles.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: D
