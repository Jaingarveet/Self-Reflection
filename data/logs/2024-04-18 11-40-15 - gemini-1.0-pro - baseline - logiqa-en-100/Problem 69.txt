Topic: Logic
Context: Zhang Shan received a higher bonus than Li Si.After learning that Wang Wu's bonus was higher than Miao Xiaoqin, Zhang Shan's bonus was also higher than Miao Xiaoqin.
Question: The following assumptions can make the above inference hold, except
Choices:
  A: Wang Wu's bonus is higher than Li Si's.
  B: Li Si's bonus is higher than Miao Xiaoqin's.
  C: Li Si's bonus is higher than Wang Wu's.
  D: Li Si's bonus is as high as Wang Wu's.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The inference is that Zhang Shan's bonus is higher than Miao Xiaoqin's.
This can be true if:
* Zhang Shan's bonus is higher than Li Si's, and Li Si's bonus is higher than Miao Xiaoqin's.
* Zhang Shan's bonus is higher than Wang Wu's, and Wang Wu's bonus is higher than Miao Xiaoqin's.
* Zhang Shan's bonus is higher than both Li Si's and Wang Wu's, and both Li Si's and Wang Wu's bonuses are higher than Miao Xiaoqin's.
The assumption that Li Si's bonus is as high as Wang Wu's does not guarantee the inference.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
