Context: Statistics show that in car accidents, the proportion of cars with airbags is higher than that of cars without airbags.Therefore, installing an airbag in a car does not make the car owner safer.
Question: Which of the following most appropriately points out the loophole of the above argument?
Choices:
  A: Assume without explanation? Any car equipped with airbags may experience a car accident.
  B: Ignore this possibility? Owners without airbags pay more attention to driving cautiously.
  C: Improper assumption? In any car accident, the airbag will automatically open.
  D: Improperly equate the possibility of a car accident with the seriousness of the car owner â€™s injury in the accident.
## Assistant 2:

The argument assumes that the proportion of cars with airbags in accidents is the same as the proportion of cars with airbags on the road. This is not necessarily true. 
Cars with airbags may be more likely to be driven in high-risk situations, such as on highways.
