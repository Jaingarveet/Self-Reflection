Context: From the end of the 1980s to the beginning of the 1990s, a total of 134 in-service staff died in 7 research institutes of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Peking University in a five-year period.Some people collected this data and concluded that the average age of death of intellectuals in Zhongguancun is 53.34 years, which is lower than Beijing â€™s average life expectancy of 73 years in 1990 and 5.18 years lower than the 58.52 years surveyed 10 years ago.
Question: Which of the following most accurately points out the fallacy of this statistical reasoning?
Choices:
  A: The actual situation is that 143 in-service personnel died, and the sample data is unreliable.
  B: If the sample size is too small, data on the deaths of in-service personnel from other research institutions and universities in Zhongguancun should be added.
  C: This is equivalent to the surprising conclusion after surveying the average age of death of college students is 22 years? people with college education have an average life expectancy of more than 50 years less than others.
  D: This statistical reasoning does not distinguish between types of intellectuals in Zhongguancun.
## Assistant 2:
