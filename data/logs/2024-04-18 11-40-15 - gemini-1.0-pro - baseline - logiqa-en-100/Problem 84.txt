## User 2:
Topic: Logic
Context: All landscape rooms can see the landscape, but Li Wenbing's family can't see the landscape.Therefore, Li Wenbing's family is not a landscape room.
Question: Which of the following is most similar to the above argument?
Choices:
  A: Kind people will be respected by the villagers, Chenggong who is kind and charitable will be respected by the villagers, so Chenggong is a kind person
  B: Vegetables in Dongdun Market are very cheap.This basket of vegetables is not bought in Dongdun Market.Therefore, this basket of vegetables is not cheap
  C: Employees of Jiutian Company can speak English, Lin Yingrui is an employee of Jiutian Company, therefore, Lin Yingrui can speak English
  D: Anyone who meets the basic conditions can apply for a small loan.Sun Wen did not apply for a small loan.Therefore, Sun Wen did not meet the basic conditions
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The original argument is a deductive argument with a modus tollens form:
- All P are Q (All landscape rooms can see the landscape)
- Not Q (Li Wenbing's family can't see the landscape)
- Therefore, not P (Li Wenbing's family is not a landscape room)
Let's analyze the answer choices:
A: This is a deductive argument with a modus ponens form, which is not the same as the original argument.
B: This is a deductive argument with a modus tollens form, similar to the original argument.
C: This is a deductive argument with a modus ponens form, which is not the same as the original argument.
D: This is a deductive argument with a modus tollens form, similar to the original argument.
Therefore, the answer choices that are most similar to the original argument are B and D. However, choice B is a better fit because it uses the same type of objects (vegetables) and the same type of property (cheapness) as the original argument.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
