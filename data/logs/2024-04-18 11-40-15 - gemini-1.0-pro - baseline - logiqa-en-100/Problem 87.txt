Context: European fern is a poisonous wild grass that has spread and destroyed many pastures in the northern hemisphere in recent years.One way to deal with this wild grass is to spend less money and be self-sustaining by introducing the natural enemy of this plant.Therefore, some scientists suggested that the moths that feed on the European fern produced in the southern hemisphere were released into the northern hemisphere affected by this wild grass to control the growth of the European fern.
Question: If the scientist â€™s proposal to control the European fern is adopted, which of the following is necessary for its success?
Choices:
  A: This northern fern of the northern hemisphere also grows in areas with similar climate and soil conditions in the southern hemisphere.
  B: In addition to eating European ferns, the moths they stock also eat other wild grasses that grow in the northern hemisphere.
  C: The stocked moths can survive in the northern hemisphere and can form a large enough group to reduce the number of European ferns and prevent their growth.
  D: When the number of European ferns decreases, livestock will become immune to diseases caused by this wild grass.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The scientist's proposal is to introduce the moths that feed on the European fern produced in the southern hemisphere into the northern hemisphere affected by this wild grass to control the growth of the European fern.
So, the moths must be able to survive in the northern hemisphere and eat the European fern.
