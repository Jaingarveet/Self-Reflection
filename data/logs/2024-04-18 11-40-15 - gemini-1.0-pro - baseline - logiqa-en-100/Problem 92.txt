Choices:

## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Professor Zhao said that the champion is not the Tsinghua University team nor the Zhejiang University team.
Professor Qian said that the champion is not the Tsinghua University team, but the University of Science and Technology of China.
Professor Sun said that the champion is not the China University of Science and Technology team, but the Tsinghua University team.
Let's analyze the statements:
* If Professor Zhao is correct, then the champion is either the China University of Science and Technology team or the Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics team.
* If Professor Qian is correct, then the champion is the University of Science and Technology of China team.
* If Professor Sun is correct, then the champion is the Tsinghua University team.
Since only one professor judged both, one's judgment is one-to-one wrong, the other one is wrong.
Therefore, Professor Zhao's statement is wrong.
This means that the champion is either the Tsinghua University team or the Zhejiang University team.
However, Professor Sun's statement is also wrong, which means that the champion is not the Tsinghua University team.
Therefore, the champion must be the Zhejiang University Team.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
