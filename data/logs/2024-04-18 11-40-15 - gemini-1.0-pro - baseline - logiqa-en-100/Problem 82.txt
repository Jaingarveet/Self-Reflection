Topic: Logic
Context: The person in charge of the relevant department said that pilots will be carried out in some areas this year to prepare for the system and policy preparations for the comprehensive clean-up of "small property houses", and require all localities to confirm the registration and certification of rural collective land.All small-property houses are not subject to registration and are not protected by law.Therefore, this newly built house in Hexi Village is not protected by law.
Question: Which of the following is true will most weaken the above argument
Choices:
  A: This newly built house in Hexi Village has been tacitly approved by relevant departments
  B: This newly built house in Hexi Village is a small property house
  C: This newly built house in Hexi Village is built on rural collective land
  D: Some of the newly built houses in Hexi Village are not small property houses
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The argument claims that the newly built house in Hexi Village is not protected by law because it is a small property house and is not subject to registration.
Option A: This option weakens the argument because if the house has been tacitly approved by relevant departments, it may be considered legal even if it is a small property house.
Option B: This option strengthens the argument because it confirms that the house is a small property house, which is not protected by law.
Option C: This option strengthens the argument because it confirms that the house is built on rural collective land, which is not protected by law.
Option D: This option weakens the argument because it suggests that not all newly built houses in Hexi Village are small property houses, which means that the argument may not apply to all houses in the village.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
