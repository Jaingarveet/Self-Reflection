## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I misunderstood the problem and made an error in my calculations. I incorrectly calculated the difference in the ratios and the number of new members. 
Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation of problem
- Calculation error
- Ratio error
Solution:
The initial number of boys is 64 and girls is 40. 
The final ratio of boys to girls is 4:3. 
Let's denote the number of new members as x. 
So, the number of boys is now 64 + x and the number of girls is 40 + x. 
The ratio of boys to girls is now (64 + x) : (40 + x) = 4 : 3. 
Solving this equation for x gives x = 24. 
So, the total number of members now is 64 + 40 + 2x = 64 + 40 + 2*24 = 152.
Instructions:
1. Understand the initial number of boys and girls.
2. Understand the final ratio of boys to girls.
3. Let the number of new members be x.
4. Set up an equation based on the final ratio.
5. Solve the equation to find the number of new members.
6. Add the initial number of boys and girls and twice the number of new members to find the total number of members.
7. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
- Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
- Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
- Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
- Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
- Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
- Remember that ratios represent a relationship between two quantities.
