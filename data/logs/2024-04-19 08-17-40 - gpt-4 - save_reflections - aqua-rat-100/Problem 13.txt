## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I made a mistake in the arithmetic calculation when combining the fractions. The correct calculation should be 63/72*x - 28/72*x = 35/72*x, not 35/72*x = 770. This led to an incorrect answer.
Error Keywords:
- Calculation error
- Arithmetic error
- Fraction simplification error
Solution:
Let's denote the number as x. The student should have found 7/8*x but instead found 7/18*x. The difference between these two values is 770. So, we can write the equation as follows:
7/8*x - 7/18*x = 770
To solve this equation, we first need to find a common denominator for 8 and 18, which is 72. So, we rewrite the equation as:
63/72*x - 28/72*x = 770
Combine the fractions:
35/72*x = 770
To solve for x, we multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of 35/72, which is 72/35:
x = 770 * 72/35
x = 1584
Instructions:
1. Understand the problem and denote the unknown number as x.
2. Write down the equation based on the problem.
3. Find a common denominator for the fractions in the equation.
4. Rewrite the equation using the common denominator.
5. Combine the fractions on the left side of the equation.
6. To solve for x, multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of the fraction on the left side.
7. Calculate the value of x.
8. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
9. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
- Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
- Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
- Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
- Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
- Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
- Be careful when simplifying fractions and finding common denominators.
