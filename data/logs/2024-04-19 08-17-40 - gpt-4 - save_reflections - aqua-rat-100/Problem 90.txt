Solution:
Let's denote the number of newspapers the hotel buys on Monday (and the rest of the weekdays) as x. Then, the hotel buys 2x newspapers on Sunday. 
The total cost for the newspapers is $210. We know that the cost for the Sunday newspapers is 2x * $4 = $8x and the cost for the newspapers for the rest of the week (Monday to Saturday) is 6x * $1 = $6x. 
So, we can set up the equation: $8x (for Sunday) + $6x (for Monday to Saturday) = $210. 
First, combine like terms: 8x + 6x = 14x.
Then, divide both sides of the equation by 14 to solve for x: 210 / 14 = 15.
So, the hotel buys 15 newspapers on Monday.
