  Great, let's break down the question and the possible answers:

Question: An unstated assumption made by the authors about clover is that the plants

Choices:

A: do not produce pyrethrums.
B: are members of the Chrysanthemum genus.
C: are usually located near wild-type honeybee colonies.
D: will not be a good food source for honeybees in the control colonies.

Action: Answer("B")

The correct answer is (B) because the passage states that the authors postulate that the problem with commercial bee colonies is a diet deficient in anti-mite toxins, specifically pyrethrums. Since clover is not a member of the Chrysanthemum genus, which includes pyrethrum-producing plants, it is unlikely that the authors assume that clover produces pyrethrums.

Here's a summary of the question and the correct answer:

Question: An unstated assumption made by the authors about clover is that the plants

Correct Answer: B - Clover is a member of the Chrysanthemum genus, which does not produce pyrethrums.
