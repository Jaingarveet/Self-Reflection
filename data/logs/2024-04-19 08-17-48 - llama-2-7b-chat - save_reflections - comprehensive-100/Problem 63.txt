## Get Reflection:
 Explanation:
I made a mistake in my solution to the equation $2z + 1 = z$.

The correct solution is:

$$2z + 1 = z \Rightarrow 2z = z - 1 \Rightarrow z = \frac{1}{2}$$

Therefore, the value of $z$ that satisfies the equation is $\frac{1}{2}$.

Error Keywords:

* Misunderstanding the equation
* Failure to isolate the variable
* Incorrect calculation

Solution:

To solve for $z$ in the equation $2z + 1 = z$, we need to isolate the variable $z$ by subtracting $1$ from both sides of the equation.

$$2z + 1 = z \Rightarrow 2z = z - 1 \Rightarrow z = \frac{1}{2}$$

Instructions:

1. Read the equation carefully and identify the variable to be solved for.
2. Isolate the variable by subtracting $1$ from both sides of the equation.
3. Calculate the value of the variable by simplifying the expression.
4. Choose the answer that matches the calculated value.

Advice:

* Always read the equation carefully and identify the variable to be solved for.
* Isolate the variable by using the appropriate mathematical operations.
* Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
* Remember to simplify the expression before choosing the answer.
