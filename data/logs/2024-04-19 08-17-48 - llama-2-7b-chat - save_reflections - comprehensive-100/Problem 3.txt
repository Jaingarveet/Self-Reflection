 Explanation:
I miscalculated the number of sales the salesperson must make to reach a salary of at least $1000. I misunderstood the problem and overestimated the number of sales required.

Error Keywords:

* Miscalculation
* Overestimation
* Commission percentage
* Sale price

Solution:
To calculate the number of sales the salesperson must make to reach a salary of at least $1000, we need to know the commission percentage and the sale price.

Let's assume the commission percentage is 10% and the sale price is $250.

The commission earned per sale is 10% of $250, which is $25.

To calculate the number of sales the salesperson must make, we can divide the desired salary of $1000 by the commission earned per sale:

$1000 รท $25 = 40 sales

Therefore, the salesperson must make 40 sales of $250 each to reach a salary of at least $1000.

Instructions:

1. Identify the commission percentage and the sale price.
2. Calculate the commission earned per sale.
3. Divide the desired salary by the commission earned per sale to find the number of sales required.
4. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
5. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.

Advice:

* Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
* Break down complex problems into smaller, manageable steps.
* Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
* Remember that the commission percentage is calculated as a percentage of the sale price.
* When calculating the number of sales required, divide the desired salary by the commission earned per sale.
