## Get Reflection:
  Great, let's break down the answer:

The correct answer is (D) The second trigger provides a necessary supplement to the calcium concentration released by the first trigger.

The passage explains that the Venus flytrap requires a second trigger hair to be touched within a short amount of time in order for its trap to close. According to the passage, this is because the second trigger provides a necessary supplement to the calcium concentration released by the first trigger. This means that the second trigger helps to increase the concentration of calcium ions in the trap, which is necessary for it to close.

The other options are not supported by the passage:

Option (A) is incorrect because the passage does not mention anything about an electrical charge produced by the first trigger.

Option (B) is incorrect because the passage does not mention anything about stabilizing the surge of calcium ions created by the first trigger.

Option (C) is correct, as the passage states that the second trigger prompts the calcium channels to open, which is necessary for the trap to close.

Therefore, the best explanation for why the Venus flytrap requires a second trigger hair to be touched within a short amount of time in order for its trap to close is that the second trigger provides a necessary supplement to the calcium concentration released by the first trigger.
