## Get Reflection:
 Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question as "B" (Hypophosphatemic vitamin D-resistant rickets is a disorder that affects the body's ability to absorb vitamin D and phosphorus).

The correct answer is "C" (Hypophosphatemic vitamin D-resistant rickets is a rare genetic disorder that affects the body's ability to absorb vitamin D and phosphorus, leading to softening of the bones (osteomalacia) or abnormal bone growth (rachitis)).
