## Get Reflection:
  Great, you have correctly identified the source of the passage! The passage is most likely drawn from option E, "a book describing various North American folk song forms." The passage provides detailed information about the historical and cultural context of the corrido, including its origins in the Lower Rio Grande Border region and its significance in affirming the cohesiveness of Border communities. The passage also highlights the unique features of the corrido, such as its use of familiar linguistic and thematic conventions, its heavy reliance on metaphors, and its use of standard generic elements. These details suggest that the passage is about the Lower Rio Grande Border region and the corrido tradition specific to that area, rather than a brochure for tourists, a study on the ballad's influence on Spanish music, an editorial on contemporary issues, or a book on North American folk song forms.
