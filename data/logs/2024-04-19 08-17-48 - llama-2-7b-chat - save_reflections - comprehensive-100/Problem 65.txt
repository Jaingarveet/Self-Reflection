## Get Reflection:
  Explanation:

You have correctly identified that the function $f(n)$ is an increasing linear function. Well done!

The problem states that for each of the next 5 years, Eleanor invited double the number of people she had invited the previous year. This means that the rate at which the number of people invited is increasing is 100% per year.

Here's a breakdown of how the number of people invited would increase over time:

Year 1: 30 people
Year 2: 60 people (double the number of people invited in Year 1)
Year 3: 120 people (double the number of people invited in Year 2)
Year 4: 240 people (double the number of people invited in Year 3)
Year 5: 480 people (double the number of people invited in Year 4)

As you can see, the number of people invited to the fund-raiser increases linearly with each passing year, at a rate of 100% per year. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) An increasing exponential function.

Great job!
