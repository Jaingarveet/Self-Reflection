# Model: llama-2-7b-chat | Agent: keywords | Exam: sat-math-100 | Problem 58 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: $$\begin{aligned}& y<-x+a \\& y>x+b\end{aligned}$$In the $x y$-plane, if $(0,0)$ is a solution to the system of inequalities above, which of the following relationships between $a$ and $b$ must be true?
Choices:
  A: $a>b$
  B: $b>a$
  C: $|a|>|b|$
  D: $a=-b$

## Assistant 2:
  Thought: 
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I need to reflect on my mistake. The system of inequalities can be represented graphically as a line in the $x y$-plane. If $(0,0)$ is a solution, then the line must intersect the $y$-axis at $y=0$.

Action: Answer("B")

Reflection:
I misinterpreted the problem by assuming that the line was parallel to the $x$-axis, which led me to choose the wrong answer. I should have realized that the line was actually vertical, intersecting the $y$-axis at $y=0$. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) $b>a$.

Error Keywords: Misinterpretation of the problem, Incorrect reasoning, Wrong answer
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
