## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Assistant 2:
  Thought: I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I am now reflecting on my mistake. I realized that I made a factoring error and misinterpreted the equation.

Action: Let's try to solve the equation again. We have $\sqrt{k+2} - x = 0$. We can factor the left-hand side as $\sqrt{k} + \sqrt{2} - x = 0$. Now, we can see that $\sqrt{k} = 7$ or $\sqrt{2} = 1.6$. So, the value of $k$ is either $7$ or $16$.

Answer: The value of $k$ is $16$.
