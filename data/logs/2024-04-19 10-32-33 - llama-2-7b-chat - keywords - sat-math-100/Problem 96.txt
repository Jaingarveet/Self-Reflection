## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

## Assistant 2:
  Thought: I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I am now reflecting on my solution and the correct answer.

Action: I will use my self-reflection to help me answer the question.

Self-Reflection:

* I incorrectly calculated the new length of the rectangle as 1.10(original length) instead of 1.10(original length) x 1.10(percentage increase).
* I also incorrectly calculated the new width of the rectangle as 0.90(original width) instead of 0.90(original width) x 0.90(percentage decrease).
* The correct formula for the area of the rectangle is A = length x width.
* The area of the original rectangle was 100 square units.
* The area of the altered rectangle is 12 percent less than the area of the original rectangle, so the area of the altered rectangle is 90 square units.

Action: Based on my self-reflection, the correct answer is (B) 15%.

Explanation:
The length of the rectangle was increased by 10 percent, which means it was increased by 10/100 = 0.10 of the original length.
The width of the rectangle was decreased by $p$ percent, which means it was decreased by $p/100$ of the original width.
The new length of the rectangle is 1.10(original length) = 1.10(x) square units.
The new width of the rectangle is 0.90(original width) = 0.90(y) square units.
The area of the altered rectangle is A = length x width = 1.10(x) x 0.90(y) square units.
The area of the altered rectangle is 90 square units, which is 12 percent less than the area of the original rectangle.
Therefore, the value of $p$ is 15 percent.
