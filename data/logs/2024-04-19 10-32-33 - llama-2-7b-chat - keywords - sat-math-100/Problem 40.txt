## Assistant 2:
  Thought: 
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand that I made a mistake in my calculation. I will carefully review the problem and my solution to determine the correct answer.

Reflection:
The equation $20-x=15$ can be solved by subtracting $20$ from both sides, which gives us $x=15$.

Now, to find the value of $3x$, we multiply $x$ by $3$, which gives us $3x=45$.

Action: Answer("C")
