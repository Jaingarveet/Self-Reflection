## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: The first year Eleanor organized a fund-raising event, she invited 30 people. For each of the next 5 years, she invited double the number of people she had invited the previous year. If $f(n)$ is the number of people invited to the fund-raiser $n$ years after Eleanor began organizing the event, which of the following statements best describes the function $f$ ?
Choices:
  A: The function $f$ is a decreasing linear function.
  B: The function $f$ is an increasing linear function.
  C: The function $f$ is a decreasing exponential function.
  D: The function $f$ is an increasing exponential function.

## Assistant 2:
  Thought:
I previously answered this question as Choice A: The function $f$ is a decreasing linear function. However, upon further reflection, I realize that the problem states that Eleanor invited double the number of people each year, which means that the function $f$ is actually increasing linearly.

Action: Answer("B")

Reflection:
I realized that my previous answer was incorrect because I misunderstood the problem. I thought that the function $f$ was decreasing linearly, but it is actually increasing linearly. This is because Eleanor invited double the number of people each year, which means that the function $f$ is increasing by a factor of 2 each year. I will make sure to be more careful in my reasoning and to read the problem more closely in the future.
