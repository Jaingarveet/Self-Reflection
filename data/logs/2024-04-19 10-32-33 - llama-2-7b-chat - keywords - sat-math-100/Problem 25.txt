# Model: llama-2-7b-chat | Agent: keywords | Exam: sat-math-100 | Problem 25 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Assistant 2:
  Thought: I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I believe I understand where I went wrong. The first equation can be rewritten as $y = x^2$, and the second equation can be rewritten as $2y + 6 = 2(x + 3)$. Substituting the expression for $y$ from the first equation into the second equation, we get $2x^2 + 6 = 2(x + 3)$. Simplifying, we get $2x^2 + 6 = 2x + 6$. Subtracting $2x$ from both sides gives $x^2 + 4 = 0$.

Reflection: I realized that I made a substitution error in the first equation, where I should have kept the $y$ on the left-hand side. This led to an incorrect solution. I will make sure to be more careful in my calculations and to follow the correct steps in the future.

Action: Answer("B")
