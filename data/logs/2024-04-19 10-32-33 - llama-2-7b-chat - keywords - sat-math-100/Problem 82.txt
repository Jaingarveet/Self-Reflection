## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I am reflecting on my mistake to improve my response.
The quadratic equation $y = a(x-2)(x+4)$ can be factored as $y = a(x-2)^2$.
The vertex of the parabola is at $(c, d)$, where $c = -2$.
To find $d$, we can substitute $x = -2$ into the equation:
$$y = a(-2 - 4)(-2 + 4) = -16 a$$
Therefore, $d = -16 a$.

Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: A
