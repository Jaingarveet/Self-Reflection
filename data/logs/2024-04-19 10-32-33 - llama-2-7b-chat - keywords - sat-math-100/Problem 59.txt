Question: Keith modeled the growth over several hundred years of a tree population by estimating the number of the trees' pollen grains per square centimeter that were deposited each year within layers of a lake's sediment. He estimated there were 310 pollen grains per square centimeter the first year the grains were deposited, with a $1 \%$ annual increase in the number of grains per square centimeter thereafter. Which of the following functions models $P(t)$, the number of pollen grains per square centimeter $t$ years after the first year the grains were deposited?
Choices:
  A: $P(t)=310^{t}$
  B: $P(t)=310^{1.01 t}$
  C: $P(t)=310(0.99)^{t}$
  D: $P(t)=310(1.01)^{t}$

## Assistant 2:
  Thought:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and upon reflection, I realized that I made a mistake in my calculation. I estimated the number of pollen grains per square centimeter as $P(t) = 310^{t}$, which is incorrect.

Reflection:
I analyzed my previous answer and realized that I made a mistake in my calculation. The correct function for modeling the growth of the number of pollen grains per square centimeter over time is:

$P(t) = 310^{1.01t}$

Explanation:
The problem states that the number of pollen grains per square centimeter increases by $1\%$ annually, which means that the growth rate is $1\%$ per year. Therefore, the function that models this growth is:

$P(t) = 310 \times (1 + 0.01t)$

Simplifying the expression, we get:

$P(t) = 310^{1.01t}$

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) $P(t) = 310^{1.01t}$.
