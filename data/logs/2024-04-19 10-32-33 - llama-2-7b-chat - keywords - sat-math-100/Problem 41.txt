## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Assistant 2:
  Thought:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand that the correct answer is (A) $x-2$.

Reflection:
I analyzed the given table and the function $f(x)$ and realized that $f(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 1, which means it can be factored as $a(x-b)$. From the table, we can see that $f(0) = 3$, $f(2) = 1$, $f(4) = 0$, and $f(5) = -2$. These values can be expressed as $a(x-b)$ where $a = 3$, $b = 2$. Therefore, the only factor of $f(x)$ is $x-2$.

Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: C
