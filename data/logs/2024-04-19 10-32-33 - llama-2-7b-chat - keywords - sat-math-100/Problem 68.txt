Question: $$0.10 x+0.20 y=0.18(x+y)$$Clayton will mix $x$ milliliters of a $10 \%$ by mass saline solution with $y$ milliliters of a $20 \%$ by mass saline solution in order to create an $18 \%$ by mass saline solution. The equation above represents this situation. If Clayton uses 100 milliliters of the $20 \%$ by mass saline solution, how many milliliters of the $10 \%$ by mass saline solution must he use?
Choices:
  A: 5
  B: 25
  C: 50
  D: 100

## Assistant 2:
  Thought:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and upon reflection, I realized that I made a mistake in my calculation. The correct equation to use is:

$$0.10x + 0.20y = 0.18(x+y)$$

To find the amount of the $10\%$ by mass saline solution needed, we can solve for $x$ in terms of $y$:

$$0.10x = 0.18y - 0.20y$$

Simplifying, we get:

$$0.90x = 0.18y$$

Now, if Clayton uses 100 milliliters of the $20\%$ by mass saline solution, we can find the amount of the $10\%$ by mass saline solution he needs by multiplying the amount of the $20\%$ by mass saline solution by the ratio of the $10\%$ by mass saline solution to the $20\%$ by mass saline solution:

$$x = \frac{100}{0.20} = 500$$

So, the correct answer is (C): 500 milliliters of the $10\%$ by mass saline solution.

Reflection:
I realized that I made a mistake in my initial calculation by not properly simplifying the equation. I also realized that I should have used the correct equation to solve for $x$ in terms of $y$. Additionally, I noticed that I made a calculation error in my final answer, which resulted in the incorrect solution. I will make sure to be more careful and thorough in my calculations in the future.
