## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Assistant 2:
  Thought: 
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand that the intersection point of the system of equations is not at the point $(0,0)$.
I will use the method of substitution to solve the system of equations.
Action: Substitute the second equation into the first equation:
$$2.4x - 1.5y = 0.3$$
$$1.6x + 0.5y = -1.3$$
Substituting the second equation into the first equation, we get:
$$2.4x - 1.5y = 0.3$$
$$1.6x + 0.5y = -1.3$$
Now, I will solve for $x$ in terms of $y$.
$$2.4x - 1.5y = 0.3$$
$$1.6x + 0.5y = -1.3$$
Subtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get:
$$0.4x = -0.8y$$
Dividing both sides by $0.4$, we get:
$$x = -2y$$
Now, I will substitute this expression for $x$ into the first equation:
$$2.4(-2y) - 1.5y = 0.3$$
Simplifying, we get:
$$-4y - 1.5y = 0.3$$
Combining like terms, we get:
$$-5.5y = 0.3$$
Dividing both sides by $-5.5$, we get:
$$y = 0.06$$
Now, I will find the $x$-coordinate of the intersection point:
$$x = -2y = -2 \times 0.06 = 0.12$$
Action: Answer("B")
