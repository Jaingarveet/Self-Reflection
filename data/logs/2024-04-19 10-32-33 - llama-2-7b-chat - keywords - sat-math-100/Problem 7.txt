## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:

## Assistant 2:
  Thought: I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I am now reflecting on my solution and the correct answer.

Error Analysis:

* I simplified the expression $(7+3i) + (-8+9i)$ by adding the real and imaginary parts, which is not the correct way to add complex numbers.
* I should have added the real and imaginary parts separately, resulting in $(7+3i) + (-8+9i) = 5+6i$.

Correct Answer:

Action: Answer("C")

Explanation: The correct answer is $15+12i$, which can be calculated by adding the real and imaginary parts of the expression: $(7+3i) + (-8+9i) = 5+6i = 15+12i$.
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
