## Assistant 2:
  Thought: 
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand that I made a mistake in my equation setup. I will carefully review the problem and my solution to determine where I went wrong.

Reflection:
The problem states that $16 + 4x$ is 10 more than $14$. To find the value of $8x$, I need to isolate the variable $x$.

My previous answer was incorrect because I misunderstood the problem and set up the equation incorrectly. I mistakenly added $4x$ to both sides of the equation, which resulted in an incorrect solution.

To solve the problem correctly, I will set up the equation as follows:

$16 + 4x = 14 + 4x$

Subtracting $14$ from both sides gives us:

$16 = 4x$

Dividing both sides by $4$ gives us:

$4 = x$

Therefore, the value of $8x$ is $32$.

Action: Answer("B")
