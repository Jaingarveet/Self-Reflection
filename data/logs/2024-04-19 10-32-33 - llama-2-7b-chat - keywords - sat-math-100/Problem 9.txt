Question: Dreams Recalled during One Week\begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|}\hline& None & 1 to 4 & 5 or more & Total \\\hline\hlineGroup X & 15 & 28 & 57 & 100 \\\hlineGroup Y & 21 & 11 & 68 & 100 \\\hlineTotal & 36 & 39 & 125 & 200 \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}The data in the table above were produced by a sleep researcher studying the number of dreams people recall when asked to record their dreams for one week. Group X consisted of 100 people who observed early bedtimes, and Group Y consisted of 100 people who observed later bedtimes. If a person is chosen at random from those who recalled at least 1 dream, what is the probability that the person belonged to Group Y ?
Choices:
  A: $\frac{68}{100}$
  B: $\frac{79}{100}$
  C: $\frac{79}{164}$
  D: $\frac{164}{200}$

Error Keywords:

* Total number of dreams recalled
* Number of dreams recalled by Group Y alone
* Probability of belonging to Group Y
## Assistant 2:
  Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly by calculating the probability of belonging to Group Y based on the total number of dreams recalled, rather than the number of dreams recalled by Group Y alone. I realized my mistake and adjusted my approach accordingly.

To calculate the probability of belonging to Group Y, we need to divide the number of dreams recalled by Group Y by the total number of dreams recalled. Therefore, the correct answer is:

B: $\frac{79}{100}$

Explanation:
The table shows that Group Y recalled 79 dreams out of a total of 100 dreams recalled. Therefore, the probability of belonging to Group Y is $\frac{79}{100}$.
