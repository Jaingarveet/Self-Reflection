## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Assistant 2:
  Thought: 
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand the mistake. The parabola intersects the line at two points, $A$ and $B$, and the length of $\overline{A B}$ is the distance between these two points.

Action: Answer("B")

Self-reflection:

I made a mistake in my previous answer by not properly identifying the points of intersection between the parabola and the line. I realized that the parabola intersects the line at two points, $A$ and $B$, and the length of $\overline{A B}$ is the distance between these two points.

To calculate the length of $\overline{A B}$, I used the formula for the distance between two points in the $x y$-plane: $d = \sqrt((x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2)$.

I plugged in the values for $x_1 = 11$, $y_1 = 25$, $x_2 = 11$, and $y_2 = 16$, and calculated the distance: $d = \sqrt((11 - 11)^2 + (16 - 25)^2) = \sqrt(0 + 95) = 95$.

Therefore, the length of $\overline{A B}$ is $95$.
