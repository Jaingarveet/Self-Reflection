## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

  Thought: I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I need to reflect on my solution and the correct answer.

Error Keywords: Factoring error, Simplification error, Calculation error

Reflection:

I remember that the equation is $\frac{x^{2}-1}{x-1} = -2$. To solve for $x$, I factored the numerator and denominator separately:

$$\frac{x^{2}-1}{x-1} = -2 \Leftrightarrow \frac{x^{2} - 2x + 1}{x - 1} = -2$$

I simplified the equation by combining like terms:

$$\frac{x^{2} - 2x + 1}{x - 1} = -2 \Leftrightarrow x^{2} - 2x + 1 = 0$$

I tried to factor the left-hand side of the equation, but I made a mistake in my factoring. I factored it as $x(x - 1) = 0$, which is not the correct factorization.

The correct factorization is $x(x - 1) = (x - 1)(x + 1) = 0$, which gives us $x = 1$ or $x = -1$.

Therefore, the values of $x$ that satisfy the equation are $x = 1$ and $x = -1$.

Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
