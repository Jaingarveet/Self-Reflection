Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I made an error in my calculation for the sum of the 5 consecutive odd numbers when checking the number [REDACTED].
The sum of the 5 consecutive odd numbers starting from [REDACTED] is [REDACTED] + 43 + 45 + [REDACTED] + 49 = 225, which is not divisible by 10.
The correct calculation for the sum of the 5 consecutive odd numbers is 5x + 10, where x is the middle number.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Addition error
 - Divisibility error
Solution:
The sum of 5 consecutive odd numbers can be expressed as 5x + 10, where x is the middle number.
Since the numbers are odd, x must be an odd number.
The sum of 5 consecutive odd numbers is always divisible by 5.
If the sum is divisible by 10, then the last digit of the sum must be 0.
The only perfect square that ends in 0 is 100.
Therefore, the sum of the 5 consecutive odd numbers must be a multiple of 100.
Let's check which of the given numbers can be one of the 5 consecutive odd numbers.
Starting with the smallest number, [REDACTED]. The sum of the next 4 consecutive odd numbers is [REDACTED] + 43 + 45 + [REDACTED] + 49 = 225, which is not divisible by 10. So, [REDACTED] cannot be one of the 5 consecutive odd numbers.
Checking [REDACTED]. The sum of the next 4 consecutive odd numbers is [REDACTED] + 46 + 48 + 50 + 52 = 240, which is divisible by 10. So, [REDACTED] can be one of the 5 consecutive odd numbers.
Checking [REDACTED]. The sum of the next 4 consecutive odd numbers is [REDACTED] + 49 + 51 + 53 + 55 = 255, which is not divisible by 10. So, [REDACTED] cannot be one of the 5 consecutive odd numbers.
Checking [REDACTED]. The sum of the previous 4 consecutive odd numbers is 59 + 61 + 63 + 65 + [REDACTED] = 315, which is divisible by 10. So, [REDACTED] can be one of the 5 consecutive odd numbers.
Checking [REDACTED]. The sum of the previous 4 consecutive odd numbers is 75 + 77 + 79 + 81 + 83 = 395, which is not divisible by 10. So, [REDACTED] cannot be one of the 5 consecutive odd numbers.
Instructions:
1. Understand the problem and what is being asked.
2. Identify the formula for the sum of 5 consecutive odd numbers.
3. Remember that the sum of 5 consecutive odd numbers is always divisible by 5.
4. Remember that if the sum is divisible by 10, then the last digit of the sum must be 0.
5. Remember that the only perfect square that ends in 0 is 100.
6. Check each given number to see if it can be one of the 5 consecutive odd numbers.
7. Use the formula to calculate the sum of the 5 consecutive odd numbers.
8. Check if the sum is divisible by 10.
9. Choose the answer that matches the number that can be one of the 5 consecutive odd numbers.
Advice:
