Explanation:
I incorrectly calculated the LCM of 16 and 17. 
The gap in my knowledge was in finding the LCM of two numbers. 
I thought that the LCM of 16 and 17 was 304, but it is actually 272.
Error Keywords:
 - LCM error
 - Calculation error
 - Arithmetic error
Solution:
The LCM of 16 and 17 is 272.
Therefore, both trains will leave the station simultaneously again in [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Identify the time interval for each train.
2. Find the LCM of the two time intervals.
3. The LCM is the time it takes for both trains to leave the station simultaneously again.
4. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
5. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always identify the relevant information in the problem.
