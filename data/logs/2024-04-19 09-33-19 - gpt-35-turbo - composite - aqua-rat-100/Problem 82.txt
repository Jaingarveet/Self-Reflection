## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: A cow is tethered in the middle of a field with a 14 feet long rope. If the cow grazes 10 sq.ft. per day, then approximately what time will be taken by the cow to graze the whole field?
Choices:
  A: 51 days
  B: 61 days
  C: 71 days
  D: 81 days
  E: 91 days
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I made a calculation error while finding the area of the field. 
I used the diameter instead of the radius to calculate the area of the field.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Area calculation error
 - Diameter instead of radius
Solution:
The rope tied to the cow is the radius of the circular area it can graze.
The area of the circle is pi*r^2, where r is the radius of the circle.
We need to find the area of the field and divide it by the area the cow can graze in a day.
The radius of the circle is 14/2 = 7 feet.
The area of the field is [REDACTED] = pi*r^2 = pi*7^2 = 153.94 sq.ft. (rounded to two decimal places)
The time taken by the cow to graze the whole field is T = A/10 = 15.39 days (rounded to two decimal places)
Instructions:
1. Identify the radius of the circle that the cow can graze.
2. Calculate the area of the circle using the formula [REDACTED] = pi*r^2.
3. Identify the area that the cow can graze in a day.
4. Divide the area of the field by the area that the cow can graze in a day.
5. Round the result to the nearest whole number or decimal place, as required.
6. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
7. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always use the correct formula for the problem.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that the radius of a circle is half of its diameter.
