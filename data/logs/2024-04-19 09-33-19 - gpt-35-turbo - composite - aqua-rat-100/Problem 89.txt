Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I made a calculation error while dividing the remaining $5.00 by $0.40 per mile.
The correct calculation is $5.00/$0.40 = 12.5 miles.
The maximum distance is 12.5 miles, which is greater than all the answer choices except for [REDACTED].
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Division error
 - Arithmetic error
Solution:
The initial charge is $3.50, which leaves $5.00 for the additional distance.
Each additional quarter-mile costs $0.10, which means that each mile costs $0.40.
To find the maximum distance, we need to divide the remaining $5.00 by $0.40 per mile.
$5.00/$0.40 = 12.5 miles.
Instructions:
1. Identify the initial charge and the cost per additional quarter-mile.
2. Calculate the remaining amount after the initial charge.
3. Calculate the cost per mile.
4. Divide the remaining amount by the cost per mile.
5. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
6. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that the maximum distance is the result of dividing the remaining amount by the cost per mile.
 - Be careful with units and conversions.
