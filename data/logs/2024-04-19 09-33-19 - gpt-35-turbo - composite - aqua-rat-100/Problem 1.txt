Explanation:
I incorrectly calculated the diagonal of the rectangular solid. 
The gap in my knowledge was in visualizing the rectangular solid and its diagonal. 
I used the wrong formula to calculate the diagonal of the rectangular solid.
Error Keywords:
 - Visualization error
 - Formula error
 - Calculation error
Solution:
The rectangular solid has dimensions 3 x 4 x 15.
The diameter of the sphere is equal to the diagonal of the rectangular solid.
The diagonal of the rectangular solid can be found using the Pythagorean theorem.
The diagonal of the rectangular solid is sqrt(3^2 + 4^2 + 15^2) = sqrt(250).
The diameter of the sphere is equal to the square root of 250 times 2, which is approximately[REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Visualize the rectangular solid and the sphere.
2. Identify the dimensions of the rectangular solid.
3. Use the Pythagorean theorem to calculate the diagonal of the rectangular solid.
4. Multiply the diagonal of the rectangular solid by the square root of 2 to find the diameter of the sphere.
5. Round the answer to the nearest ten-thousandth.
6. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
7. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always visualize the problem to better understand it.
 - Always use the correct formula to solve the problem.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that the diameter of a sphere is equal to the diagonal of the rectangular solid inscribed in it.

The diameter of the sphere is equal to the square root of 250 times 2, which is approximately 19.7889.
Rounding to the nearest ten-thousandth gives 19.7889 â‰ˆ 19.7888.
