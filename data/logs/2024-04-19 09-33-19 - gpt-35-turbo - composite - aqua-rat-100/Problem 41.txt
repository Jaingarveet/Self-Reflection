## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I made an error in setting up the equation. 
The equation should have been 96/x = (96/(x-4)) + 4, not (96/x) = (96/x + 4) * (x-4).
Error Keywords:
 - Equation setup error
 - Algebraic manipulation error
 - Misunderstanding of the problem
Solution:
Let's assume that the total number of friends who planned to go on a picnic is "x".
The cost of eatables per person would be 96/x.
When 4 friends did not turn up, the remaining friends had to pay an additional Rs. 4 each.
So, the new cost of eatables per person would be (96/(x-4)) + 4.
We can create an equation based on the above information and solve for "x".
Equation: 96/x = (96/(x-4)) + 4
Solving for "x":
96/x - 96/(x-4) = 4
(96(x-4) - 96x)/(x(x-4)) = 4
-3[REDACTED]4/(x^2 - 4x) = 4
x^2 - 4x = -96
x^2 - 4x + 96 = 0
(x-[REDACTED])(x-[REDACTED]) = 0
x = [REDACTED] or x = [REDACTED]
Since 4 friends did not turn up, the number of friends who attended the picnic must be less than or equal to [REDACTED].
Therefore, the answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED].
