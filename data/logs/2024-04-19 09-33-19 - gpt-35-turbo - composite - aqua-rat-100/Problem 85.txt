## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: Consider there is an staircase elevator and you are coming down. If you walk 20 steps and stop, then you reach bottom in 10 minutes. If you walk 10 steps and stop, you reach to the ground in 20 minutes. What is the speed of the elevator?
Choices:
  A: 1 step/minute
  B: 2 step/minute
  C: 3 step/minute
  D: 4 step/minute
  E: None of the above
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
The elevator's speed is constant, so it cannot have two different values. 
The error in my reasoning was that I assumed the elevator's speed was constant, but it was not. 
Error Keywords:
 - Incorrect assumption
 - Non-constant speed
Solution:
Let's assume that the speed of the elevator is "x steps/minute".
From the first statement, we can say that the total number of steps in the staircase is 20 steps. So, the time taken to reach the bottom is 10 minutes. Therefore, the speed of the elevator can be calculated as (20 steps)/(10 minutes) = 2 steps/minute.
From the second statement, we can say that the elevator's speed is half of the speed in the first statement. Therefore, the speed of the elevator can be calculated as (2 steps/minute) / 2 = [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and understand the problem.
2. Identify the unknown variable and assign a variable to it.
3. Use the given information to create equations.
4. Solve the equations to find the value of the unknown variable.
5. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
6. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
