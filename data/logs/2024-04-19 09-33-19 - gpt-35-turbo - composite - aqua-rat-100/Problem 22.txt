## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: Alex and Jacob works at a toy shop that make toys. Alex takes 7 hours to make a toy, and Jacob takes 9 hours to make a toy. During a month, both of them makes 35 toys in total. If both of them have worked for almost similar number of hours how many toys have been prepared by Jacob?
Choices:
  A: 15
  B: 16
  C: 17
  D: 18
  E: 19
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
My approach to the problem was incorrect. I assumed that Alex and Jacob made x toys and (35 - x) toys respectively, which is not correct. Also, I did not use the given information that both of them worked for almost similar hours. 
Error Keywords:
 - Incorrect assumption
 - Incorrect approach
 - Ignoring given information
Solution:
Let's assume that Alex and Jacob made a toys and b toys respectively.
The time taken by Alex and Jacob to make a toys and b toys respectively can be calculated using the formula: Time = (Work / Rate)
Let's assume that Alex worked for t hours and Jacob worked for (t + d) hours.
Using the above information, we can form two equations and solve for d.
Equation 1: t/7 + (t + d)/9 = 35
Equation 2: a + b = 35
Solving equation 1 for t, we get t = (3[REDACTED] - 4d)/23
Substituting t in equation 2, we get a = (23*35 - 9d)/23 = 35 - (9d/23)
Since both of them worked for almost similar hours, we can assume that the difference in their working hours is negligible. Therefore, we can assume that d is very small compared to 3[REDACTED]. 
Using this approximation, we can solve for d as follows:
t = (3[REDACTED] - 4d)/23 = (3[REDACTED]/23) - (4d/23)
Substituting this value of t in equation 1, we get:
(3[REDACTED]/[REDACTED]1) - (4d/[REDACTED]1) + [(3[REDACTED]/[REDACTED]1) - (4d/[REDACTED]1) + d]/9 = 35/[REDACTED]1
Simplifying the above equation, we get:
d = [REDACTED]
Substituting d = [REDACTED] in the equation for a, we get:
a = 35 - (9d/23) = [REDACTED]
Therefore, Jacob made 20 toys.
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and understand the problem.
2. Identify the given information and what needs to be calculated.
3. Formulate equations based on the given information.
4. Simplify the equations and solve for the unknowns.

Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always use the given information and avoid making assumptions.
 - Always use the correct formulae and equations to solve the problem.
 - Always simplify the equations and solve for the unknowns.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that approximation can be used if the difference is negligible.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
We can use the formula: Time = (Work / Rate) to solve this problem.
Let's assume that Alex made x toys and Jacob made y toys.
We can form two equations based on the given information:
Equation 1: x + y = 35
Equation 2: x/7 + y/9 = [REDACTED]
We need to solve for y, which represents the number of toys made by Jacob.
Action: Answer("C")
