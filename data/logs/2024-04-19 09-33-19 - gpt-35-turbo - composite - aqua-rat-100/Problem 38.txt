## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I made a calculation error when finding the number of smaller cubes that make up the outer surface. 
I used the formula for the volume of the outer surface instead of the formula for the surface area of the outer surface. 
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Formula error
 - Surface area error
Solution:
The outer surface of the cube is (5x5x6) - (3x3x6) = 150 square cm.
The number of smaller cubes that make up the outer surface is 5x5x6 - 3x3x6 = 150.
Each face of a smaller cube has an area of 1 square cm, so the total number of faces of the smaller cubes is 150 x 6 = 900.
The number of faces that remain unpainted is 900 - 150 = 750.
Instructions:
1. Identify the dimensions of the outer cube and the inner cube.
2. Calculate the surface area of the outer cube.
3. Calculate the surface area of the inner cube.
4. Subtract the surface area of the inner cube from the surface area of the outer cube to find the surface area of the hollow cube.
5. Calculate the number of smaller cubes that make up the outer surface.
6. Multiply the number of smaller cubes that make up the outer surface by 6 to find the total number of faces of the smaller cubes.
7. Subtract the number of faces of the smaller cubes that make up the outer surface from the total number of faces of the smaller cubes to find the number of faces that remain unpainted.
8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always use the correct formula for the problem.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that the surface area of a cube is the sum of the areas of its faces.
