## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
My thought process and solution were correct. However, I made a calculation error. The product of 3, 4, 1, and 3 is [REDACTED], not [REDACTED].
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Multiplication error
Solution:
The number of ways to travel from M to Q is the product of the number of ways to travel from M to N, from N to O, from O to P, and from P to Q.
From M to N, there are 3 buses.
From N to O, there are 4 buses.
From O to P, there is 1 bus.
From P to Q, there are 3 buses.
The total number of ways to travel from M to Q is 3 x 4 x 1 x 3 = [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Identify the number of buses from M to N.
2. Identify the number of buses from N to O.
3. Identify the number of buses from O to P.
4. Identify the number of buses from P to Q.
5. Multiply the number of buses from M to N by the number of buses from N to O by the number of buses from O to P by the number of buses from P to Q.
6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.
7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them.
