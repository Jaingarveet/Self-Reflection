## System:
You are an expert in Logic.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Topic: Logic
Context: The football game in the "Master Cup 2003 China Robot Competition" is in progress.Three professors predicted the final result? Professor Zhao said? "The champion is not the Tsinghua University team nor the Zhejiang University team." Professor Qian said ? "The champion is not the Tsinghua University team, but the University of Science and Technology of China." Professor Sun said? "The champion is not the China University of Science and Technology team, but the Tsinghua University team.The results of the competition showed that only one of them judged both, one 'S judgment is one-to-one wrong, the other one is wrong.
Question: According to the above situation, we know that the winner is
Choices:
  A: Tsinghua University Team
  B: China University of Science and Technology Team
  C: Zhejiang University Team
  D: Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:** My error stemmed from misinterpreting the information about the professors' accuracy. I focused on the elimination of Tsinghua by both Qian and Sun, assuming that meant it couldn't be the winner. However, I overlooked the possibility that one professor could be entirely wrong, while the other was partially correct.
**Error Keywords:**
*   Logic error
*   Misinterpretation 
*   Assumption error
## Step-by-Step Solution
1. **Analyze Professor Zhao's statement:** He eliminates Tsinghua and Zhejiang, leaving China University of Science and Technology and others as possibilities.
2. **Analyze Professor Qian's statement:** He eliminates Tsinghua and suggests China University of Science and Technology.
3. **Analyze Professor Sun's statement:** He eliminates China University of Science and Technology and suggests Tsinghua.
4. **Consider the accuracy information:** Only one professor is completely wrong, and one is partially wrong.
5. **Evaluate possibilities:**
    *   If Zhao is entirely wrong, both Tsinghua and Zhejiang could be winners. This contradicts Qian's statement.
    *   If Qian is entirely wrong, Tsinghua could be the winner, and China University of Science and Technology wouldn't. This aligns with Sun's statement.
    *   If Sun is entirely wrong, China University of Science and Technology could be the winner, and Tsinghua wouldn't. This contradicts Qian's statement.
6. **Conclusion:** Based on the analysis, Professor Qian must be entirely wrong, making **Tsinghua University the winner (A)**. Professor Zhao is partially correct (eliminating Zhejiang), and Professor Sun is also partially correct (eliminating China University of Science and Technology). 
## Instructions for Future Similar Problems
1. **Carefully analyze each statement:** Identify what each statement implies about the possible winner and loser.
2. **Consider the accuracy information:** Understand how the given information about the accuracy of the statements limits the possibilities.
3. **Evaluate each possibility systematically:**  Analyze each scenario based on the statements and accuracy information to identify contradictions.
4. **Eliminate contradictory scenarios:**  Focus on the scenarios that align with all the given information.
5. **Draw a conclusion:** Based on the remaining possibilities, identify the correct answer.
## General Advice for Logic Problems
*   **Avoid assumptions:** Don't jump to conclusions based on initial observations. 
*   **Consider all possibilities:** Systematically evaluate all potential scenarios before reaching a conclusion.
*   **Pay attention to detail:** Small details in the problem statement can significantly impact the solution.
*   **Use logic and reasoning:** Apply logical thinking and reasoning to eliminate contradictory possibilities and identify the correct answer. 
*   **Practice regularly:** The more you practice logic problems, the better you will become at identifying patterns and applying logical reasoning.
