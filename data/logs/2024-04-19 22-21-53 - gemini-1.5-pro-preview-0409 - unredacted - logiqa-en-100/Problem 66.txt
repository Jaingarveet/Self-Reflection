## System:
You are an expert in Logic.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Logic
Context: There are five volcanic islands E, F, G, H, and I in the east coast of a country.They are arranged in a straight line from north to south, and they are found? (1) F is adjacent to H and is on the north side of H.(2) I and E are adjacent.(3) G is somewhere in the north of F.
Question: If it is found that G is the northernmost island, how many possible arrangements are there for this group of islands?
Choices:
  A: 2
  B: 3
  C: 4
  D: 5
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:** My error was assuming that I and E must come after H, limiting the possible arrangements. I failed to consider the possibility of I and E being located between G and F.
**Error Keywords:**
*   Logic error
*   Assumption error
*   Ordering error
**Step-by-Step Solution:**
1.  **G is northernmost:** The order starts with G.
2.  **F is south of G:** From (3), F must come after G. Order is now GF.
3.  **H is south of F:** From (1), H must come after F. Order is now GFH.
4.  **I and E are adjacent:** From (2), I and E are together. They can be placed in three positions:
    *   **South of H:** GFHI, GFHIE (two possibilities as I and E can switch)
    *   **Between G and F:** GIFH, GIEFH (two possibilities as I and E can switch)
**Instructions for Future:**
1.  **Analyze each statement individually:** Break down the given information into separate facts.
2.  **Consider all possibilities:** Don't make assumptions about the order or placement of elements unless explicitly stated.
3.  **Systematically explore placements:** Try placing the remaining elements in all possible valid positions.
4.  **Count distinct arrangements:** Ensure each arrangement is unique and adheres to all given conditions.
**General Advice for Similar Problems:**
*   **Visualize the problem:** Draw diagrams or use objects to represent the elements and their relationships.
*   **Work systematically:** Avoid jumping to conclusions and explore all possibilities in an organized manner.
*   **Check for consistency:** Ensure your solution satisfies all the given conditions and constraints.
*   **Practice similar problems:** The more you practice, the better you become at identifying potential pitfalls and applying logical reasoning.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Following the insights from the reflection, we know G is the northernmost, followed by F and H. I and E can be placed in 3 positions (south of H, between G and F) with 2 possibilities for each position due to their order (IE or EI). 
Action: Answer("B") 
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
