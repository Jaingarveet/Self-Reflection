Topic: Logic
Context: There are five stations set up from west to east along a section of the high-speed railway along the river.It is known that Fuyi Station is east of Haoyun Station and West of Huyao Station, and is adjacent to Huyao Station; Jiushang Station is adjacent to Yinling Station.
Question: If Jiushang Station is adjacent to Haoyun Station and east of Haoyun Station, it can be concluded that?

## Reflection on Logic Problem
**Explanation of Incorrect Answer:**
My error stemmed from misinterpreting the given information and incorrectly ordering the stations. I assumed "adjacent" meant directly next to each other, leading to an incorrect sequence.
**Error Keywords:**
*   Misinterpretation
*   Logical reasoning error
*   Ordering error
**Step-by-Step Solution:**
1.  **Analyze Clues:** We know:
    *   West to East order.
    *   Fuyi is between Haoyun (West) and Huyao (East) and next to Huyao.
    *   Jiushang is East of and next to Haoyun.
    *   Jiushang is also next to Yinling.
2.  **Establish Order:**
    *   Haoyun is the westernmost as Fuyi is East of it.
    *   Jiushang is next to Haoyun (East).
    *   Yinling is next to Jiushang (unknown direction yet).
    *   Fuyi is next to Huyao, and we know Huyao is East of Fuyi, so Huyao is the easternmost.
3.  **Deduce Conclusion:** Since Huyao is the easternmost, the answer is **A: Huyao is standing on the east side.**
**Instructions for Future Problems:**
1.  **Carefully analyze each statement** and its implications.
2.  **Draw a diagram or map** to visualize the relationships.
3.  **Consider all possibilities** before establishing order.
4.  **Pay attention to keywords** like "adjacent" and their exact meaning.
5.  **Double-check the logic** and ensure conclusions are supported by the given information.
**General Advice for Similar Problems:**
*   **Avoid assumptions** and stick to the given information.
*   **Break down complex statements** into smaller parts.
*   **Look for relationships and connections** between elements.
*   **Use visualization tools** to aid understanding.
*   **Practice logical reasoning** with various problems.
