## Assistant 2:
## Reflection on Previous Attempt:
In my previous attempt, I made an error in interpreting the information about the professors' predictions and the actual outcome. I focused too much on the individual statements and failed to analyze the combined implications of "only one judged both" and "one's judgment is one-to-one wrong, the other one is wrong." This led me to an incorrect conclusion.
## Improved Approach:
1. **Analyze Combined Information:**  The key to solving this problem lies in understanding the combined meaning of the statements about the professors' judgments. Since only one professor got both parts of their prediction right, and another got both parts wrong, the remaining professor must have one part right and one part wrong.
2. **Evaluate Each Professor's Statements:**
    * **Professor Zhao:** If Zhao is right about the champion not being Tsinghua or Zhejiang, then either Qian or Sun must be completely wrong. This would contradict the given information. Therefore, Zhao must be wrong on both counts, meaning the champion is either Tsinghua or Zhejiang.
    * **Professor Qian:** If Qian is right about the champion not being Tsinghua but being USTC, then Sun must be completely wrong. This aligns with the given information (one completely wrong, one both right). 
    * **Professor Sun:** If Sun is right, then both Zhao and Qian would be wrong in both parts of their predictions, contradicting the given information.
3. **Identify the Champion:** Based on the above analysis, Professor Qian's statement aligns with the given information. Therefore, the champion is the **China University of Science and Technology Team**.
Action: Answer("B") 
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: A
