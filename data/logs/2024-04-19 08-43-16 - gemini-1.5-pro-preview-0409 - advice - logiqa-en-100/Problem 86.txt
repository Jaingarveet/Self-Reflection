## Assistant 2:
## Reflection on Previous Attempt:
In my previous attempt, I likely focused too much on the positions of Fuyi and Huyao stations, neglecting the crucial information about Jiushang and Yinling stations being adjacent. This led me to an incorrect conclusion about the easternmost station.
## Reasoning:
1. **Jiushang is east of and adjacent to Haoyun:** This means Haoyun cannot be the easternmost station.
2. **Jiushang is adjacent to Yinling:** This places Yinling directly next to Jiushang, either to the east or west.
3. **Fuyi is east of Haoyun and west of Huyao:** This places Fuyi between Haoyun and Huyao, eliminating Fuyi and Huyao from being the easternmost.
Therefore, the only remaining option for the easternmost station is **Yinling**.
Action: Answer("C") 
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
