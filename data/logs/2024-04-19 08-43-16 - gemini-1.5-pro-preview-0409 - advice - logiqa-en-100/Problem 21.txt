Context: Xiao Chen? At present, part of the orbit of Comet 1996D3 is far from the sun, but recently it can be found to emit flickering light through the solar telescope.In the past, people never observed such flashes of comets far away from the sun, so this flicker must be an unusual scene.Xiao Wang? Normally people don't observe comets far away from the sun.The 1996D3 comet flicker light discovered this time was obtained by continuous and careful tracking observation.
Question: Which of the following most accurately summarizes the method Xiao Wang used to refute Xiao Chen's views?
Choices:
  A: Point out that the key concepts used by Xiao Chen are ambiguous.

## Assistant 2:
## Reflection on Previous Error:
My previous answer to this question was incorrect because I focused on the superficial aspects of the argument rather than the core reasoning structure. I failed to analyze how Xiao Wang's response directly addressed the flaws in Xiao Chen's argument. 
## Applying the Learning:
Xiao Wang's refutation does not address ambiguity, persuasiveness, or self-contradiction in Xiao Chen's claims. Instead, Xiao Wang offers an alternative explanation for the observed phenomenon (comet flickering). This directly challenges the assumption that the flickering must be "unusual" simply because it hasn't been observed before. 
Therefore, the correct answer is: 
**Action: Answer("D")** 
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
