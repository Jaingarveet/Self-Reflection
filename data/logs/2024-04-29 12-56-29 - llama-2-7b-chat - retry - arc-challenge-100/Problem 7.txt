## Assistant 2:
  Thought: I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I need to reassess the problem.

The question states that the group of Canada geese left a Florida lake in the spring and arrived at a Maine lake 2,000 km away in 40 days. To determine how far the geese traveled on the first day, we need to divide the total distance traveled by the number of days it took them to travel that distance.

Action: Let's calculate the distance traveled by the geese on the first day.

2,000 km / 40 days = 50 km/day

So, the geese traveled 50 km on the first day.

Answer: C: 50 km
