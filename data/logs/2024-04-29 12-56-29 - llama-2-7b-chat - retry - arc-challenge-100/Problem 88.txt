## System:
You are an expert in Science.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: Michelle performed an investigation but the results did not match her hypothesis. What should Michelle do next?
Choices:
  A: perform the investigation in a different way
  B: change the hypothesis to match the results
  C: choose a different investigation
  D: repeat the investigation

Action: Answer("A")

Reflection:
As an expert in Science, I understand that when an investigation does not match the hypothesis, it is important to re-evaluate the methodology and approach used in the investigation. Performing the investigation in a different way can help identify any errors or limitations in the original methodology and provide new insights into the phenomenon being studied. By changing the hypothesis to match the results, Michelle may be able to refine her understanding of the phenomenon, but this approach may not provide a complete picture of the issue. Choosing a different investigation may also be a viable option, but it is important to ensure that the new investigation is well-designed and addresses the discrepancy between the hypothesis and results. Repeating the investigation without making any changes to the methodology may not provide a different outcome, and may not be the most efficient use of resources.
