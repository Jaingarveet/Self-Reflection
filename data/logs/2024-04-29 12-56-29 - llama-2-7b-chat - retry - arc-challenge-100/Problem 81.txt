  Topic: Science
Question: What precaution must be taken by students when making observations of the Sun?
Choices:
A: Use only new equipment.
B: Use a very strong telescope.
C: Project image onto a piece of cardboard.
D: Look at the Sun only in the morning.

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I realized that I overlooked an important precaution. Here is my reflection:

When making observations of the Sun, students must take the necessary precautions to avoid eye damage. The correct answer is (C) Project image onto a piece of cardboard. This is because looking directly at the Sun can cause serious eye damage, including solar retinopathy, which can lead to blindness. By projecting the image onto a piece of cardboard, students can safely observe the Sun without risking eye damage.

I hope this answer is correct, and I will make sure to take this precaution in any future observations of the Sun.
## Result:
Agent Answer: None
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
