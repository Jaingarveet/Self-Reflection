Question: Which of the following is an example of an escape strategy that is used to avoid being killed and eaten by predators?
Choices:
  A: Deer shed their antlers in the fall.
  B: Newts drop their tails when threatened.
  C: Anglerfish produce light to attract other fish.
  D: Otters produce oil to coat their fur and make it waterproof.

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I realize now that I misunderstood the question. I selected option A, which is incorrect. The correct answer is option B, Newts drop their tails when threatened.

Newts have a unique defense mechanism to avoid being eaten by predators. When they feel threatened, they drop their tails, which can continue to wriggle and distract the predator while the newt escapes. This is an excellent example of an escape strategy used by animals to avoid being killed and eaten by predators.

I apologize for my previous mistake and hope this reflection helps me provide the correct answer this time.
## Result:
