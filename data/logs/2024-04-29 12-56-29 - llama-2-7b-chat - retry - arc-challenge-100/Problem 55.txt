## System:
You are an expert in Science.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: Which statement best describes the motion of water molecules as the water changes state from steam to liquid?
Choices:
  A: The molecules move faster and occupy more space.
  B: The molecules move slower and occupy more space.
  C: The molecules move faster and occupy less space.
  D: The molecules move slower and occupy less space.

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand that my reasoning was flawed. I will use my self-reflection to help me answer this question correctly.

As the water changes state from steam to liquid, the motion of the water molecules slows down. This is because the molecules are moving slower and are more closely packed together as they transition from a gas to a liquid. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) The molecules move slower and occupy more space.
