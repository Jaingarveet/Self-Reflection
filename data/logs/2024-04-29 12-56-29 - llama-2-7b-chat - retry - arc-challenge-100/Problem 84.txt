## User 2:
Topic: Science
Question: Many fertilizers contain organic materials that are helpful to an orchard but have a different effect when rain causes them to run off into a freshwater ecosystem. How does the addition of organic waste from fertilizers most commonly affect freshwater ecosystems?
Choices:
  A: increasing biodiversity
  B: increasing water clarity
  C: decreasing algae blooms
  D: decreasing oxygen levels

Choices:
  A: increasing biodiversity
  B: increasing water clarity
  C: decreasing algae blooms
  D: decreasing oxygen levels

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly. My solution was [REDACTED]. The correct answer is [C: decreasing algae blooms].

Explanation:
Fertilizers contain organic materials that can run off into freshwater ecosystems during rainfall. These organic materials can lead to an increase in algae growth, which can cause a decrease in water clarity and oxygen levels. Therefore, the correct answer is [C: decreasing algae blooms].
## Result:
Agent Answer: None
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
