Question: A ship leaks a large amount of oil near a coastal area. Which statement describes how the oil most likely will affect the coastal habitat?
Choices:
  A: Fish reproduction rates will increase.
  B: Water birds will be unable to use their wings.
  C: Water plants will be exposed to more sunlight.
  D: Coastal plants will have access to more nutrients.

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand that my solution was not correct. I will use my self-reflection to help me answer this question correctly.

The correct answer is (D) Coastal plants will have access to more nutrients. When oil leaks into a coastal area, it can harm the plants and animals that live there. The oil can smother plants, preventing them from getting the oxygen and nutrients they need to survive. It can also harm the soil and water, reducing the amount of nutrients available to plants and animals. Therefore, the oil most likely will not affect the coastal habitat in any of the other choices.
