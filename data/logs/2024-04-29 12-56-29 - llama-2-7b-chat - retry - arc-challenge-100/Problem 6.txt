Choices:
  A: They have different dimensions.
  B: They have different boiling points.
  C: They are made up of a different type of matter.
  D: They contain a different amount of matter per unit volume.

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I realized that I overlooked the key aspect of the problem. The correct answer is (C) They are made up of a different type of matter. The two pieces of metal may have the same density, mass, and texture, but they can still be different elements or compounds, which means they have different chemical compositions and properties. Thank you for providing the opportunity to reflect on my mistake and improve my answer.
