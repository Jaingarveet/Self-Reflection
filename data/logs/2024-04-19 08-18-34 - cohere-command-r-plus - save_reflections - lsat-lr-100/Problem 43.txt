## Get Reflection:
Explanation: I misinterpreted the ethicist's argument and the assumptions being made. I focused on the control aspect, which is addressed in option B, but this is not the primary assumption the argument relies on. 

Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation
- Overlooking key details
- Logical error

Solution: The ethicist's argument centers around the logical interpretation of promises and vows. The key assumption is that promises should be interpreted in a way that makes sense and is reasonable. 

The ethicist argues that if "love" refers to feelings, the promise becomes illogical, as feelings are not within one's control. Therefore, the logical assumption being made is that: 
D: Promises should not be interpreted in a way that renders them meaningless or illogical. 

Instructions: 
1. Carefully read and understand the ethicist's argument and conclusion. 
2. Identify the key premise and the logical connection being made. 
3. Recognize that the argument revolves around the interpretation of promises, specifically avoiding illogical interpretations. 
4. Understand that option D directly addresses this interpretation aspect, while the other options only tangentially relate to the main point. 
5. Choose option D as the correct answer. 

Advice: 
- Focus on the central point of the argument and identify the key assumption being made. 
- Ensure you fully understand the context and implications of the argument before selecting an answer. 
- Avoid being misled by options that only partially address the argument or focus on secondary aspects. 
- Recognize that logical arguments often hinge on specific interpretations or definitions, so pay close attention to these nuances. 
- Always double-check your understanding of the argument and the assumptions being presented.
