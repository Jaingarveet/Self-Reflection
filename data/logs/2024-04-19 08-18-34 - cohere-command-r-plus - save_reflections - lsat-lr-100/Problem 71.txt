## Get Reflection:
Explanation: I misinterpreted the curator's statement about the museum store selling prints of some works not in the permanent collection. I focused on this detail and overlooked the key point that prints are available for all works in the permanent collection. 

Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation
- Oversight
- Detail-oriented error

Solution: 
The curator states that the museum store sells prints of all works in the permanent collection. This means that for every work displayed in the museum that is not on loan (i.e., part of the permanent collection), there is a print available in the store. Therefore, choice C is the correct answer. 

Instructions: 
1. Read the curator's statements carefully, especially the parts about the museum store and the permanent collection. 
2. Identify the key points: the museum store sells prints of all works in the permanent collection and some works not in the collection. 
3. Understand the implications: for all works displayed and not on loan (part of the permanent collection), there are prints available in the store. 
4. Choose the answer option that aligns with this understanding. 

Advice: 
 - Read and understand the context thoroughly. 
 - Pay attention to details but also grasp the overall structure of the argument. 
 - Consider all the information provided and avoid focusing on isolated details. 
 - Interpret the statements logically and infer the implications accurately. 
 - Always review your chosen answer to ensure it fully satisfies the conditions of the question.
