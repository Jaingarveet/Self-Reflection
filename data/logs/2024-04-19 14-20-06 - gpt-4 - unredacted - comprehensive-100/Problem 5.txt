Explanation:
I made a mistake in solving the equation. I incorrectly calculated the value of n, which represents the number of members in the club. 
Error Keywords:
- Calculation error
- Algebraic error
- Solving equations
Solution:
The sum of an arithmetic series is given by the formula: n/2 * (2a + (n-1)d), where n is the number of terms, a is the first term, and d is the common difference.
We can set up the equation: 250 = n/2 * (2*7 + (n-1)*0.25) and solve for n.
Solving this equation gives n = 25.
Instructions:
1. Understand the problem and identify the given values.
2. Write down the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: n/2 * (2a + (n-1)d).
3. Substitute the given values into the formula.
4. Solve the equation for n, which represents the number of members in the club.
5. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
6. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
- Always read the question carefully and understand what is being asked.
- Be careful when solving equations, and double-check your calculations.
- Remember the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series and how to apply it.
- Practice solving similar problems to improve your skills and accuracy.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The sum of an arithmetic series is given by the formula: n/2 * (2a + (n-1)d), where n is the number of terms, a is the first term, and d is the common difference.
Given that the youngest member is 7 years old (which is the first term 'a'), the common difference 'd' is 0.25 years (3 months), and the sum of the ages 'S' is 250 years, we can substitute these values into the formula and solve for 'n' (the number of members).
So, 250 = n/2 * (2*7 + (n-1)*0.25)
Solving this equation gives n = 25.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
