## Assistant 2:
  Topic: Medicine
Subtopic: Gynaecology & Obstetrics
Question: Which of the drug is not commonly used in PPH?
Choices:
A: Mifepristone
B: Misoprostol
C: Oxytocin
D: Ergotamine

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I reflected on the problem, my solution, and the correct answer. Here is my reflection:

I mistakenly selected option D, Ergotamine, as a drug commonly used in PPH. However, upon further review, I realized that Ergotamine is not commonly used in postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) management. Ergotamine is actually a medication used to treat migraines and other vascular headaches, and it has no role in PPH management.

Therefore, the correct answer is option C, Oxytocin. Oxytocin is a hormone that plays a crucial role in PPH management, as it helps to stimulate uterine contractions to control bleeding after childbirth. Mifepristone, Misoprostol, and Ergotamine are not commonly used in PPH management.

Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
