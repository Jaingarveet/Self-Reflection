Question: Major complication of cyst-gastrostomy for pseudo pancreatic cyst is?

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand the importance of accurately identifying the complications of a surgical procedure.

The surgical procedure being discussed is cyst-gastrostomy, which involves creating a new opening in the stomach to drain a pseudo pancreatic cyst. The major complications of this procedure are:

1. Infection: Bacterial infection can occur in the incision site or within the abdominal cavity, leading to sepsis and organ failure.
2. Obstruction: The cyst-gastrostomy can become blocked by scar tissue or debris, preventing the drainage of the cyst and causing abdominal pain and distension.
3. Fistula: An abnormal connection between two organs or between an organ and the skin can occur, leading to leakage of fluid or gas and potentially life-threatening complications.
4. Hemorrhage: Bleeding can occur during or after the procedure, leading to hypovolemic shock and potentially life-threatening complications.

Based on the information provided, the correct answer is (B) Obstruction.

Double-check:
I have carefully reviewed the information provided, and I am confident in my answer. The correct answer is (B) Obstruction.
## Result:
Agent Answer: None
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
