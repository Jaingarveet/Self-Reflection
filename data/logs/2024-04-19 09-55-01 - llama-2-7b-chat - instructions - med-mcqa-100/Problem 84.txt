# Model: llama-2-7b-chat | Agent: instructions | Exam: med-mcqa-100 | Problem 84 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Medicine.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: Which of the trabecular meshwork and effect the aqueous outflow
Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand that I need to identify the structure in the eye that regulates aqueous outflow, list the drugs that increase aqueous outflow through the trabecular meshwork, list the drugs that decrease aqueous outflow through the trabecular meshwork, explain the mechanism by which each drug affects aqueous outflow through the trabecular meshwork, and double-check my answers to ensure accuracy.

Identify the structure in the eye that regulates aqueous outflow: The structure in the eye that regulates aqueous outflow is the trabecular meshwork.

List the drugs that increase aqueous outflow through the trabecular meshwork:

* Timolol
* Pilocarpine

List the drugs that decrease aqueous outflow through the trabecular meshwork:

* Brimonidine
* Brinzolamide

Explain the mechanism by which each drug affects aqueous outflow through the trabecular meshwork:

* Timolol: Timolol decreases aqueous outflow through the trabecular meshwork by blocking the beta-adrenergic receptors in the iris sphincter, which results in relaxation of the sphincter and an increase in aqueous outflow.
* Pilocarpine: Pilocarpine increases aqueous outflow through the trabecular meshwork by stimulating the beta-adrenergic receptors in the iris sphincter, which results in contraction of the sphincter and an increase in aqueous outflow.
* Brimonidine: Brimonidine decreases aqueous outflow through the trabecular meshwork by blocking the alpha-adrenergic receptors in the iris sphincter, which results in relaxation of the sphincter and a decrease in aqueous outflow.
* Brinzolamide: Brinzolamide decreases aqueous outflow through the trabecular meshwork by reducing the permeability of the meshwork, which results in a decrease in aqueous outflow.

Double-check my answers:

* The structure in the eye that regulates aqueous outflow is the trabecular meshwork.
* The drugs that increase aqueous outflow through the trabecular meshwork are Timolol and Pilocarpine.
* The drugs that decrease aqueous outflow through the trabecular meshwork are Brimonidine and Brinzolamide.
* Timolol decreases aqueous outflow through the trabecular meshwork by blocking the beta-adrenergic receptors in the iris sphincter, which results in relaxation of the sphincter and an increase in aqueous outflow.
* Pilocarpine increases aqueous outflow through the trabecular meshwork by stimulating the beta-adrenergic receptors in the iris sphincter, which results in contraction of the sphincter and an increase in aqueous outflow.
* Brimonidine decreases aqueous outflow through the trabecular meshwork by blocking the alpha-adrenergic receptors in the iris sphincter, which results in relaxation of the sphincter and a decrease in aqueous outflow.
* Brinzolamide decreases aqueous outflow through the trabecular meshwork by reducing the permeability of the meshwork, which results in a decrease in aqueous outflow.
## Result:
Agent Answer: None
Correct Answer: B
