Question: Not raised in liver disorder is/are:
Choices:
  A: Lipase
  B: ALP
  C: AST
  D: ALT
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:

1. Identify the enzymes produced and secreted by the liver.
2. Determine which enzymes are not produced in liver disorders.
3. Use your knowledge of biochemistry to eliminate incorrect options.
4. Double-check your answer to ensure accuracy.
## Assistant 2:
  Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand that I need to identify the enzymes produced and secreted by the liver, determine which enzymes are not produced in liver disorders, and use my knowledge of biochemistry to eliminate incorrect options.

Enzymes produced and secreted by the liver:

* Lipase
* ALP (Alanine Aminotransferase)
* AST (Aspartate Aminotransferase)
* ALT (Alanine Transaminase)

Enzymes not produced in liver disorders:

* AST (Aspartate Aminotransferase)

Reasoning:
Liver disorders can affect the production and secretion of enzymes by the liver. For example, liver cirrhosis can lead to decreased production of AST and ALT. Therefore, option B (ALP) is the correct answer, as it is not affected by liver disorders.

Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
