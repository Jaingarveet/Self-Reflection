Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:

1. Identify the veins that drain into the inferior vena cava.
2. Label the tributary veins of the inferior vena cava.
3. Recall the correct anatomy of the inferior vena cava and its tributary veins.
4. Double-check your work to ensure accuracy.
5. Choose the answer that matches your understanding of the correct vein that drains directly into the inferior vena cava.
## Assistant 2:
  Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand that the correct answer is (B) Inferior mesenteric vein.

To arrive at this answer, I will follow the tributary veins of the inferior vena cava:

1. Identify the veins that drain into the inferior vena cava:
	* Superior vena cava
	* Inferior vena cava
2. Label the tributary veins of the inferior vena cava:
	* Inferior mesenteric vein
	* Common iliac vein
	* External iliac vein
	* Common femoral vein
	* External femoral vein
3. Recall the correct anatomy of the inferior vena cava and its tributary veins:
	* The inferior vena cava is a large vein that drains blood from the lower extremities and pelvis
	* It receives blood from the inferior mesenteric vein, which drains the intestines, kidneys, and other organs in the pelvis
	* The inferior vena cava also receives blood from the common iliac vein, which drains the lower abdomen and pelvis
	* The inferior vena cava empties into the right atrium of the heart
4. Double-check my work to ensure accuracy:
	* I have correctly identified the tributary veins of the inferior vena cava
	* I have correctly identified the correct answer as (B) Inferior mesenteric vein

Therefore, the answer to the question is (B) Inferior mesenteric vein.
