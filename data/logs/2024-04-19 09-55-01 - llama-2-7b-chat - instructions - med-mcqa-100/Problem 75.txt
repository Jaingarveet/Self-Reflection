Question: Trends can be represented by-

Reflection:
In this question, I previously answered that the trend can be represented by a bar chart. However, upon further reflection, I realize that the correct answer is a line diagram.

Type of data: Time series data

Trend or pattern: Stability

Graphical representation: Line diagram

Explanation:
Time series data is a type of data that is collected over time, and it is used to represent the stability or trend of a particular phenomenon. In this case, the data represents the number of patients visiting a clinic over a specific period. To represent the stability of this data, a line diagram is the most appropriate graphical representation. A line diagram is a graph that shows the trend or pattern of a variable over time, and it is used to visualize the stability of the data.

In a line diagram, the data is represented by a continuous line that shows the trend of the variable over time. The line can be smooth or jagged, depending on the nature of the data. By examining the line diagram, it is easy to identify any changes or trends in the data, such as an increase or decrease in the number of patients visiting the clinic.

In conclusion, the trend can be represented by a line diagram, and it is the most appropriate graphical representation for time series data that shows stability.
