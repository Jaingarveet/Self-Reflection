Question: Treatment for post-radiation skin lesion like desquamation: March 2013 (e)

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand now that the correct answer is (C) Surgery.

To arrive at this answer, I will decompose the question into smaller sub-problems:

1. What is the treatment for post-radiation skin lesions?
2. What is desquamation?
3. What is the treatment for desquamation?

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Treatment for post-radiation skin lesions:
Post-radiation skin lesions can be treated with surgery, topical therapy, or observation.
2. Desquamation:
Desquamation is a type of skin reaction that occurs after radiation therapy, characterized by the shedding of the outer layers of the skin.
3. Treatment for desquamation:
The treatment for desquamation is surgery.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) Surgery.
