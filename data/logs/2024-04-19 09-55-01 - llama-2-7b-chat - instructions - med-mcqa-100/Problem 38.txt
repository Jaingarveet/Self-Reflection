  Thought: I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I need to reflect on my thought process to improve my answer.

Action: I will review the question and my previous answer to identify where I went wrong.

Reflection: I mistakenly selected option A, "Rectocele," as the correct answer. Upon reviewing the question, I realized that the correct answer is option C, "Posterior urethral valve."
