Question: Expanisle type osseous metastases are characteristic of primary malignancy of:

Reflection:

Initial Answer:
I previously answered this question as C: Breast. However, upon further reflection, I realize that this answer is incorrect. Expanisle type osseous metastases are actually characteristic of primary malignancy of:

Correct Answer: D: Prostate

Explanation:

Expanisle type osseous metastases are a type of bone metastasis that occurs in the spine, pelvis, or long bones. They are typically seen in patients with advanced cancer, particularly prostate cancer. The characteristic "expanse" shape of these metastases is due to the irregular growth of cancer cells in the bone, which can cause destruction of the normal bone architecture.

In contrast, breast cancer typically metastasizes to the bones in a more diffuse and widespread manner, leading to a different pattern of bone involvement. Therefore, the presence of expanse type osseous metastases is more consistent with a primary malignancy of prostate origin.

I apologize for my initial mistake and hope this corrected answer is helpful.
