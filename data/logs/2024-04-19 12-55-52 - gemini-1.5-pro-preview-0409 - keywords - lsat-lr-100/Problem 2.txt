## Assistant 2:
## Reflection on Previous Error:
**Error Analysis:**
My previous answer to this question was incorrect because I misinterpreted the relationship between the statements. I focused on the fact that prize-winning films at Lac Nichoutec also won at international festivals, but I failed to consider the scope and direction of this relationship. 
**Understanding the Correct Answer:**
The correct answer should be a statement that is **necessarily true** given the premises. It should not introduce new information or make assumptions beyond what is stated.
**Key Takeaways:**
* **Focus on the direction of the relationship:** The context states that Lac Nichoutec winners **also** won at international festivals, not the other way around.
* **Consider the scope:** The statement refers to **most** prize-winning films, not all. This leaves room for exceptions.
* **Avoid assumptions:**  Don't assume information that is not explicitly stated.
## Answering the Question:
Let's analyze each option based on the above understanding:
* **A:** This reverses the direction of the relationship. We don't know if international festival winners were shown at Lac Nichoutec.
* **B:** This introduces new information about the proportion of Canadian films shown at Lac Nichoutec. We only know about prize-winning films.
* **C:** This aligns with the given information. If Lac Nichoutec winners (which are Canadian films) also won at international festivals, then some international winners must be Canadian. 
* **D:** This is possible but not necessarily true. The statement allows for the possibility that all Lac Nichoutec winners were also shown internationally.
* **E:** This introduces information about films not shown at Lac Nichoutec, which is beyond the scope of the context.
Therefore, the only statement that must be true is that some international prize-winning films were Canadian.
**Action: Answer("C")**
