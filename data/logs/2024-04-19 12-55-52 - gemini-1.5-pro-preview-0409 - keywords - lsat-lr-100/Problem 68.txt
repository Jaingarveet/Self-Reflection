Topic: Law
Context: City dog licensing records show that more cocker spaniels are registered to addresses in the Flynn Heights neighborhood than to addresses in all other neighborhoods combined. So if an animal control officer finds a stray cocker spaniel anywhere near Flynn Heights, it is likely that the dog belongs to someone in Flynn Heights.
Question: Which one of the following would be most useful to know in order to evaluate the argument?
Choices:
  A: whether cocker spaniels are more likely than dogs of other breeds to stray from their owners
  B: whether there are more cocker spaniels registered to addresses in Flynn Heights than any other breed of dog
  C: whether the city's animal control officers find more stray dogs in and around Flynn Heights than in any other part of the city
  D: whether the number of pets owned, per capita, is greater for residents of Flynn Heights than for residents of any other neighborhood
  E: whether residents of Flynn Heights are more likely to license their dogs than residents of other neighborhoods are

## Assistant 2:
## Reflection on Previous Error:
My previous answer to this question was incorrect because I focused on the popularity of cocker spaniels in Flynn Heights rather than the likelihood of the stray dog belonging to someone in that specific neighborhood.  The key to evaluating the argument is determining if the stray cocker spaniel is more likely to be from Flynn Heights compared to other areas. 
## Analysis of Choices:
*   **A:** While interesting, this doesn't directly address the likelihood of the stray dog being from Flynn Heights.
*   **B:** This reinforces the popularity of cocker spaniels in Flynn Heights but doesn't compare the likelihood of the stray coming from there versus another area.
*   **C:** This is the most relevant choice.  If more stray dogs are found in Flynn Heights, it weakens the argument that a stray cocker spaniel found nearby is likely from that neighborhood. 
*   **D & E:** These options don't provide information about the specific situation of the stray cocker spaniel.
