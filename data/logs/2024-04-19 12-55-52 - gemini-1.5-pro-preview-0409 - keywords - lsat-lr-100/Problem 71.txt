Context: Curator: Our museum displays only twentieth-century works, which are either on loan from private collectors or in the museum's permanent collection. Prints of all of the latter works are available in the museum store. The museum store also sells prints of some works that are not part of the museum's permanent collection, such as Hopper's Nighthawks.

  C: There are prints in the museum store of every work that is displayed in the museum and not on loan from a private collector.

## Reflection on Previous Error:
**Error Analysis:**
My previous attempt likely failed due to misinterpreting the curator's statement regarding the prints sold in the museum store.  I may have incorrectly assumed that all prints sold were of works displayed in the museum, leading to an inaccurate conclusion.
**Understanding the Problem:**
The key is to carefully analyze the curator's statements and identify the relationship between the museum's exhibits, its permanent collection, and the prints available in the store. We need to find a statement that MUST be true based on the given information, avoiding assumptions or extrapolations.
**Key Points:**
*   The museum displays only 20th-century works.
*   These works are either on loan or part of the permanent collection.
*   Prints of ALL works in the permanent collection are available in the store.
*   The store also sells prints of SOME works NOT in the permanent collection (e.g., Hopper's Nighthawks).
**Solution Approach:**
Let's analyze each option based on the key points:
*   A: This is not necessarily true. The store sells prints of works NOT in the collection (e.g., Nighthawks).
*   B: This MUST be true. The museum only displays 20th-century works, and all prints are derived from displayed works.
*   C: This is not necessarily true. The store may not have prints of all displayed works, only those in the permanent collection.
*   D: This is not necessarily true. Nighthawks is NOT part of the permanent collection, and its loan status is unknown.
*   E: This is not necessarily true. Nighthawks could be on display as a loaned work.
Therefore, the only statement that MUST be true is that all prints sold are copies of 20th-century works.
