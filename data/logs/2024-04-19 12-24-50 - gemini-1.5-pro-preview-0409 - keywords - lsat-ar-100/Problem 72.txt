## Reflection on Previous Error:
While I don't have access to the specific details of my previous error, I can analyze the problem and potential pitfalls to arrive at the correct answer.
**Key Points and Constraints:**
*  7 spaces in a row (1-7)
*  7 businesses: Optometrist (O), Pharmacy (P), 2 Restaurants (R1, R2), Shoe store (S), Toy store (T), Veterinarian (V)
*  Pharmacy at one end, Restaurant at the other.
*  2 Restaurants separated by at least 2 businesses.
*  Pharmacy next to Optometrist or Veterinarian.
*  Toy store not next to Veterinarian.
*  **New Constraint:** Optometrist next to Shoe store (OS)
**Potential Error Sources:**
* **Overlooking a constraint:**  It's crucial to consider all constraints simultaneously. 
* **Incorrect placement of restaurants:**  Their positioning significantly limits other placements.
* **Misinterpreting "next to":**  It implies immediate adjacency, not just proximity.
**Deductions:**
1. **OS pair placement:** Since P is at one end, and R at the other, and they need 2 businesses between them, the OS pair must be in the middle 3 spaces (either 34, 45, or 56).
2. **Pharmacy placement:** P must be next to O or V. Since O is with S, P must be next to V. This leaves only one possible arrangement: **PVR1OSR2**.
3. **Businesses next to OS:**  Therefore, the businesses immediately next to the OS pair are **R1 and R2**.
**Action: Answer("C")**
