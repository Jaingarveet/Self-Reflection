Context: An administrator must assign parking spaces to six new employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young. Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
Question: For how many of the six new employees is the assignment of a parking space limited to one of only two possible spaces?
Choices:
  A: none
  B: two
  C: three

## Reflection on Previous Error:
While I don't have access to the specific details of my previous error, I can analyze the problem and potential pitfalls to ensure a correct answer this time. 
**Possible Errors and Solutions:**
* **Misinterpreting the constraints:** The problem has several layered constraints. It's crucial to consider all of them simultaneously and not miss any. I will carefully analyze each rule and its implications before reaching a conclusion.
* **Overlooking indirect implications:**  Some rules might indirectly restrict parking space options for certain employees. For example, if Robertson must be in spaces #1-#4 and above Young, it limits Young's options as well. I will pay close attention to such indirect consequences.
* **Calculation errors:**  Keeping track of the possibilities for each employee can be tricky. I will use a systematic approach, possibly a table or diagram, to visualize the options and avoid miscalculations.
**Improved Approach:**
1. **Analyze each rule and its direct implications.**
2. **Identify indirect limitations based on the combined rules.**
3. **Systematically list the possible parking spaces for each employee.**
4. **Count the employees with only two possible parking space options.**
By following this structured approach and learning from my previous mistakes, I am confident I can arrive at the correct answer.
