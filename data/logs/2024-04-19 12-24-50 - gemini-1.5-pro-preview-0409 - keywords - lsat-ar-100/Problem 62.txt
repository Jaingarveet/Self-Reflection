Topic: Law
Context: A government needs to assign new ambassadors to Venezuela, Yemen, and Zambia. The candidates for these ambassadorships are Jaramillo, Kayne, Landon, Novetzke, and Ong. One ambassador will be assigned to each country, and no ambassador will be assigned to more than one country. The assignment of the ambassadors must meet the following constraints: Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships. If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne. If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen. If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
Question: If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Jaramillo is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela.
  B: Landon is assigned as ambassador to Zambia.
  C: Ong is assigned as ambassador to Zambia.
  D: Jaramillo is not assigned to an ambassadorship.
  E: Ong is not assigned to an ambassadorship.

## Reflection on Previous Error:
**Error Analysis:**
My previous attempt at this question was incorrect due to a misinterpretation of the constraint "If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen." I incorrectly assumed this implied a biconditional relationship, meaning Kayne being assigned to Yemen would necessitate Ong *not* being assigned to Venezuela. However, the constraint only works one way.
**Understanding the Constraints:**
*   Either Kayne or Novetzke gets an ambassadorship, but not both.
*   Jaramillo having an ambassadorship necessitates Kayne also having one.
*   Ong being ambassador to Venezuela prevents Kayne from being ambassador to Yemen (but not the other way around).
*   Landon can only be ambassador to Zambia.
**Corrected Approach:**
Given Kayne is assigned to Yemen, we need to analyze which option **must** be true:
*   **A: Jaramillo to Venezuela:** Not necessarily true. Kayne being in Yemen doesn't dictate Jaramillo's placement.
*   **B: Landon to Zambia:** Not necessarily true. Kayne's position doesn't force Landon's placement.
*   **C: Ong to Zambia:** Not necessarily true. Ong could be in Venezuela or not have an ambassadorship at all.
*   **D: Jaramillo not assigned:** This is **not necessarily true**. The constraint states that if Jaramillo IS assigned, Kayne must also be assigned. However, Kayne being assigned doesn't require Jaramillo to be assigned.
*   **E: Ong not assigned:** This is also **not necessarily true**. Ong could be assigned to Venezuela or Zambia.
Therefore, none of the options **must** be true when Kayne is assigned to Yemen. 
However, since I must choose an answer, the option that is most likely to be true based on the constraints is **D: Jaramillo is not assigned to an ambassadorship.** This is because if Jaramillo were assigned, Kayne would also have to be assigned, and we already know Kayne is assigned to Yemen.
