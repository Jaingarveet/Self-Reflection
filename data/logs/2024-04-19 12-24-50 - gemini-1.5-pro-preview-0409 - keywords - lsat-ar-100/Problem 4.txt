Context: A chemistry class has six lab sessions scheduled over three days—Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday—one session heing held each morning and one each afternoon. Each session will be led by a different lab assistant—Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, or Rebecca. The assignment of lab assistants to sessions is constrained as follows: Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day. Nessa must lead an afternoon session. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
Question: If Lan does not lead a Wednesday session, then which one of the following lab assistants must lead a Thursday session?
Choices:
  A: Rebecca
  B: Olivia
  C: Nessa

## Assistant 2:
## Reflection on Previous Error:
While I don't have access to the specific details of my previous error and the [REDACTED] information, I can still analyze the problem structure and apply general problem-solving strategies to arrive at the correct answer.
**Key Points to Consider:**
* **Constraints:**  The problem provides specific limitations on scheduling for each lab assistant. These are crucial to consider when eliminating possibilities.
* **Deductive Reasoning:** We need to use the given information and constraints to deduce the schedule step-by-step.
* **Impact of Lan's Wednesday Absence:**  Since Lan isn't leading a Wednesday session, this opens up possibilities for other assistants and might create a chain reaction affecting the remaining schedule.
**Approach:**
1. **Analyze Constraints:** List down each constraint and its implications for the schedule.
2. **Eliminate Possibilities:** Based on Lan not being on Wednesday, eliminate options for other assistants based on their constraints.
3. **Deduce Remaining Schedule:**  Use the process of elimination and remaining constraints to determine who MUST lead a Thursday session. 
**Applying this approach should lead to the correct answer.**
