## Reflection on Previous Error:
While I don't have access to the specific details of my previous error ([REDACTED]), I can analyze the problem and potential pitfalls to arrive at the correct answer.
**Key Points and Potential Errors:**
* **Minimum Selection:** The question asks for the minimum guaranteed selection, not the maximum or a specific combination.
* **Constraints:** We need to consider all the given constraints to ensure the minimum selection fulfills all requirements.
* **French Novels vs. Russian Novels:** The condition "at least as many French novels as Russian novels" is crucial. 
* **Plays:** The condition regarding plays might influence the novel selection indirectly.
**Approach:**
1. **French Novels:**  Since there must be at least as many French novels as Russian novels, and the minimum number of novels is three, we must select **at least one French novel**.
2. **Russian Novels:**  To satisfy the minimum novel requirement (3) and maintain the French novel condition, we need **at least one Russian novel**.
3. **Plays:**  The information about plays doesn't directly impact the minimum novel selection.
Therefore, the organizer must at least select one French novel and one Russian novel.
