## Reflection on Previous Error:
**Error Analysis:**
My previous attempt likely failed due to a misinterpretation of the constraints or an error in deduction based on the given conditions. It's crucial to carefully analyze each condition and their implications on the possible schedules.
**Key Learnings:**
* **Break down the problem:**  Analyze each condition separately and then combine them to deduce the possible scenarios.
* **Consider all constraints:** Ensure every condition is satisfied in the proposed solution.
* **Eliminate possibilities:** Use the conditions to eliminate options that lead to contradictions.
**Applying Learnings to the Current Problem:**
1. **Franco and Hong testify on the same day:** This leaves Tuesday or Wednesday as possibilities since Hong cannot be on Monday.
2. **Iturbe testifies on Wednesday:** This means Franco and Hong cannot be on Wednesday as only one other witness can be there.
3. **Therefore, Franco and Hong must be on Tuesday:** This satisfies the condition of exactly two witnesses on Tuesday.
4. **Garcia cannot be on Tuesday:** Due to the constraint with Franco.
5. **At least one witness on Monday:** This must be Garcia as all others are accounted for.
**Conclusion:**
Based on the analysis, Garcia must be scheduled to testify on Monday.
