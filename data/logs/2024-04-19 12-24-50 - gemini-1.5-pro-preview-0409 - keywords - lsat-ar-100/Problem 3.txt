## System:
You are an expert in Law.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## User 2:
Topic: Law
Context: An administrator must assign parking spaces to six new employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young. Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
Question: If Robertson is assigned parking space #3, then which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Souza is assigned parking space #4.
  B: Togowa is assigned parking space #2.
  C: Vaughn is assigned parking space #5.
  D: Xu is assigned parking space #6.
  E: Young is assigned parking space #2.

## Assistant 2:
## Reflection on Previous Error:
While I don't have access to the specifics of my previous error ([REDACTED]), I can generally analyze potential pitfalls in this type of logic puzzle:
* **Misinterpreting Rules:**  The complexity arises from the interlinked rules.  It's crucial to consider all rules simultaneously, not in isolation. For instance, focusing solely on "Robertson > Young" without considering "Young > Togowa" could lead to an error.
* **Overlooking Possibilities:**  Jumping to conclusions based on limited information is another pitfall.  The question asks for what **must** be true, not what *could* be true.  So, exploring all valid arrangements is necessary before determining the definitive outcome.
* **Calculation Errors:**  Simple mistakes in ordering or comparing numbers can occur, especially when dealing with multiple constraints.
## Answering the Current Question:
Given Robertson is assigned parking space #3:
1. **Robertson > Young:**  This means Young must be in #1 or #2.
2. **Young > Togowa:**  Therefore, Togowa must be in #1 (if Young is in #2) or cannot be placed (if Young is in #1).
3. **Xu > Souza:**  We don't have enough information to place Xu or Souza definitively yet.
**Analysis of Choices:**
* **A: Souza in #4:**  This is possible but not guaranteed. Xu could be in #4, pushing Souza to #1 or #2.
* **B: Togowa in #2:**  This is impossible as it violates "Young > Togowa".
* **C: Vaughn in #5:**  We have no information restricting Vaughn's placement, so this is not necessarily true.
* **D: Xu in #6:**  This is possible but not guaranteed.  Xu could be in #4 or #5 depending on Souza's placement.
* **E: Young in #2:**  This **must** be true based on the given constraints.
Therefore, the correct answer is: **Action: Answer("E")**
