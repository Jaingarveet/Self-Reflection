Context: A software company employs exactly seven sales representatives—Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall—to work in its three sales zones—Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3. Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Question: Quinn CANNOT work in the same sales zone as which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: Kim
  B: Mahr

## Assistant 2:
## Reflection on Previous Error:
My previous error likely stemmed from misinterpreting the constraints related to Tiao and Udall's placements and their impact on Quinn's possible zone.  I need to carefully analyze each clue to ensure accurate placement deductions.
## Step-by-Step Deductions:
1. **Parra/Tiao and Tiao/Udall Rules:**  These are exclusive OR conditions. So, either Parra OR Tiao is in Zone 1, and either Tiao OR Udall is in Zone 2. This means Tiao cannot be with Udall, and if Tiao is in Zone 1, then Udall MUST be in Zone 2.
2. **Parra and Quinn together:** This means wherever Parra is placed, Quinn must also be there.
3. **Stuckey and Udall together:** This links their placements.
4. **Zone 3 has more people:** This means at least 3 people must be in Zone 3.
## Analysis:
* **If Tiao is in Zone 1:** Then Udall is in Zone 2 with Stuckey. This leaves Parra and Quinn to also be in Zone 2 OR both be in Zone 3 with one remaining person (Kim or Mahr).
* **If Parra is in Zone 1:** Then Tiao MUST be in Zone 2 with Udall and Stuckey. This leaves Zone 3 with only Quinn and one remaining person, violating the "more people in Zone 3" rule. 
Therefore, Parra CANNOT be in Zone 1, meaning **Parra and Quinn must be in Zone 3**. This leaves Tiao in Zone 1 and Udall/Stuckey in Zone 2.
## Conclusion:
Quinn cannot be with **Stuckey** because their placements are fixed in different zones based on the given conditions.
