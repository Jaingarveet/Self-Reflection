Context: A shopping center has exactly seven spaces—space 1 through space 7—arranged in a straight row. Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
Question: Which one of the following, if substituted for the constraint that the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, would have the same effect in determining the locations of the businesses?
Choices:
  A: A restaurant must be in either space 3, space 4, or space 5.
  B: A restaurant must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  C: Either the toy store or the veterinarian must be somewhere between the two restaurants.
  D: No more than two businesses can separate the pharmacy and the restaurant nearest it.
  E: The optometrist cannot be next to the shoe store.

## Reflection on Previous Error:
While I don't have access to the specific details of my previous error, I can analyze the problem and choices to ensure a correct response this time.
**Key Points to Consider:**
* **Original Constraint:** The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. This means there must be a minimum of 3 spaces between them, effectively dividing the row into two sections.
* **Goal:** Find an option that creates the same division, restricting the restaurants to opposite ends of the row.
**Analysis of Choices:**
* **A:** This restricts one restaurant to the center spaces but doesn't necessarily place the other at the opposite end. 
* **B:** This doesn't guarantee the separation of restaurants, as both could be next to the optometrist or veterinarian.
* **C:** This ensures separation but doesn't force the restaurants to be at opposite ends. They could be separated by the toy store or veterinarian in the middle spaces.
* **D:** This limits the distance between the pharmacy and the nearest restaurant but doesn't affect the placement of the other restaurant.
* **E:** This is irrelevant to the placement of the restaurants.
**Conclusion:**
The option that creates the same division as the original constraint is **C**. By placing either the toy store or the veterinarian between the restaurants, it forces them to occupy opposite ends of the row, fulfilling the original constraint's purpose.
**Action: Answer("C")**
