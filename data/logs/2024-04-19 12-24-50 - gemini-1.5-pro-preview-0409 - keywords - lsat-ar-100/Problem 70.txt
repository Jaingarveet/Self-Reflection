Topic: Law
Context: A maintenance company that takes service requests from three clients—Image, Solide, and Truvest—plans to set targets for its average service response times. Service targets will be set at 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day. Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail. The six targets are set according to the following conditions: None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
Question: If Solide's voicemail target is shorter than Truvest's website target, which one of the following targets could be 2 days?
Choices:
  A: Image's website target
  B: Image's voicemail target
  C: Solide's website target
  D: Truvest's voicemail target
  E: Truvest's website target

## Reflection on Previous Error:
**Error Analysis:**
My previous attempt likely failed due to a misunderstanding of the constraints and relationships between the different service targets. I may have incorrectly interpreted the conditions or made an error in logical reasoning when applying them to the given scenario.
**Key Learnings:**
* **Carefully analyze each constraint:** Each condition provides crucial information about the relative lengths of the service targets. I need to ensure I understand the implications of each condition before drawing conclusions.
* **Visualize the relationships:** Creating a diagram or table to represent the relationships between the targets could help in visualizing the problem and identifying potential solutions.
* **Consider all possibilities:**  I should explore different scenarios and eliminate options that violate the given conditions.
**Applying Learnings to the Current Problem:**
1. **Analyze Constraints:**
    * No website target is longer than its corresponding voicemail target.
    * Image's voicemail target is the shortest among all voicemail targets.
    * Solide's website target is shorter than Truvest's website target.
    * Solide's voicemail target is shorter than Truvest's website target (from the question).
2. **Reasoning:**
    * Since Solide's voicemail target is shorter than Truvest's website target, and no website target can be longer than its voicemail target, then **Truvest's website target cannot be 2 days**. 
    * Similarly, **Solide's website target cannot be 2 days** as it needs to be shorter than Truvest's website target.
    * **Image's voicemail target cannot be 2 days** because it has to be the shortest voicemail target.
    * This leaves us with **Image's website target and Solide's voicemail target** as potential options for a 2-day target.
3. **Choosing the Correct Option:**
    * We know that Solide's voicemail target is shorter than Truvest's website target. If Solide's voicemail target were 2 days, then Truvest's website target would have to be 3 days. This would leave only 1 day for Solide's website target, violating the condition that Solide's website target is shorter than Truvest's website target.
    * Therefore, the only remaining possibility is **Image's website target**.
