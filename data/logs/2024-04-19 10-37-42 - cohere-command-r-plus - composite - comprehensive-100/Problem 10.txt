Explanation:
Error Keywords:
- Arithmetic error
- Division error
- Calculation error

Solution:
The total amount to be distributed is Rs. 8600, and there are 11 family members in total: 5 sons + 4 daughters + 2 nephews = 11. 

Step 1: Calculate the number of family members: 
Total family members = 5 + 4 + 2 = 11. 

Step 2: Find the share for each nephew: 
Nephew's share = Total amount / Total family members = Rs. 8600 / 11 = Rs. 781.82 (rounded to two decimal places). 

Step 3: Calculate the share for each daughter, which is four times the nephew's share: 
Daughter's share = 4 * Nephew's share = 4 * Rs. 781.82 = Rs. 3127.28. 

Step 4: Check the answer options: 
Option [REDACTED] offers the closest rounded value to our calculated result, so the final answer is [REDACTED]. 

Instructions:
- Calculate the total number of family members. 
- Find the share for each nephew by dividing the total amount by the total number of family members. 
- Calculate the share for each daughter, which is four times the nephew's share. 
- Check the answer options for the closest match to your calculated result. 

Advice:
- Always double-check your calculations, especially when dividing amounts. 
- Pay attention to the relationships between the amounts received by different family members. 
- Ensure you understand the question's context and relationships before beginning calculations. 
- Rounding values can help simplify calculations, but be mindful of significant figures and potential rounding errors.

Thought: 
The total amount of money to be divided is Rs. 8600, and there are 11 family members in total: 5 sons, 4 daughters, and 2 nephews. 

First, we calculate the share for each nephew. There are 11 family members, so each nephew's share is Rs. 8600/11 = Rs. 781.82 (rounded to two decimal places). 

Next, we find the share for each daughter, which is four times the nephew's share: 4 * Rs. 781.82 = Rs. 3127.28. 

Finally, we round this amount to the nearest hundred, and the result is Rs. 3100, which is closest to the option:
