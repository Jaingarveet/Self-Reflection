Error Keywords:
- Treatment selection error
- Acne treatment error
- [REDACTED] error

Solution: Comedonal acne is a form of acne characterized by the presence of comedones (blackheads and whiteheads). [REDACTED] are the first-line treatment for this type of acne. While benzoyl peroxide is a valid treatment option for inflammatory acne, retinoids are preferred for comedonal acne due to their ability to normalize skin cell turnover and prevent the formation of comedones. 

Solution:
Instructions:
1. Identify the type of acne mentioned in the question (comedonal acne).
2. Recall the standard first-line treatment for this specific type of acne (retinoids). 
3. Recognize that while benzoyl peroxide is effective for inflammatory acne, it is not the primary treatment for comedonal acne. 
4. Choose the answer option that reflects the correct first-line treatment (retinoids). 

Advice:
- Familiarize yourself with the standard first-line treatments for common dermatological conditions, such as acne. 
- Understand the mechanisms of action and specific indications for different acne treatments, including retinoids and benzoyl peroxide. 
- Consider the specific type of acne mentioned in the question and select the treatment that is most appropriate for that type. 
- Avoid jumping to conclusions based on general knowledge of acne treatments; instead, tailor your answer to the specific condition presented.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Upon reflection, it is clear that while benzoyl peroxide is an effective treatment for inflammatory acne, comedonal acne is primarily treated with retinoids. This is because retinoids can normalize skin cell turnover, preventing the formation of comedones (blackheads and whiteheads). Therefore, retinoids are the first-line treatment for comedonal acne.
