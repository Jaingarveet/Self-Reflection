## System:
You are an expert in Medicine.
You have incorrectly answered the following multiple-choice question.
Your task is to reflect on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
You will then use this information help you answer the same question in the future.
First, explain why you answered the question incorrectly.
Second, list the keywords that describe the type of your errors from most general to most specific. 
Third, solve the problem again, step-by-step, based on your knowledge of the correct answer.
Fourth, create a list of detailed instructions to help you correctly solve this problem in the future.
Finally, create a list of general advice to help you solve similar types of problems in the future.  
Be concise in your response; however, capture all of the essential information.  
For guidance, I will provide you with a single generic example problem and reflection (below).
## User 1:
Topic: Geography and Math
Question: What is the product of the number of letters contained in the name of the city where Iowa State University is located multiplied by the number of letters contained in the name of the state?
Choices:
    A: 16
    B: 20
    C: 24
    D: 32
Thought:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
ISU is located in the state of Iowa.
Action: Answer("D")
---
Correct Answer: A
## Assistant 1:
Explanation:
I miscalculated the product of the number of letters in the city and state names. 
The gap in my knowledge was not in geography but in basic arithmetic. 
I knew the correct city and state but made a calculation error.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Arithmetic error
 - Multiplication error
Solution:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
Iowa State University is located in the state of Iowa.
The city name "Ames" contains 4 letters.
The state name "Iowa" contains 4 letters.
The product of 4*4 is 16.
Instructions:
1. Identify the city where the university is located.
2. Identify the state where the university is located.
3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.
4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.
5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.
6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.
7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them.

Subtopic: Biochemistry
Question: Aminoacyl t-RNA is not require for ?
Choices:
  A: Proline
  B: Lysine
  C: Hydroxylysine
  D: Methionine

Thought:
Aminoacyl t-RNA is required for protein synthesis.
Methionine is the first amino acid in protein synthesis and requires aminoacyl t-RNA.
Proline, Lysine, and Hydroxylysine are also amino acids, but I need to check if they require aminoacyl t-RNA for protein synthesis.
Action: Answer("A")

 --- 
Correct Answer: C
## Assistant 2:
Response:
Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I did not know that Hydroxylysine does not require aminoacyl t-RNA for protein synthesis. 
The gap in my knowledge was in the specific amino acids that require aminoacyl t-RNA for protein synthesis. 
I knew that aminoacyl t-RNA was required for protein synthesis, but I did not know which amino acids required it.
Error Keywords:
 - Lack of knowledge
 - Specificity error
 - Misunderstanding of the question
Solution:
Aminoacyl t-RNA is required for protein synthesis, but not all amino acids require it.
Methionine is the first amino acid in protein synthesis and requires aminoacyl t-RNA.
Proline and Lysine require aminoacyl t-RNA for protein synthesis.
Hydroxylysine does not require aminoacyl t-RNA for protein synthesis.
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and understand the problem.
2. Identify the amino acids listed in the answer choices.
3. Recall which amino acids require aminoacyl t-RNA for protein synthesis.
4. Identify the amino acid that does not require aminoacyl t-RNA for protein synthesis.
5. Choose the answer that matches your identified amino acid.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always recall the basic concepts and definitions related to the question.
 - Always be specific in your knowledge and understanding of the topic.
 - Never assume that you know the answer without checking your knowledge.
 - Always double-check your answer to ensure accuracy.
