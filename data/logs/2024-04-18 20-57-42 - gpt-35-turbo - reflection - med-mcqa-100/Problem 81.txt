## Assistant 1:
Explanation:
I miscalculated the product of the number of letters in the city and state names. 
The gap in my knowledge was not in geography but in basic arithmetic. 
I knew the correct city and state but made a calculation error.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Arithmetic error
 - Multiplication error
Solution:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
Iowa State University is located in the state of Iowa.
The city name "Ames" contains 4 letters.
The state name "Iowa" contains 4 letters.
The product of 4*4 is 16.
Instructions:
1. Identify the city where the university is located.
2. Identify the state where the university is located.
3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.
4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.
5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.
6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.
7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.

## Assistant 2:
Response:
Explanation:
I incorrectly answered this question because I did not remember the upper limit of normal for CA 125. 
The upper limit of normal for CA 125 varies depending on the laboratory and the menopausal status of the patient. 
In premenopausal women, the upper limit of normal is usually 35 U/ml. 
In postmenopausal women, the upper limit of normal is usually 25 U/ml. 
Error Keywords:
 - Lack of knowledge
