Context: During a recital, two pianists—Wayne and Zara—will perform solos. There will be five solos altogether, performed one immediately after another. Each solo will be either a modern piece or a traditional piece. The choice of pianist and type of piece for the solos must conform to the following conditions: The third solo is a traditional piece. Exactly two of the traditional pieces are performed consecutively. In the fourth solo, either Wayne performs a traditional piece or Zara performs a modern piece. The pianist who performs the second solo does not perform the fifth solo. No traditional piece is performed until Wayne performs at least one modem piece.
Question: What is the minimum number of solos in which Wayne performs a traditional piece?

You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
The third and [REDACTED]th solos are traditional pieces. The [REDACTED]th solo can be performed by Wayne with a traditional piece or Zara with a modern piece. Since Zara can perform a modern piece in the [REDACTED]th solo, Wayne doesn't necessarily have to perform a traditional piece. The condition that no traditional piece is performed until Wayne performs at least [REDACTED] modern piece also doesn't require Wayne to perform a traditional piece. Therefore, the minimum number of solos in which Wayne performs a traditional piece could be [REDACTED].
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The third solo is a traditional piece. The fourth solo can be performed by Wayne with a traditional piece or Zara with a modern piece. Since Zara can perform a modern piece in the fourth solo, Wayne doesn't necessarily have to perform a traditional piece. The condition that no traditional piece is performed until Wayne performs at least one modern piece also doesn't require Wayne to perform a traditional piece. Therefore, the minimum number of solos in which Wayne performs a traditional piece could be zero.
Action: Answer("A")
