Context: For the school paper, five students—Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, Megregian, and O'Neill—each review one or more of exactly three plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation, but do not review any other plays. The following conditions must apply: Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.

Choices:
  A: Megregian does not review Undulation.
  B: O'Neill does not review Undulation.

Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
Given the conditions, we know that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews, so Jiang cannot review Tamerlane. This means Jiang must review Undulation and/or Sunset. Since exactly three students review Undulation, and we know that Megregian reviews more plays than Kramer and Lopez, it's possible that Megregian reviews all three plays, including Undulation. However, the conditions do not specify that Megregian must review Undulation. Therefore, it is possible that O'Neill reviews Sunset, making choice [REDACTED] the correct answer.
