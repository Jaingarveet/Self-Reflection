Topic: Law
Context: A software company employs exactly seven sales representatives—Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall—to work in its three sales zones—Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3. Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Question: Quinn CANNOT work in the same sales zone as which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: Kim
  B: Mahr
  C: Stuckey
  D: Tiao

Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
Given the conditions, we know that Parra and Quinn work in the same zone, and [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] work in the same zone. If Quinn and [REDACTED] were in the same zone, that would mean Parra and [REDACTED] are in the same zone, which contradicts the condition that either Parra or [REDACTED] (but not both) works in Zone 1. Therefore, Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as [REDACTED].
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Given the conditions, we know that Parra and Quinn work in the same zone, and Stuckey and Udall work in the same zone. If Quinn and Udall were in the same zone, that would mean Parra and Udall are in the same zone, which contradicts the condition that either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Therefore, Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Udall.
Action: Answer("E")
