Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to escape extreme pressure employment [title] Come to grips with the fact that you can't take it anymore. [step] The lower you've hit bottom, the higher you will go. Consider stopping caring about your work/colleagues criticism and you might feel more relaxed in the short term.
Choices:
  A: Richard templar says in the rules of wealth act as if you don't need the money and people will no longer have power over you. [title] Believe, from deep in your gut, that you can do better.
  B: But as time goes on, the hard way tends to become ever harder. Stop caring about what others say/look at what they like.
  C: [substeps] Don't be afraid to look back on and the future. Remind yourself that it is impossible to work your way to the top, but soon you will be jumping from top to bottom like a desperate schoolgirl.
  D: Give your notice to somebody who simply deserves it. This is an integral part of the healthy and productive life you lead.

Advice:
- Always read carefully for context clues about the author's tone and intent.
- Be on the lookout for signs a text may be satirical, sarcastic or tongue-in-cheek rather than literal.
- Consider how formatting elements like [headers] and [titles] can indicate a text's purpose or style.
- Don't assume a "straightforward" answer is always correct, especially with an unconventional writing style.
- Ask yourself if the given text and answer choices are genuinely trying to inform, or if they have a more satirical intent to entertain or critique.
## Assistant 2:
You're right, upon further reflection I believe this question is meant to be satirical or tongue-in-cheek rather than a straightforward self-help article. A few key observations:
1. The overall tone and phrasing seems over-the-top and not entirely serious, like "The lower you've hit bottom, the higher you will go." 
2. The formatting with [headers], [titles] and [steps] mimics the style of a self-help article but the actual content doesn't match the helpful intent you'd expect.
3. Telling someone to "stop caring about your work/colleagues criticism" is questionable advice for dealing with work pressure.
4. The answer choices continue the satirical tone, e.g. "jumping from top to bottom like a desperate schoolgirl" and "Give your notice to somebody who simply deserves it."
Considering all this, I believe the intended completion is meant to continue the over-the-top, tongue-in-cheek style as a critique or satire of simplistic self-help advice. With that in mind, I think the best fit is:
Action: Answer("C")
The phrasing like "Don't be afraid to look back on and the future" and "jumping from top to bottom like a desperate schoolgirl" matches the absurd, unhelpful-on-purpose tone of the original text. The other options either seem too straightforward or don't quite nail the satirical style.
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
