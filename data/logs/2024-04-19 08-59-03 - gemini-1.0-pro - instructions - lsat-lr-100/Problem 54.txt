## Assistant 2:
Self-reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly because I did not carefully consider the premises of the argument. I focused too much on the conclusion and did not realize that the premises did not provide sufficient support for the conclusion.
I have learned that it is important to carefully consider all of the premises of an argument before drawing any conclusions. I will also try to be more careful about using terms that are intrinsically evaluative.
