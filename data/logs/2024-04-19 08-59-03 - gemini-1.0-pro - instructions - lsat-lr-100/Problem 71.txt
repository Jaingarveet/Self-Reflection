Context: Curator: Our museum displays only twentieth-century works, which are either on loan from private collectors or in the museum's permanent collection. Prints of all of the latter works are available in the museum store. The museum store also sells prints of some works that are not part of the museum's permanent collection, such as Hopper's Nighthawks.
Question: If the curator's statements are true, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Every print in the museum store is of a work that is either on loan to the museum from a private collector or part of the museum's permanent collection.
  B: Every print that is sold in the museum store is a copy of a twentieth-century work.
  C: There are prints in the museum store of every work that is displayed in the museum and not on loan from a private collector.
  D: Hopper's Nighthawks is both a twentieth-century work and a work on loan to the museum from a private collector.
  E: Hopper's Nighthawks is not displayed in the museum.

Instructions:
1. Carefully read and identify key facts from the provided context.

4. If unsure, eliminate obviously wrong choices first and carefully analyze remaining options.
## Assistant 2:
## Self-Reflection on Previous Incorrect Answer:
**Mistake:** I incorrectly chose answer A in the previous attempt. This was due to misinterpreting the statement about prints being available for all works in the permanent collection. I mistakenly assumed that this meant prints of all works in the permanent collection were available in the store, which is not necessarily true.
**Learning:** I need to pay closer attention to the specific wording of statements and avoid making assumptions that are not explicitly supported by the information provided.
## Analysis of Answer Choices:
**A:** This is incorrect. The curator only states that prints of works in the permanent collection are available in the store. They do not say that all prints in the store are of works in the permanent collection.
**B:** This is incorrect. The curator mentions that prints of some works not in the permanent collection are also sold in the store, such as Hopper's Nighthawks.
**C:** This is incorrect. The curator only states that prints of works in the permanent collection are available. They do not say that prints of all displayed works are available.
**D:** This is not necessarily true. The information provided does not state whether Hopper's Nighthawks is on loan or part of the permanent collection.
**E:** This is the most likely answer. Since the curator states that the museum only displays twentieth-century works, and Hopper's Nighthawks is not a twentieth-century work, it cannot be displayed in the museum.
## Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the answer must be **E: Hopper's Nighthawks is not displayed in the museum.**
## Action:
Answer("E") 
## Result:
Agent Answer: E
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
