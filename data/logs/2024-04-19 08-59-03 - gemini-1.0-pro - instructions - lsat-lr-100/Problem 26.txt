Topic: Law
Context: There are two kinds of horror stories: those that describe a mad scientist's experiments and those that describe a monstrous beast. In some horror stories about monstrous beasts, the monster symbolizes a psychological disturbance in the protagonist. Horror stories about mad scientists, on the other hand, typically express the author's feeling that scientific knowledge alone is not enough to guide human endeavor. However, despite these differences, both kinds of horror stories share two features: they describe violations of the laws of nature and they are intended to produce dread in the reader.
Question: If the statements above are true, which one of the following would also have to be true?
Choices:
  A: All descriptions of monstrous beasts describe violations of the laws of nature.
  B: Any story that describes a violation of a law of nature is intended to invoke dread in the reader.
  C: Horror stories of any kind usually describe characters who are psychologically disturbed.
  D: Most stories about mad scientists express the author's antiscientific views.
  E: Some stories that employ symbolism describe violations of the laws of nature.

## Assistant 2:
Self-reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly because I did not carefully consider the relationship between the feature being discussed (violations of the laws of nature) and the types of stories mentioned in the passage (horror stories about monstrous beasts and horror stories about mad scientists). I assumed that all horror stories describe violations of the laws of nature, which is not true.
I have learned that it is important to carefully consider the specific feature that is being asked about and to identify other types of stories that may also exhibit that feature. This will help me to avoid making assumptions that are not explicitly stated in the passage and to choose the answer that accurately reflects the relationship between the feature and the types of stories that exhibit it.
