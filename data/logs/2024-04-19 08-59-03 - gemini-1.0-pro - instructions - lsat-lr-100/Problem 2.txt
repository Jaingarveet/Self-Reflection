## Self-Reflection
**Previous Incorrect Answer:** C
**Reasoning for Incorrect Answer:** I incorrectly assumed that all films shown at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival were Canadian.
**Correct Answer:** E
**Reasoning for Correct Answer:** The statement "most of the films that won prizes at international film festivals also won prizes at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival" implies that there were some films that won prizes at international film festivals but did not win prizes at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival. Therefore, at least one film that won a prize at an international film festival was not shown at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival.
**Action:** Answer("E")
