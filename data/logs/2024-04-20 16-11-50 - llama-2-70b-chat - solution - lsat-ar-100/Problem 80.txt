Context: An administrator must assign parking spaces to six new employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young. Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.

  C: #1: Togowa; #2: Young; #3: Xu; #4: Robertson; #5: Souza; #6: Vaughn

## Assistant 2:
  My apologies for my previous mistake. Let's analyze the question again.

The problem states that Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa, Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, and Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.

From the given choices, only option D satisfies all the conditions:

* Togowa is assigned parking space #1, which is lower than Young's assigned parking space #3.
* Xu is assigned parking space #5, which is higher than Souza's assigned parking space #4.
* Robertson is assigned parking space #4, which is higher than Young's assigned parking space #3 and satisfies the condition that Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.

Therefore, the correct answer is D: #1: Togowa; #2: Robertson; #3: Young; #4: Souza; #5: Vaughn; #6: Xu.

I hope this answer is correct. Please let me know if there's anything else I can help with.
