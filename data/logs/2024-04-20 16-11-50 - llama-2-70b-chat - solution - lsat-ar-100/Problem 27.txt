Context: For the school paper, five students—Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, Megregian, and O'Neill—each review one or more of exactly three plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation, but do not review any other plays. The following conditions must apply: Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.

  A: Jiang, Kramer
  B: Kramer, O'Neill
  C: Kramer, Lopez, O'Neill
  D: Kramer, Megregian, O'Neill

## Assistant 2:
  Sure, I'll do my best to answer the question based on the information provided.

From the given information, we know that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Therefore, the list of students who review Tamerlane must include both Kramer and O'Neill.

We also know that Lopez does not review any play that Jiang reviews. Therefore, if Jiang reviews Tamerlane, then Lopez cannot review Tamerlane. However, we also know that Lopez reviews fewer plays than Megregian, so if Lopez does not review Tamerlane, then Megregian must review Tamerlane.

Therefore, the list of students who review Tamerlane must include Kramer, O'Neill, and either Lopez or Megregian.

The only choice that satisfies these conditions is B: Kramer, O'Neill.

Therefore, the answer is B: Kramer, O'Neill.

Reflection:
In my previous answer, I incorrectly chose option C: Kramer, Lopez, O'Neill.

Upon reflection, I realized that I made a mistake in my reasoning. I incorrectly assumed that Lopez must review Tamerlane if Jiang does not review it. However, we only know that Lopez does not review any play that Jiang reviews, not that Lopez must review every play that Jiang does not review.

Therefore, the correct answer is indeed B: Kramer, O'Neill, as they are the only two students who we know for certain review Tamerlane.
