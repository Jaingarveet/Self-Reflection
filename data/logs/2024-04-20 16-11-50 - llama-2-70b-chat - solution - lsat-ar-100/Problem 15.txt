Topic: Law
Context: A shopping center has exactly seven spaces—space 1 through space 7—arranged in a straight row. Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
Question: If the shoe store is in space 4, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: The optometrist is next to a restaurant.
  B: The pharmacy is next to the veterinarian.
  C: A restaurant is next to the toy store.
  D: The shoe store is next to the toy store.

Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
Start by placing the pharmacy in space 1, as it must be at one end of the row.
One of the restaurants must be in space 7, so place it there.
The other restaurant must be separated by at least two other businesses, so place it in space 3.
The optometrist must be next to the pharmacy, so place it in space 2.
The veterinarian must be next to the pharmacy or the optometrist, so place it in space 4.
The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so place it in space 6.
The shoe store is in space 4, so it is next to the veterinarian.
## Assistant 2:
  Answer: E

The shoe store is in space 4, and since it cannot be next to the veterinarian, the veterinarian must be in space 5. Therefore, the shoe store is next to the veterinarian, which means that option E is correct.

The other options can be eliminated as follows:

Option A: The optometrist is next to a restaurant.
This is not possible since the optometrist is next to the pharmacy, and there is no restaurant between them.

Option B: The pharmacy is next to the veterinarian.
This is incorrect since the pharmacy is at the opposite end of the row from the veterinarian.

Option C: A restaurant is next to the toy store.
This is not possible since the toy store is in space 6, and there are no restaurants adjacent to it.

Option D: The shoe store is next to the toy store.
This is incorrect since the shoe store is in space 4, and the toy store is in space 6. They are not adjacent to each other.
## Result:
Agent Answer: None
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
