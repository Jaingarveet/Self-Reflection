Context: A chemistry class has six lab sessions scheduled over three days—Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday—one session heing held each morning and one each afternoon. Each session will be led by a different lab assistant—Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, or Rebecca. The assignment of lab assistants to sessions is constrained as follows: Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day. Nessa must lead an afternoon session. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
Question: If Julio and Kevin both lead morning sessions, then any of the following could be true EXCEPT:
Choices:
  A: Lan's session meets Wednesday morning.
  B: Lan's session meets Thursday afternoon.
  C: Nessa's session meets Friday afternoon.

1. Julio leads a morning session on Wednesday.
2. Kevin leads a morning session on Thursday.
3. Lan leads an afternoon session on Wednesday.
4. Nessa leads an afternoon session on Friday.
5. Olivia leads a morning session on Friday.
## Assistant 2:
  I apologize for my previous mistake. Let's analyze the given options:

A: Lan's session meets Wednesday morning.
Since Julio leads a morning session on Wednesday, Lan cannot lead a session that meets Wednesday morning. Therefore, this option is incorrect.

B: Lan's session meets Thursday afternoon.
This option is possible. Lan can lead a session that meets Thursday afternoon, as it does not conflict with Julio's session.

C: Nessa's session meets Friday afternoon.
This option is correct. Nessa must lead an afternoon session, and Friday afternoon is the only available slot.

D: Olivia's session meets Thursday morning.
This option is incorrect. Kevin leads a morning session on Thursday, and Rebecca must lead a session that meets on the same day as Kevin. Therefore, Olivia cannot lead a session that meets Thursday morning.

E: Olivia's session meets Friday morning.
This option is possible. Olivia can lead a session that meets Friday morning, as it does not conflict with Julio's or Kevin's sessions.

Therefore, the correct answer is D: Olivia's session meets Thursday morning.

Action: Answer("D")
