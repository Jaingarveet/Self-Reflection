Solution:
Let's break down the problem step-by-step again:

* The first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Monday.
* The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies, so it's made on Tuesday.
* The first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday.
* The second batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Wednesday.
* The first batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
* The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Friday.

Now, let's consider the conditions:

* No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
* At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
* The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
