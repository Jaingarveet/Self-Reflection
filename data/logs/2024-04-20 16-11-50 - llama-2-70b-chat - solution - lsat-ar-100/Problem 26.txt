Context: During a recital, two pianists—Wayne and Zara—will perform solos. There will be five solos altogether, performed one immediately after another. Each solo will be either a modern piece or a traditional piece. The choice of pianist and type of piece for the solos must conform to the following conditions: The third solo is a traditional piece. Exactly two of the traditional pieces are performed consecutively. In the fourth solo, either Wayne performs a traditional piece or Zara performs a modern piece. The pianist who performs the second solo does not perform the fifth solo. No traditional piece is performed until Wayne performs at least one modem piece.

  A: zero
  B: one
  C: two
  D: three

## Assistant 2:
  My previous answer was incorrect because I misunderstood the conditions of the problem. I thought that the third solo was a modern piece, and that the fourth solo had to be a traditional piece. However, the problem states that the third solo is a traditional piece, and that the fourth solo can be either a traditional piece or a modern piece.

To solve this problem, I need to focus on the conditions that relate to the performance of traditional pieces. The third solo is a traditional piece, and exactly two traditional pieces are performed consecutively. This means that the second solo cannot be a traditional piece, as there would be three traditional pieces in a row.

Therefore, the second solo must be a modern piece, and the fourth solo can be either a traditional piece or a modern piece. If the fourth solo is a traditional piece, then Wayne must perform a modern piece in the fifth solo, as he has not performed a traditional piece yet. If the fourth solo is a modern piece, then Zara must perform a traditional piece in the fifth solo, as she has not performed a traditional piece yet.

In either case, Wayne performs a traditional piece in the fifth solo. Therefore, the minimum number of solos in which Wayne performs a traditional piece is 5.
