## Assistant 2:
  Action: Answer("D")

Explanation:
If the pianist who performs the first solo also performs the second solo, then we can deduce that Wayne performs the first and second solos, as he is the only pianist who performs two solos consecutively. Since the third solo is a traditional piece, and no traditional piece is performed until Wayne performs at least one modern piece, Wayne's first solo must be a modern piece. Therefore, the second solo, which is performed by Wayne, must be a traditional piece, making option D the correct answer.

Self-Reflection:
In my previous response, I incorrectly answered option A. Upon reflection, I realized that I misunderstood the given information and made an incorrect deduction. I failed to consider the fact that the pianist who performs the second solo does not perform the fifth solo. Therefore, I should have deduced that Wayne performs the first and second solos, and not Zara. I also mistakenly assumed that the second solo must be a modern piece, which led me to choose option A.

To avoid similar mistakes in the future, I will make sure to carefully read and understand the given information, identify the relevant facts, and use logical reasoning to determine the correct answer. I will also ensure that my answer is well-formatted and includes a clear and concise explanation.
