## Assistant 2:
  Thought: I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I need to reassess the problem.

Reflection: I calculated the distance traveled based on the initial cost of $3.50 for the first quarter-mile, and I did not take into account the additional 10 cents for each additional quarter-mile. This means that the maximum distance I can travel with $8.50 is actually less than what I previously calculated.

Action: I will recalculate the maximum distance I can travel with $8.50 using the correct formula.

Solution: The maximum distance I can travel with $8.50 is:

$3.50 (first quarter-mile) + ($0.10 x number of additional quarter-miles)

Where number of additional quarter-miles = distance traveled - first quarter-mile.

In this case, the distance traveled is 11.75 miles, so the number of additional quarter-miles is:

11.75 - 3.50 = 8.25

The cost of the additional quarter-miles is:

$0.10 x 8.25 = $0.825

Therefore, the total cost of traveling 11.75 miles with this cab is:

$3.50 (first quarter-mile) + $0.825 (additional quarter-miles) = $4.325

So, the maximum distance I can travel with $8.50 is 11.75 miles.

Answer: C) 17.75 miles
