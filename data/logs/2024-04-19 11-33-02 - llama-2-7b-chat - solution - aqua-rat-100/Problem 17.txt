## Assistant 2:
  Thought: I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I need to rethink my solution.

Action: Let's calculate the minimum selling price per component to guarantee a yearly profit of $626,400.

Step 1: Calculate the production cost per component = $110
Step 2: Calculate the total production cost for 420 components per month = $46,800
Step 3: Calculate the total revenue from sales per month = 420 components x $226 (minimum selling price) = $91,340
Step 4: Calculate the yearly profit = $91,340 x 12 months = $1,090,160

Since the yearly profit is less than the required amount of $626,400, we need to adjust the minimum selling price per component.

Action: Let's find the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee a yearly profit of $626,400.

Step 1: Divide the required yearly profit by the total production cost per month = $626,400 รท $46,800 = 13
Step 2: Multiply the minimum selling price per component by 13 = $280 (minimum selling price per component)

Therefore, the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee a yearly profit of $626,400 is $280.

Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
