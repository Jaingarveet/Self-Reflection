## Assistant 2:
  Thought: I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I need to rethink my solution.

Let's analyze the problem again:

The newspaper costs $4 on Sunday and $1 the rest of the days of the week.
If a hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week, it means the hotel orders 2S papers on Sunday, where S is the number of papers ordered on the other days of the week.

So, the total number of papers the hotel orders per week is:

2S x $4 = $80

Since the hotel pays $210 per week for newspapers, the number of papers it buys on Monday is:

$210 - $80 = $130

Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
