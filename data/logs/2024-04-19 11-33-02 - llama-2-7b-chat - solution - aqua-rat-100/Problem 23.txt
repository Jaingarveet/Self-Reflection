## Assistant 2:
  Thought: I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I need to reflect on my solution and the correct answer.

Action: I will re-evaluate the problem and use my self-reflection to determine the correct answer.

Reflection:

The problem states that the trader sold an article at a profit of 20%. To find the cost price of the article, we need to use the formula:

Cost price = Selling price / (1 + Profit percentage)

So, the cost price of the article is:

Cost price = 360 / (1 + 0.20)
= 360 / 1.20
= 300

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 300.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.
