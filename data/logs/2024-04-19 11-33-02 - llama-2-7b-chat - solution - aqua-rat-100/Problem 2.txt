## Assistant 2:
  Thought: 
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand that the average weight of the group of vehicles increased by 2.6 tons after the new heavy-duty truck was added. To find the weight of the heavy-duty truck, I need to use the information provided in the question.

Action: Answer("B")

Reflection:
I reflected on my previous answer and realized that I made a mistake in my calculation. I misunderstood the information provided in the question and calculated the average weight of the group incorrectly. I will make sure to carefully read and understand the problem before answering it.

Solution:
The correct answer is (B) 41.6 tons. To calculate the weight of the heavy-duty truck, I used the formula:

Weight of heavy-duty truck = Average weight of group of vehicles x Increase in average weight

Weight of heavy-duty truck = 12.2 tons x 2.6 tons = 31.32 tons

Therefore, the weight of the heavy-duty truck is 31.32 tons.
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
