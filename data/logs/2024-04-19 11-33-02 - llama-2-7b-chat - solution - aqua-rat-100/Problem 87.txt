## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Solution:
To find the number of ways to choose 2 oranges from a basket of 10 oranges, we need to use the principle of permutations. There are 10 oranges in the basket, and we need to arrange 2 of them in a particular order. Therefore, the number of ways to choose 2 oranges from the basket is:

10C2 = 10 × 9 = [REDACTED]
## Assistant 2:
  Great, let's solve this problem using the principle of permutations!

To find the number of ways to choose 2 oranges from a basket of 10 oranges, we need to use the formula:

Number of ways = Number of objects × Number of choices

In this case, there are 10 oranges in the basket, and we need to choose 2 of them. So, the formula becomes:

Number of ways = 10 × 9

Now, we need to simplify the formula by multiplying the number of objects (10) by the number of choices (9):

Number of ways = 10 × 9 = 90

Therefore, the answer is (B) 90.

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I realized that I made a mistake in my calculation. I misunderstood the problem and used the formula for the number of combinations instead of the number of permutations. Thank you for pointing out my mistake, and I'm glad I could correct it!
