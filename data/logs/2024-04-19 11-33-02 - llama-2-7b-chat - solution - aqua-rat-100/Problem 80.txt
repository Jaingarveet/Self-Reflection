## Assistant 2:
  Thought: 
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand that I made a mistake in my calculation. I will reflect on my solution and the correct answer to determine the correct number of white and brown sharpeners that Jack bought.

Action:
I will use the information provided in the question to calculate the number of white and brown sharpeners that Jack bought.

White sharpeners cost 1 rupee more than brown sharpeners, so the cost of 1 white sharpeners is:
Rs. 100 / (1 + 1) = Rs. 90

The number of white sharpeners Jack bought is:
18 - 9 = 9

The number of brown sharpeners Jack bought is:
18 - 9 = 9

Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
