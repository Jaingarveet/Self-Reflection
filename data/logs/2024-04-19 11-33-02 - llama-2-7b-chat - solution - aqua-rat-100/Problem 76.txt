Question: If n is such that 36 ≤ n ≤ 72, then x = (n2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16) / (n+ 4√n+ 4) satisfies

Reflection:

I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I realized that I made a mistake in my calculation. I misunderstood the problem and ended up with an incorrect solution. To solve this problem correctly, I need to pay closer attention to the given information and use the correct mathematical operations.

Here is my revised solution:

Let n be the number that satisfies 36 ≤ n ≤ 72. Then, we can write the equation:

x = (n2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16) / (n+ 4√n+ 4)

We are asked to find the value of x that satisfies the inequality given in the choices.

A: 20 < x < 54

We can see that 20 < n < 54, so the expression inside the parentheses is:

n2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16

= n2 + 2n + 16

= n(n + 2) + 16

Since n is between 20 and 54, the value of n(n + 2) is between 40 and 112, inclusive. Therefore, the value of x is between 40 and 112, inclusive.

B: 23 < x < 58

We can repeat the same calculation as before:

n2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16
= n2 + 2n + 16
= n(n + 2) + 16

Since n is between 23 and 58, the value of n(n + 2) is between 46 and 126, inclusive. Therefore, the value of x is between 46 and 126, inclusive.

C: 25 < x < 64

Again, we can calculate the expression inside the parentheses:

n2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16
= n2 + 2n + 16
= n(n + 2) + 16

Since n is between 25 and 64, the value of n(n + 2) is between 50 and 136, inclusive. Therefore, the value of x is between 50 and 136, inclusive.

D: 28 < x < 60

We can repeat the same calculation as before:

n2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16
= n2 + 2n + 16
= n(n + 2) + 16

Since n is between 28 and 60, the value of n(n + 2) is between 44 and 120, inclusive. Therefore, the value of x is between 44 and 120, inclusive.

E: None of these

Since none of the choices match the value of x that we calculated, the answer is E: None of these.

In conclusion, the correct answer is (E) None of these.
