## Assistant 2:
  Thought: 
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand the mistake. Let's analyze the problem again.

Arjun has $X, and Sajal has $Y. If Arjun gives $30 to Sajal, Sajal will have $Y + $30 = 2Y.
If Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have $X + $10 = 3X.

We know that Arjun will have thrice as much money as is left with Sajal, so:
3X = 2Y

Now, we can solve for X and Y:
X = 62, Y = 34

Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: B
