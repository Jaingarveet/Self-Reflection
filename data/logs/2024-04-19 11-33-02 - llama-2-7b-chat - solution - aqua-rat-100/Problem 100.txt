## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: A rectangular piece of 150 sq m has a length which is 1m more than the 4 times the breadth. What is the perimeter of the piece?
Choices:
  A: 60 m
  B: 61 m
  C: 62 m
  D: 63 m
  E: 64 m
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
The perimeter of a rectangle is found by adding the lengths of all four sides. The correct equation is:

Perimeter = 2(Length + Width)

Since the length is 1m more than 4 times the breadth, we can set up the equation:

Length = 4[REDACTED] + 1

Now, we can substitute the value of Length in terms of [REDACTED]:

Length = 4[REDACTED] + 1

Perimeter = 2(4[REDACTED] + 1)

Perimeter = 8[REDACTED] + 2

Therefore, the perimeter of the rectangular piece is [REDACTED] (Answer: C).
