Question: A cyclist travels at 12 miles per hour. How many minutes will it take to travel 48 miles?
Choices:
  A: 1
  B: 240
  C: 30
  D: 60
  E: 120

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I realized that I made a mistake in my calculation. I misunderstood the problem and calculated the time it would take to travel 48 miles at a constant speed of 12 miles per hour, which is not the correct approach.

To solve this problem, we need to use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed. In this case, the distance is 48 miles, and the speed is 12 miles per hour.

So, the correct answer is: Time = 48 miles / 12 miles/hour = 4 hours.

Therefore, the answer is (D) 60 minutes.
## Result:
Agent Answer: None
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
