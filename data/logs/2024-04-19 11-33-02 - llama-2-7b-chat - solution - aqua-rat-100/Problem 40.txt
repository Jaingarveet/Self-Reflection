## Assistant 2:
  Thought: I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand that I made a mistake in my calculation. I will reflect on my solution and the correct answer to ensure I get it right this time.

Action: I will re-solve the problem using the information provided.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 60.
