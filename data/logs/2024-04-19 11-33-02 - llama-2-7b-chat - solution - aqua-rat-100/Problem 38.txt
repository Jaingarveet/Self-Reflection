Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
The hollow cube has a size of 5cm, and the thickness is 1cm, making the volume of the cube 5cm x 5cm x 1cm = 25 cm続.
The cube is made of smaller cubes of size 1cm, so the number of smaller cubes that can fit inside the hollow cube is 25 cm続 / 1 cm続 = 25.
The outer surface of the cube is painted, so the number of faces of the smaller cubes that remain unpainted is 25 - 6 (faces of the smaller cubes that are not painted) = 19.
## Assistant 2:
  Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, stating that the number of faces of the smaller cubes that remain unpainted was 438. Upon further reflection, I realized that the volume of the hollow cube is 25 cm続, and the number of smaller cubes that can fit inside it is 25. The number of faces of the smaller cubes that remain unpainted is therefore 25 - 6 = 19.

Action: Answer("C")
