## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

## Assistant 2:
  Thought: 
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand the mistake. The correct solution is to use the fact that B bisects minor arc AC to find the measure of minor arc AD.

Action:
I will use the information provided in the question to find the measure of minor arc AD.

Reflection:
I reflected on my previous answer and realized that I made a mistake in calculating the measure of minor arc AD. I used the wrong angle measure for the minor arc AC, which led to an incorrect calculation.

Solution:
The measure of minor arc AD is 140°.

Action: Answer("C")
