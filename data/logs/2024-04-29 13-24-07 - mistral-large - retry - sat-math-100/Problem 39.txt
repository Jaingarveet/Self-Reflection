You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

## Assistant 2:
Thought:
To find the value of $a$ for which the system has no solution, we can use the concept of linear independence. Two equations are linearly independent if they do not represent the same line. If they are linearly dependent, they either represent the same line (infinite solutions) or parallel lines (no solution).

To check for linear dependence, we can compare the slopes of the two equations. If the slopes are equal, the equations are linearly dependent.

The slope of the first equation is $-3$. The slope of the second equation is $-\frac{a}{2}$.

Setting the slopes equal to each other, we get $-3 = -\frac{a}{2}$. Solving for $a$, we get $a = 6$.

However, we need to check if this value of $a$ results in parallel lines or the same line. To do this, we can compare the y-intercepts of the two equations. If the y-intercepts are different, the lines are parallel and there is no solution.

The y-intercept of the first equation is $6$. The y-intercept of the second equation is $4$.

Since the y-intercepts are different, the lines are parallel and there is no solution when $a = 6$.
