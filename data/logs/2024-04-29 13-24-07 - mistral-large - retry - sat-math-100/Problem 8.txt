## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let's denote the original price of the computer as x. After a 20% discount, the price becomes 0.8x. Then, an 8% sales tax is applied to the discounted price, which is 0.08 \* 0.8x = 0.064x. The total amount Alma paid is the discounted price plus the sales tax, which is 0.8x + 0.064x = 0.864x. We are given that the total amount Alma paid is p, so we have the equation 0.864x = p. To find the original price x in terms of p, we need to solve for x.

Action: Answer("D")

Explanation:
To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 0.864:

x = p / 0.864

We can simplify the denominator by multiplying it by 100/100 to get rid of the decimal:

x = p / (86.4/100)

x = p / (0.8 \* 1.08)

Therefore, the original price of the computer in terms of p is x = p / (0.8 \* 1.08), which corresponds to choice (D).
