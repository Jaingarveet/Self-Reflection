Question: Mr. Kohl has a beaker containing $n$ milliliters of solution to distribute to the students in his chemistry class. If he gives each student 3 milliliters of solution, he will have 5 milliliters left over. In order to give each student 4 milliliters of solution, he will need an additional 21 milliliters. How many students are in the class?

## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let's denote the number of students in the class as x.
According to the problem, Mr. Kohl has n milliliters of solution.
When he gives each student 3 milliliters, he has 5 milliliters left over. So, we can write the equation:
n = 3x + 5
When he wants to give each student 4 milliliters, he needs an additional 21 milliliters. So, we can write the equation:
n + 21 = 4x
Now, we can solve this system of equations to find the value of x.
Subtract the first equation from the second equation:
(n + 21) - (3x + 5) = 4x - 3x
n + 21 - 3x - 5 = x
n - 3x + 16 = x
Substitute the first equation into this equation:
3x + 5 - 3x + 16 = x
21 = x
So, there are 21 students in the class.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
