## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I confused epiligrin (laminin-332) with laminin-5, which are both adhesion molecules in the epidermis, and I overlooked the correct answer, collagen XVII, another important component of the dermal-epidermal junction.
Error Keywords:
- Misidentification
- Overlooked correct answer
- Autoimmune antigen
Solution:
Cicatricial pemphigoid is a rare autoimmune blistering disease characterized by IgG autoantibodies targeting antigens at the dermal-epidermal junction.
In this disease, IgG autoantibodies primarily target collagen XVII, which is a transmembrane collagen component of the hemidesmosome, essential for maintaining the structural integrity of the skin.
Collagen XVII is bound by IgG on the epidermal side of the salt-split skin in this disease.
Instructions:
1. Understand the nature of cicatricial pemphigoid as an autoimmune disease.
2. Recognize that the question seeks the antigen targeted by IgG autoantibodies.
3. Identify collagen XVII as the transmembrane collagen component of the hemidesmosome.
4. Confirm that collagen XVII is located on the epidermal side of the dermal-epidermal junction.
5. Select the answer choice corresponding to collagen XVII.
Advice:
- Familiarize yourself with the common antigens targeted in autoimmune diseases.
- Understand the structural components of the dermal-epidermal junction, including collagen XVII and its role.
- Be mindful of potential confusion between different types of laminin and their respective locations and functions.
- When answering multiple-choice questions, ensure your answer choice directly addresses the specific aspect being queried.
