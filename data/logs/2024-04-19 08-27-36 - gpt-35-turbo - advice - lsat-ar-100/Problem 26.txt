## Assistant 2:
Thought:
To determine the minimum number of solos in which Wayne performs a traditional piece, we need to consider the given conditions and constraints. 
From the given conditions, we know that the third solo is a traditional piece, and exactly two of the traditional pieces are performed consecutively. 
Also, no traditional piece is performed until Wayne performs at least one modern piece. 
Therefore, Wayne must perform a modern piece in the first or second solo. 
If Wayne performs a modern piece in the first solo, then he must perform a traditional piece in the third or fourth solo. 
If Wayne performs a modern piece in the second solo, then he must perform a traditional piece in the third, fourth, or fifth solo. 
Thus, Wayne must perform a traditional piece in at least two solos. 
Action: Answer("C")
