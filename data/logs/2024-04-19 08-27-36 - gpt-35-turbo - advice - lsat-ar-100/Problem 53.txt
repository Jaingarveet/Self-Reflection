## Assistant 2:
Thought:
J must be shown in the evening, so J cannot be shown in the morning or afternoon.
K cannot be shown in the morning, so K must be shown in the afternoon or evening.
L must be shown after K and before M, so L must be shown in the afternoon or evening.
M cannot be shown in the evening because J is shown in the evening.
N, O, and P are not mentioned in the rules, so they can be shown at any time.
