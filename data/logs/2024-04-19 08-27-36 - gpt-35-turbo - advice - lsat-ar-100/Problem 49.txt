## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. This means that the pharmacy and one of the restaurants must be in spaces 1 and 7, but we don't know which one is in which space.
The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. This means that the restaurant cannot be in spaces 2 or 6.
The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. This means that the optometrist or the veterinarian must be in space 2 or 6.
The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian. This means that the veterinarian cannot be in space 3 or 5.
Action: Answer("E")
