## Assistant 2:
Thought:
If the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday, then the first batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Monday. The second batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Wednesday. The second batch of sugar cookies must be made on Thursday. Therefore, the second batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Friday.
