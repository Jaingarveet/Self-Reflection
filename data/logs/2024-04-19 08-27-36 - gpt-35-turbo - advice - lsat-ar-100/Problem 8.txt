## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
Therefore, the bay holding grain must have a number higher than the bay holding textiles.
The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
Therefore, the bay holding textiles must be either bay 2 or bay 5.
If the bay holding textiles is bay 2, then the bay holding livestock must be bay 4, which is impossible because the bay holding produce must be higher than the bay holding livestock.
Therefore, the bay holding textiles must be bay 5, and the bay holding livestock must be either bay 3 or bay 4.
