## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on a different day than the first batch of oatmeal cookies.
The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
Therefore, the second batch of oatmeal cookies is not made on Monday.
If one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, then the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Wednesday.
If the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Wednesday, then the first batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Wednesday as well.
If the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Wednesday, then the second batch of sugar cookies must be made on Monday.
Therefore, exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
If the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Wednesday, then the second batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Thursday.
If the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Thursday, then the second batch of sugar cookies must be made on Tuesday.
Therefore, exactly two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday.
If one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, then the first batch of sugar cookies must be made on Friday.
Therefore, at least one batch of cookies is made on each of the five days.
If the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Wednesday, then the second batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Friday.
If the second batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Friday, then at least two batches of cookies are made on Friday.
Therefore, statement B could be false.
Action: Answer("B")
