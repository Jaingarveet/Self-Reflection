## Assistant 2:
Thought:
If Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong, then Hong cannot testify on Monday because Hong does not testify on Monday. Therefore, Hong must testify on Tuesday or Wednesday. If Hong testifies on Tuesday, then Iturbe must testify on Monday, and Garcia and Jackson must testify on Wednesday. This scenario violates the condition that exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday. Therefore, Hong must testify on Wednesday. Iturbe also testifies on Wednesday, so Franco cannot testify on Wednesday. Therefore, Franco must testify on Monday, and Garcia must testify on Tuesday. This scenario satisfies all of the given conditions.
Action: Answer("C")
