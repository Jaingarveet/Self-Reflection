## Assistant 2:
Thought:
If Jiang does not review Tamerlane, then Kramer and O'Neill must review Tamerlane. 
Thus, Megregian reviews Sunset and Lopez reviews Undulation. 
Since neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews, Jiang cannot review Sunset. 
Therefore, Jiang reviews Undulation.
