Context: Of the eight students—George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert—in a seminar, exactly six will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
Question: If Helen, Kyle, and Lenore, not necessarily in that order, give the three morning reports, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Helen gives a report on Monday.
  B: Irving gives a report on Monday.
  C: Irving gives a report on Wednesday.
  D: Kyle gives a report on Tuesday.

## Assistant 2:
Thought:
If Helen, Kyle, and Lenore give the three morning reports, then George, Nina, Olivia, and Robert must give the afternoon reports. 
George can only give a report on Tuesday, so he must give an afternoon report on Tuesday.
If Nina gives a report, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on the next day, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. Therefore, Nina cannot give a report on Tuesday, or else Helen and Irving would have to give reports on Wednesday, which is not possible since there are already two people giving reports on Wednesday.
Thus, Nina must give a report on Monday or Wednesday. If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday, which is not possible since George is already giving an afternoon report on Tuesday. Therefore, Nina must give a report on Wednesday.
If Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving do not have to give reports on the same day. Therefore, Irving can give a report on Monday or Wednesday.
Thus, Irving can give a report on Monday or Wednesday, but we cannot determine which one for sure. However, we do know that Kyle must give a report on Tuesday or Wednesday, since there are already two people giving reports on Monday. Therefore, Kyle must give a report on Wednesday.
Action: Answer("E")
