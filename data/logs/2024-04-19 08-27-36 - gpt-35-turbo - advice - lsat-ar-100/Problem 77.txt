Thought:
To determine the number of employees with only two possible parking spaces, we need to identify the employees whose parking space is limited by the given rules.
Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4. Therefore, Robertson's parking space is limited to two possible spaces.
Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Therefore, Young's parking space is limited to two possible spaces.
Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Therefore, Xu's parking space is limited to two possible spaces.
Vaughn's parking space is not limited by any of the given rules.
Therefore, three employees have their parking space limited to two possible spaces: Robertson, Young, and Xu.
Action: Answer("C")
