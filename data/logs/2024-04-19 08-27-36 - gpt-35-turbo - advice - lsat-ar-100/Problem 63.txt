Context: A chemistry class has six lab sessions scheduled over three days—Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday—one session heing held each morning and one each afternoon. Each session will be led by a different lab assistant—Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, or Rebecca. The assignment of lab assistants to sessions is constrained as follows: Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day. Nessa must lead an afternoon session. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
Question: If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, then for how many of the other lab assistants can one determine which sessions they lead?
Choices:
  A: one
  B: two
  C: three
  D: four
  E: five

Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the constraints.
 - Always make a list of all the constraints and use them to deduce the schedule of the lab assistants.
 - Always double-check your reasoning to ensure that it is consistent with the constraints.
 - Always be careful when making assumptions; check that they are consistent with the constraints.
 - Remember that logical errors can be difficult to detect, so always double-check your reasoning.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, then we know that Olivia's session must be on Friday. Therefore, Lan cannot lead a session on Friday, so she must lead a session on Wednesday. Nessa must lead an afternoon session, so she must lead the Wednesday afternoon session. Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions on the same day, so they must lead the Thursday morning and afternoon sessions. Therefore, the only unknown lab assistant is Nessa. We know that she must lead the Wednesday afternoon session, but we don't know which lab assistant will lead the Friday morning session. Therefore, we can determine the sessions led by five of the lab assistants, and the answer is E: five.
Action: Answer("E")
