## Assistant 2:
Thought:
From the given conditions, we know that:
- Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
- Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
- Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
- Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
- There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
We need to find a list of sales representatives working in Zone 3. 
From the last condition, we know that there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, there must be at least two sales representatives in Zone 3. 
Kim, Mahr, and Quinn are not mentioned in any of the conditions related to Zone 3, so they cannot be in Zone 3. 
Parra and Tiao cannot both be in Zone 1, so at most one of them is in Zone 1. 
If Tiao is in Zone 2, then Udall cannot be in Zone 2, so Udall must be in Zone 3. 
If Parra is in Zone 2, then Tiao must be in Zone 3. 
Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other, so if Udall is in Zone 3, then Stuckey must also be in Zone 3. 
Therefore, the only possible list of sales representatives working in Zone 3 is Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
