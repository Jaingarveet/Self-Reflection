## System:
You are an expert in Math.
You have incorrectly answered the following multiple-choice question.
Your task is to reflect on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
You will then use this information help you answer the same question in the future.
First, explain why you answered the question incorrectly.
Second, list the keywords that describe the type of your errors from most general to most specific. 
Third, solve the problem again, step-by-step, based on your knowledge of the correct answer.
Fourth, create a list of detailed instructions to help you correctly solve this problem in the future.
Finally, create a list of general advice to help you solve similar types of problems in the future.  
Be concise in your response; however, capture all of the essential information.  
For guidance, I will provide you with a single generic example problem and reflection (below).

Topic: Geography and Math
Question: What is the product of the number of letters contained in the name of the city where Iowa State University is located multiplied by the number of letters contained in the name of the state?
Choices:
    A: 16
    B: 20
    C: 24
    D: 32
Thought:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
ISU is located in the state of Iowa.
Action: Answer("D")
---
Correct Answer: A
## Assistant 1:
Explanation:
I miscalculated the product of the number of letters in the city and state names. 
The gap in my knowledge was not in geography but in basic arithmetic. 
I knew the correct city and state but made a calculation error.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Arithmetic error
 - Multiplication error
Solution:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
Iowa State University is located in the state of Iowa.
The city name "Ames" contains 4 letters.
The state name "Iowa" contains 4 letters.
The product of 4*4 is 16.
Instructions:
1. Identify the city where the university is located.
2. Identify the state where the university is located.
3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.
4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.
5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.
6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.
7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them.

Topic: Math
Question: A starts travel towards south 3km, then travel 5 km towards east, and again travels 3 km to north, and finally travels 2km towards west. In the end how far from is A from home?
Choices:
  A: 3km
  B: 2km
  C: 4km
  D: 5km
  E: 6km

Thought:
We can use Pythagoras theorem to find the distance between the starting point and the final point.
The distance travelled towards south and north will cancel each other out.
The distance travelled towards east and west will cancel each other out.
Action: Answer("C")

 --- 
Correct Answer: A
## Assistant 2:
Response:
Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that the distance travelled towards south and north would cancel each other out, and the distance travelled towards east and west would cancel each other out. However, this is not true because the distances travelled towards south and north are not equal, and the distances travelled towards east and west are not equal. 
Error Keywords:
 - Incorrect assumption
 - Misapplication of Pythagoras theorem
 - Misunderstanding of the problem
Solution:
We can use Pythagoras theorem to find the distance between the starting point and the final point.
The distance travelled towards south and north will cancel each other out.
The distance travelled towards east and west will cancel each other out.
The distance travelled towards south is 3 km.
The distance travelled towards north is 3 km.
The distance travelled towards east is 5 km.
The distance travelled towards west is 2 km.
The net distance travelled towards south is 3 km - 3 km = 0 km.
The net distance travelled towards east is 5 km - 2 km = 3 km.
The distance between the starting point and the final point is the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle with sides of 3 km and 3 km.
Using Pythagoras theorem, we get:
distance^2 = 3^2 + 3^2
distance^2 = 18
distance = sqrt(18) = 3sqrt(2)
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and understand the problem.
2. Identify the distances travelled towards south, north, east, and west.
3. Calculate the net distance travelled towards south and north.
4. Calculate the net distance travelled towards east and west.
5. Use Pythagoras theorem to find the distance between the starting point and the final point.
6. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
7. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always draw a diagram to visualize the problem.
 - Always use Pythagoras theorem to find the distance between two points in a right-angled triangle.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
