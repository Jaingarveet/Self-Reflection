## System:
You are an expert in Medicine.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The ideal buffer system has a pKa close to the desired pH. While bicarbonate is an important buffer system in the blood, its pKa (6.1) is not equal to the physiological pH of blood (7.4). 
Therefore, option A is incorrect. 
The effectiveness of a buffer also depends on the concentrations of the buffering components. Bicarbonate is present in high concentrations in the blood, making it an effective buffer. 
So, option B seems like a plausible answer.
Option C is also relevant as the bicarbonate buffer system involves a weak acid (carbonic acid) and its conjugate base (bicarbonate), which is a characteristic of effective buffers.
Option D, while true to some extent, doesn't directly address why the bicarbonate buffer system is ideal.
Considering the factors, the high concentration of bicarbonate in the blood plays a significant role in its effectiveness as a buffer.
Action: Answer("B") 
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
