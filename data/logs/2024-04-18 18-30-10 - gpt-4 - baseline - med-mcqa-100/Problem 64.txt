Ovarian torsion is a condition that occurs when an ovary twists around the ligaments that hold it in place. This can cause severe pain and other symptoms because the ovary isn't receiving enough blood. Dermoid cysts, also known as mature cystic teratomas, are the most common type of ovarian mass that leads to torsion. They are also the most common ovarian neoplasm in women under 20 years of age.
