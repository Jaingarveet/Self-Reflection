Question: At 34 weeks multigravida with previous 2 normal delivery has an unstable lie with the present pregnancy. It can be due to:
Choices:
  A: Oligohydramnios
  B: Placenta pre
  C: Pelvic tumor
  D: Uterine anomalies
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
An unstable lie is when the baby's position changes frequently during the last month of pregnancy. This can be due to several reasons, including a large amount of amniotic fluid (polyhydramnios), multiple pregnancies, a uterus that is abnormally shaped or has abnormal growths, or a baby that is small or not growing well. In this case, the woman has had two previous normal deliveries, so uterine anomalies are less likely. A pelvic tumor could potentially cause an unstable lie, but it's not the most common cause. Placenta previa could potentially cause an unstable lie, but it would likely present with other symptoms as well, such as bleeding. Oligohydramnios, or a low amount of amniotic fluid, could potentially cause an unstable lie, but it's not the most common cause.
Action: Answer("C")
