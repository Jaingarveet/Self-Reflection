Thought: 
The symptoms described are indicative of cystic fibrosis, a genetic disorder that affects the chloride channels in the body, leading to thick, sticky mucus in various organs. The basic abnormality in cystic fibrosis is a defect in the CFTR gene, which codes for a protein that functions as a chloride channel and regulates the flow of other ions across the cell membrane. This defect leads to decreased chloride transport and increased sodium absorption, which results in thick, sticky mucus.
