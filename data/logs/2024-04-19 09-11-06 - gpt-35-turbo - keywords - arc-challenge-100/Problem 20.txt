I previously answered this question incorrectly, so I need to be careful and think about each choice.
High tide occurs twice a day, so it cannot be the answer.
A new moon occurs about every 29.5 days, so it cannot be the answer.
A new season occurs about every three months, but it is not an event that occurs every three months.
A solar eclipse does not occur every three months, so it cannot be the answer.
