## User 2:
Topic: Science
Question: A pharmaceutical company develops a new antibiotic to treat pneumonia. After limited testing, the researchers conclude that the antibiotic seems to be effective. How can the researchers strengthen their conclusions?
Choices:
  A: Test the antibiotic on human volunteers.
  B: Publish their results in a medical journal.
  C: Ask an independent lab to retest the antibiotic.
  D: Test the effectiveness of the antibiotic at killing other bacteria.

Error Keywords:
 - Misunderstanding of the question
 - Misinterpretation of the answer choices

## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The researchers need to conduct further testing to strengthen their conclusions.
Option A is not a good choice because testing on human volunteers without further testing on animals is unethical.
Option B is not a good choice because publishing results in a medical journal does not necessarily strengthen the conclusions.
Option C is a good choice because an independent lab can retest the antibiotic to confirm the results.
Option D is not a good choice because testing the effectiveness of the antibiotic at killing other bacteria does not necessarily strengthen the conclusions.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
