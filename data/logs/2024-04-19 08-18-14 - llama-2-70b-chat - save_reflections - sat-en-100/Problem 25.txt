## Get Reflection:
  Action: Answer("B")

The main purpose of the passage is to stress the urgency of an issue. The author is emphasizing the importance of considering the direction of the procession of educated men and the need to think deeply about it, as the moment is short and the future is uncertain. The author is urging the readers to take action and make decisions about their participation in the procession, rather than simply accepting tradition or continuing with the status quo. Therefore, option B is the best answer.
