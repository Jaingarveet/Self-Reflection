## Get Reflection:
  Action: Answer("D")

Explanation:
The authors of Passage 1 believe that women are suited for domestic duties and childrearing, and that this is their natural role. They argue that women have "delicate constitutions," "peaceful inclinations," and are suited for "gentle occupations" and "the cares of the home." They also suggest that this role is distinct from the roles performed by men, and that it is not appropriate for women to aspire to political rights and functions.

Therefore, option D is the best answer, as it most closely aligns with the authors' views. They do not suggest that running a household and raising children are rewarding for men as well as for women (option A), or that these roles yield less value for society than do the roles performed by men (option B). While the authors do suggest that women are suited for domestic duties, they do not imply that these duties are easy or without difficulty (option C).
