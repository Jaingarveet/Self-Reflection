## Get Reflection:
  Action: Answer(D)

Explanation:
The table provided in the question does not contain information about the presence or absence of Varroa mites in the colonies, so it does not provide direct evidence for the authors' claim that infection with Varroa mites increases a honey bee's susceptibility to secondary infections. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) No, because the data do not indicate whether the honeybees had been infected with mites.

The other answer choices are incorrect because:

* (A) Yes, because the data provide evidence that infection with a pathogen caused the colonies to undergo colony collapse disorder. - The data do not provide evidence that the pathogens caused colony collapse disorder, only that there is a correlation between the two.
* (B) Yes, because for each pathogen, the percent of colonies infected is greater for colonies with colony collapse disorder than for colonies without colony collapse disorder. - This is true, but it does not necessarily mean that the infection with Varroa mites increases susceptibility to secondary infections, as there could be other factors at play.
* (C) No, because the data do not provide evidence about bacteria as a cause of colony collapse disorder. - The data do provide evidence about the presence of viruses and fungi in colonies with colony collapse disorder, but it does not mention bacteria. However, this does not affect the answer to the question.
