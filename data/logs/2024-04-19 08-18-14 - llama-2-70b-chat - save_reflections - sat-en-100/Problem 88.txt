## Get Reflection:
  The correct answer is indeed A: number of cortices activated in the brain during gentle brushing. The passage states that G.L.'s brain showed activity in the insular cortex, but not in the somatosensory cortex, when her arm was gently brushed to activate CT fibers. This suggests that G.L.'s brain had a different response to gentle brushing compared to the other test subjects, specifically in terms of the number of cortices activated. Option A correctly captures this difference.

My apologies for the mistake in my previous response. Thank you for pointing it out.
