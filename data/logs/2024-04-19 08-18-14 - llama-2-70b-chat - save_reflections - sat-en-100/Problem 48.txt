## Get Reflection:
  Action: Answer("B")

Explanation:
The second passage discusses the potential benefits of space mining, but also raises concerns about the environmental impact and the need for careful consideration of the consequences. The author argues that it is in everyone's long-term interest to seek a broad agreement on the for-profit exploitation of space. Therefore, the central claim of Passage 2 is that space mining has positive potential, but its effects should be thoughtfully considered before it becomes a reality, which aligns with choice B.

Error: Your answer must be stated as 'Action: Answer("[ANSWER_CHOICE]")'; where [ANSWER_CHOICE] is the letter of the correct answer choice. In this case, the correct answer choice is B.
