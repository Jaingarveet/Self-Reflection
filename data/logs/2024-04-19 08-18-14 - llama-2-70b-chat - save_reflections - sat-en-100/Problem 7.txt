## Get Reflection:
  Action: Answer(A)

Explanation:
The passage states that the 1999 experiment aimed to investigate the characteristics of slow fibers, specifically named "C-tactile" or CT fibers, and their response to gentle touch. The experiment sought to determine why humans have these fibers, which respond only to a narrow range of subtle stimuli and are found only in hairy skin. The passage also mentions that the researchers used functional MRI studies to examine which areas of the brain lit up when CT fibers were activated, which suggests that they were interested in understanding the nature of the sensations conveyed by CT fibers. Therefore, choice A is the best answer.
