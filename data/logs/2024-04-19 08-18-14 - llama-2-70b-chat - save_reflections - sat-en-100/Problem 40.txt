## Get Reflection:
  Action: Answer(A)

The narrator is portrayed as someone who is reserved around unfamiliar people.

In the passage, the narrator is described as feeling shy and hesitant when interacting with her uncle, whom she has not seen in a long time. She also initially refuses his invitation to sit down, citing her father's busy schedule. These actions suggest that the narrator is reserved around unfamiliar people, preferring to observe and take things in before engaging with others.

There is no evidence in the passage to suggest that the narrator is attuned to her immediate surroundings (choice B). While she does notice some details about the shop, such as the polished wooden floors and the shiny glass cases, she does not seem to be particularly attuned to her surroundings or focused on observing them.

There is also no evidence to suggest that the narrator is sympathetic to the needs of others (choice C). While she is polite and respectful to her uncle and father, there is no indication that she is particularly sympathetic or empathetic towards them.

Finally, there is no evidence to suggest that the narrator is anxious about her responsibilities (choice D). While she is described as remembering her aunt's teachings about the importance of effort and intention, there is no indication that she is anxious or stressed about her responsibilities.

Therefore, the correct answer is choice A, reserved around unfamiliar people.
