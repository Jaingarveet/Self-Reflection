## Get Reflection:
  Action: Answer(A)

Explanation:
The correct answer is A: They may be different resources from those that are valuable on Earth.

In Passage 1, the author mentions that the resources extracted from space will be used to meet earthly demands for precious metals and rare earth elements. However, the passage also mentions that water ice from the moon's poles could be sent to astronauts on the International Space Station for drinking or as a radiation shield, and that splitting water into oxygen and hydrogen makes spacecraft fuel. This implies that resources that are not necessarily valuable on Earth, such as water, may be highly valued in space.

In Passage 2, the author explicitly states that the resources that are valuable in orbit and beyond may be very different to those we prize on Earth. This reinforces the idea that resources that are not valuable on Earth may be highly valued in space.

Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
