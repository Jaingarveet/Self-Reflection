## Get Reflection:
  Action: Answer(D)

Explanation:
The passage describes the protagonist's visit to her family's ink shop, where she learns about the quality and craftsmanship of their ink products and witnesses her father's passion for his work. The visit deepens her appreciation of her family's work and helps her understand her father's ambitions. The passage does not focus primarily on the protagonist's relationship with her aunt or the happy reunion between the protagonist and her family members, although these elements are mentioned. Therefore, choice D, "A character's visit to her family's ink shop deepens her appreciation of her family's work," best summarizes the passage.
