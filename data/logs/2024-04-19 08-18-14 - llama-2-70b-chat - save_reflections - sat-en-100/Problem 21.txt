## Get Reflection:
  Action: Answer("C")

Explanation:
Passage 1 suggests that the US government's provisions for the institution of slavery, as framed in the Constitution, provided a good basic structure that does not need to be changed. The author argues that the Constitution has allowed the US to grow and expand from four million to thirty million people, extend its territory from the Mississippi to the Pacific Ocean, and increase in population, wealth, and power. The author suggests that the Union can exist forever, divided into Free and Slave States, if each state carries out the principles upon which their institutions were founded, such as the right of each state to do as it pleases without meddling with its neighbors. This implies that the Constitution's provisions for slavery were adequate for the time and did not need to be changed, which is option C.
