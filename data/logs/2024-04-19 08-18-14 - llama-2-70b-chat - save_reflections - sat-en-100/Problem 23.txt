## Get Reflection:
  Action: Answer(B)

Explanation:
The main purpose of Douglas's discussion of the growth of the territory and population of the United States in the first paragraph of Passage 1 is to suggest that the division into free and slave states does not endanger the Union. Douglas argues that the United States has grown rapidly in population, wealth, and power since its founding, and that this growth has occurred under a Constitution that Mr. Lincoln claims is contrary to the law of God and cannot stand. Douglas suggests that the fact that the Union has endured and expanded despite its division into free and slave states undermines Lincoln's argument that the Union cannot exist forever with this division. Therefore, option B is the best answer.
