## Get Reflection:
  Action: Answer(B)

Explanation:
Passage 1 presents a view on the role of women in society, arguing that women should conform to a subordinate position and exert influence through peaceful and benevolent means. Passage 2, written by Grimké, takes issue with the primary argument of Passage 1, arguing that women have equal rights and responsibilities as moral beings. Grimké's argument directly challenges the idea that women should be subordinate to men, and instead advocates for their equal status and opportunities. Therefore, option B is the best answer, as Passage 2 takes issue with the primary argument of Passage 1.
