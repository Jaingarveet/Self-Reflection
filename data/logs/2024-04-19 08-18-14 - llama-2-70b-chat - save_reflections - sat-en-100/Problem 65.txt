## Get Reflection:
  Action: Answer("B")

The main idea of the last paragraph is that Mr. Peters behaves as if he is a younger version of himself. The paragraph describes his efforts to present himself as still young and powerful, such as straightening his tie self-consciously and flashing his diamond ring at the women at the next table. This suggests that he is trying to act younger than he actually is, and is therefore behaving as if he is a younger version of himself.

Error Keywords:

* Neglects
* Preoccupied
* Growing old

The passage does not mention Mr. Peters neglecting his family members or being preoccupied with the knowledge that he is growing old.
