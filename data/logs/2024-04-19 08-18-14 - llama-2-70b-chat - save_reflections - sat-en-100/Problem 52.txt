## Get Reflection:
  Action: Answer(D)

Explanation:
Bryan's criticism of American imperialism in Passage 2 suggests that he would disagree with Beveridge's vision of expanding American governance to island territories. Bryan believes that the principles of self-government and liberty that the US was founded upon would be compromised by such a policy. Therefore, option D is the best answer, as it states that the islanders would object to being governed by Americans, which aligns with Bryan's argument.
