## Get Reflection:
  Action: Answer("B")

Explanation:
The passage states that Volkov tested Hodick and Sievers' model by applying an electrical current to the open lobes of the Venus flytrap. However, the passage also states that Hodick and Sievers proposed that the flytrap stored information regarding how many hairs have been touched in the electric charge of its leaf. Volkov's measurements did not corroborate a central element of Hodick and Sievers' model, as he applied an electrical current directly to the trap, rather than measuring the electric charge of the leaf. Therefore, option B is the best answer.

Option A is incorrect because the passage does not suggest that Volkov's understanding of Hodick and Sievers' model was incorrect.

Option C is incorrect because the passage does not suggest that Hodick and Sievers would have objected to Volkov's direct application of an electrical current.

Option D is incorrect because the passage does not suggest that Volkov's technology was not available to Hodick and Sievers.
