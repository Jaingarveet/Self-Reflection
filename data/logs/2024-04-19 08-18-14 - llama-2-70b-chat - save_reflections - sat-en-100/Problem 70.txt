## Get Reflection:
  Action: Answer("D")

Explanation:
The authors of both passages would most likely agree with statement D: They generally enjoyed fewer rights than men did.

In Passage 1, the author argues that women are excluded from public employments and political rights, and that this exclusion is justified because it leads to a greater sum of mutual happiness for both sexes. The author also suggests that women are not suited for strenuous habits and onerous duties and are instead summoned to gentle occupations and the cares of the home.

In Passage 2, the author argues that women need education to become the companion of man and to understand their duty and the true principle of patriotism. The author also suggests that the education and situation of women shut them out from investigations into the moral and civil interest of mankind.

Both passages suggest that women in the eighteenth century had fewer rights and opportunities than men, and that this was seen as a natural and just state of affairs. Therefore, option D is the best answer.
