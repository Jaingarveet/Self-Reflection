## Get Reflection:
  I apologize for my mistake. Let's analyze the question and options again.

The correct answer is indeed A: She will consider his proposal inappropriate.

Akira's fear is that Chie will not take his proposal seriously or will view it as inappropriate, which is reflected in option A. Chie's initial reaction to Akira's proposal, where she views him as a child and compares him to Naomi, also suggests that she may not take his proposal seriously. Additionally, Akira's concern about the unseemliness of his proposal and his worry about being judged by Chie further support this answer.

Option B, She will mistake his earnestness for immaturity, is also a possible reaction from Chie, but it is not the most likely one based on the given text.

Option C, She will consider his unscheduled visit an imposition, is not directly related to Akira's fear or Chie's reaction.

Option D, She will underestimate the sincerity of his emotions, is unlikely given the context.

Therefore, the correct answer is A: She will consider his proposal inappropriate.
