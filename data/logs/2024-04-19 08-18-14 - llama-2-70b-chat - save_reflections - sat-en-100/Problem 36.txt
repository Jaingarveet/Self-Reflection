## Get Reflection:
  Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I misunderstood the perspective of the narrator. 
I thought the narrator was an outsider, a member of the community, and didn't realize they were actually one of Miss Spivey's former students. 
This led me to choose option C, an anonymous member of the community, instead of option A, one of Miss Spivey's former students.

Error Keywords:
- Perspective error
- Narrative viewpoint error
- Misinterpretation of the text

Solution:
I should have carefully read the passage and paid attention to the narrator's perspective.
