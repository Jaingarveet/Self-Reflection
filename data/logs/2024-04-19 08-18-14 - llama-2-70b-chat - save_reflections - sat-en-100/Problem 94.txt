## Get Reflection:
  Action: Answer(B)

The correct answer is B: attuned to her immediate surroundings.

The narrator is described as paying close attention to her surroundings, noticing details such as the polished wooden floors, the shiny glass cases, and the different qualities of inksticks. She is also described as remembering her aunt's teachings about the importance of effort and intention in creating art. These details suggest that the narrator is someone who is attuned to her surroundings and values attention to detail.

There is no evidence in the passage to suggest that the narrator is reserved around unfamiliar people (choice A). While she is initially hesitant to approach her uncle, she quickly warms up to him and engages in conversation.

There is also no evidence to suggest that the narrator is sympathetic to the needs of others (choice C). While she is polite and respectful to her uncle and father, there is no indication that she is particularly sympathetic or empathetic towards them.

Finally, there is no evidence to suggest that the narrator is anxious about her responsibilities (choice D). While she is described as remembering her aunt's teachings about the importance of effort and intention, there is no indication that she is anxious or stressed about her responsibilities.

Therefore, the correct answer is B: attuned to her immediate surroundings.
