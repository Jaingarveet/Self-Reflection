  Action: Answer("C")

The question that Maguire's study of mental athletes was primarily intended to answer is: "Does heightened memorization ability reflect abnormal brain structure or an unusual use of normal brain structure?" Maguire and her team wanted to find out if the brains of mental athletes were structurally different from those of the control subjects, or if they were somehow just making better use of memory abilities that we all possess. They found that the brains of the mental athletes appeared to be indistinguishable from those of the control subjects, but that they were engaging different circuitry when memorizing information. Specifically, they were using regions of the brain involved in visual memory and spatial navigation, such as the right posterior hippocampal region, which was also enlarged in London cabbies who had spent years navigating the city's streets. This suggests that the mental athletes' heightened memorization ability is the result of an unusual use of normal brain structure, rather than abnormal brain structure. Therefore, choice C is the correct answer.
