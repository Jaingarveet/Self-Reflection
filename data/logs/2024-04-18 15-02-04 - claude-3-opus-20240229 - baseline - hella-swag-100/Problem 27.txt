  C: continues to fly through the air as well as a large group of people watching on the sides.
  D: continues flying around on a kite around the room and others flying kites.
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The question describes a scene where a man is flying kites in an auditorium with a large group of people watching.
2. Choice A mentions the kite landing on a roof and the person looking at the camera, which doesn't fit the context of an indoor auditorium.
3. Choice B mentions the person walking away with a woman speaking to the crowd, which could be a plausible continuation of the scene.
4. Choice C describes the person continuing to fly through the air along with a large group of people watching from the sides, which aligns with the initial description of the scene.
5. Choice D mentions others also flying kites in the room, but the initial description only mentioned one person flying kites.
Considering the context and the most logical continuation of the described scene, Choice C seems to be the most appropriate answer.
