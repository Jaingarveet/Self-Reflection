Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to escape extreme pressure employment [title] Come to grips with the fact that you can't take it anymore. [step] The lower you've hit bottom, the higher you will go. Consider stopping caring about your work/colleagues criticism and you might feel more relaxed in the short term.
Choices:
  A: Richard templar says in the rules of wealth act as if you don't need the money and people will no longer have power over you. [title] Believe, from deep in your gut, that you can do better.
  B: But as time goes on, the hard way tends to become ever harder. Stop caring about what others say/look at what they like.
  C: [substeps] Don't be afraid to look back on and the future. Remind yourself that it is impossible to work your way to the top, but soon you will be jumping from top to bottom like a desperate schoolgirl.
  D: Give your notice to somebody who simply deserves it. This is an integral part of the healthy and productive life you lead.
## Assistant 2:
This is a challenging question as none of the answer choices provide a fully appropriate or sensible completion to the given text. The original text seems to be giving questionable advice about dealing with extreme work pressure by essentially giving up and not caring. 
The best answer choice would be one that steers the advice in a more constructive direction, such as seeking support, setting boundaries, and making positive changes. Of the given choices, D comes closest to this by suggesting giving notice and moving on to lead a healthier life.
However, the phrasing of D is still somewhat odd and abrupt. A more appropriate completion might be something like: "Consider whether it's time to move on from this unhealthy situation. Thoughtfully plan your exit and next steps to transition to a role and environment more conducive to your wellbeing and success. Prioritize your mental health and don't be afraid to seek support during this challenging time."
But constrained to the given choices, I'll select D as the most reasonable, while acknowledging it's still not an ideal fit.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
