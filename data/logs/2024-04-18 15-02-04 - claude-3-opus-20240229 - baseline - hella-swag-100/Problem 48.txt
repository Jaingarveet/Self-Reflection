Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to shop for speakers [title] Decide how you'll use the speakers. [step] The variety of speaker builds suits individual speakers for different tasks. For casual music listening, a pair of bookshelf speakers would be more than enough.
Choices:
  A: For, for church music listening, a pair of high performance speakers would be perfect for easy listening during worship periods. For assembly groups, a 4-prong speaker would be adequate, but for parties, ladies could now stand between the blocks.
  B: However, for business calls or social gatherings you may also consider other options; ipods and digital speakers are both available. It's important to consider the quality of your speakers, along with the layout of your space.
  C: Personal speakers are fairly easy to get into. A solo recording of 10 seconds played on your ipod or two of jumps up and down on a bulletin board might work for the majority of speakers.
  D: Those who desire a more intensive experience can upgrade to standing speakers. Surround sound systems are also a high-end option.
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The question is asking for the most likely completion to the given text about how to shop for speakers.
2. The given text mentions that the choice of speakers depends on the intended use. It gives the example that bookshelf speakers are suitable for casual music listening.
3. Looking at the choices:

   - Choice D mentions upgrading to standing speakers and surround sound systems for a more intensive experience, which logically follows from the given text about casual listening.
4. Choice D seems to be the most coherent and logical continuation of the given text.
