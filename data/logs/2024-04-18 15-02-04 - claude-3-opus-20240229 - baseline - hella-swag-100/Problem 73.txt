## System:
You are an expert in Common Sense.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")

Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to decode binary numbers [title] Remember that in binary 1 is " on : [step] And 0 is " off. " [title] Choose the binary number that you want to decode. [title] Give each number a value, starting from the extreme right.
Choices:
  A: [substeps] For example, using the number 1001001 , 1=1, + 0=2, + 0=4, + 1=8, + 0=16, + 0=32, + 1=64. The number becomes : 32 + 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1.
  B: [title] Draw a circle around your decimal place (which is considered the edge of the decimal place) (the first place furthest from it). [title] Place the " on : [step] " digit on the left side of the decimal place.
  C: [title] Put a value next, and add either 1 or 2 values. [step] For example: " 1/1 (1/1/1 and 1/1 1/1.
  D: [step] But the content button will say " value " is set to 0 and the denominator when you set down the values. Example in numerary 1, the number (and the numerator) is " 10, " but 0 may still be the clue you've referenced.
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The question is asking about decoding binary numbers. The given text explains that in binary, 1 represents "on" and 0 represents "off".
2. It then instructs to choose a binary number to decode and give each digit a value, starting from the rightmost digit.
3. Looking at the answer choices:
   - Choice A provides an example of assigning values to each digit, doubling the value for each position from right to left (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64). This matches the standard method for decoding binary numbers.
   - Choices B, C, and D do not make sense in the context of decoding binary numbers. They mention concepts like decimal places, fractions, and denominators which are not relevant.
4. Therefore, choice A is the most logical and correct completion of the given text.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
