## Assistant 2:
Thought process:
- The woman is dipping a rag in a bowl of olive oil, likely to use it for some purpose.
- Putting the oily rag in the towel bin doesn't make sense and would be messy.
- Rubbing the rag over the side of an olive oil can seems pointless.
- Pouring olive oil into a contact lens is illogical and serves no purpose.
- Rubbing the oil-soaked rag on a wooden chair suggests she is using the olive oil to polish or condition the wood, which is a common use for olive oil.
