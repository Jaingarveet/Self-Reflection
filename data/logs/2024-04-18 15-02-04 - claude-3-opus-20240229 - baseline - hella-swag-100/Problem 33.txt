Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to clean a dryer drum [title] Unplug the dryer. [step] Before you start, you should unplug the dryer to prevent accidents. The plug is usually located behind the machine.
Choices:
  A: [substeps] If there is an inside fitting you can remove it and dispose of it. [title] Run your dryer on high heat.
  B: If there is static behind the agitator coils, remove this and check for static. Some models may even have a switch to turn on or off.
  C: It will be located roughly 1 foot (50 cm) from the dryer. [title] Run the dryer on neutral mode.
  D: Test it to be sure that you have unplugged it correctly. [substeps] If you have a gas dryer, you will also want to shut off the gas.
## Assistant 2:
To determine the most likely completion, I'll consider what makes the most sense in the context of cleaning a dryer drum safely.
A: Removing an inside fitting and running the dryer on high heat doesn't logically follow the safety step of unplugging the dryer. This is unlikely to be correct.
B: Static and agitator coils are not typically part of a dryer, and this step doesn't follow logically from unplugging the dryer for safety. This is also unlikely to be correct.
C: Specifying the location of the plug is somewhat relevant, but running the dryer on "neutral mode" after unplugging it doesn't make sense. Dryers don't have a neutral mode, and you wouldn't run it after unplugging for safety. This is probably not correct.
D: Testing to ensure you've unplugged the dryer correctly is a logical safety precaution that follows unplugging the dryer. Additionally, shutting off the gas for a gas dryer is another important safety step before cleaning the dryer drum. This choice makes the most sense in the context of the question.
