Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to make a paper dreidel garland [title] Get six to eight sheets of craft paper. [step] You will need six to eight sheets of craft paper to make the dreidels. Pick craft paper that has an interesting design, such as hebrew letters, or a plain design if you are planning on decorating the dreidels later.
Choices:
  A: Go for paper that is thick and durable as you will be gluing them together. [substeps] You can also use colored craft paper in a certain color scheme, such as blue and yellow, if you do not plan on decorating them later.
  B: [substeps] Choose paper that has no patterns or embellishments. You want the paper to be smooth and no hairs or wrinkles are present.
  C: [substeps] Craft paper typically comes in multiple shapes and colors. If your craft paper has one shape, like blossoms, flowers, animals, and designs, choose an array to paint the dreidels on.
  D: You may wish to make your garland smaller based on how strong the paper is, or you may use more narrow representations such as images, writing utensils or sequins. [substeps] If you plan on making the garland from scratch, craft paper is preferred.
## Assistant 2:
To determine the most likely completion, I'll consider what makes the most sense in the context of making a paper dreidel garland:
A: This choice provides relevant additional details - using thick, durable paper is important for a garland that will hold together well. The suggestion of color schemes also fits with the idea of an attractive holiday decoration.
B: Choosing completely plain paper with no patterns or texture seems less ideal for a decorative craft project. Some texture or pattern would likely enhance the appearance of the dreidels.
C: The mention of specific shapes like flowers and animals seems out of place for a dreidel garland. Dreidels have a specific traditional shape.
D: The suggestion to potentially make the garland smaller based on paper strength is reasonable. However, the rest of this choice mentioning narrow representations and making the garland from scratch seems less relevant and clear compared to choice A.
Choice A provides the most relevant, helpful additional details for making an attractive and durable paper dreidel garland.
Action: Answer("A")
