Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
6 pita breads = [REDACTED] rolls
[REDACTED] rolls = 5 baguettes
We need to find [REDACTED] baguettes = ? pita breads
Let's start by finding the number of falafels in 1 roll.
6 pita breads = [REDACTED] rolls
So, 1 roll = 6/[REDACTED] = [REDACTED] pita breads
[REDACTED] rolls = 5 baguettes
So, 1 roll = 5/[REDACTED] baguettes
Therefore, 1 baguette = [REDACTED]/5 rolls = [REDACTED]/5 * [REDACTED] pita breads = 9/5 pita breads
[REDACTED] baguettes = [REDACTED] * 9/5 pita breads = 18/5 pita breads
So, [REDACTED] baguettes contain the same amount of falafel as 18/5 pita breads.
We need to simplify this fraction.
18/5 = [REDACTED].6
18/5 = [REDACTED] [REDACTED]/5
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
We need to find the number of pita breads that contain the same amount of falafel as 2 baguettes.
We know that 1 baguette = 9/5 pita breads.
So, 2 baguettes = 2 * 9/5 pita breads = 18/5 pita breads.
