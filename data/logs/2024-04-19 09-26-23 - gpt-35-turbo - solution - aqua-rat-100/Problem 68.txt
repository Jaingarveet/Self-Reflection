Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
The GCF of two numbers is 11.
The LCM of two numbers is 7700.
One of the numbers is 350.
We can find the other number by dividing the product of 350 and 7700 by 350 and then dividing by 11.
The other number is (350*7700)/350/11 = 700.
