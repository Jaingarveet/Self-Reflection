Question: Alex and Jacob works at a toy shop that make toys. Alex takes 7 hours to make a toy, and Jacob takes 9 hours to make a toy. During a month, both of them makes 35 toys in total. If both of them have worked for almost similar number of hours how many toys have been prepared by Jacob?
Choices:
  A: 15
  B: 16
  C: 17
  D: 18
  E: 19
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
Let's assume that Alex and Jacob made a toys and b toys respectively.
The time taken by Alex and Jacob to make a toys and b toys respectively can be calculated using the formula: Time = (Work / Rate)
Let's assume that Alex worked for t hours and Jacob worked for (t + d) hours.
Using the above information, we can form two equations and solve for d.
Equation 1: t/7 + (t + d)/9 = 35
Equation 2: a + b = 35
Solving equation 1 for t, we get t = (3[REDACTED] - 4d)/23
Substituting t in equation 2, we get a = (23*35 - 9d)/23 = 35 - (9d/23)
Since both of them worked for almost similar hours, we can assume that the difference in their working hours is negligible. Therefore, we can assume that d is very small compared to 3[REDACTED]. 
Using this approximation, we can solve for d as follows:
t = (3[REDACTED] - 4d)/23 = (3[REDACTED]/23) - (4d/23)
Substituting this value of t in equation 1, we get:
(3[REDACTED]/[REDACTED]1) - (4d/[REDACTED]1) + [(3[REDACTED]/[REDACTED]1) - (4d/[REDACTED]1) + d]/9 = 35/[REDACTED]1
Simplifying the above equation, we get:
d = [REDACTED]
Substituting d = [REDACTED] in the equation for a, we get:
a = 35 - (9d/23) = [REDACTED]
Therefore, Jacob made 20 toys.
