## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: Points A, B, C, D lie in this order on the circumference of a circle. Minor arc AC is 160°, and minor arc BD is 150°. If B bisects minor arc AC, then what is the measure of minor arc AD?
Choices:
  A: 80°
  B: 130°
  C: 140°
  D: 160°
  E: 220°
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
If [REDACTED] bisects minor arc A[REDACTED], then the measure of minor arc A[REDACTED] is half the measure of minor arc A[REDACTED].
The measure of minor arc A[REDACTED] is [REDACTED], so the measure of minor arc A[REDACTED] is [REDACTED].
The measure of minor arc B[REDACTED] is 150°.
The sum of the measures of minor arc A[REDACTED] and minor arc B[REDACTED] is equal to the circumference of the circle.
Let x be the measure of minor arc A[REDACTED].
Then, x + [REDACTED] + 150° = 360° (the circumference of the circle)
Solving for x, we get x = [REDACTED].
