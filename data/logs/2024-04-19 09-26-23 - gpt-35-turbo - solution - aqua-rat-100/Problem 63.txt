## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
The team won 20 matches.
The team lost [REDACTED]% of their matches.
To find the number of matches lost, we need to calculate [REDACTED]% of the total number of matches played.
[REDACTED]% of the total number of matches played is 0.[REDACTED]*(20+lost) = 6+0.[REDACTED]*lost.
We know that the team lost [REDACTED]% of their matches, so 0.[REDACTED]*total_matches = lost.
0.[REDACTED]*total_matches = lost = 0.[REDACTED]*(20+lost)
0.[REDACTED]*total_matches = 6+0.[REDACTED]*lost
0.[REDACTED]*total_matches - 0.[REDACTED]*lost = 6
0.[REDACTED]*(total_matches - lost) = 6
total_matches - lost = 20
lost = 20 - total_matches
0.[REDACTED]*total_matches = 20 - total_matches
0.[REDACTED]*total_matches + total_matches = 20
1.[REDACTED]*total_matches = 20
total_matches = 20/1.[REDACTED]
total_matches = 1[REDACTED].[REDACTED]8
The team lost [REDACTED]% of their matches, which is 0.[REDACTED]*1[REDACTED].[REDACTED]8 = 4.61, rounded to [REDACTED].
## Assistant 2:
Action: Answer("D") 
The team lost 30% of their matches, which is 0.3*50 = 15 matches. Therefore, the answer is 15, which corresponds to choice D.
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
