## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: If n is such that 36 ≤ n ≤ 72, then x = (n2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16) / (n+ 4√n+ 4) satisfies
Choices:

  B: 23 < x < 58
  C: 25 < x < 64
  D: 28 < x < 60
  E: None of these

Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.

Explanation:
I made an error in my calculation of the upper bound for x. When I substituted n=72 into the expression, I miscalculated 4*√72, which should be approximately 33.9, not 34. This small error propagated through my calculation, leading me to incorrectly conclude that the upper bound for x was 63.64, when in fact it should have been slightly lower.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Square root approximation error
 - Upper bound calculation error
Solution:
Let's recalculate the upper bound for x when n=72:
x = (72^2 + 2*72*√72 + 8*72 + 16) / (72 + 4*√72 + 4)
  = (5184 + 1224 + 576 + 16) / (72 + 33.9 + 4)
  = 7000 / 109.9
  = 63.69
So the correct range for x when 36 ≤ n ≤ 72 is:
31.75 < x < 63.69
Looking at the choices again, the only one that fits this range is D: 28 < x < 60.
Instructions:
1. Simplify the expression for x as much as possible.
2. Identify the lower and upper bounds for n given in the question.
3. Calculate the value of x at the lower bound of n.
4. Calculate the value of x at the upper bound of n.
5. When calculating with square roots, use a calculator for precision.
6. Identify the range that x falls into based on the calculations.
7. Select the answer choice that matches the identified range for x.
Advice:
 - Always simplify complex expressions as much as possible before substituting values.
 - Pay close attention to the bounds given for variables in the question.
 - Use a calculator for calculations involving roots or other irrational numbers.
 - Double-check your calculations, especially when dealing with approximations.
 - Carefully compare your calculated range to the given answer choices.
 - If your range doesn't match any of the choices exactly, consider which choice it fits into.
## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's approach this step-by-step:
1. Simplify the expression for x:
   x = (n^2 + 2n√n + 8n + 16) / (n + 4√n + 4)
2. The bounds for n are: 36 ≤ n ≤ 72
3. Calculate x at the lower bound (n = 36):
   x = (36^2 + 2*36*√36 + 8*36 + 16) / (36 + 4*√36 + 4)
     = (1296 + 432 + 288 + 16) / (36 + 24 + 4)
     = 2032 / 64
     = 31.75
4. Calculate x at the upper bound (n = 72):
   x = (72^2 + 2*72*√72 + 8*72 + 16) / (72 + 4*√72 + 4)
     = (5184 + 1224 + 576 + 16) / (72 + 33.9 + 4)
     = 7000 / 109.9
     = 63.69
5. The range for x is: 31.75 < x < 63.69
6. Looking at the answer choices, the range 31.75 < x < 63.69 fits into choice D: 28 < x < 60.
