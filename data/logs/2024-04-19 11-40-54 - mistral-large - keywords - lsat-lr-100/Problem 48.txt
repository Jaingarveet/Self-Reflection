## Assistant 2:
Reflection:
I previously misunderstood the argument and overlooked the main concern, which is the relationship between marketing, enrollment, and spending. The president's argument is that in order to maintain the quality of education, they must increase enrollment through marketing, otherwise they will have to reduce spending.

Thought:
The conclusion of the president's argument is that they must market their programs more aggressively to increase enrollment and avoid reducing spending. This can only be drawn if we assume that marketing will lead to increased enrollment, and that increased enrollment will prevent the need to reduce spending.

Action: Answer("E")
