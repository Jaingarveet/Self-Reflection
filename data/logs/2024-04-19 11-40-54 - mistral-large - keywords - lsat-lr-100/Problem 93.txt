## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The conclusion drawn in the argument is that Ellsworth is offended by the suggestions in the media that he has engaged in unethical business practices. The argument assumes that Ellsworth's self-righteousness is the reason why he is offended by the suggestions.
The correct answer must be an assumption that connects Ellsworth's self-righteousness to his offense at the suggestions.
Choice A is a logical fallacy because it assumes that all self-righteous people are actually unethical.
Choice B is incorrect because the argument does not mention any previous accusations of unethical business practices.
Choice C is a misinterpretation of the premise because it assumes that Ellsworth is a hypocrite, which is not stated in the argument.
Choice D is incorrect because the argument does not state that Ellsworth is innocent of all wrongdoing.
Choice E is the correct answer because it assumes that self-righteous people are easily offended, which connects Ellsworth's self-righteousness to his offense at the suggestions.
Action: Answer("E")
## Result:
