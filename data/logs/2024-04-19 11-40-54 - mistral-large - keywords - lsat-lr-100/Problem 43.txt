Topic: Law
Context: Ethicist: Marital vows often contain the promise to love "until death do us part." If "love" here refers to a feeling, then this promise makes no sense, for feelings are not within one's control, and a promise to do something not within one's control makes no sense. Thus, no one—including those making marital vows—should take "love" in this context to be referring to feelings.
Question: The ethicist's conclusion follows logically if which one of the following is assumed?
Choices:
  A: None of our feelings are within our control.
  B: People should not make promises to do something that is not within their control.
  C: "Love" can legitimately be taken to refer to something other than feelings.
  D: Promises should not be interpreted in such a way that they make no sense.
  E: Promises that cannot be kept do not make any sense.

## Assistant 2:
Reflection:
In my previous answer, I made a logical reasoning error by assuming that the ethicist's conclusion was based on the idea that feelings are not within our control. However, the ethicist's argument is focused on the idea that promises should not be made for things that are not within our control.

The correct answer is "B: People should not make promises to do something that is not within their control." This assumption is necessary for the ethicist's conclusion to follow logically. The ethicist argues that since feelings are not within our control, promising to love someone (in the sense of having a certain feeling) until death does not make sense. Therefore, the ethicist assumes that people should not make promises to do something that is not within their control.

Action: Answer("B")
