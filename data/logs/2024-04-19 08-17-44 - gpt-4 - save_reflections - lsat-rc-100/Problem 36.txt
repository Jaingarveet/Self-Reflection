## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misinterpreted the critics' argument. I focused on the idea of multiple cultural perspectives, which led me to choose option C. However, the critics' main point was about the influence of historical and social circumstances on a culture's values, which is reflected in option B.
Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation
- Reading comprehension
- Argument analysis
Solution:
The critics argue that the value systems of cultures arise from their unique social and historical circumstances. They believe that these values cannot be fully understood if approached solely from the perspective of the majority culture. This argument aligns with option B, which states that the historical and social circumstances of a culture can play an important role in the development of that culture's values.
