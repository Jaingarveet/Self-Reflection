# Model: gpt-4 | Task: save_reflection | Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Problem 71 of 100
## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misinterpreted the author's argument in passage B. I focused on the criticism of the assumption that all human behavior can be explained by the desire to propagate one's genes, but I overlooked the author's point that to decisively explain a behavior, it must be reasonable only if one had that interest. 
Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation
- Reading comprehension
- Inference
Solution:
The author of passage B criticizes the assumption that all human behavior can be explained by the desire to propagate one's genes. However, the author also argues that there are often multiple interests that could explain a given behavior, and that it is a mistake to assume that a behavior is only reasonable if it serves the interest of gene propagation. This criticism aligns with choice C, which suggests that to explain a behavior in evolutionary terms, it is sufficient to show that the behavior would have improved the reproductive success of early humans. 
Instructions:
1. Read both passages carefully and understand the main arguments.
2. Understand the question and what it is asking.
3. Identify the author's criticism in passage B.
4. Match the author's criticism with the choices given.
5. Choose the answer that best aligns with the author's argument.
Advice:
- Always read the passages and the question carefully.
- Understand the main arguments of the passages.
- Pay attention to the author's criticism and what it implies.
- Be careful not to misinterpret the author's argument.
- Always double-check your answer.
