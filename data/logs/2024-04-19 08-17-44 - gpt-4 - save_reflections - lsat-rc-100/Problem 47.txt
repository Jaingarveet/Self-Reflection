## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I focused on the tone of the passages rather than their scope. I interpreted the question as asking about the certainty of the claims made in each passage, rather than the breadth of the topics they covered.
Error Keywords:
- Comprehension error
- Scope error
- Focus error
Solution:
Passage A focuses on a specific case of a defendant challenging his conviction based on fingerprint evidence, and discusses the reliability of fingerprint identification in that context. Passage B, on the other hand, discusses the general issues and uncertainties surrounding fingerprint identification, without tying it to a specific case. Therefore, Passage B is more general in focus.
Instructions:
1. Read both passages carefully.
2. Identify the main points and arguments in each passage.
3. Compare the scope of the topics covered in each passage.
4. Determine whether one passage is more specific or more general in focus than the other.
5. Choose the answer that best describes the difference in focus between the two passages.
Advice:
- Always read the question carefully and make sure you understand what it's asking.
- Pay attention to the scope of the topics covered in each passage, not just the tone or certainty of the claims made.
- When comparing two passages, consider all aspects of their content, including the breadth of the topics they cover.
- Don't rush your answer. Take the time to fully understand the question and the passages before making your choice.
