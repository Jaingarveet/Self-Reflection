## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misinterpreted the author's argument. I focused on the economic efficiency and convenience of digital publishing, but overlooked the role of literary agents in driving the transition to the new model.
Error Keywords:
- Reading comprehension error
- Misinterpretation
- Inference error
Solution:
The author discusses the economic advantages of digital publishing and suggests that these advantages will lead to a shift in the publishing industry. The author also mentions that literary agents could demand a larger share of revenue for their authors, which could put pressure on traditional publishers to adapt. Therefore, the author would likely agree with statement C: "The demands of literary agents will be the impetus for completing the transition to the new digital model."
