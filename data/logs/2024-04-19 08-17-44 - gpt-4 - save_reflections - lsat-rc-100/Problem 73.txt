Solution:
The passage discusses how African American writers have used music as a theme and metaphor in their work. It then focuses on Toni Morrison's novel "Jazz", which uses a narrative style that is analogous to the structure of a jazz band, specifically referencing the work of Duke Ellington. The characteristic of "Jazz" that is also present in the work of some other African American writers is the use of music as a theme and metaphor. Therefore, the correct answer is E.
