Question: Sheep Challenge Evolution A species of sheep lives on the Scottish island of Hirta. Hirta has plenty of grass for the sheep to eat, and no natural predators of the sheep live on the island. Some sheep have dark wool, and some have light wool. The sheep with dark wool tend to be much larger and stronger than the sheep with light wool. However, researchers have found that in the last 20 years, the sheep with light wool have increased in number. Usually, strength and size help animals survive and breed. A new sheep predator is introduced to the island. Which change to the sheep population will most likely occur first?
Choices:
  A: a decrease in the population of sheep with dark wool
  B: a decrease in the population of sheep with light wool
  C: an increase in the population of sheep with dark wool
  D: an increase in the population of sheep with light wool
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that the sheep with light wool would have an advantage over the sheep with dark wool when a new predator is introduced. However, the question states that the sheep with dark wool are larger and stronger, which usually helps animals survive and breed. Therefore, the sheep with dark wool are more likely to survive the introduction of a new predator. The increase in the population of sheep with light wool in the last 20 years may be due to other factors, such as changes in the environment or breeding patterns.
Error Keywords:
 - Assumption error
 - Misinterpretation error
 - Logical error
Solution:
The sheep with dark wool are larger and stronger, which usually helps animals survive and breed. Therefore, the sheep with dark wool are more likely to survive the introduction of a new predator. The increase in the population of sheep with light wool in the last 20 years may be due to other factors, such as changes in the environment or breeding patterns. When a new predator is introduced, the sheep with light wool are more likely to be targeted and killed, which will result in a decrease in their population.
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and understand the problem.
2. Identify the characteristics of the sheep with dark wool and the sheep with light wool.
3. Consider how these characteristics may affect the survival and breeding of the sheep.
4. Consider how the introduction of a new predator may affect the survival and breeding of the sheep.
5. Choose the answer that best matches your reasoning.
6. Double-check your answer to ensure accuracy.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always consider all the information provided in the question.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your answer to ensure accuracy.
 - Remember that assumptions and logical errors can lead to incorrect answers.
