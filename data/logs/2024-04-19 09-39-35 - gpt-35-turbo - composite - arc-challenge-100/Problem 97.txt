Question: What is the first step of the process in the formation of sedimentary rocks?
Choices:
  A: erosion
  B: deposition
  C: compaction
  D: cementation
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I did not recall the correct order of the steps in the formation of sedimentary rocks. 
The correct first step in the formation of sedimentary rocks is [REDACTED], not [REDACTED]. 
Error Keywords:
 - Recall error
 - Order error
 - Misinterpretation error
Solution:
The correct first step in the formation of sedimentary rocks is [REDACTED]. 
Erosion is the process by which rocks and minerals are broken down into smaller pieces by wind, water, or ice. 
These smaller pieces are then transported and deposited in a new location, which is the second step in the formation of sedimentary rocks. 
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and understand the problem.
2. Recall the steps involved in the formation of sedimentary rocks.
3. Identify the correct first step in the process.
4. Choose the answer that matches your knowledge of the correct order of the steps.
5. Double-check your answer to ensure accuracy.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always recall the relevant information from memory.
 - Always double-check your answer to ensure accuracy.
 - Remember that the order of steps in a process is important.
