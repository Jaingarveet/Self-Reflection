Topic: Law

Context: An administrator must assign parking spaces to six new employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young. Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.

Question: Which one of the following could be the assignment of parking spaces to the new employees?

Choices:

A: #1: Young; #2: Souza; #3: Vaughn; #4: Robertson; #5: Togowa; #6: Xu

B: #1: Vaughn; #2: Togowa; #3: Young; #4: Souza; #5: Robertson; #6: Xu

C: #1: Togowa; #2: Young; #3: Xu; #4: Robertson; #5: Souza; #6: Vaughn

D: #1: Togowa; #2: Robertson; #3: Young; #4: Souza; #5: Vaughn; #6: Xu

E: #1: Souza; #2: Togowa; #3: Young; #4: Robertson; #5: Xu; #6: Vaughn

Action: Answer("D")

---

The correct answer is (E) Souza; Togowa; Young; Robertson; Souza; Vaughn; Xu.

Explanation:

The rule that Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa means that Young cannot be assigned parking space #1 or #2, as these are the lowest-numbered parking spaces. Therefore, Young must be assigned parking space #3 or #4.

The rule that Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza means that Xu cannot be assigned parking space #1 or #2, as these are the lowest-numbered parking spaces. Therefore, Xu must be assigned parking space #3 or #4.

The rule that Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young means that Robertson cannot be assigned parking space #1 or #2, as these are the lowest-numbered parking spaces. Therefore, Robertson must be assigned parking space #3 or #4.

The rule that Souza must be assigned parking space #1 or #2 means that Souza cannot be assigned parking space #3 or #4, as these are the higher-numbered parking spaces. Therefore, Souza must be assigned parking space #1 or #2.

The rule that Vaughn must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa means that Vaughn cannot be assigned parking space #1 or #2, as these are the lowest-numbered parking spaces. Therefore, Vaughn must be assigned parking space #3 or #4.

The rule that Xu must be assigned parking space #1 or #2 means that Xu cannot be assigned parking space #3 or #4, as these are the higher-numbered parking spaces. Therefore, Xu must be assigned parking space #1 or #2.

Therefore, the correct assignment of parking spaces to the new employees is:

Souza; Togowa; Young; Robertson; Souza; Vaughn; Xu.
