  My apologies for the mistake. Here is my revised answer:

Action: Answer("D")

The correct answer is (D) Exactly two French novels and exactly two plays are selected. This option meets all the given requirements:

* No more than four French works are selected, and at least three but no more than four novels are selected.
* At least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected, which is true since there are 3 French novels and 3 Russian novels.
* If both French plays are selected, then the Russian play is not selected, which is also true since only one French play is selected.

Therefore, the organizer's selection of works must be (D) Exactly two French novels and exactly two plays are selected.
