## Get Reflection:
 Explanation:
You have correctly analyzed the problem and identified the possible selections based on the given requirements. Great job!

The correct answer is indeed option E: three French novels, two Russian novels, one Russian play. This selection meets all the requirements given in the problem, as you have mentioned:

1. No more than four French works are selected, so we can eliminate options A and E, as they have more than four French works.
2. At least three but no more than four novels are selected, so we can eliminate option C, as it has only two novels.
3. At least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected, so we can eliminate option B, as it has more Russian novels than French novels.
4. If both French plays are selected, then the Russian play is not selected, so we can eliminate option D, as it selects the Russian play.

Well done! It's important to carefully analyze the problem and identify the possible selections based on the given requirements.
