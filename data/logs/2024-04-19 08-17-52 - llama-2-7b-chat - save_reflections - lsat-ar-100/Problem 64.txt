## Get Reflection:
 Explanation:
I made a mistake in my previous answer. I incorrectly identified the correct answer as option C, but I should have chosen option A.

Here's why:

If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then Parra must work in Zone 3. This is because Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other, and Quinn works in Zone 3. Therefore, Parra must work in a different sales zone than Quinn, which means he must work in Zone 3.

So, the correct answer is option A: Kim works in Zone 2.
