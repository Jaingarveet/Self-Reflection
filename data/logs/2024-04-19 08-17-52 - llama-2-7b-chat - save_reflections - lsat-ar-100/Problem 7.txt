## Get Reflection:
  Great job! You have correctly identified the correct answer as option B. Here's a breakdown of your reasoning and the steps you took to arrive at the correct answer:

1. You analyzed the conditions given in the question and identified the key constraints: Franco does not testify on the same day as Garcia, Iturbe testifies on Wednesday, exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday, Hong does not testify on Monday, and at least one witness testifies on Monday.
2. You used a truth table to determine the possible schedules that meet the conditions. This was a great way to visualize the possible combinations of witnesses and their testimonies.
3. You observed that the only possible schedule that meets all the conditions is: Franco does not testify on the same day as Hong, Garcia testifies on Tuesday, Iturbe testifies on Wednesday, and Hong does not testify on Monday. Jackson is the only witness scheduled to testify on Monday.
4. You concluded that the correct answer is option B, which states that Hong is scheduled to testify on Tuesday.

Overall, your reasoning and approach were logical and systematic. Great job!
