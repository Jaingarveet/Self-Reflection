## Get Reflection:
  Great job! You have correctly identified the correct order of compositions for the concert. Your explanation is clear and concise, and you have provided a step-by-step analysis of how each condition is satisfied.

Here are some additional tips to help you improve your performance:

1. Read the question carefully: Make sure you read the question thoroughly and understand what is being asked. In this case, the question explicitly states that the compositions are to be performed consecutively and one at a time, which helped you identify the correct order.
2. Break down the problem into smaller parts: Instead of trying to solve the entire problem at once, break it down into smaller parts and tackle each part separately. This will help you identify the key conditions that need to be satisfied and make it easier to find the correct order.
3. Use visual aids: Visual aids such as diagrams or flowcharts can help you visualize the problem and identify the possible combinations of compositions that satisfy the conditions.
4. Check your work: Once you have identified the possible orders, double-check your work to make sure you have satisfied all the conditions. In this case, you did a great job of checking your work by going through each condition and explaining how the order satisfies it.

Overall, great job! Keep practicing and you will become more confident and proficient in solving similar problems.
