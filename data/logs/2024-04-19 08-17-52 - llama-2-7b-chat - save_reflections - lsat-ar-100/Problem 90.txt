## Get Reflection:
  Great job! You have correctly identified the answer. Here's why:

The correct answer is (E) a 3-day website target.

From the given conditions, we can conclude that:

1. None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
2. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
3. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.

So, if a 3-day website target is set for more than one client, it violates condition 1. Therefore, option (E) is the correct answer.

Well done!
