  My apologies for the mistake in my previous response. Here is the corrected answer:

Action: Answer("D")

The correct answer is (D) The first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Wednesday.

Explanation:

Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday).
* No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
* At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
* The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
* The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.

Now, let's consider the possible scenarios:

Scenario 1: First batch of sugar cookies made on Monday.

* This means that the first batch of sugar cookies is made on Monday, which is not possible since the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies, and Monday is not Wednesday.

Scenario 2: First batch of oatmeal cookies made on Tuesday.

* This is possible, but it means that the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Wednesday, which is not possible since the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.

Scenario 3: First batch of peanut butter cookies made on Wednesday.

* This is possible, but it means that the second batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Thursday, which is not possible since the second batch of peanut butter cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of sugar cookies.

Scenario 4: Second batch of peanut butter cookies made on Tuesday.

* This is possible, but it means that the third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Friday, which is not possible since the third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the second batch of peanut butter cookies.

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) The first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Wednesday.
