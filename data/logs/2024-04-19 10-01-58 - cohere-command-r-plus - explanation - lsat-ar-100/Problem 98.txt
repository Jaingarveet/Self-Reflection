## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The question asks for a statement that could be true, so we should look at the options and try to disprove them.

Statement A could be false because there are no restrictions on when K can be shown, so it is possible for it to be shown before J.

Statement B could be false for the same reason - there are no restrictions on when L is shown, so it could be shown before J.

Statement C is false because J must be shown in the evening, so P cannot be shown after it.

Statement D could be false because there is no requirement for N and O to be shown after M. They could be shown before M, or even in the morning or afternoon.

Statement E is the correct answer because K cannot be shown in the morning, so N and P must be shown after K if they are shown in the afternoon or evening.
Action: Answer("E")
