Explanation:
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
We know that at least one batch is made on Monday, and the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. This means that two batches are made on Monday.

We also know that the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday. As no batches are made on Wednesday, it can be inferred that the first batch of sugar cookies is made on Tuesday, and the third batch on Friday.

This leaves oatmeal cookies with one batch made on Tuesday, and one on Thursday, as they cannot be made on the same day as each other or the sugar cookies.

Therefore, the answer is that at least two batches of cookies are made on Monday and Thursday.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
