Context: For the school paper, five students—Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, Megregian, and O'Neill—each review one or more of exactly three plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation, but do not review any other plays. The following conditions must apply: Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.

Explanation:
## Assistant 2:
Reflection: Kramer and O'Neill review Tamerlane, and Megregian reviews more plays than Lopez and Kramer, so Megregian must review at least two plays. This means that Megregian reviews either Sunset and Tamerlane or Sunset and Undulation. If Megregian reviews Sunset and Tamerlane, then Lopez must review Undulation, and Jiang must review Sunset. But this scenario doesn't work because Lopez and Jiang can't both review Sunset, and Megregian can't review the same plays as Kramer and O'Neill. So, Megregian must review Sunset and Undulation. This means that Lopez must review Sunset, and Jiang must review Undulation. Thus, the correct answer is "C: Jiang, Lopez."
