Context: A government needs to assign new ambassadors to Venezuela, Yemen, and Zambia. The candidates for these ambassadorships are Jaramillo, Kayne, Landon, Novetzke, and Ong. One ambassador will be assigned to each country, and no ambassador will be assigned to more than one country. The assignment of the ambassadors must meet the following constraints: Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships. If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne. If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen. If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
Question: Which one of the following CANNOT be true?
Choices:
  A: Jaramillo is assigned as ambassador to Zambia.
  B: Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Zambia.
  C: Novetzke is assigned as ambassador to Zambia.
  D: Landon is not assigned to an ambassadorship.
  E: Ong is not assigned to an ambassadorship.

Explanation:
## Assistant 2:
Thought: This question requires identifying which response would violate the given constraints.

Constraint 1: Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both.
Constraint 2: If Jaramillo is an ambassador, then so is Kayne.
Constraint 3: If Ong is the ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne cannot be the ambassador to Yemen.
Constraint 4: Landon can only be assigned to Zambia.

Response A violates Constraint 2, as it includes Jaramillo but not Kayne.
Response B violates Constraint 4, as Kayne cannot be assigned to Zambia.
Response C does not violate any constraints and is feasible.
Response D violates Constraint 4, as it precludes Landon being assigned to Zambia.
Response E does not violate any constraints and is feasible.

Therefore, the correct answer is A.

Action: Answer("A")
