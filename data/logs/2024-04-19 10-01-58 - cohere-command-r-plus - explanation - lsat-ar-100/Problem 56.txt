Topic: Law
Context: A software company employs exactly seven sales representatives—Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall—to work in its three sales zones—Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3. Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Question: If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Kim works in Zone 2.
  B: Mahr works in Zone 2.
  C: Parra works in Zone 3.
  D: Tiao works in Zone 1.
  E: Udall works in Zone 3.

Explanation:
## Assistant 2:
Reflection: The conditions given in the question and the complex interplay between the sales representatives and their zones made this question challenging.

Parra and Quinn work in the same zone, and this must be Zone 1 (from the condition that either Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1). This means Tiao does not work in Zone 1. Similarly, either Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2, but as Tiao does not work in Zone 1, Tiao must work in Zone 2. This means Udall does not work in Zone 2 and is therefore in the same zone, Zone 3, as Stuckey.

Now we can deduce that Zone 1 has at least two people (Parra and Quinn), Zone 2 has one person (Tiao), and Zone 3 has two people (Stuckey and Udall). This doesn't fit the condition that more people work in Zone 1 than Zone 3, so we must now consider the remaining sales representatives—Kim, Mahr, and either Parra or Tiao.

If Parra works in Zone 1, then Tiao is available to work in Zone 3, making a total of three in Zone 1 and three in Zone 3, which doesn't satisfy the conditions. However, if Tiao works in Zone 3, then there are three in Zone 1 and three in Zone 3, with Kim or Mahr in Zone 2—satisfying all the conditions.

Therefore, the correct answer is that Tiao works in Zone 1, and this makes it possible for there to be more people in Zone 1 than in Zone 3.
Action: Answer("D")
