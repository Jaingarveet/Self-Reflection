Context: Of the eight students—George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert—in a seminar, exactly six will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
Question: Which one of the following is a pair of students who, if they give reports on the same day as each other, must give reports on Wednesday?
Choices:
  A: George and Lenore
  B: Helen and Nina

Explanation:
## Assistant 2:
Reflection: George must give his report on Tuesday, and Nina's report must be followed by Helen and Irving the next day, unless Nina presents on Wednesday. Therefore, for Nina and another student to give their reports on the same day, it must be Wednesday, as this is the only day without conditions.

Of the options provided, only Kyle and Nina can give their reports on the same day (Wednesday) without creating a conflict with the other conditions.
Action: Answer("D")
