Context: A shopping center has exactly seven spaces—space 1 through space 7—arranged in a straight row. Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
Question: If the shoe store is in space 2, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: The optometrist is in space 5.
  B: The pharmacy is in space 1.
  C: A restaurant is in space 3.

Explanation:
## Assistant 2:
Thought: If the shoe store is in space 2, the pharmacy (one end) and a restaurant (the other end) can only be in spaces 1 and 7, respectively, or vice versa.

The pharmacy must also be next to the optometrist or the veterinarian, so the optometrist or veterinarian must be in space 2. This leaves only the toy store and one of the restaurants for spaces 3 and 4 (in some order). As a result of this configuration, the toy store and the veterinarian must be next to each other in spaces 3 and 4, which violates the given constraint.

Therefore, the correct answer is B: The pharmacy is in space 1. This satisfies the constraint of the pharmacy being at one end, and it allows for various arrangements that meet the other constraints, such as having the veterinarian in space 2, the toy store in space 3, a restaurant in space 4, the optometrist in space 5, the second restaurant in space 6, and finally, the shoe store in space 7.

Answer: B
