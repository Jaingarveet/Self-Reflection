## User 2:
Topic: Science
Question: The kinetic energies of particles in a sample of matter are increasing. This sample is most likely
Choices:
  A: a liquid that is warming.
  B: a gas that is cooling.
  C: a liquid that is turning into a solid.
  D: a gas that is turning into a liquid.
## Assistant 2:
  Thought: When the kinetic energy of particles in a sample of matter is increasing, it means that the particles are moving faster and have more energy. This can occur due to an increase in temperature or due to the conversion of one state of matter to another (e.g. liquid to gas).
