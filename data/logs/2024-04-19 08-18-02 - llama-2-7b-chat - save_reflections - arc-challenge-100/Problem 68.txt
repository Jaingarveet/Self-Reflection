## Get Reflection:
 Explanation:
I made a mistake in my answer. I incorrectly identified the escape strategy used by otters.

The correct answer is (B) Newts drop their tails when threatened. Newts have a specialized defense mechanism where they can drop their tail to distract predators and escape. This is an example of an escape strategy used to avoid being killed and eaten by predators.

Error Keywords:

* Misidentification of escape strategy
* Lack of knowledge on newt behavior

Solution:

1. Identify the correct escape strategy used by the organism.
2. Research and learn about the behavior and adaptations of newts.
3. Understand the mechanism of the escape strategy and how it helps the organism avoid predators.
4. Apply the knowledge to answer the question correctly.

Instructions:

1. Read the question carefully and identify the organism being discussed.
2. Research and learn about the behavior and adaptations of the organism.
3. Identify the escape strategy used by the organism and explain how it helps the organism avoid predators.
4. Choose the answer that best matches the escape strategy used by the organism.

Advice:

* Always read the question carefully and identify the organism being discussed.
* Research and learn about the behavior and adaptations of the organism.
* Pay attention to the details of the escape strategy and how it helps the organism avoid predators.
* Double-check your answer to ensure accuracy.
* Remember that the escape strategy used by the organism may not be immediately apparent, and it may require some research and analysis to identify the correct answer.
