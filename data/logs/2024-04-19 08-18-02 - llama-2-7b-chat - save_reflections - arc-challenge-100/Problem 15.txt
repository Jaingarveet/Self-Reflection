## Get Reflection:
 Explanation:
I incorrectly chose answer A, "It is made up of more than one substance," as the reason why the snack is a mixture. However, the correct answer is C, "The components retain their original properties."

A mixture is a combination of two or more substances that maintain their original properties. In the case of the snack, each ingredient (peanuts, sunflower seeds, raisins, almonds, and chocolate pieces) retains its original properties, such as taste, texture, and chemical composition, even when mixed together. Therefore, the snack is a mixture.

Error Keywords:

* Mixture
* Substance
* Composition
* Properties

Solution:
The snack is a mixture because the ingredients are not chemically combined and retain their original properties.

Instructions:

1. Identify the ingredients in the snack.
2. Determine if each ingredient maintains its original properties when mixed together.
3. If the ingredients do not chemically combine, the snack is a mixture.
4. Choose the answer that describes why the snack is a mixture.
Advice:

* Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
* Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
* Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
* Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
* Always double-check your answers and final conclusion.
* Remember that a mixture is a combination of two or more substances that maintain their original properties.
