Reflection:
In my previous answer, I selected Choice A, which was incorrect. Upon reflection, I realized that the best completion is Choice B, as it aligns with the context of the passage and the author's intention. The author suggests borrowing maternity clothes from friends and family, which is a practical and cost-effective solution.
