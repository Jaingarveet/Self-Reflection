Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I misinterpreted the text and chose the incorrect answer. The correct completion to the text is "[REDACTED]: the young man strikes the white ball but immediately stops it with the cue stick."

The text describes the young man hitting balls that land in the pocket of the pool table, which suggests that he is attempting to pocket the balls. However, the next sentence mentions the man putting the balls in a metal triangle and arranging other balls, which is not related to pocketing the balls. Therefore, option [REDACTED] is not the most likely completion.

Option [REDACTED] is also unlikely because it does not make sense for the young man to play a pool stroke to serve the ball as his opponent scores the ball. Pool is a game of skill and strategy, and players typically aim to pocket their own balls, not serve them to their opponents.

Option [REDACTED] is also incorrect because the text does not mention the man grabbing two wooden balls and holding them in the triangle.

Therefore, the correct answer is option [REDACTED], which describes the young man striking the white ball but immediately stopping it with the cue stick. This action is consistent with the context of the text and the game of pool.
