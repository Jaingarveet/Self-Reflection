Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to deal poker [title] Shuffle the deck. [step] Shuffling randomizes the deck in order to introduce chance to the game. Not shuffling the cards could allow some players to predict the cards that will come up later, which would give these players an unfair advantage.

[substeps] A riffle refers to splitting the cards in half and mixing them together by placing the corners of the cards in each half against each other and letting the cards go so they intermix.
  B: [title] Take the " left, " " right, " and " bring " of the deck and place them in one of the center corners. [step] The ace of these cards should be the same card as the one that will be dealt in poker.
  C: [title] Shuffle the cards and place them in order. [step] For example, one or two cards-four of the " sticks, " four of the " buckets, " and a deck of jacks is a trump.

Error Keywords:

* Shuffle the cards and place them in order. (C)
* Take the "left," "right," and "bring" of the deck and place them in one of the center corners. (B)

Solution:
The correct answer is (A): There are different ways to shuffle, but a poker shuffle will typically consist of two riffles, a box, another riffle, and a cut.

Explanation:
A poker shuffle involves splitting the deck in half and intermixing the cards by placing the corners of the cards in each half against each other and letting them go so they intermix. This randomizes the deck and introduces chance to the game, which is important in poker to prevent players from predicting the cards that will come up later and gaining an unfair advantage.

Advice:
When dealing poker, it is important to shuffle the deck properly to ensure that the cards are randomized and that no player has an unfair advantage. There are different ways to shuffle, but a poker shuffle typically involves two riffles, a box, another riffle, and a cut.
