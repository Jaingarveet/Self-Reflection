## System:
You are an expert in Common Sense.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to decode binary numbers [title] Remember that in binary 1 is " on : [step] And 0 is " off. " [title] Choose the binary number that you want to decode. [title] Give each number a value, starting from the extreme right.
Choices:
  A: [substeps] For example, using the number 1001001 , 1=1, + 0=2, + 0=4, + 1=8, + 0=16, + 0=32, + 1=64. The number becomes : 32 + 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1.
  B: [title] Draw a circle around your decimal place (which is considered the edge of the decimal place) (the first place furthest from it). [title] Place the " on : [step] " digit on the left side of the decimal place.
  C: [title] Put a value next, and add either 1 or 2 values. [step] For example: " 1/1 (1/1/1 and 1/1 1/1.
  D: [step] But the content button will say " value " is set to 0 and the denominator when you set down the values. Example in numerary 1, the number (and the numerator) is " 10, " but 0 may still be the clue you've referenced.

[header] How to decode binary numbers
[title] Remember that in binary 1 is "on" and 0 is "off."
[title] Choose the binary number you want to decode.

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly. Upon reflection, I realized that I misunderstood the instructions and confused the decimal and binary number systems. Here is my revised answer:

The most likely completion to the text is:

B: Draw a circle around the decimal place (which is considered the edge of the decimal place) (the first place furthest from it).

Explanation:
In binary, the number 1001001 can be decoded by drawing a circle around the decimal place (which is the edge of the decimal place). The values of each digit are as follows:

* 1 = 1
* 0 = 2
* 0 = 4
* 1 = 8
* 0 = 16
* 1 = 32

Therefore, the decoded binary number is 32 + 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 100.

Advice:
When decoding binary numbers, it is important to understand the base-2 number system and the relationship between 1 and 0. It is also helpful to use a visual aid, such as a circle around the decimal place, to keep track of the values of each digit.
