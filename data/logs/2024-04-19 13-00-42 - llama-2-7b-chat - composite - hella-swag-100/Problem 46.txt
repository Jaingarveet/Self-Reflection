Subtopic: Spread mulch
Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
A man dumps a wheelbarrow of mulch on the lawn. He rakes it out over the ground. [REDACTED]
Choices:
A: rakes up dirt over the mulch.
B: uses a leaf blower to blow it around.
C: brings another wheelbarrow full of mulch and rakes it out over the lawn.
D: scoops out a puddle with the rake.

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I reflected on the problem, my solution, and the correct answer. I realized that I misunderstood the context of the situation and the purpose of the man's actions. The correct completion is (C) brings another wheelbarrow full of mulch and rakes it out over the lawn. This is because the man is trying to spread mulch evenly over the lawn, and bringing another wheelbarrow of mulch is the most likely action to achieve this goal.

Advice: When answering questions, it is important to carefully read and understand the context of the situation, and to think critically and logically about the possible solutions. Reflecting on past mistakes and learning from them can also help improve problem-solving skills.
