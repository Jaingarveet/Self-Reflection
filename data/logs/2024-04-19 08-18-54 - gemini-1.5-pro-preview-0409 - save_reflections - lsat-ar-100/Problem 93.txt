## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:** My error stemmed from a misinterpretation of the word "shorter" in the context of the answer choices. I focused on finding a target that was strictly less than another, failing to consider the possibility of equal targets being described as "shorter" due to the wording of the options.
**Error Keywords:**
*   Misinterpretation
*   Logical reasoning error
*   Comparison error
## Step-by-Step Solution
1.  **Analyze Conditions:**
    *   Website targets â‰¤ Voicemail targets (for the same client)
    *   Image's Voicemail < Other Voicemails
    *   Solide's Website < Truvest's Website
    *   No 2-day Website targets
2.  **Deduce Image's Targets:** Since Image's voicemail is shortest and can't be 3 days (due to the first condition), it must be **1 day**. Consequently, Image's website target is also **1 day**.
3.  **Deduce Website Targets:** With Image at 1 day and no 2-day option, Solide must have the **3-day website target**, leaving Truvest with the **1-day website target** (following the third condition).
4.  **Deduce Remaining Voicemail Targets:** Solide's voicemail must be **3 days** (longer than Image's). Truvest's voicemail can be either **1 day or 3 days**.
5.  **Evaluate Choices:**
    *   A: False. Image's website is 1 day, not shorter than any other.
    *   B: False. Solide's website is 3 days, not shorter than any other.
    *   **C: True.** If Truvest's voicemail is 1 day, it is shorter than Solide's 3-day voicemail.
    *   D: This would only be true if "shorter" included "equal to," which is a misinterpretation. 
    *   E: False. Truvest's voicemail is either equal to or longer than Solide's.
