## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:** My error stemmed from overlooking a possible scenario where Megregian reviews only two plays, both of which Jiang does not. This oversight led me to conclude that option D must be true, while neglecting the possibility of option B.
**Error Keywords:**
*   Logic error
*   Overlooking possibilities 
*   Incomplete case analysis
**Step-by-Step Solution:**
1.  **Megregian reviews 2 plays (not Tamerlane):** As I previously analyzed, this scenario is not possible due to creating three students with the same play reviews.
2.  **Megregian reviews 2 plays (including Tamerlane):** This scenario is also not possible for the same reason as above.
3.  **Megregian reviews all 3 plays:** This scenario leads to option D being true, as I previously concluded.
4.  **Megregian reviews 2 plays (Sunset and Undulation):** This scenario was previously overlooked.  Here, Kramer and O'Neill must each review Tamerlane and one other play.  Jiang reviews the remaining play.  In this case, **Megregian reviews more plays than Jiang, making option B true.**
Therefore, while option D is possible, it is not necessarily true. Option B, however, can be true in a scenario I initially missed.
## Future Instructions and Advice
**Instructions:**
1.  **Identify constraints:** Clearly list all conditions and limitations presented in the problem.
2.  **Analyze each possibility systematically:** Explore all possible scenarios that satisfy the given constraints, ensuring no possibility is overlooked.
3.  **Evaluate each scenario against all answer choices:**  Don't stop at the first scenario that seems to confirm an answer choice.
4.  **Choose the answer that holds true in all possible scenarios:** If an answer choice is not true in even one scenario, it cannot be the correct answer.
**General Advice:**
*   **Avoid jumping to conclusions:** Thoroughly analyze all possibilities before settling on an answer.
*   **Break down complex problems:** Divide the problem into smaller, manageable scenarios for easier analysis.
*   **Consider all constraints:** Ensure each scenario adheres to all given conditions and limitations.
*   **Think critically and creatively:** Explore unconventional possibilities and challenge initial assumptions. 
*   **Learn from mistakes:** Reflect on errors to improve problem-solving strategies and avoid similar mistakes in the future.
