## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:** My error stemmed from misinterpreting the constraint "Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other." I focused on finding pairs that reviewed the same plays but overlooked the possibility that one person reviewing two plays could leave room for another pair to also review the same two plays.
**Error Keywords:**
*   Logic error
*   Misinterpretation of constraints
*   Overlooking possibilities
## Step-by-Step Solution
1.  **Establish the fixed review:** Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. They cannot be the pair with identical reviews.
2.  **Analyze the "Undulation" constraint:** If three students review Undulation, the identical review pair must involve Undulation and one other play.
3.  **Evaluate options based on the constraints:**
    *   **A:** Eliminated - Leaves only two reviewers for Undulation.
    *   **B:** Possible - Allows for another pair to review Undulation and another play.
    *   **C:** Eliminated - Contradicts the condition about Lopez and Megregian not reviewing the same plays as Jiang.
    *   **D:** Eliminated - Creates three people with the same reviews (Tamerlane), violating the constraint.
    *   **E:** **Correct** - O'Neill reviewing Sunset and Tamerlane leaves room for another pair to review Undulation and one other play (e.g., Jiang and Lopez reviewing Undulation and Sunset).
## Instructions for Future Problem Solving
1.  **Carefully analyze each constraint and its implications.**
2.  **Consider all possible scenarios and combinations that satisfy the constraints.**
3.  **Pay attention to the possibility of overlapping reviews, not just identical ones.**
4.  **Eliminate options that directly contradict the given information.**
5.  **Choose the option that allows for the fulfillment of all conditions.** 
## General Advice for Similar Problems
*   **Break down complex logic problems into smaller, manageable steps.**
*   **Create a visual representation (e.g., table or diagram) to track information and possibilities.**
*   **Double-check your reasoning and ensure all conditions are met before finalizing the answer.**
*   **Practice similar logic problems to improve your analytical and problem-solving skills.**
