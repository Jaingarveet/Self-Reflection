## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:** My error stemmed from misinterpreting the question's intent. I focused on scenarios where Young was directly assigned a higher-numbered space than Souza, overlooking the possibility of indirect ordering through other assignments.
**Error Keywords:**
*   Misinterpretation
*   Logical reasoning error
*   Assumption error
## Step-by-Step Solution
1.  **Analyze Rules:** We know Young > Togowa, Xu > Souza, and Robertson > Young. Robertson must be in spaces #1-4.
2.  **Consider Indirect Ordering:** The question asks what *could* be true if Young > Souza, not necessarily directly adjacent.
3.  **Evaluate Option A:** If Togowa is in #1, then Young must be in #2 or higher due to Young > Togowa. This leaves space #1 for Robertson, satisfying Robertson > Young and the #1-4 requirement. 
4.  **Conclusion:** Option A satisfies all conditions and allows for Young to have a higher-numbered space than Souza indirectly through the placement of Togowa and Robertson.
## Instructions for Future
1.  **Carefully Analyze Question Intent:** Pay close attention to keywords like "could be true" to avoid limiting possibilities.
2.  **Consider Indirect Relationships:** Don't focus solely on direct comparisons; analyze how other assignments can influence the order.
3.  **Evaluate All Options Systematically:** Check each option against all given rules and conditions to ensure no contradictions.
## General Advice
*   **Read Carefully:** Always ensure a thorough understanding of the problem and the question being asked.
*   **Avoid Assumptions:** Don't make assumptions beyond the information provided; consider all possibilities.
*   **Think Holistically:** Analyze the problem as a whole, considering the interplay of all elements and conditions. 
*   **Check for Consistency:** Ensure your solution satisfies all given rules and conditions without contradictions.
