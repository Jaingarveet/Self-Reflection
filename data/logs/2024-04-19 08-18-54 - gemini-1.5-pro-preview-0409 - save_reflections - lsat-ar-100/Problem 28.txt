## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:** My reasoning was flawed because I focused on fulfilling the requirement of having one scientist from each category without thoroughly considering all the given conditions. I overlooked the condition "If M is selected, both P and R must be selected," which implies that if R is selected (as in this case), then M must also be selected.  This oversight led me to incorrectly conclude that K was not a possibility and M was the only option.
**Error Keywords:**
*   Misinterpretation of conditions
*   Overlooking implications
*   Incomplete analysis
## Step-by-Step Solution
1.  **Analyze the given information:** We know F, L, Q, and R are selected. We need one more scientist, and it must be either a botanist (G or H) or a zoologist (P) to fulfill the requirement of having at least one from each category.
2.  **Consider the condition related to M:** Since R is already selected, the condition "If M is selected, both P and R must be selected" implies that M cannot be the fifth scientist. If M were chosen, then P would also have to be included, exceeding the limit of five scientists.
3.  **Evaluate remaining options:** With M ruled out, the only remaining option to fulfill the requirement of having at least one scientist from each category is to choose P, the zoologist. 
4.  **Verify the solution:** Choosing P satisfies all the given conditions: 
    *   There is at least one scientist from each category (F - botanist, L - chemist, Q and P - zoologists).
    *   The restriction "If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected" is not violated as there is only one botanist (F) selected.
    *   The restrictions related to K and M are irrelevant as neither is being selected.
Therefore, the fifth scientist must be **P**.
## Instructions for Future Problem Solving
1.  **Carefully read and understand all the given conditions and restrictions.**
2.  **Analyze the implications of each condition and how they interact with each other.**
3.  **Consider all possible scenarios and eliminate options that violate any of the conditions.**
4.  **Verify the chosen solution by ensuring it satisfies all the given conditions.**
