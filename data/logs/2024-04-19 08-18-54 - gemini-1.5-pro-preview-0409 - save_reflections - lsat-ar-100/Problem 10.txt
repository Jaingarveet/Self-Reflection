## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:** My error stemmed from misinterpreting the condition "At least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected." I incorrectly assumed this meant the number of French novels must be equal to or greater than the total number of Russian works (novels + plays), leading me to eliminate option C.
**Error Keywords:**
*   Misinterpretation 
*   Logical error
*   Condition misapplication
## Step-by-Step Solution
1. **Review Conditions:** We have the following conditions:
    *   5-6 works total
    *   Maximum 4 French works
    *   3-4 novels
    *   French novels â‰¥ Russian novels
    *   If both French plays are selected, then no Russian play.
2. **Analyze Options:**
    *   **Option A:** Violates "3-4 novels" condition (only 3 novels).
    *   **Option B:** Violates "Maximum 4 French works" (2 novels + 2 plays = 4 French works).
    *   **Option C:** Satisfies all conditions: 4 novels (2 French, 2 Russian), 4 French works, and the play condition is irrelevant.
    *   **Option D:** Violates "Maximum 4 French works" (3 novels + 2 plays = 5 French works).
    *   **Option E:** Violates "3-4 novels" condition (5 novels).
3. **Identify Correct Option:** Based on the analysis, only **Option C** satisfies all given conditions. 
## Instructions for Future Similar Problems
1. **Carefully read and understand all conditions:** Pay close attention to the wording and ensure you grasp the exact meaning of each condition.
2. **Analyze each option systematically:** Check each option against all conditions, ensuring it satisfies every single one.
3. **Focus on the specific requirements:** Avoid making assumptions or drawing broader conclusions than what the conditions explicitly state.
4. **Double-check your reasoning:** Review your analysis to ensure you haven't overlooked any details or misinterpreted any conditions.
