## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:** My reasoning was flawed because I assumed Wayne had to play the traditional piece after playing a modern piece. I overlooked the possibility of Zara playing the third (traditional) piece, allowing Wayne to play a traditional piece earlier.
**Error Keywords:**
*   Logic error
*   Assumption error
*   Misinterpretation of constraints
## Solving the Problem
1.  **Wayne's Modern Piece:**  Wayne must play a modern piece before any traditional pieces. So, the first or second solo must be Wayne playing a modern piece. 
2.  **Zara's Solo:**  The pianist in the second solo cannot play the fifth. So, if Wayne plays first (modern), Zara must play second (either modern or traditional).
3.  **Third Solo:**  The third solo is a traditional piece. Zara can play this, fulfilling the constraint of two consecutive traditional pieces (with the fourth solo).
4.  **Fourth Solo:**  The constraint for the fourth solo is satisfied as Zara is playing a traditional piece.
5.  **Fifth Solo:**  Wayne plays the fifth solo, which can be either modern or traditional.
Therefore, Wayne can play **zero** traditional pieces as a minimum. 
## Instructions for Future Problems
1.  **Identify all constraints:**  Carefully analyze each constraint and its implications.
2.  **Consider all possibilities:**  Don't make assumptions or jump to conclusions. Explore different scenarios that satisfy the constraints.
3.  **Work step-by-step:**  Break down the problem into smaller steps and analyze each step's possibilities.
4.  **Check for contradictions:**  Ensure your solution doesn't violate any of the given constraints.
5.  **Review your assumptions:**  Question your initial assumptions and see if they limit your solution space unnecessarily.
## General Advice
*   **Read carefully:**  Ensure you understand the problem and all its conditions before attempting a solution.
*   **Think critically:**  Don't accept information at face value; analyze and question assumptions.
*   **Be flexible:**  Consider multiple approaches and be open to revising your initial understanding.
*   **Practice logic puzzles:**  Regularly solving logic puzzles can improve your reasoning and problem-solving skills.
