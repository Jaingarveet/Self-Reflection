## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:** My reasoning was flawed because I misinterpreted the rule about Nina. I assumed it meant that if Nina presented, Helen and Irving had to present the *following* day. However, the rule actually states they must present on the *next day unless Nina presents on Wednesday*, meaning they could present on the same day as Nina if it's not Wednesday. This oversight led me to eliminate the correct option.
**Error Keywords:**
*   Misinterpretation 
*   Logical Error
*   Conditional Reasoning Error
## Step-by-Step Solution
1. **George on Tuesday:** This remains a fixed condition, eliminating options A, B, and E.
2. **Olivia/Robert Constraint:** Since they can't present in the afternoon, one of them must present on Monday morning. This leaves Tuesday morning for the other, as George is on Tuesday afternoon.
3. **Wednesday Options:** This leaves Helen and Irving for Wednesday. Since Nina's rule doesn't apply if she presents on Wednesday, she can present on Wednesday morning with Helen and Irving in the afternoon.
4. **Valid Option:** This analysis leads to option D: Olivia on Monday morning, Robert on Tuesday morning, and Irving on Wednesday morning.
## Instructions for Future
1. **Carefully analyze each condition:** Pay close attention to the wording and avoid making assumptions.
2. **Consider all possibilities:** Don't eliminate options prematurely based on misinterpretations.
3. **Break down complex rules:** If a rule has multiple parts or exceptions, analyze each part separately.
4. **Test each remaining option:** Ensure it satisfies all given conditions before selecting the answer.
## General Advice
*   **Read actively and critically:** Don't just passively read the information; engage with it and question your understanding.
*   **Identify the type of reasoning required:** Is it deductive, inductive, or abductive reasoning?
*   **Draw diagrams or tables:** Visual aids can help clarify complex relationships and constraints.
*   **Practice with similar problems:** The more you expose yourself to different scenarios, the better you'll become at logical reasoning.
