## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:** My error stemmed from misinterpreting the "next to" constraint. I assumed it meant Textiles and Produce must be sequential in numerical order, limiting Livestock to bay 3. However, "next to" only implies adjacency, not specific order.
**Error Keywords:**
*   Logical reasoning error
*   Misinterpretation of constraint
*   Assumption error
## Step-by-Step Solution
1.  **Analyze Constraints:**
    *   Grain > Livestock > Textiles
    *   Produce > Fuel
    *   Textiles is adjacent to Produce
2.  **Eliminate Options:**
    *   Bay 1 and Bay 6 are eliminated based on the Grain > Livestock > Textiles constraint.
    *   Bay 2 is eliminated because if Textiles were in Bay 1 (the only adjacent option), Livestock would be forced into Bay 1, violating the constraint.
3.  **Evaluate Remaining Options:**
    *   Bay 3: If Livestock is in Bay 3, Textiles must be in Bay 2, and Produce in Bay 1. This leaves no valid placement for Grain and Fuel that satisfies the constraints.
    *   **Bay 5: This option allows for a valid arrangement:**
        *   Bay 6: Grain
        *   Bay 5: Livestock
        *   Bay 4: Textiles
        *   Bay 3: Produce
        *   Bay 2: Fuel
4.  **Conclusion:** Bay 5 is the only possible bay for Livestock. 
## Instructions for Future Problem Solving
1.  **Carefully analyze each constraint and its implications.**
2.  **Consider all possible interpretations of ambiguous terms like "next to".**
3.  **Eliminate options that violate constraints.**
4.  **Test remaining options by attempting to construct valid arrangements.**
5.  **Verify that the chosen solution satisfies all given conditions.**
## General Advice for Similar Problems
*   **Avoid making assumptions or jumping to conclusions.**
*   **Break down complex problems into smaller, manageable steps.**
*   **Consider multiple possibilities and perspectives.**
*   **Use a systematic approach to evaluate options and eliminate inconsistencies.**
*   **Practice logical reasoning and critical thinking skills.**
