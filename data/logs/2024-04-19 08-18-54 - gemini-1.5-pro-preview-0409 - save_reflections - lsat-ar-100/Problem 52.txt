## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:** My reasoning was flawed because I assumed both Franco and Garcia would be on Monday, but the conditions only state they cannot be together, not that they must be on the same day. This oversight led me to the wrong conclusion.
**Error Keywords:**
*   Assumption error
*   Logical reasoning error
*   Misinterpretation of constraints
## Step-by-Step Solution
1.  **Wednesday:** Iturbe and Jackson are scheduled, leaving three witnesses for Monday and Tuesday.
2.  **Tuesday:** Two witnesses are needed, and it cannot be Franco or Garcia (due to the constraint) or Iturbe/Jackson (already on Wednesday). Therefore, **Hong must be one of the two witnesses on Tuesday**.
3.  **Monday:** This leaves Franco and Garcia as possibilities. However, the constraint only states they cannot be on the same day, not that they must both be on Monday. 
4.  **Analyzing options:**
    *   If Franco is on Monday, Garcia must be on Tuesday with Hong.
    *   If Garcia is on Monday, Franco must be on Tuesday with Hong.
Therefore, **exactly one of Franco or Garcia will be on Monday with the other on Tuesday alongside Hong.**
## Instructions for Future Similar Problems
1.  **Carefully analyze each constraint:** Pay close attention to what each condition allows and restricts. Avoid making assumptions beyond the given information.
2.  **Consider all possibilities:** Don't jump to conclusions based on initial deductions. Explore different scenarios that fit the constraints.
3.  **Use a process of elimination:** If possible, eliminate options that contradict the constraints or your deductions.
4.  **Review your reasoning:** Before finalizing your answer, revisit your steps and ensure your logic is sound and consistent with the problem's conditions.
## General Advice for Similar Problems
*   **Break down complex problems:** Divide the problem into smaller parts and analyze each part individually.
*   **Visualize the problem:** Use diagrams or tables to represent the information and constraints, making it easier to see relationships and possibilities.
*   **Practice logical reasoning:** Engage in puzzles and exercises that challenge your logical thinking skills.
*   **Learn from mistakes:** Reflect on incorrect answers to understand the reasoning errors and avoid them in the future.
