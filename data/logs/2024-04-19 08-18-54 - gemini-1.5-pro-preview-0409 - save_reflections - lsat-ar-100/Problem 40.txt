## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:** My error stemmed from focusing too much on satisfying the constraints related to the pharmacy and restaurants, while neglecting the constraint about the toy store not being next to the veterinarian. This oversight led me to choose an option that violated that specific constraint.
**Error Keywords:**
* Constraint violation
* Oversight
* Focus on specific constraints
* Neglecting other constraints
## Step-by-Step Solution
1. **Analyze Constraints:**
    * Pharmacy at one end (space 1 or 7)
    * Restaurants at opposite ends with at least 2 spaces between them.
    * Pharmacy next to optometrist or veterinarian.
    * Toy store not next to veterinarian.
2. **Shoe Store in Space 2:** This eliminates options involving space 2.
3. **Pharmacy Placement:** Option B (space 1) is possible. This forces a restaurant in space 7 due to the separation constraint.
4. **Eliminate Options:** Options C and D are eliminated due to the restaurant placement.
5. **Remaining Options:** A and E remain.
6. **Analyze Option A:**
    * Optometrist in space 5.
    * This allows for the veterinarian in space 4 (next to the pharmacy) and the toy store in space 3 (not next to the veterinarian). 
    * **This option satisfies all constraints.**
7. **Analyze Option E:**
    * Veterinarian in space 4.
    * This would require the toy store to be in space 1 (next to the pharmacy) which violates the constraint of not being next to the veterinarian.
    * **This option violates a constraint.**
Therefore, the correct answer is **A: The optometrist is in space 5.** 
## Instructions for Future Problem Solving
1. **List all constraints explicitly.**
2. **Eliminate options that directly violate constraints.**
3. **Consider the remaining options one by one.**
4. **For each option, check if it satisfies ALL constraints.**
5. **If an option violates even one constraint, eliminate it.**
6. **Choose the option that satisfies all constraints.**
## General Advice for Similar Problems
* **Read and understand all constraints carefully before attempting a solution.**
* **Focus on each constraint individually, but don't neglect the others.**
* **Consider all possible scenarios and eliminate options that violate any constraint.**
* **Work systematically and step-by-step to avoid oversights.**
* **Double-check your reasoning and ensure the chosen option satisfies all conditions.**
