## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:** My reasoning was flawed because I focused on eliminating options based on individual conditions without considering the combined implications of all conditions. I failed to recognize that option E creates a conflict with the requirement of having at least one witness on Monday.
**Error Keywords:**
*   Logic error
*   Reasoning error
*   Failure to consider all conditions
## Step-by-Step Solution
1. **Analyze Conditions:** We know Iturbe is on Wednesday, two witnesses are on Tuesday, Hong is not on Monday, and Franco and Garcia are on different days.
2. **Evaluate Option E:** If Jackson is on Tuesday and two witnesses are on Monday, then Franco, Garcia, and Hong must be on Monday. This contradicts the condition that Hong cannot be on Monday.
3. **Conclusion:** Therefore, option E cannot be true. 
## Instructions for Future Problem Solving
1. **List all conditions:** Clearly write down all given conditions and constraints.
2. **Analyze each option:** Evaluate each option against all conditions, not just individual ones.
3. **Consider combinations:** Think about how the conditions interact and create limitations.
4. **Look for contradictions:** Identify any scenarios that violate the given conditions.
5. **Eliminate impossible options:** Rule out options that create contradictions.
## General Advice for Similar Problems
*   **Read carefully:** Ensure you understand all aspects of the problem and the conditions.
*   **Think holistically:** Consider the combined effect of all conditions, not just individual ones.
*   **Visualize:** Use diagrams or tables to represent the problem and explore possibilities.
*   **Test assumptions:** Don't make assumptions without verifying them against the given information.
*   **Check for consistency:** Ensure your solution satisfies all conditions and constraints.
