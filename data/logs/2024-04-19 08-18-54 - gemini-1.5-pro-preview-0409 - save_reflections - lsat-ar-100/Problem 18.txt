## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:** My error stemmed from misinterpreting the constraint regarding Nina's report. I focused on eliminating options based on the restrictions for George and Robert but failed to fully consider the implications of Nina's condition.
**Error Keywords:**
*   Logical reasoning error
*   Conditional statement misinterpretation 
*   Failure to consider all constraints
## Step-by-Step Solution
1. **George on Tuesday:** Eliminate options A, B, and D as they don't have George presenting on Tuesday.
2. **Nina's condition:** Analyze the remaining options (C and E) in light of Nina's condition. 
    *   Option C has no conflict. 
    *   Option E has Nina presenting on Monday afternoon, which would require both Helen and Irving to present on Tuesday, violating the condition of only two presentations per day. 
3. **Robert's restriction:** Option C satisfies the condition of Robert not presenting in the afternoon.
Therefore, the correct schedule is **Option C**.
## Instructions for Future Problem Solving
1. **Identify all constraints:** Carefully read and list all conditions and restrictions mentioned in the problem.
2. **Eliminate options:** Systematically eliminate options that violate any of the listed constraints.
3. **Analyze remaining options:** For the remaining options, carefully analyze how each constraint applies and ensure all conditions are met.
4. **Consider conditional statements:** Pay close attention to conditional statements and their implications on the schedule.
5. **Double-check:** Before finalizing the answer, review the chosen option against all constraints to ensure it satisfies all conditions.
## General Advice for Similar Problems
*   **Break down complex problems:** Divide the problem into smaller, manageable parts based on individual constraints.
*   **Focus on one constraint at a time:** Analyze how each constraint affects the possible solutions before moving on to the next.
*   **Visualize the problem:** Consider creating a table or diagram to represent the schedule and constraints visually.
*   **Practice logical reasoning:** Regularly engage in problems that involve logical reasoning and deduction to improve your skills.
*   **Learn from mistakes:** Reflect on errors and identify areas for improvement to avoid similar mistakes in the future.
