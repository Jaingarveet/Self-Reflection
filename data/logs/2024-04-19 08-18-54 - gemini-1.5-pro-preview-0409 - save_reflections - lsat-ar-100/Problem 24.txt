## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:** My initial reasoning was flawed because I focused on the direct implication of the original statement without considering alternative ways to achieve the same outcome. Option A, while seemingly a direct reflection, actually introduces a new constraint that Kayne must be assigned if Jaramillo is, which is not present in the original statement.
**Error Keywords:**
*   Logic error
*   Misinterpretation of implication
*   Focusing on surface-level equivalence
## Step-by-Step Solution
1. **Analyze the original constraint:** "If Jaramillo is assigned, then so is Kayne" implies that Jaramillo cannot be assigned without Kayne also being assigned. This means either both are assigned or neither is.
2. **Evaluate options based on this implication:**
    *   Option A creates a new constraint, as discussed.
    *   Option B introduces irrelevant conditions about Landon, Ong, and Novetzke.
    *   Option C forces Kayne's assignment if Ong is not assigned, which is not equivalent to the original constraint.
    *   **Option D ensures that Jaramillo and Novetzke cannot both be assigned.** This aligns with the original constraint because if Jaramillo is assigned, Novetzke cannot be, leaving a spot for Kayne.
    *   Option E is irrelevant as it deals with Novetzke and Ong, not Jaramillo and Kayne.
## Instructions for Future Similar Problems
1. **Identify the core implication of the original statement:**  Don't just focus on the surface-level wording; understand what the statement restricts or allows.
2. **Analyze each option based on its effect on the possible assignments:**  Consider how each option limits or expands the assignment possibilities and compare it to the original constraint.
3. **Eliminate options that introduce new constraints or irrelevant conditions.**
4. **Choose the option that achieves the same outcome as the original constraint without adding new restrictions.**
## General Advice
*   **Think critically about logical implications:**  Don't assume that similar wording implies the same logical outcome.
*   **Consider all possible scenarios and their compatibility with the constraints.**
*   **Focus on the core restrictions and allowances, not just the specific wording.**
*   **Practice logical reasoning and problem-solving skills to improve your ability to analyze complex relationships.**
