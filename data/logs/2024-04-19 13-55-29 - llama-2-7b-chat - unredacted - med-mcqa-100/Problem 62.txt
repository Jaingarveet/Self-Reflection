Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I apologize for my mistake in answering the question. I misunderstood the question and provided an incorrect answer.

The narrowest part of the uterine tube is indeed the interstitial part, which is option D. The interstitial part is the narrowest section of the uterine tube, located between the isthmus and the cervix.

I made a mistake in my thought process by identifying the isthmus as the narrowest part of the uterine tube. The isthmus is actually the narrowest part of the uterine tube near the cervix, but it is not the entire length of the tube.

Thank you for pointing out my error, and I will make sure to be more careful in the future.
