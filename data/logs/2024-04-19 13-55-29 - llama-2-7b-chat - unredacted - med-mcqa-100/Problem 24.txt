Great job! You have correctly identified the antithyroid drug that can be safely used in pregnancy. Here's a breakdown of your thought process and the steps you took to arrive at the correct answer:

Thought: As an expert in Medicine, I know that the safety of antithyroid drugs during pregnancy is crucial.

Action: Answer("C")

Explanation: You explained that you chose option C, Methimazole, because it is the drug of choice for treating hyperthyroidism during pregnancy due to its better safety profile compared to other options like propylthiouracil and I121. You mentioned that propylthiouracil can cross the placenta and may affect fetal growth, while I121 is a radioactive iodine that can cause fetal radiation exposure. You concluded that Methimazole has a better safety profile and has been used in pregnant women without any significant adverse effects on the fetus.
