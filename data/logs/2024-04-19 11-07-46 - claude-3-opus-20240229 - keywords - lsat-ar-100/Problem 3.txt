Context: An administrator must assign parking spaces to six new employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young. Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.

## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step, making sure to consider all the given information and rules:
1. Robertson is assigned parking space #3. This is given in the question.
2. Young must be assigned a lower-numbered parking space than Robertson. Since Robertson is in space #3, Young must be in space #1 or #2.
3. Togowa must be assigned a lower-numbered parking space than Young. Since Young is in space #1 or #2, Togowa must be in the remaining one of those two spaces.
4. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. The remaining spaces are #4, #5, and #6. So Souza must be in space #4 or #5, and Xu must be in a higher space than Souza.
5. The only choice that must be true based on the given information is B: Togowa is assigned parking space #2. 
This is because if Young is in space #1, then Togowa must be in space #2. And if Young is in space #2, then Togowa must be in space #1. Either way, Togowa is definitely assigned parking space #2.
The other choices are not necessarily true based on the given information and rules.
Action: Answer("B")
