## Assistant 2:
You're right, I made some incorrect assumptions and didn't fully consider all the conditions in my previous attempt. Let me try again, being more thorough this time.
Given:
- 3 kinds of cookies: oatmeal, peanut butter, sugar 
- 3 batches of each kind made Mon-Fri
- No two batches of the same kind made on the same day
- At least one batch made on Monday
- 2nd oatmeal batch made same day as 1st peanut butter batch
- 2nd sugar batch made on Thursday
- Exactly one batch made on Friday
Analyzing each choice:
A) 1st sugar batch on Monday 
This is possible. Monday needs at least one batch, which could be sugar.
B) 1st oatmeal batch on Tuesday
This conflicts with the 2nd oatmeal and 1st peanut butter being made the same day. If oatmeal started Tue, the 2nd would be Thu. But peanut butter can't also start Thu since sugar's 2nd batch is that day. 
C) 3rd oatmeal batch on Friday 
This is impossible. Oatmeal's 2nd batch is made with peanut butter's 1st. The 3rd oatmeal batch would have to be the day after peanut butter's 2nd. With one batch on Fri, peanut butter's 3rd would need to be Fri, leaving no day for oatmeal's 3rd.
D) 1st peanut butter batch on Wednesday
This works. It allows the 2nd oatmeal and 1st peanut butter to be made together Wed. Then peanut butter's 2nd is Fri.
E) 2nd peanut butter batch on Tuesday
Impossible. Peanut butter's 1st is made with oatmeal's 2nd. The earliest this could be is Tue. So the 2nd peanut butter batch couldn't also be on Tue.
Narrowed down to A and D, D fits the conditions best. The 1st peanut butter Wed allows the 2nd on Fri, the only day with one batch. 
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
