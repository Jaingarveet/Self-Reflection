## Assistant 2:
You're right, I made an error in my previous attempt. Let me think through this more carefully.
The key requirements are:
- Select 5-6 works total
- No more than 4 French works 
- 3-4 novels must be selected
- At least as many French novels as Russian novels
- If both French plays are selected, the Russian play cannot be
With those constraints in mind, let's consider the minimum requirements:
At least 3 novels must be selected. To have at least as many French novels as Russian, a minimum of 2 French novels are required. So the organizer must select at least 2 French novels.
The other 3-4 works can be any combination of the remaining 1 French novel, 1 Russian novel, 2 French plays and 1 Russian play, as long as no more than 4 total French works are chosen and the French play/Russian play constraint is met.
But the question only asks about the absolute minimum that must be selected. And that minimum is 2 French novels.
