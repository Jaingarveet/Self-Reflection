## Assistant 2:
You're right, I made an error in my previous reasoning. Let me think through this again step-by-step, considering all the given information:
1. There are 8 books (F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O) and 3 shelves (top, middle, bottom). 
2. At least 2 books are on each shelf.
3. More books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
4. I is on the middle shelf.
5. K is on a higher shelf than F.
6. O is on a higher shelf than L.
7. F and M are on the same shelf.
Now, let's consider each answer choice:
A. We don't know the relative positions of O and M. Insufficient information.
B. We don't know the relative positions of K and G. Insufficient information.  
C. I is on the middle shelf. F and M are on the same shelf, which must be lower than the middle shelf since K is higher than F. So this must be true.
D. We don't know the relative positions of G and O. Insufficient information.
E. We don't know if F and L are on the same shelf or different shelves. Insufficient information.
Therefore, the only statement that must be true is C - I is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf F is placed on.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: A
