## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. Parra and Tiao cannot both be in Zone 1. So there are two possibilities:
   a) Parra is in Zone 1 and Tiao is in Zone 2 
   b) Tiao is in Zone 1 and Parra is not in Zone 1
2. Tiao and Udall cannot both be in Zone 2. Combined with point 1, this means:
   a) If Tiao is in Zone 1, Udall must be in Zone 2
   b) If Tiao is in Zone 2, Udall cannot be in Zone 2 
3. Parra and Quinn must be in the same zone. From 1b, if Tiao is in Zone 1, then Parra and Quinn are together in either Zone 2 or Zone 3.
4. Stuckey and Udall must be in the same zone. From 2b, if Tiao is in Zone 2, then Stuckey and Udall are together in either Zone 1 or Zone 3.
5. There are more reps in Zone 3 than Zone 2. This is the key point. 
Looking at the answer choices:
A. Kim, Mahr - This doesn't account for the other reps. Incomplete.
B. Kim, Tiao - This violates the "more in Zone 3 than Zone 2" condition. 
C. Parra, Quinn - Possible, but doesn't account for the "more in Zone 3" condition.
D. Stuckey, Tiao, Udall - This violates the Tiao/Udall condition.
E. Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Udall - This satisfies all conditions. Parra and Quinn together, Stuckey and Udall together, and 4 reps in Zone 3 which is more than any other zone can have.
Therefore, the best answer is E.
Action: Answer("E")
## Result:
Agent Answer: E
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
