Context: A shopping center has exactly seven spaces—space 1 through space 7—arranged in a straight row. Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.

## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The veterinarian is in space 5. 
2. The pharmacy must be at one end (space 1 or 7) and a restaurant at the other end.
3. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or veterinarian. Since the vet is in space 5, the pharmacy cannot be next to it, so it must be in space 1 next to the optometrist.
4. That means a restaurant must be in space 7.
5. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two businesses. With one restaurant in space 7, the other restaurant could be in spaces 1-4. But space 1 is taken by the pharmacy. So the second restaurant must be in space 2, 3, or 4.
6. The toy store can't be next to the vet in space 5. So the toy store is in space 3, 4, or 6.
Looking at the answer choices:
A: The optometrist could be in space 2, but doesn't have to be. 
B: Yes, the pharmacy must be in space 1, so a restaurant must be in space 7.
C: A restaurant could be in space 4, but could also be in 2 or 3.
D: The shoe store's location is not determined by the given information. 
E: The toy store could be in space 3, but could also be in 4 or 6.
Therefore, the only statement that must be true is B - the pharmacy is in space 7.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
