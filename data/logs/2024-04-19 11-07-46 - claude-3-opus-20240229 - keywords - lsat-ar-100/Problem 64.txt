Context: A software company employs exactly seven sales representatives—Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall—to work in its three sales zones—Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3. Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Question: If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Kim works in Zone 2.
  B: Mahr works in Zone 1.
  C: Parra works in Zone 3.
  D: Stuckey works in Zone 2.
  E: Tiao works in Zone 1.

## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. Parra and Tiao cannot both be in Zone 1. 
2. Tiao and Udall cannot both be in Zone 2.
3. Parra and Quinn must be in the same zone.
4. Stuckey and Udall must be in the same zone. 
5. There are more reps in Zone 3 than Zone 2.
6. The question states Mahr and Stuckey are in the same zone.
Now let's consider each answer choice:
A. Kim works in Zone 2. 
This is possible. Nothing precludes Kim from being in Zone 2.
B. Mahr works in Zone 1.
If Mahr is in Zone 1, then Stuckey is also in Zone 1 (given). This would put at least 2 reps in Zone 1. But there are more reps in Zone 3 than 2, so this is possible.
C. Parra works in Zone 3.
If Parra is in Zone 3, then Quinn is also in Zone 3. This is possible and doesn't violate any constraints.
D. Stuckey works in Zone 2.
If Stuckey is in Zone 2, then Udall is also in Zone 2 (given). But Tiao and Udall can't both be in Zone 2. So this is not possible.
E. Tiao works in Zone 1.
If Tiao is in Zone 1, then Parra cannot be in Zone 1. This is possible and doesn't violate any constraints.
After carefully considering each choice, B, C and E are all possible given the constraints. 
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
