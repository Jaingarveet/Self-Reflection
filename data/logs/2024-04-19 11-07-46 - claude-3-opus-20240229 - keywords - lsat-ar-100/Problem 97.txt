## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. We know the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies, which is Tuesday. 
2. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
3. No two batches of the same kind are made on the same day. So on Thursday, only the second batch of sugar cookies can be made.
4. At least one batch is made on Monday. It can't be peanut butter (first batch Tuesday) or sugar (second batch Thursday). So the first batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Monday.
5. Putting this together:
   Monday: 1st Oatmeal 
   Tuesday: 2nd Oatmeal, 1st Peanut Butter
   Thursday: 2nd Sugar
   
6. The only day left for two batches of the same kind is Wednesday. It must be the 1st Sugar and 3rd Oatmeal.
7. That leaves the 2nd Peanut Butter and 3rd Peanut Butter for Friday. Also the 3rd Sugar must be Friday.
8. Looking at the answer choices:
   A: False, only oatmeal on Monday
   B: True, oatmeal and peanut butter on Tuesday 
   C: True, sugar and oatmeal on Wednesday
   D: False, only sugar on Thursday
   E: True, peanut butter and sugar on Friday
Therefore, the statement that could NOT be true is D.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
