Context: A maintenance company that takes service requests from three clients—Image, Solide, and Truvest—plans to set targets for its average service response times. Service targets will be set at 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day. Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail. The six targets are set according to the following conditions: None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
Question: Which one of the following targets CANNOT be set for more than one of the clients?
Choices:
  A: a 1-day website target

## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The question asks which target cannot be set for more than one client. This means the target must be unique to one client.
2. The conditions state:
   - No client's website target can be longer than its voicemail target. 
   - Image's voicemail target must be the shortest of the 3 clients.
   - Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's.
3. Image must have the 1-day voicemail target, as it's the only way to satisfy the condition that Image's voicemail target is the shortest. This means Image's website target must also be 1 day.
4. Solide and Truvest are left with the 2-day and 3-day targets for both website and voicemail. 
5. To satisfy the condition that Solide's website target is shorter than Truvest's, Solide must have the 2-day website target and Truvest the 3-day one.
6. This leaves Solide with the 3-day voicemail target and Truvest with the 2-day one.
Putting it together:
- Image: 1-day website, 1-day voicemail 
- Solide: 2-day website, 3-day voicemail
- Truvest: 3-day website, 2-day voicemail
The 1-day website and 1-day voicemail targets are unique to Image. All other targets are used by two clients.
Therefore, the targets that cannot be set for more than one client are the 1-day website and 1-day voicemail targets.
Action: Answer("A")
