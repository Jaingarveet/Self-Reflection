Each bay is holding a different one of exactly six types of cargoâ€”fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles. The following apply: The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock. The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles. The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel. The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.

## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step, considering all the constraints:
1. The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
2. The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles. 
3. The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
4. The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
From constraints 1 and 2, we know the order is textiles < livestock < grain.
From constraint 3, produce > fuel. 
From constraint 4, textiles and produce are adjacent. Since textiles < livestock < grain, textiles and produce must be in bays 5 and 6 in some order.
So bays 5 and 6 contain textiles and produce. Livestock and grain must be in lower numbered bays than 5. Fuel must be in a lower numbered bay than produce.
The only cargo type we can't definitively place is machinery. But we know machinery can't be in bays 5 or 6.
Therefore, the only cargo type that MUST be in bay 4 is machinery. Grain, livestock, produce, and textiles cannot be in bay 4 based on the constraints.
Action: Answer("C")
