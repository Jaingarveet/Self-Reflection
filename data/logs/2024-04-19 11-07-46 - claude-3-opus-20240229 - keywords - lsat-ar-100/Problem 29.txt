## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. We know there are 8 books (F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O) and 3 shelves. 
2. At least 2 books must be on each shelf, and there are more books on the bottom shelf than the top.
3. I is on the middle shelf.
4. K is on a higher shelf than F. 
5. O is on a higher shelf than L.
6. F and M are on the same shelf.
7. The key condition is: L is on a higher shelf than H.
Given this, let's deduce the shelf placements:
- I is on the middle shelf per condition 3.
- L must be on the top shelf, since it's higher than H (condition 7). 
- O must also be on the top shelf with L, since O is higher than L (condition 5).
- So the top shelf contains at least: L, O
- H must be on the bottom shelf, since L is higher than it (condition 7).
- F and M are together (condition 6), and must be on the bottom shelf since K is higher than F (condition 4).
- So the bottom shelf contains at least: F, H, M
- This leaves G and K. K can't be on the bottom since it's higher than F.
- So K must be on the middle shelf with I. G must also be on the middle shelf to satisfy condition 2.
In summary:
Top: L, O
Middle: G, I, K  
Bottom: F, H, M
Looking at the answer choices, only E is definitely true based on this arrangement - K and O are both on higher shelves than the bottom, so must be together on the middle or top shelf.
The other choices are not definitely true. For example, F and G are not together, H and M are not together, etc.
Action: Answer("E")
