## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. There are 8 books total (F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O) and 3 shelves. 
2. At least 2 books must be on each shelf.
3. More books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
4. I is on the middle shelf.
5. K is on a higher shelf than F. 
6. O is on a higher shelf than L.
7. F and M are on the same shelf.
From the conditions, we know:
- I is on the middle shelf 
- F and M must be together on either the top or bottom shelf
- K must be on the middle or top shelf (higher than F)
- O must be on the middle or top shelf (higher than L)
The bottom shelf has the most books. F and M must be on the bottom shelf together to satisfy the conditions.
Looking at the answer choices:
A: F, M - Possible but incomplete, need at least 2 more books
B: F, H, M - Possible 
C: G, H, K - Not possible, doesn't include F and M
D: F, G, M, O - Not possible, O can't be on bottom shelf
E: G, H, L, M - Not possible, F and M must be together
Therefore, the only possible complete list of books on the bottom shelf is B: F, H, M.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
