Context: During a recital, two pianists—Wayne and Zara—will perform solos. There will be five solos altogether, performed one immediately after another. Each solo will be either a modern piece or a traditional piece. The choice of pianist and type of piece for the solos must conform to the following conditions: The third solo is a traditional piece. Exactly two of the traditional pieces are performed consecutively. In the fourth solo, either Wayne performs a traditional piece or Zara performs a modern piece. The pianist who performs the second solo does not perform the fifth solo. No traditional piece is performed until Wayne performs at least one modem piece.

## Assistant 2:
Okay, let me think through this step-by-step:
1. The third solo must be a traditional piece. This could be performed by either Wayne or Zara.
2. Exactly two traditional pieces are performed consecutively. Given the third solo is traditional, the second or fourth solo must also be traditional to satisfy this condition. 
3. In the fourth solo, either Wayne performs a traditional piece or Zara performs a modern piece. This means if the fourth solo is traditional, it must be performed by Wayne.
4. No traditional piece can be performed until Wayne performs at least one modern piece. So Wayne must perform a modern piece in either the first or second solo.
5. Putting this together, the minimum number of traditional pieces performed by Wayne is one:
   - 1st solo: Wayne modern 
   - 2nd solo: Zara modern
   - 3rd solo: Wayne traditional
   - 4th solo: Zara modern
   - 5th solo: Wayne modern
In this scenario, Wayne performs the minimum of one traditional piece in the third solo. The other conditions are also satisfied.
Therefore, the minimum number of solos in which Wayne performs a traditional piece is one.
Action: Answer("B")
