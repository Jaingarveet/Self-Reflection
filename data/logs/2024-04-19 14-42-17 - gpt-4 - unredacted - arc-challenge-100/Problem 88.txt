# Model: gpt-4 | Agent: unredacted | Exam: arc-challenge-100 | Problem 88 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Science.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:
Topic: Geography
Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Science
Question: Michelle performed an investigation but the results did not match her hypothesis. What should Michelle do next?
Choices:
  A: perform the investigation in a different way
  B: change the hypothesis to match the results
  C: choose a different investigation
  D: repeat the investigation
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I misunderstood the scientific method's process. I thought that if the results did not match the hypothesis, the hypothesis should be changed immediately. However, the correct procedure is to repeat the investigation to ensure the results were not due to experimental error.
Error Keywords:
- Misunderstanding
- Scientific method
- Hypothesis testing
Solution:
In the scientific method, if the results of an investigation do not match the hypothesis, the next step is to repeat the investigation to ensure the results were not due to experimental error. Therefore, Michelle should repeat the investigation.
Instructions:
1. Understand the question and the situation presented.
2. Recall the steps of the scientific method.
3. Identify the current step in the scientific method based on the situation.
4. Determine the next step in the scientific method.
5. Choose the answer that matches the next step in the scientific method.
Advice:
- Always remember the steps of the scientific method.
- Understand that if results do not match the hypothesis, the investigation should be repeated to ensure the results were not due to experimental error.
- Only after repeated inconsistent results should the hypothesis be reconsidered.
- Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
- Always think through each step of your reasoning.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The scientific method involves making a hypothesis, conducting an experiment, and then analyzing the results. If the results do not match the hypothesis, the experiment should be repeated to ensure that the results were not due to experimental error. If the results consistently do not match the hypothesis, then the hypothesis may need to be revised. 
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
