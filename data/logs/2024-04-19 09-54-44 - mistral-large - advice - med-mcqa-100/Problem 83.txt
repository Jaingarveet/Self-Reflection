## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Split skin grafts in young children should be harvested from areas that are less visible and have a good blood supply. The buttocks and thigh are common donor sites in young children because they are less visible and have a good blood supply. However, the trunk is not a good donor site because it is more visible and has a poorer blood supply. The upper limb is also not a good donor site because it is more visible and has a poorer blood supply.
Action: Answer("A") or Answer("B")

I also did not use my knowledge of the subject to determine the correct answer. I will make sure to read the question carefully and use my knowledge of the subject to determine the correct answer in the future.

Correct Answer:
Split skin grafts in young children should be harvested from the buttocks or thigh.
Action: Answer("A") or Answer("B")
