 - Always evaluate the risk factors associated with each medical condition in the context of the specific question.
 - Always double-check your answer to ensure that it is consistent with the specific features of each medical condition.
 - Remember that the most common type of medical condition is not necessarily the most likely to cause a specific complication.
## Assistant 2:
Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly by selecting "A: Serous cystadenoma" as the most likely ovarian tumor to undergo torsion during pregnancy. However, upon further reflection, I realized that I made an assumption based on general knowledge rather than considering the specific features of each type of ovarian tumor.

Action: Answer("D")

Explanation:
Theca lutein cysts are the most likely type of ovarian tumor to undergo torsion during pregnancy. This is because they are typically large, unilateral, and rapidly growing, which increases the risk of torsion. In contrast, serous and mucinous cystadenomas are more common in older women and are less likely to undergo torsion. Dermoid cysts are also less likely to undergo torsion because they are typically smaller and more solid than theca lutein cysts. Therefore, the correct answer is "D: Theca lutein cyst."
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
