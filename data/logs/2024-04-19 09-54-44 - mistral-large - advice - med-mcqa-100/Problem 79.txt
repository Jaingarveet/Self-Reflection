## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The average growth rate for children between the ages of 2 and 5 is about 6-8 cm per year.
To find the total growth over 4 years, we need to multiply the annual growth rate by 4.
Let's use the lower end of the range (6 cm) to be conservative:
6 cm/year \* 4 years = 24 cm
This is close to choice A, but we should double-check our calculation and consider the upper end of the range (8 cm):
8 cm/year \* 4 years = 32 cm
This is closer to choice B.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
