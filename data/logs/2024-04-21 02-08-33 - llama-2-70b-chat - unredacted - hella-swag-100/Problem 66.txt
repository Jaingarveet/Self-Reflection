  Action: Answer("D")

Explanation:
The correct answer is D. However, the discharge can be anything from watery to white to yellow. This choice completes the text by acknowledging that the discharge can vary in appearance, which aligns with the information provided in the text.

The other choices do not complete the text accurately.

Choice A states that the mucus and blood will evaporate out from the nose, which is not mentioned in the text.

Choice B describes a yellow or reddish discharge, which is not consistent with the description of the classic pasteurella infection discharge.

Choice C suggests wiping away the discharge with a cotton ball and getting it tested, which is not related to the topic of diagnosing respiratory problems in rabbits.

Therefore, Choice D is the best answer.
