## User 2:
Topic: Law
Context: A recent study shows that those highways that carry the most traffic, and thus tend to be the most congested, have the lowest rate of fatal traffic accidents.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain the phenomenon described above?
Choices:
  A: Drivers have more accidents when they become distracted.
  B: The highways that have the highest rate of fatal accidents have moderate volumes of traffic.
  C: Most of the motorists on very heavily traveled highways tend to be commuting to or from work.
  D: Most serious accidents occur when vehicles are moving at a high rate of speed.
  E: Heavily traveled highways do not always carry a higher proportion of large trucks.
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I failed to consider the possibility that the lower accident rate on heavily trafficked highways could be due to the fact that vehicles are moving at a lower rate of speed. I was influenced by the fact that the question mentioned that heavily trafficked highways tend to have better maintenance, lighting, and safety features, which led me to choose option [REDACTED].

Error Keywords:

* Misconception
* Oversight
* Lack of consideration

Solution:
The correct answer is option [REDACTED], "[REDACTED]" This option correctly explains the phenomenon described in the question, as the lower accident rate on heavily trafficked highways could be due to the fact that vehicles are moving at slower speeds, reducing the likelihood of serious accidents.

Instructions:

1. Read the question carefully and identify the phenomenon described.
2. Consider all the options and evaluate how each one relates to the phenomenon.
3. Choose the option that best explains the phenomenon.

Advice:

* Always read the question carefully and understand the phenomenon described.
* Consider all options and evaluate their relevance to the phenomenon.
* Avoid being influenced by extraneous information or assumptions.
* Think critically and logically about the possible explanations for the phenomenon.
* Double-check your answer to ensure it is well-supported by the information provided.
