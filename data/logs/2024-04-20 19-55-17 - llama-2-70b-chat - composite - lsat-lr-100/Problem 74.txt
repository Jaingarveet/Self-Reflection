The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Law
Context: Traditional "talk" therapy, in which a patient with a psychological disorder discusses it with a trained therapist, produces chemical changes in the brain. These changes seem to correspond to improvements in certain aspects of the patient's behavior. Thus, physicians will eventually be able to treat such patients as effectively through pharmacological intervention in the brain's neurochemistry as through the lengthy intermediary of traditional "talk" methods.
Question: Which one of the following is an assumption on which the argumoot depends?
Choices:
  A: All neurochemical changes produce corresponding psychological changes.
  B: improvements in a patient's behavior produced by "talk" therapy occur only through chemical changes in the brain's neurochemistry.
  C: Talk therapy has not been effective at bringing about psychological change.
  D: If chemical changes in the brain's neurochemistry correspond to improvemeots in patient behavior, then psychology and neuroscience will eventually be indistinguishable.
  E: Direct intervention in the brain's neurochemistry is likely to become a less expensive way of treating psychological disorders than is "talk" therapy.
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
The argument assumes that the chemical changes in the brain that occur as a result of talk therapy are the sole cause of the corresponding improvements in behavior. This assumption is necessary to support the idea that physicians will eventually be able to treat patients as effectively through pharmacological intervention in the brain's neurochemistry as through talk therapy. If other factors, such as changes in the patient's thoughts or emotions, also play a role in the improvements, then the argument would not be valid.

Therefore, the correct answer is choice [REDACTED]: [REDACTED]

The other choices are not assumptions on which the argument depends:

[REDACTED]: This statement is not an assumption of the argument, as the argument does not address the relationship between neurochemical changes and psychological changes in general.

[REDACTED]: This statement is not an assumption of the argument, as the argument does not suggest that talk therapy is ineffective.

[REDACTED]: This statement is not an assumption of the argument, as the argument does not address the relationship between psychology and neuroscience.

[REDACTED]: This statement is not an assumption of the argument, as the argument does not address the cost-effectiveness of different treatments.
