Action: Answer("E") 

The correct answer is E: Everyone expects self-righteous people to be easily offended.

Explanation:
The passage states that Ellsworth is self-righteous and offended by suggestions of unethical business practices. It is reasonable to assume that people who know Ellsworth expect him to be easily offended, given his self-righteous nature. This expectation does not necessarily imply that Ellsworth is engaged in unethical practices, but it does suggest that his offense may be a result of his self-righteousness rather than any actual wrongdoing.

Therefore, the correct answer is E: Everyone expects self-righteous people to be easily offended. This answer aligns with the evaluation of the passage, which suggests that people who know Ellsworth expect him to be easily offended due to his self-righteous nature.

Option B suggests that Ellsworth has been accused of unethical business practices before, which is not mentioned in the passage. Option C suggests that hypocrites often hide behind righteous indignation, which is not directly related to the passage. Option D suggests that Ellsworth is innocent of all wrongdoing, which is not implied by the passage.
