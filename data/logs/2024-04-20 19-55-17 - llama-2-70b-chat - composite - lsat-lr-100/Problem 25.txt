## User 2:
Topic: Law
Context: When presented with the evidence against him, Ellison freely admitted to engaging in illegal transactions using company facilities. However, the company obtained the evidence by illegally recording Ellison's conversations. Therefore, although the company may demand that he immediately cease, it cannot justifiably take any punitive measures against him.
Question: Which one of the following judgments best illustrates the principle illustrated by the argument above?
Choices:
  A: After Price confessed to having stolen money from Long over a period of several years, Long began stealing from Price. Despite Price's guilt, Long was not justified in taking illegal action against him.
  B: Shakila's secretary has admitted that he is illegally receiving cable television without paying for it. Shakila would not be justified in reporting him, though, since she once did the same thing.
  C: After Takashi told Sarah's parents that he had seen her at the movies on Tuesday, Sarah confessed to sneaking out that day. On Monday, however, Takashi had violated the local curfew for minors. Hence Sarah's parents cannot justifiably punish her in this case.
  D: After a conservation officer discovered them, Kuttner admitted that he had set the illegal animal traps on his land. But, because she was trespassing at the time, the conservation officer cannot justifiably punish Kuttner in this case.
  E: Ramirez was forced by the discovery of new evidence to admit that she lied about her role in managing the chief of staff's financial affairs. Nevertheless, the board of directors cannot justifiably take action against Ramirez, because in past instances it has pardoned others guilty of similar improprieties.

## Assistant 2:
  Answer: C

Explanation:
The principle illustrated by the argument is that if one party has engaged in illegal activity, they cannot justifiably take punitive measures against another party who has also engaged in illegal activity, even if the latter party has admitted their wrongdoing.

In choice C, Takashi violated the local curfew for minors, which is an illegal activity. Therefore, Sarah's parents cannot justifiably punish her for sneaking out, even though she confessed to doing so, since they themselves have engaged in illegal activity.

This scenario is similar to the original argument, where the company obtained evidence of Ellison's illegal activities through illegal means, and therefore cannot justifiably take punitive measures against him.

Reflection:
My previous answer was incorrect because I mistakenly chose choice A. I realized that choice A does not illustrate the principle of the argument, as Long's actions are not illegal, whereas Price's actions are. In contrast, choices C and E both illustrate the principle of the argument, as both involve one party engaging in illegal activity and therefore being unable to justifiably take punitive measures against another party who has also engaged in illegal activity. Therefore, I have selected choice C as the best answer.
