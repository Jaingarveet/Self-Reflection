Topic: Law
Context: A smoker trying to quit is more likely to succeed if his or her doctor greatly exaggerates the dangers of smoking. Similar strategies can be used to break other habits.

Choices:
  A: People tend to believe whatever doctors tell them.
  B: Most of the techniques that help people quit smoking can also help people break other habits.
  C: The more the relevant danger is exaggerated, the more likely one is to break one's habit.
  D: People generally do not find it easy to deceive themselves.

Explanation:
The correct answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED]

The argument assumes that individuals cannot easily adopt the strategy of exaggerating the dangers of smoking unless a doctor or some other third party provides the warning. This implies that people are not likely to deceive themselves into believing the exaggerated danger, and therefore, they need someone else to provide the warning.

Option [REDACTED] is not an assumption of the argument, as the argument does not rely on the belief that people tend to believe whatever doctors tell them.

Option [REDACTED] is not an assumption of the argument, as the argument focuses on the effectiveness of exaggerating the dangers of smoking, not the effectiveness of techniques that help people quit smoking in general.

Option [REDACTED] is not an assumption of the argument, as the argument does not address the relationship between the extent of exaggeration and the likelihood of breaking a habit.

Option [REDACTED] is not an assumption of the argument, as the argument does not address whether a doctor is justified in deceiving a patient.

Therefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED]
