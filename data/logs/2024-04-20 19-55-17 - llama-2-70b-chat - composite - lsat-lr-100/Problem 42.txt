## User 2:
Topic: Law
Context: When a group is unable to reach a consensus, group members are often accused of being stubborn, bullheaded, or unyielding. Such epithets often seem abusive, are difficult to prove, and rarely help the group reach a resolution. Those who wish to make such an accusation stick, however, should choose "unyielding," because one can always appeal to the fact that the accused has not yielded; obviously if one acknowledges that a person has not yielded, then one cannot deny that the person is unyielding, at least on this issue.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately descrthes the argumentative technique employed above?
Choices:
  A: rejecting a factic on the grounds that it constitutes an attack on the character of a person and has no substance in :fact
  B: rejecting a factic on the grounds that the factic makes it virtually imposSlble for the group to reach a consensus on the issue in question
  C: conditionally advocating a factic on the grounds that it results in an accusation that is less offensive than the alternatives
  D: conditionally advocating a factic on the grounds that it results in an argument that would help the group to reach a consensus on the issue in question
  E: conditionally advocating a factic on the grounds that it results in an argument for which one could not consistently accept the premise but deny the conclusion
