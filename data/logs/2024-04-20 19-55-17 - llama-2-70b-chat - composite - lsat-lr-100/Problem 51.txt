Topic: Law
Context: Political scientist: People become unenthusiastic about voting if they believe that important problems can be addressed only by large numbers of people drastically changing their attitudes and that such attitudinal changes generally do not result from government action. The decreasing voter turnout is thus entirely due to a growing conviction that politicians cannot solve the most important problems.
Question: The reasoning in the political scientist's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that the argument
Choices:
  A: presumes, without providing justification, that there is no cause of decreasing voter turnout other than the belief that few important problems can be solved by government action
  B: presumes, without providing justification, that there are no political solutions to the most important problems
  C: infers that important problems can be seriously addressed if people's attitudes do change from the premise that these problems cannot be addressed if people's attitudes do not change
  D: undermines its claim that people no longer believe there are political solutions to important problems by suggesting that people are dissatisfied with politicians
  E: presumes, without providing justification, that voter apathy prevents the attitudinal changes that result in finding solutions to important problems

Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
The political scientist's argument assumes that the only reason for decreasing voter turnout is the belief that politicians cannot solve important problems. However, the argument does not provide any evidence or justification for this claim. It ignores the possibility that other factors, such as voter apathy, disillusionment with politics, or lack of interest in the issues being addressed, may also contribute to decreasing voter turnout. Therefore, option [REDACTED] is the best answer.

Error Keywords:
- Assumption
- Lack of evidence

Solution:
1. Identify the claim made by the political scientist's argument.
2. Identify the assumption made by the political scientist's argument.
3. Evaluate the assumption to determine if it is supported by evidence or justification.
4. Consider alternative explanations for the phenomenon being observed.
5. Determine if the argument's conclusion logically follows from the premises.
6. Consider if the argument addresses all relevant factors that may contribute to the phenomenon.

Instructions:
1. Read the argument carefully and identify the claim being made.
2. Identify the assumption(s) made by the argument.
3. Evaluate the assumption(s) to determine if they are supported by evidence or justification.
4. Consider alternative explanations for the phenomenon being observed.
5. Determine if the argument's conclusion logically follows from the premises.
6. Consider if the argument addresses all relevant factors that may contribute to the phenomenon.
7. Use the above steps to determine the best answer choice.

Advice:
- Always carefully read the argument and identify the claim being made.
- Identify the assumption(s) made by the argument and evaluate if they are supported by evidence or justification.
- Consider alternative explanations for the phenomenon being observed.
- Determine if the argument's conclusion logically follows from the premises.

## Assistant 2:
  Action: Answer("A")

The political scientist's argument assumes that the only reason for decreasing voter turnout is the belief that politicians cannot solve important problems. However, the argument does not provide any evidence or justification for this claim. It ignores the possibility that other factors, such as voter apathy, disillusionment with politics, or lack of interest in the issues being addressed, may also contribute to decreasing voter turnout. Therefore, option A is the best answer.

The argument's conclusion that the decreasing voter turnout is entirely due to a growing conviction that politicians cannot solve the most important problems lacks evidence and justification. The argument does not consider alternative explanations for the phenomenon, such as changes in demographics, voting laws, or political engagement. Additionally, the argument's assumption that people's attitudes are the only factor that can address important problems is not supported by evidence.

Therefore, option A is the best answer, as it accurately identifies the weakness in the argument's assumption that there is no other cause of decreasing voter turnout besides the belief that few important problems can be solved by government action.
