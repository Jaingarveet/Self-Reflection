## User 2:
Topic: Law
Context: In some jurisdictions, lawmakers have instituted sentencing guidelines that mandate a penalty for theft that is identical to the one they have mandated for bribery. Hence, lawmakers in those jurisdictions evidently consider the harm resulting from theft to be equal to the harm resulting from bribery.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would most strengthen the argument?
Choices:
  A: In general, lawmakers mandate penalties for crimes that are proportional to the harm they believe to result from those crimes.
  B: In most cases, lawmakers assess the level of harm resulting from an act in determining whether to make that act illegal.
  C: Often, in response to the unusually great harm resulting from a particular instance of a crime, lawmakers will mandate an increased penalty for that crime.
  D: In most cases, a victim of theft is harmed no more than a victim of bribery is harmed.
  E: If lawmakers mandate penalties for crimes that are proportional to the harm resulting from those crimes, crime in those lawmakers' jurisdictions will be effectively deterred.

## Assistant 2:
  Action: Answer("A")

The correct answer is A: In general, lawmakers mandate penalties for crimes that are proportional to the harm they believe to result from those crimes.

This answer choice supports the argument that lawmakers in those jurisdictions consider the harm resulting from theft to be equal to the harm resulting from bribery, as it states that lawmakers generally mandate penalties for crimes that are proportional to the harm they believe results from those crimes. Therefore, the fact that the penalties for theft and bribery are the same suggests that lawmakers consider the harm resulting from both crimes to be equal.

It's important to note that the other answer choices do not provide the same level of support for the argument. Choice B mentions that lawmakers assess the level of harm resulting from an act in determining whether to make that act illegal, but it does not address the proportionality of penalties. Choice C mentions that lawmakers may mandate increased penalties for crimes that cause great harm, but it does not address the comparison between the harm resulting from theft and bribery. Choice D states that victims of theft and bribery are harmed equally, but it does not address the penalties for the crimes. Choice E mentions that mandating penalties proportional to the harm resulting from crimes will effectively deter crime, but it does not address the comparison between the harm resulting from theft and bribery.
