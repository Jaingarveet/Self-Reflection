Topic: Law
Context: Most people who shop for groceries no more than three times a month buy prepared frozen dinners regularly. In Hallstown most people shop for groceries no more than three times a month. Therefore, in Hallstown most people buy prepared frozen dinners regularly.
Question: Which one of the following arguments has a flawed pattern of reasoning most like the flawed reasoning in the argument above?
Choices:
  A: It is clear that most drivers in West Ansland are safe drivers since there are very few driving accidents in West Ansland and most accidents there are not serious.
  B: It is clear that John cannot drive, since he does not own a car and no one in his family who does not own a car can drive.
  C: It is clear that Fernando's friends usually drive to school, since all of his friends can drive and all of his friends go to school.
  D: It is clear that most people in Highland County drive sedans, since most people who commute to work drive sedans and most people in Highland County commute to work.
  E: It is clear that most of Janine's friends are good drivers, since she accepts rides only from good drivers and she accepts rides from most of her friends.

Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
The argument's flawed pattern of reasoning is based on the fact that it makes a conclusion about a population based on a sample that is not representative of the population. In the argument, the conclusion that most people in Hallstown buy prepared frozen dinners regularly is based on the fact that most people shop for groceries no more than three times a month, but this sample of people who shop for groceries no more than three times a month is not representative of the population of Hallstown.

Similarly, in choice [REDACTED], the conclusion that most people in Highland County drive sedans is based on the fact that most people who commute to work drive sedans and most people in Highland County commute to work. However, this sample of people who commute to work is not representative of the population of Highland County, and therefore the conclusion about most people in Highland County driving sedans is not valid.

The other choices do not have the same flawed pattern of reasoning:

* Choice [REDACTED]: This argument is based on the fact that there are very few driving accidents in West Ansland, which suggests that most drivers in West Ansland are safe drivers. This argument is not based on a sample that is not representative of the population, and therefore it does not have the same flawed pattern of reasoning as the original argument.
* Choice [REDACTED]: This argument is based on the fact that John does not own a car and no one in his family who does not own a car can drive. This argument is not based on a sample that is not representative of the population, and therefore it does not have the same flawed pattern of reasoning as the original argument.
* Choice [REDACTED]: This argument is based on the fact that all of Fernando's friends can drive and all of his friends go to school. This argument is not based on a sample that is not representative of the population, and therefore it does not have the same flawed pattern of reasoning as the original argument.
* Choice [REDACTED]: This argument is based on the fact that she accepts rides only from good drivers and she accepts rides from most of her friends. However, this sample of Janine's friends who she accepts rides from is not representative of all of Janine's friends, and therefore the conclusion about most of Janine's friends being good drivers is not valid.

Therefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED].
