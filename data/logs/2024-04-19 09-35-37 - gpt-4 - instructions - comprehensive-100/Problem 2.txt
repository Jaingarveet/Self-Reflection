## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: A straight picket fence is composed of x pickets each of which is 1/2 inch wide. If there are 6 inches of space between each pair of pickets, which of the following represents the length of fence in feet?
Choices:
  A: 13x/2
  B: 13x/2 - 6
  C: 13x/24
  D: (13x+1)/24
  E: (13x-12)/24
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Identify the components that make up the total length of the fence (width of pickets and space between them).
2. Calculate the total width of the pickets.
3. Calculate the total space between the pickets.
4. Add the total width of the pickets and the total space between them to get the total length in inches.
5. Convert the total length in inches to feet by dividing by 12.
6. Simplify the equation if necessary.
7. Provide your answer in the correct format: 'Action: Answer("[ANSWER_CHOICE]")'.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
1. The components that make up the total length of the fence are the width of the pickets and the space between them.
2. The total width of the pickets is x * 1/2 = x/2 inches.
3. The total space between the pickets is (x - 1) * 6 inches because there is no space after the last picket.
4. The total length in inches is x/2 + (x - 1) * 6 = x/2 + 6x - 6 = 6.5x - 6.
5. Convert the total length in inches to feet by dividing by 12: (6.5x - 6) / 12 = 13x/24 - 1/2.
6. Simplify the equation: 13x/24 - 1/2 = (13x - 12) / 24.
Action: Answer("E")
## Result:
Agent Answer: E
Correct Answer: E
Score: 1
