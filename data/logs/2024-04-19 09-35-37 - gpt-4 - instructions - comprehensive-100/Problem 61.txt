## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:

The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: If $(a x+2)(b x+7)=15 x^{2}+c x+14$ for all values of $x$, and $a+b=8$, what are the two possible values for $c$ ?
Choices:
  A: 3 and 5
  B: 6 and 35

You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Expand the given equation.
2. Equate the coefficients on both sides of the equation.
3. Use the given equation $a + b = 8$ and the derived equation $ab = 15$ to solve for a and b.
4. Substitute the values of a and b into the equation $7a + 2b = c$ to find the values of c.
5. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
6. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
1. Expanding the left side of the equation gives $abx^2 + (7a + 2b)x + 14$.
2. Equating the coefficients on both sides of the equation gives $ab = 15$ and $7a + 2b = c$.
3. Using the given equation $a + b = 8$ and the derived equation $ab = 15$, we can solve for a and b. The solutions are a = 5, b = 3 or a = 3, b = 5.
4. Substituting these values into the equation $7a + 2b = c$ gives c = 41 or c = 31.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
