# Model: gpt-4 | Agent: instructions | Exam: comprehensive-100 | Problem 69 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:
Topic: Geography
Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: $$\begin{aligned}& 2 x-3 y=-14 \\& 3 x-2 y=-6\end{aligned}$$If $(x, y)$ is a solution to the system of equations above, what is the value of $x-y$ ?
Choices:
  A: -20
  B: $\quad-8$
  C: -4
  D: 8
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Identify the two equations in the system.
2. Subtract the second equation from the first.
3. Subtract the coefficients of the variables correctly.
4. Subtract the constants on the right side of the equations correctly.
5. Simplify the equation to find the value of x - y.
6. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
7. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The two equations are 2x - 3y = -14 and 3x - 2y = -6. 
Subtracting the second equation from the first gives: 
(2x - 3x) - (3y - 2y) = -14 - (-6)
This simplifies to -x - y = -8
So, x - y = 8
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
