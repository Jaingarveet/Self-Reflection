6. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The formula for the sum of an arithmetic series is n/2 * (2a + (n-1)d), where n is the number of terms, a is the first term, and d is the common difference. Here, a is 7 years (or 84 months, since the common difference is given in months), d is 3 months, and the sum is 250 years (or 3000 months). 
Substituting these values into the formula gives us:
3000 = n/2 * (2*84 + (n-1)*3)
Solving this equation for n will give us the number of members in the club.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
