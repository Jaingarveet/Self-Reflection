## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The conditions are as follows:
- Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report.
- Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
- If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
- Kyle and Lenore do not give reports.
Let's evaluate each option against these conditions:
A: Helen, George, and Nina
- George cannot give a report on Monday, so this option is invalid.
B: Irving, Robert, and Helen
- This option is valid as it doesn't violate any conditions.
C: Nina, Helen, and Olivia
- If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Tuesday. But George must give a report on Tuesday, so this option is invalid.
D: Olivia, Robert, and Irving
- This option is valid as it doesn't violate any conditions.
E: Robert, George, and Helen
- George cannot give a report on Monday, so this option is invalid.
So, the possible answers are B and D.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: D
