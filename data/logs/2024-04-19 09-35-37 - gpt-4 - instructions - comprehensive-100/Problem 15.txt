Question: Which of the following is true will raise the most doubts about the opinions of the above experts?

  A: In 1997, the "Hot Spring Xinjiang Northern Salamander Nature Reserve" was established, and local herders' awareness of protecting Xinjiang Northern Salamander is increasing.
  B: In recent years, the rainfall has decreased and the groundwater level has fallen, which has affected the water source environment in which the northern salamander in Xinjiang lives.
  C: Xinjiang salamander is a kind of animal that is afraid of light.Most of them hide under the rocks of the creek during the day, and avoid the trampling of cattle and sheep.
  D: Xinjiang's northern salamanders are located in the mountains, and most tourists cannot enter at all.

B: This choice provides an alternative explanation for the decline in the salamander population, suggesting that changes in the environment, specifically the decrease in rainfall and groundwater level, could be the cause. 
C: This choice directly contradicts the expert's opinion by suggesting that the salamanders are able to avoid being trampled by hiding under rocks during the day.
D: This choice suggests that the location of the salamanders in the mountains prevents most tourists from entering, but it does not directly relate to the expert's opinion about the cause of the decline in the salamander population.
