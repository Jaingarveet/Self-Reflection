Reflection:

Initial Answer: I previously answered that K is placed on a higher shelf than the shelf G is placed on. However, upon further reflection, I realized that this answer is incorrect.

Correct Answer: The correct answer is (C) I is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf F is placed on.

Explanation:

From the given information, we know that I is placed on the middle shelf. Since more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, the bottom shelf must have at least two books. Therefore, the book placed on the bottom shelf next to I must be F. This means that I is placed on a higher shelf than the shelf F is placed on, which is option (C).

REDACTED:

* The bookcase has exactly three shelves, not eight books.
* The books are placed on the shelves in the following order: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O.
* The top shelf has at least two books, but not all the books are placed on the top shelf.
* The middle shelf has at least two books, and I is placed on the middle shelf.
* The bottom shelf has at least two books, and the book placed next to I is F.
* K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
* O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
* F is placed on the same shelf as M.
