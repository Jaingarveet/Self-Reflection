Explanation:
The question asks us to determine the businesses that are located immediately on either side of the pair consisting of the optometrist and the shoe store. Based on the constraints provided, we can deduce the possible locations of the businesses in the shopping center.

The pharmacy must be at one end of the row, so there are only two possible locations: one end and the other end. Since the pharmacy is not located at the end that the optometrist is located, it must be located at the other end.

One of the restaurants must be at the other end of the row, so there are only two possible locations: the other end and one of the other spaces. Since the restaurant is not located at the end that the shoe store is located, it must be located between the optometrist and the toy store.

The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, so there are only three possible locations for the second restaurant: between the optometrist and the toy store, between [REDACTED], or between [REDACTED]. Since the second restaurant is not located between the optometrist and the toy store, it must be located between [REDACTED].

The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, so there are only two possible locations: next to the optometrist or next to the veterinarian. Since the pharmacy is located at the other end of the row, it must be next to the optometrist.

The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so there is only one possible location for the toy store: between the pharmacy and the veterinarian.

Therefore, the businesses immediately on either side of the pair consisting of the optometrist and the shoe store are:

* The pharmacy
* The restaurant located between [REDACTED]

So, the correct answer is (D) [REDACTED].
