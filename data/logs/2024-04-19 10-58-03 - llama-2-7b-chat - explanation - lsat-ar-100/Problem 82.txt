There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

  C: Zone 1: Parra, Quinn Zone 2: Kim, Udall Zone 3: Mahr, Stuckey, Tiao
  D: Zone 1: Stuckey, Udall Zone 2: Kim, Tiao Zone 3: Mahr, Parra, Quinn
  E: Zone 1: Tiao Zone 2: Kim, Parra, Quinn Zone 3: Stuckey, Udall
Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly as Choice B. Upon reflection, I realized that the correct answer is Choice C.

Explanation:
The correct matching of the sales representatives to the sales zones is:

Zone 1: Parra, Quinn
Zone 2: Kim, Udall
Zone 3: Mahr, Stuckey, Tiao

The reasoning behind this answer is as follows:

* Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other, so they must be in the same zone.
* Kim and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other, so they must be in the same zone.
* Mahr, Stuckey, and Tiao work in more than one sales zone, so they must be in different zones.

Therefore, the correct matching of the sales representatives to the sales zones is Choice C.
## Result:
Agent Answer: None
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
