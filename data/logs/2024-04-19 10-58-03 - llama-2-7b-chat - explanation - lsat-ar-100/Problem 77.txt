Explanation:
## Assistant 2:
  Thought: 
After reflecting on my previous answer, I realized that I made an error in my reasoning. To determine the number of employees for whom the assignment of a parking space is limited to one of only two possible spaces, we need to analyze the given rules.

Rule 1: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
Rule 2: Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
Rule 3: Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.

From these rules, we can deduce that the following employees have a limited number of options for their parking space assignment:

1. Young - must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa, so options are #5 or #6.
2. Xu - must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, so options are #5 or #6.
3. Robertson - must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young, so options are #1, #2, or #4.

Therefore, the answer is (B) two employees have a limited number of options for their parking space assignment.

Explanation:
The two employees who have a limited number of options for their parking space assignment are Young and Xu. Both must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than the other employee, so their options are limited to #5 or #6.
