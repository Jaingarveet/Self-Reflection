Initial Answer:
I previously answered this question by selecting choice (B) Greyhounds and Himalayans are both featured on day 7. However, upon further reflection, I realized that this answer is incorrect.

Correct Answer:
After analyzing the given conditions, I have come to the conclusion that the correct answer is choice (D) Rottweilers and Manx are both featured on day 5.

Explanation:

Day 1: Greyhounds are featured, so no breed is featured on day 2.
Day 2: No breed is featured on day 2, so choice (A) Greyhounds and Siamese are both featured on day 2 is incorrect.
Day 3: Himalayans are featured, so no breed is featured on day 4.
Day 4: No breed is featured on day 4, so choice (C) Rottweilers and Himalayans are both featured on day 4 is incorrect.
Day 5: Rottweilers are not featured on day 5, so choice (D) Rottweilers and Manx are both featured on day 5 is the correct answer.
Day 6: Newfoundlands are not featured on day 6, so choice (E) Newfoundlands and Manx are both featured on day 6 is incorrect.
Day 7: Himalayans are not featured on day 7, so choice (B) Greyhounds and Himalayans are both featured on day 7 is incorrect.

Therefore, the correct answer is choice (D) Rottweilers and Manx are both featured on day 5.
