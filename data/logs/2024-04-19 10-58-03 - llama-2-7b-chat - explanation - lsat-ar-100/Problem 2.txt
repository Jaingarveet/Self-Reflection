Context: A shopping center has exactly seven spaces—space 1 through space 7—arranged in a straight row. Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
Question: Which one of the following, if substituted for the constraint that the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, would have the same effect in determining the locations of the businesses?

  A: A restaurant must be in either space 3, space 4, or space 5.
  B: A restaurant must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  C: Either the toy store or the veterinarian must be somewhere between the two restaurants.

Context: A shopping center has exactly seven spaces—space 1 through space 7—arranged in a straight row. Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
Question: Which one of the following, if substituted for the constraint that the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, would have the same effect in determining the locations of the businesses?
Choices:
  A: A restaurant must be in either space 3, space 4, or space 5.
  B: A restaurant must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  C: Either the toy store or the veterinarian must be somewhere between the two restaurants.
  D: No more than two businesses can separate the pharmacy and the restaurant nearest it.
  E: The optometrist cannot be next to the shoe store.
Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and after reflecting on my solution and the correct answer, I realized that I misunderstood the problem. The correct answer is (C) Either the toy store or the veterinarian must be somewhere between the two restaurants.
Explanation:
If the constraint that the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses is replaced with the new constraint, the locations of the businesses will still satisfy all the constraints. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so the toy store must be in space 5 or 7. The veterinarian must be in space 3 or 4, and the two restaurants must be in spaces 1 and 2, respectively. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, so it must be in space 2 or 4. The shoe store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so it must be in space 6. The optometrist must be in space 1, and the two businesses between the pharmacy and the restaurant nearest it must be the shoe store and the toy store, so the shoe store must be in space 6 and the toy store must be in space 5. Therefore, the locations of the businesses will still satisfy all the constraints if the new constraint is used instead of the original constraint.
