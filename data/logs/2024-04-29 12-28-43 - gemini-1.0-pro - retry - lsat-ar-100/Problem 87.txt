## Assistant 2:
Let's analyze the requirements step-by-step:
1. **No more than four French works:** This means the organizer can select 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 French works.
2. **At least three but no more than four novels:** This means the organizer must select either 3 or 4 novels.
3. **At least as many French novels as Russian novels:** This means the organizer must select at least as many French novels as Russian novels.
4. **If both French plays are selected, then the Russian play is not selected:** This means the organizer can either select both French plays and not the Russian play, or select one or none of the French plays and the Russian play.
Now, let's consider the minimum number of works the organizer must select:
- **French novels:** The organizer must select at least 3 French novels to satisfy requirement 3.
- **Russian novels:** The organizer can select 0, 1, or 2 Russian novels.
- **French plays:** The organizer can select 0, 1, or 2 French plays.
- **Russian play:** The organizer can select 0 or 1 Russian play.
Therefore, the minimum number of works the organizer must select is 3 French novels + 0 Russian novels + 0 French plays + 0 Russian play = 3 works.
However, the organizer must also select at least 5 works in total. Since the minimum number of works is already 3, the organizer must select at least 2 more works.
Looking at the choices, only option E, two Russian novels, satisfies the minimum requirements:
- **French novels:** 3 (minimum)
- **Russian novels:** 2 (minimum)
- **French plays:** 0 (minimum)
- **Russian play:** 0 (minimum)
Therefore, the organizer must at least select two Russian novels.
Action: Answer("E")
