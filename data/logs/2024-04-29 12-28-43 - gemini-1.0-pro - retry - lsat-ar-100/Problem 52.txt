## Assistant 2:
## Reflection on Previous Incorrect Answer
**Previous Incorrect Answer:** C
**Reasoning for Incorrect Answer:** I incorrectly assumed that since Iturbe testifies on Wednesday and Jackson is also scheduled for Wednesday, then there must be exactly one witness scheduled for Monday to fulfill the condition of at least one witness testifying on Monday.
**Correct Answer:** E
**Reasoning for Correct Answer:**
1. **Iturbe and Jackson on Wednesday:** This leaves Monday and Tuesday for the remaining three witnesses (Franco, Garcia, and Hong).
2. **At least one witness on Monday:** This eliminates the possibility of all three witnesses testifying on Tuesday.
3. **Exactly two witnesses on Tuesday:** This leaves only one witness for Monday.
4. **Franco and Garcia cannot testify together:** This means either Franco or Garcia must be the lone witness on Monday.
5. **Jackson on Wednesday:** If Jackson is also on Wednesday, then Franco and Garcia cannot both be on Tuesday (violating the condition of exactly two witnesses on Tuesday). Therefore, Garcia must be on Monday, leaving Franco for Tuesday.
Therefore, the only possible schedule that satisfies all conditions is:
* **Monday:** Garcia
* **Tuesday:** Franco, Hong
* **Wednesday:** Iturbe, Jackson
This schedule also fulfills the condition that Garcia and Hong do not testify on the same day.
**Action:** Answer("E") 
## Result:
Agent Answer: E
Correct Answer: C
