## Assistant 2:
## Analyzing the Rules:
1. **J must be shown in the evening.**
2. **K cannot be shown in the morning.**
3. **L must be shown after K and before M.**
## Applying the Rules:
* **J:** Evening
* **K:** Not morning, so either afternoon or evening.
* **L:** After K and before M, so either afternoon or evening.
* **M:** After L, so either evening or morning.
* **N:** No restrictions.
* **O:** No restrictions.
* **P:** No restrictions.
## Analyzing the Choices:
* **A: K is shown in the evening.** This could be true, but not necessarily.
* **B: L is shown in the afternoon.** This could be true, but not necessarily.
* **C: L is shown in the evening.** This could be true, but not necessarily.
* **D: M is shown in the morning.** This could be true, but not necessarily.
* **E: M is shown in the afternoon.** This could be true, but not necessarily.
## Conclusion:
None of the choices are guaranteed to be true based on the given information. Therefore, the answer is **None of the Above**. 
## Reflection:
In my previous attempt, I focused on individual rules without considering the overall possibilities. This led to an incorrect conclusion. By systematically analyzing the rules and applying them to each house, I was able to identify that none of the choices are necessarily true. 
## Result:
Agent Answer: None
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
