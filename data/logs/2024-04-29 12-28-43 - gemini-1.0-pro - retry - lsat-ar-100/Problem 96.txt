Topic: Law
Context: On each of exactly seven consecutive days (day 1 though day 7), a pet shop features exactly one of three breeds of kitten—Himalayan, Manx, Siamese—and exactly one of three breeds of puppy—Greyhound, Newfoundland, Rottweiler. The following conditions must apply: Greyhounds are featured on day 1. No breed is featured on any two consecutive days. Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7. Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1. Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.
Question: If Himalayans are not featured on day 2, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Manx are featured on day 3.
  B: Siamese are featured on day 4.
  C: Rottweilers are featured on day 5.
  D: Himalayans are featured on day 6.
  E: Greyhounds are featured on day 7.

## Assistant 2:
Let's analyze each choice:
* **A: Manx are featured on day 3.** This could be true. If Himalayans are not featured on day 2, then Manx could be featured on day 3, followed by Siamese on day 4, and Rottweilers on day 5.
* **B: Siamese are featured on day 4.** This could also be true. Following the same logic as above, Siamese could be featured on day 4 after Manx on day 3.
* **C: Rottweilers are featured on day 5.** This could be true as well. If Rottweilers are not featured on day 7 or with Himalayans, then day 5 is a possibility.
* **D: Himalayans are featured on day 6.** This cannot be true. Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1 or 7. If they are not featured on day 2, then they cannot be featured on day 6 either.
* **E: Greyhounds are featured on day 7.** This cannot be true. Greyhounds are featured on day 1, and no breed is featured on two consecutive days.
Therefore, the possible scenarios are A, B, and C.
