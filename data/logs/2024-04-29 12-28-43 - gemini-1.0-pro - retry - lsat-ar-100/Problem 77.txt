## Assistant 2:
## Step-by-Step Solution:
1. **Analyze the rules:**
    - Young > Togowa
    - Xu > Souza
    - Robertson > Young
    - Robertson: #1, #2, #3, or #4
2. **Start with Robertson:**
    - Based on the rules, Robertson cannot be assigned #5 or #6.
    - Therefore, Robertson must be assigned one of #1, #2, #3, or #4.
3. **Consider Young and Togowa:**
    - Since Robertson > Young, Young cannot be assigned #1, #2, or #3.
    - Young must be assigned #4, #5, or #6.
    - Due to the rule Young > Togowa, Togowa cannot be assigned #5 or #6.
    - Togowa must be assigned #1, #2, #3, or #4.
4. **Analyze Xu and Souza:**
    - Since Xu > Souza, Souza cannot be assigned #5 or #6.
    - Souza must be assigned #1, #2, #3, or #4.
5. **Identify limitations:**
    - Young and Togowa are both limited to #1, #2, #3, or #4.
    - This means two employees have their choices limited to two possible spaces.
Therefore, the answer is **B: two**. 
## Reflection:
In my previous attempt, I incorrectly identified three employees with limited choices. I failed to consider the impact of the rule Robertson > Young on Young's possible assignments. This led me to overlook the limitation on Young's choices. By carefully analyzing each rule and its implications, I was able to arrive at the correct answer in this attempt. 
## Result:
Agent Answer: None
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
