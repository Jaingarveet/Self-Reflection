Context: A bakery makes exactly three kinds of cookieâ€”oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar. Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day. The following conditions apply: No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
Question: If the number of batches made on Friday is exactly one, then which one of the following could be true?

## Assistant 2:
## Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Friday:** We know there's only one batch made on Friday. Since there are three batches of each kind of cookie, this batch cannot be the third batch of any kind.
2. **Thursday:** The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday. This leaves two possibilities for the remaining Friday batch: either the first batch of sugar cookies or the third batch of peanut butter cookies.
3. **Monday:** We know at least one batch is made on Monday. This batch cannot be the second batch of oatmeal cookies or the second batch of sugar cookies (due to the conditions). Therefore, it must be either the first batch of oatmeal cookies, the first batch of peanut butter cookies, or the first batch of sugar cookies.
4. **Peanut Butter and Oatmeal:** The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. Since the first batch of peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Monday (due to the Monday batch being one of the first batches), it must be made on Tuesday or Wednesday.
5. **Combining Information:**
    - If the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday, then the second batch of oatmeal cookies is also made on Tuesday. This leaves Wednesday and Thursday for the third batch of oatmeal cookies, which contradicts the information about Friday.
    - If the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Wednesday, then the second batch of oatmeal cookies is also made on Wednesday. This leaves Thursday and Friday for the third batch of oatmeal cookies. Since the third batch cannot be made on Friday, it must be made on Thursday. This leaves the first batch of sugar cookies for Friday, satisfying all conditions.
Therefore, the only possibility that satisfies all conditions is:
- **First batch of sugar cookies on Monday**
- **First batch of peanut butter cookies on Wednesday**
- **Third batch of oatmeal cookies on Thursday**
- **First batch of sugar cookies on Friday**
