## Assistant 2:
## Reflection on Previous Incorrect Answer
**My previous answer:** C: Garcia is scheduled to testify on Wednesday.
**Reasoning for previous answer:** I incorrectly assumed that Franco and Garcia could not testify on the same day, which led me to believe that Garcia must testify on Wednesday since Iturbe already had that slot.
**Correct answer:** E: Iturbe is the only witness scheduled to testify on Wednesday.
**Reasoning for correct answer:**
1. **Franco and Garcia cannot testify on the same day.** This eliminates options A and C.
2. **Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.** This eliminates option B.
3. **Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.** This means that Franco and Hong cannot both testify on Tuesday, eliminating option D.
4. **At least one witness testifies on Monday.** This means that Hong cannot testify on Monday, leaving Wednesday as the only possible day for her.
5. **Therefore, Iturbe is the only witness left to testify on Wednesday.**
**Action:** Answer("E") 
## Result:
Agent Answer: E
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
