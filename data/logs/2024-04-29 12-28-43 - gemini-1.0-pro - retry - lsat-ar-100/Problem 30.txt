Context: During a recital, two pianists—Wayne and Zara—will perform solos. There will be five solos altogether, performed one immediately after another. Each solo will be either a modern piece or a traditional piece. The choice of pianist and type of piece for the solos must conform to the following conditions: The third solo is a traditional piece. Exactly two of the traditional pieces are performed consecutively. In the fourth solo, either Wayne performs a traditional piece or Zara performs a modern piece.

## Assistant 2:
## Analyzing the problem:
1. **Third solo is traditional:** This means either the second or fourth solo must also be traditional to fulfill the condition of two consecutive traditional pieces.
2. **Fourth solo:** Wayne performs a traditional piece OR Zara performs a modern piece. This means the other option must be true for the fifth solo (Wayne performs a modern piece OR Zara performs a traditional piece).
3. **Second and fifth solo:** The pianist who performs the second solo does NOT perform the fifth solo. This eliminates some possibilities depending on the first solo.
## Analyzing the answer choices:
**A: Zara performs the first solo:** This could be true, but we need more information to confirm.
**B: Wayne performs the third solo:** This could be true, but we need more information to confirm.
**C: Zara performs the fifth solo:** This could be true, but we need more information to confirm.
**D: The second solo is a traditional piece:** This is NOT necessarily true. If Zara performs the first and second solos, both could be modern pieces.
**E: The fourth solo is a modern piece:** This is NOT necessarily true. If Wayne performs the third and fourth solos, both could be traditional pieces.
## Reaching a conclusion:
We need more information about the first solo to determine which statement must be true. 
Therefore, the answer is: **None of the above**. 
## Result:
Agent Answer: None
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
