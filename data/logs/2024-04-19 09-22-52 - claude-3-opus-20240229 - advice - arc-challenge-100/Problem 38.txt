## System:
You are an expert in Science.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's approach this step-by-step:
1. The question provides the densities of red-clay bricks (2000 kg/m^3) and air (1 kg/m^3).
2. To find the mass, we use the formula: mass = density × volume
3. For each choice, let's calculate the mass:
A. 2 m^3 of bricks
   mass = 2000 kg/m^3 × 2 m^3 = 4000 kg
B. 4 m^3 of bricks 
   mass = 2000 kg/m^3 × 4 m^3 = 8000 kg
C. 6000 m^3 of air
   mass = 1 kg/m^3 × 6000 m^3 = 6000 kg
D. 10,000 m^3 of air
   mass = 1 kg/m^3 × 10,000 m^3 = 10,000 kg
4. Comparing the masses:
   6000 kg < 10,000 kg < 4000 kg < 8000 kg
Therefore, 6000 m^3 of air has the lowest mass among the given choices.
Action: Answer("C")
