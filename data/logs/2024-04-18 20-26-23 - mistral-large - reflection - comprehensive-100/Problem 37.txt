You have incorrectly answered the following multiple-choice question.
Your task is to reflect on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
You will then use this information help you answer the same question in the future.
First, explain why you answered the question incorrectly.
Second, list the keywords that describe the type of your errors from most general to most specific. 
Third, solve the problem again, step-by-step, based on your knowledge of the correct answer.
Fourth, create a list of detailed instructions to help you correctly solve this problem in the future.
Finally, create a list of general advice to help you solve similar types of problems in the future.  
Be concise in your response; however, capture all of the essential information.  
For guidance, I will provide you with a single generic example problem and reflection (below).

Topic: Geography and Math
Question: What is the product of the number of letters contained in the name of the city where Iowa State University is located multiplied by the number of letters contained in the name of the state?
Choices:
    A: 16
    B: 20
    C: 24
    D: 32
Thought:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
ISU is located in the state of Iowa.
Action: Answer("D")
---
Correct Answer: A
## Assistant 1:
Explanation:
I miscalculated the product of the number of letters in the city and state names. 
The gap in my knowledge was not in geography but in basic arithmetic. 
I knew the correct city and state but made a calculation error.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Arithmetic error
 - Multiplication error
Solution:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
Iowa State University is located in the state of Iowa.
The city name "Ames" contains 4 letters.
The state name "Iowa" contains 4 letters.
The product of 4*4 is 16.
Instructions:
1. Identify the city where the university is located.
2. Identify the state where the university is located.
3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.
4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.
5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.
6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.
7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them.

Topic: Law
Context: People who are allergic to cats are actually allergic to certain proteins found in the animals' skin secretions and saliva; which particular proteins are responsible, however, varies from allergy sufferer to allergy sufferer. Since all cats shed skin and spread saliva around their environment, there is no such thing as a cat incapable of provoking allergic reactions, although it is common for a given cat to cause an allergic reaction in some-but not all-people who are allergic to cats.
Question: Which one of the following statements is most strongly supported by the information above?
Choices:
  A: Any particular individual will be allergic to some breeds of cat but not to others.
  B: No cat is capable of causing an allergic reaction in all types of allergy sufferers.
  C: Not all cats are identical with respect to the proteins contained in their skin secretions and saliva.
  D: The allergic reactions of some people who are allergic to cats are more intense than the allergic reactions of other allergy sufferers.
  E: There is no way to predict whether a given cat will produce an allergic reaction in a particular allergy sufferer.

Thought:
The information provided states that different allergy sufferers are allergic to different proteins found in cats' skin secretions and saliva. It also states that all cats shed skin and spread saliva around their environment, so there is no such thing as a cat incapable of provoking allergic reactions. However, it is common for a given cat to cause an allergic reaction in some-but not all-people who are allergic to cats.

Based on this information, we can infer that no cat is capable of causing an allergic reaction in all types of allergy sufferers, since different allergy sufferers are allergic to different proteins. We can also infer that not all cats are identical with respect to the proteins contained in their skin secretions and saliva, since some cats may cause an allergic reaction in some allergy sufferers but not in others. However, we cannot infer that any particular individual will be allergic to some breeds of cat but not to others, since the information does not mention breeds specifically. We also cannot infer that the allergic reactions of some people who are allergic to cats are more intense than the allergic reactions of other allergy sufferers, since the information does not mention the intensity of allergic reactions. Finally, we cannot infer that there is no way to predict whether a given cat will produce an allergic reaction in a particular allergy sufferer, since the information does not mention prediction specifically.

Action: Answer("B")

Correct Answer: C
## Assistant 2:
Response:
Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I focused on the information about different allergy sufferers being allergic to different proteins and overlooked the information about the variability in proteins found in different cats.

Error Keywords:
 - Overlooking information
 - Misinterpreting information
 - Incorrect inference

Solution:
The information provided states that different allergy sufferers are allergic to different proteins found in cats' skin secretions and saliva. It also states that all cats shed skin and spread saliva around their environment, so there is no such thing as a cat incapable of provoking allergic reactions. However, it is common for a given cat to cause an allergic reaction in some-but not all-people who are allergic to cats.
