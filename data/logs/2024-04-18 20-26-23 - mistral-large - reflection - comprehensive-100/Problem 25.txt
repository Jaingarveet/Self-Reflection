You are an expert in Law.
You have incorrectly answered the following multiple-choice question.
Your task is to reflect on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
You will then use this information help you answer the same question in the future.
First, explain why you answered the question incorrectly.
Second, list the keywords that describe the type of your errors from most general to most specific. 
Third, solve the problem again, step-by-step, based on your knowledge of the correct answer.
Fourth, create a list of detailed instructions to help you correctly solve this problem in the future.
Finally, create a list of general advice to help you solve similar types of problems in the future.  
Be concise in your response; however, capture all of the essential information.  
For guidance, I will provide you with a single generic example problem and reflection (below).

Topic: Geography and Math
Question: What is the product of the number of letters contained in the name of the city where Iowa State University is located multiplied by the number of letters contained in the name of the state?
Choices:
    A: 16
    B: 20
    C: 24
    D: 32
Thought:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
ISU is located in the state of Iowa.
Action: Answer("D")
---
Correct Answer: A
## Assistant 1:
Explanation:
I miscalculated the product of the number of letters in the city and state names. 
The gap in my knowledge was not in geography but in basic arithmetic. 
I knew the correct city and state but made a calculation error.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Arithmetic error
 - Multiplication error
Solution:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
Iowa State University is located in the state of Iowa.
The city name "Ames" contains 4 letters.
The state name "Iowa" contains 4 letters.
The product of 4*4 is 16.
Instructions:
1. Identify the city where the university is located.
2. Identify the state where the university is located.
3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.
4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.
5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.
6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.
7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them.

Topic: Law
Context: A shopping center has exactly seven spaces—space 1 through space 7—arranged in a straight row. Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
Question: Which one of the following could be the order of the businesses in spaces 1 through 7 respectively?
Choices:
  A: pharmacy, optometrist, shoe store, restaurant, veterinarian, toy store, restaurant
  B: pharmacy, veterinarian, optometrist, shoe store, restaurant, toy store, restaurant
  C: restaurant, shoe store, veterinarian, pharmacy, optometrist, toy store, restaurant
  D: restaurant, toy store, optometrist, restaurant, veterinarian, shoe store, pharmacy
  E: restaurant, optometrist, toy store, restaurant, shoe store, veterinarian, pharmacy

Thought:
The pharmacy must be at one end of the row, so it can only be in space 1 or 7.
One of the restaurants must be at the other end of the row, so it can only be in space 1 or 7, but not the same space as the pharmacy.
The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, so they cannot be in adjacent spaces.
The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, so it cannot be in space 1 if the optometrist or veterinarian is not in space 2, and it cannot be in space 7 if the optometrist or veterinarian is not in space 6.
The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so they cannot be in adjacent spaces.

Let's evaluate each choice:
A: pharmacy, optometrist, shoe store, restaurant, veterinarian, toy store, restaurant - This choice satisfies all the constraints.
B: pharmacy, veterinarian, optometrist, shoe store, restaurant, toy store, restaurant - This choice violates the constraint that the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
C: restaurant, shoe store, veterinarian, pharmacy, optometrist, toy store, restaurant - This choice violates the constraint that the pharmacy must be at one end of the row.
D: restaurant, toy store, optometrist, restaurant, veterinarian, shoe store, pharmacy - This choice violates the constraint that the pharmacy must be at one end of the row.
E: restaurant, optometrist, toy store, restaurant, shoe store, veterinarian, pharmacy - This choice violates the constraint that the pharmacy must be at one end of the row.

Action: Answer("A")

 --- 
Correct Answer: E
## Assistant 2:
Response:
Explanation:
I made an error in my evaluation of choice E. I incorrectly stated that it violates the constraint that the pharmacy must be at one end of the row. However, upon closer examination, the pharmacy is indeed at one end of the row in choice E.

Error Keywords:
 - Evaluation error
 - Constraint violation error
 - End of the row error

Solution:
The pharmacy must be at one end of the row, so it can only be in space 1 or 7.
One of the restaurants must be at the other end of the row, so it can only be in space 1 or 7, but not the same space as the pharmacy.
The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, so they cannot be in adjacent spaces.
The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, so it cannot be in space 1 if the optometrist or veterinarian is not in space 2, and it cannot be in space 7 if the optometrist or veterinarian is not in space 6.
The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so they cannot be in adjacent spaces.

Let's evaluate each choice:
A: pharmacy, optometrist, shoe store, restaurant, veterinarian, toy store, restaurant - This choice satisfies all the constraints.
B: pharmacy, veterinarian, optometrist, shoe store, restaurant, toy store, restaurant - This choice violates the constraint that the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
C: restaurant, shoe store, veterinarian, pharmacy, optometrist, toy store, restaurant - This choice violates the constraint that the pharmacy must be at one end of the row.
D: restaurant, toy store, optometrist, restaurant, veterinarian, shoe store, pharmacy - This choice violates the constraint that the pharmacy must be at one end of the row.
E: restaurant, optometrist, toy store, restaurant, shoe store, veterinarian, pharmacy - This choice satisfies all the constraints.

Instructions:
1. Identify the constraints given in the problem.
2. Evaluate each choice against the constraints.
3. Eliminate any choices that violate the constraints.
4. Choose the answer that satisfies all the constraints.

Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your evaluation of each choice against the constraints.
 - Remember that the pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
 - Remember that the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
 - Remember that the pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
 - Remember that the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
