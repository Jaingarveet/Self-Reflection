## User 2:
Topic: Law
Context: Of the eight students—George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert—in a seminar, exactly six will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
Question: If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, could be given by
Choices:
  A: Helen, George, and Nina
  B: Irving, Robert, and Helen
  C: Nina, Helen, and Olivia
  D: Olivia, Robert, and Irving
  E: Robert, George, and Helen
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
*   **George must present on Tuesday**, so he cannot present on Monday or Wednesday. This eliminates options A, B, and E.
*   **Olivia and Robert cannot present in the afternoon**. If either of them presents on Monday morning, the other would have to present on Tuesday morning (since George is on Tuesday and the other two options have Helen on Monday). This would leave only Helen and Irving for Wednesday, violating the rule about Nina. 
*   Therefore, **neither Olivia nor Robert can present on Monday**, eliminating option D.
*   The only remaining option is **C: Nina, Helen, and Olivia**. This satisfies all conditions: Nina on Monday, followed by Helen and Irving on Tuesday (with George in the afternoon), and Olivia on Wednesday morning with Robert in the afternoon. 
Action: Answer("C") 
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
