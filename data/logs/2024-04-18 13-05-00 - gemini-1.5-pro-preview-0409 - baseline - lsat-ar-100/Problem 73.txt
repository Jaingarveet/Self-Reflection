Topic: Law
Context: For the school paper, five students—Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, Megregian, and O'Neill—each review one or more of exactly three plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation, but do not review any other plays. The following conditions must apply: Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
Question: If exactly three of the students review Undulation, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Megregian does not review Undulation.
  B: O'Neill does not review Undulation.
  C: Jiang reviews Undulation.
  D: Lopez reviews Tamerlane.
  E: O'Neill reviews Sunset.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
*   We know Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, so they cannot be the pair who reviewed the same plays.
*   If three students reviewed Undulation, then the pair who reviewed the same plays must have reviewed Undulation and one other play.
Analysis of Choices:
*   **A:** If Megregian doesn't review Undulation, then they can't be part of the pair, and only two students would have reviewed Undulation. So, this is not possible.
*   **B:** If O'Neill doesn't review Undulation, then they only reviewed Tamerlane. This allows for another pair to review Undulation and one other play. **This is possible.**
*   **C:** If Jiang reviews Undulation, then neither Lopez nor Megregian can review it (due to the given condition). This leaves only two reviewers for Undulation. So, this is not possible.
*   **D:** If Lopez reviews Tamerlane, then they would have the same reviews as Kramer and O'Neill, making it three people with the same reviews. This contradicts the given information. So, this is not possible.
*   **E:** If O'Neill reviews Sunset, then they reviewed both Sunset and Tamerlane. This leaves room for another pair to review Undulation and one other play. **This is possible.**
