Topic: Law
Context: Exactly eight books—F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O—are placed on a bookcase with exactly three shelves—the top shelf, the middle shelf, and the bottom shelf. At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.
Question: Which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: O is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf M is placed on.
  B: K is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf G is placed on.
  C: I is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf F is placed on.
  D: G is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf O is placed on.
  E: F is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf L is placed on.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
*   We know there are 3 shelves: Top, Middle, Bottom. 
*   More books are on the Bottom shelf than the Top shelf.
*   I is on the Middle shelf.
*   K is above F.
*   O is above L.
*   F and M are on the same shelf.
Analysis:
*   **A:** We don't know O's exact position relative to M. 
*   **B:** We don't know G's exact position relative to K.
*   **C:** Since I is on the Middle shelf, and K is above F, F cannot be on the Top shelf (as that would leave no room for K above it). So, F must be on the Bottom or Middle shelf, both below I. 
*   **D:** We don't know G's exact position relative to O.
*   **E:** Since O is above L, and F is on the same shelf as M, and there are more books on the Bottom shelf than the Top, F and M must be on the Bottom shelf, placing them above L.
Action: Answer("E")
