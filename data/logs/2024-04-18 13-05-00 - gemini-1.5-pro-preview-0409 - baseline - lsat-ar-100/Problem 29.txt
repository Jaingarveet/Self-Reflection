Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Law
Context: Exactly eight books—F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O—are placed on a bookcase with exactly three shelves—the top shelf, the middle shelf, and the bottom shelf. At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.
Question: If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: F and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  B: G and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  C: H and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  D: I and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  E: K and O are placed on the same shelf as each other.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
*   L is higher than H, so L cannot be on the bottom shelf.
*   I is on the middle shelf.
*   K is higher than F, so K cannot be on the bottom shelf.
*   O is higher than L, so O must be on the top shelf.
*   F and M are on the same shelf.
Since more books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, and the top shelf has O, the bottom shelf must have at least 2 books. We already know L and K are not on the bottom shelf, so F and M must be on the bottom shelf. This leaves H and G for the middle shelf with I.
Action: Answer("D") 
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
