Topic: Law
Context: A panel of five scientists will be formed. The panelists will be selected from among three botanists—F, G, and H—three chemists—K, L, and M—and three zoologists—P, Q, and R. Selection is governed by the following conditions: The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types. If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. F and K cannot both be selected. K and M cannot both be selected. If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
Question: If P is the only zoologist selected, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: If K is selected, G cannot be selected.
  B: If L is selected, F cannot be selected.
  C: If exactly one chemist is selected, it must be K.
  D: If exactly two chemists are selected, F cannot be selected.
  E: If exactly two chemists are selected, G cannot be selected.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
*  P being the only zoologist triggers the condition "at most one zoologist is selected," meaning we must have more than one botanist. 
*  This eliminates options focusing on chemists (C, D, E) as they don't relate to the botanist selection.
*  We need to analyze the remaining options concerning F and G with K and L.
*  The condition "F and K cannot both be selected" is relevant here. 
*  Option A aligns with this condition, stating if K is chosen, G cannot be. 
*  Option B talks about L and F, which have no restrictions together, making it incorrect.
Action: Answer("A")
