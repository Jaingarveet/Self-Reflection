The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Law
Context: Exactly five witnesses—Franco, Garcia, Hong, Iturbe, and Jackson—are to be scheduled to testify at a hearing that is to take exactly three days of one week—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Each witness testifies on exactly one day of the hearing. The schedule must meet the following conditions: Franco does not testify on the same day that Garcia testifies. Iturbe testifies on Wednesday. Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday. Hong does not testify on Monday. At least one witness testifies on Monday.
Question: If Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong, which one of the following must be true of the schedule?
Choices:
  A: Franco is scheduled to testify on Wednesday.
  B: Garcia is scheduled to testify on Monday.
  C: Garcia is scheduled to testify on Wednesday.
  D: Hong is scheduled to testify on Tuesday.
  E: Iturbe is the only witness scheduled to testify on Wednesday.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
*   We know Iturbe testifies on Wednesday and exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
*   Since Franco and Hong testify on the same day, and Hong doesn't testify on Monday, they both must testify on Tuesday.
*   This leaves Garcia and Jackson. Garcia cannot testify with Franco, so Garcia must testify on Monday, leaving Jackson for Wednesday with Iturbe.
Action: Answer("C")
