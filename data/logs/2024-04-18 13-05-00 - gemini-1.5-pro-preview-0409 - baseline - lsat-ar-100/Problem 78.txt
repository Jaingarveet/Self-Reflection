Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Law
Context: Of the eight students—George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert—in a seminar, exactly six will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
Question: If George, Nina, and Robert give reports and they do so on different days from one another, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Helen gives a report on Wednesday.
  B: Nina gives a report on Monday.
  C: Nina gives a report on Tuesday.
  D: Olivia gives a report on Monday.
  E: Robert gives a report on Wednesday.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
*   George must present on Tuesday, leaving Monday and Wednesday for Nina and Robert.
*   Nina presenting on Monday would require Helen and Irving to present on Tuesday, which is impossible due to George's Tuesday presentation. So, Nina cannot present on Monday (eliminating B).
*   If Nina presents on Wednesday, the Helen/Irving condition becomes irrelevant. This leaves Monday for Robert, satisfying the "different days" condition (eliminating C).
*   Olivia cannot present in the afternoon, and with Robert on Monday and George on Tuesday, the only remaining afternoon slot is Wednesday, making D impossible.
*   With Robert on Monday and George on Tuesday, Helen presenting on Wednesday is possible (keeping A).
*   Robert presenting on Wednesday is impossible due to the established schedule (eliminating E).
Action: Answer("A") 
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
