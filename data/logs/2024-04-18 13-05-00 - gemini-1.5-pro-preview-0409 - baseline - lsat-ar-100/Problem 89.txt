Context: A bakery makes exactly three kinds of cookieâ€”oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar. Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day. The following conditions apply: No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
Question: If the number of batches made on Friday is exactly one, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: The first batch of sugar cookies is made on Monday.
  B: The first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Tuesday.
  C: The third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Friday.
  D: The first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Wednesday.
  E: The second batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
*  We know the second batch of sugar cookies is on Thursday, and only one batch is made on Friday. So, the first and third batches of sugar cookies are made on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday.
*  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. This cannot be Friday (only one batch) or Thursday (sugar cookies). 
*  Therefore, the second batch of oatmeal cookies and the first batch of peanut butter cookies are made on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday.
Analysis of Choices:
*  A: If the first sugar cookies are Monday, then the first oatmeal cookies cannot be Tuesday (due to the condition above). This leaves Wednesday for the first oatmeal and peanut butter batches, making Friday impossible for the third oatmeal batch. So, this is **possible**.
*  B: If the first oatmeal cookies are Tuesday, then the first peanut butter cookies are also Tuesday (condition). This leaves no room for the first and third sugar cookie batches. So, this is **not possible**.
*  C: We've already established the third oatmeal batch cannot be on Friday. So, this is **not possible**.
*  D: If the first peanut butter cookies are Wednesday, then the first oatmeal cookies are also Wednesday (condition). This leaves no room for the first and third sugar cookie batches. So, this is **not possible**.
*  E: If the second peanut butter cookies are Tuesday, then the second oatmeal cookies are also Tuesday (condition). This means the first peanut butter cookies were Monday, leaving no room for the first and third sugar cookie batches. So, this is **not possible**.
