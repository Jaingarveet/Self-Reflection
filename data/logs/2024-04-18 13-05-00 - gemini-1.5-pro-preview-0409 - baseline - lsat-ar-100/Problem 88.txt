Topic: Law
Context: Exactly eight books—F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O—are placed on a bookcase with exactly three shelves—the top shelf, the middle shelf, and the bottom shelf. At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.
Question: It is fully determined which of the shelves each of the books is placed on if which one of the following is true?
Choices:
  A: I and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  B: K and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  C: L and F are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  D: M and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  E: H and O are placed on the same shelf as each other.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
We need to analyze each option to see which one definitively places all books on specific shelves.
**A: I and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.**
This would mean I, M, and F are on the middle shelf. We still don't know the exact placement of K, G, H, O, and L. 
**B: K and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.**
This doesn't give us enough information to determine the placement of the remaining books.
**C: L and F are placed on the same shelf as each other.**
This would mean L, F, and M are on the same shelf. Since O must be above L, it must be on the middle shelf with I.  K must be above F, so it's either on the middle or top shelf.  This still leaves possibilities for the placement of G and H.
**D: M and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.**
This would mean M, F, and H are on the same shelf. Since K must be above F, it's either on the middle or top shelf. We still don't know the exact placement of G, O, and L.
**E: H and O are placed on the same shelf as each other.**
Since O must be above L, L must be on the bottom shelf. F cannot be on the top shelf (as it's below K), so F and M must be on the bottom shelf with L. This leaves K and G for the middle shelf with I, and H and O for the top shelf. This option definitively places all books. 
Action: Answer("E")
