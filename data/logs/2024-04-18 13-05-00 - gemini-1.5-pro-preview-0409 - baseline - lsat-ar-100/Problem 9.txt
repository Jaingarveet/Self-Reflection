Topic: Law
Context: An administrator must assign parking spaces to six new employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young. Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
Question: If Young is assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Togowa is assigned parking space #1.
  B: Young is assigned parking space #2.
  C: Robertson is assigned parking space #3.
  D: Souza is assigned parking space #3.
  E: Vaughn is assigned parking space #4.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
*   We know Young > Togowa and Xu > Souza.
*   We also know Robertson > Young and Robertson must be in spaces #1-4.
**Analyzing options:**
*   **A:** If Togowa is in #1, then Young must be in #2 or higher, which contradicts the rule that Robertson (who must be higher than Young) must be in #1-4. So, A is not possible.
*   **B:** If Young is in #2, then Robertson must be in #1. This satisfies all conditions. So, B is possible.
*   **C & D:** If Robertson is in #3 or Souza is in #3, then Young and Xu would need to be in #4-6, leaving no space for Robertson to be higher than Young. So, C and D are not possible.
*   **E:**  Vaughn's position doesn't affect the given rules and conditions. So, E is possible.
Therefore, both B and E could be true. However, since we can only choose one, we'll go with the one that directly addresses the question about Young's position.
Action: Answer("B")
