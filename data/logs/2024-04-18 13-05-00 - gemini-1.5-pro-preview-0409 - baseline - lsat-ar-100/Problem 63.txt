Context: A chemistry class has six lab sessions scheduled over three days—Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday—one session heing held each morning and one each afternoon. Each session will be led by a different lab assistant—Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, or Rebecca. The assignment of lab assistants to sessions is constrained as follows: Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day. Nessa must lead an afternoon session. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
Question: If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, then for how many of the other lab assistants can one determine which sessions they lead?
Choices:
  A: one
  B: two
  C: three
  D: four
  E: five
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
1. **Julio on Thursday afternoon:** This means Olivia cannot be on Thursday and must be on Friday (due to the constraint). 
2. **Olivia on Friday:** This means Lan cannot be on Friday and must be on either Wednesday or Thursday.
3. **Kevin and Rebecca:** They must be on the same day, and since Friday is full, they must be on either Wednesday or Thursday.
4. **Nessa:** She must be in the afternoon, and with Julio taking Thursday afternoon, she must be on either Wednesday or Friday afternoon.
Based on the above deductions:
* We know Olivia's day (Friday).
* We know the possible days for Lan (Wednesday or Thursday).
* We know the possible days for Kevin and Rebecca (Wednesday or Thursday, together).
* We know the possible days for Nessa (Wednesday or Friday afternoon).
Therefore, we can determine the possible sessions for **four** of the other lab assistants. 
Action: Answer("D")
