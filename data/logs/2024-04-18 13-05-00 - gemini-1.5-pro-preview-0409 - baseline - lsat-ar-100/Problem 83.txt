Context: A chemistry class has six lab sessions scheduled over three days—Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday—one session heing held each morning and one each afternoon. Each session will be led by a different lab assistant—Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, or Rebecca. The assignment of lab assistants to sessions is constrained as follows: Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day. Nessa must lead an afternoon session. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
Question: If Julio and Kevin both lead morning sessions, then any of the following could be true EXCEPT:
Choices:
  A: Lan's session meets Wednesday morning.
  B: Lan's session meets Thursday afternoon.
  C: Nessa's session meets Friday afternoon.
  D: Olivia's session meets Thursday morning.
  E: Olivia's session meets Friday morning.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
*   Julio and Kevin lead morning sessions (given).
*   Rebecca must be with Kevin, so she also leads a morning session on the same day as Kevin.
*   This leaves the afternoon sessions for Lan, Nessa, and Olivia.
*   Nessa must take one afternoon, leaving the other two afternoons for Lan and Olivia.
*   Lan and Olivia cannot be on the same day, so they must take Friday and Thursday afternoons (order doesn't matter yet).
*   Julio must be before Olivia, so Julio must be on Wednesday, leaving Kevin and Rebecca on Thursday. 
*   Therefore, Lan must be on Friday afternoon and cannot be on Wednesday morning. 
Action: Answer("A")
