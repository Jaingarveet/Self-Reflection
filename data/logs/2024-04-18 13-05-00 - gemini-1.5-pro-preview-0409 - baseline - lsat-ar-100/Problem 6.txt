Context: For the school paper, five students—Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, Megregian, and O'Neill—each review one or more of exactly three plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation, but do not review any other plays. The following conditions must apply: Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
Question: Which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Jiang reviews more of the plays than Lopez does.
  B: Megregian reviews more of the plays than Jiang does.
  C: Megregian reviews more of the plays than O'Neill does.
  D: O'Neill reviews more of the plays than Jiang does.
  E: O'Neill reviews more of the plays than Kramer does.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
*   We know Kramer and Lopez each review fewer plays than Megregian, so options B and C are possible and A is not.
*   We know Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, so option E is not possible.
*   We need to find if D is possible or must be true.
Analysis:
1.  **Megregian reviews all 3 plays:** This satisfies the condition of reviewing more plays than Kramer and Lopez.  Since Megregian can't review the same plays as Lopez, Lopez must review Sunset and Undulation.  This leaves Tamerlane and one other play for Kramer, and the last play for Jiang.  In this case, **O'Neill reviews more plays than Jiang, making D true.**
2.  **Megregian reviews 2 plays (not Tamerlane):** This leaves Tamerlane and one other play for both Kramer and O'Neill.  Lopez must review the remaining play.  This scenario is not possible because it would mean three students review the same plays (Kramer, O'Neill, and one of the others). 
3.  **Megregian reviews 2 plays (including Tamerlane):** Kramer and O'Neill must review the remaining play.  Lopez reviews the two plays Megregian didn't.  This scenario is not possible because it would mean three students review the same plays (Kramer, O'Neill, and Lopez).
Therefore, the only possible scenario leads to O'Neill reviewing more plays than Jiang. 
Action: Answer("D") 
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
