## User 2:
Topic: Law
Context: An administrator must assign parking spaces to six new employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young. Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
Question: If Robertson is assigned parking space #3, then which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Souza is assigned parking space #4.
  B: Togowa is assigned parking space #2.
  C: Vaughn is assigned parking space #5.
  D: Xu is assigned parking space #6.
  E: Young is assigned parking space #2.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
*   Robertson is in #3, so Young must be in #4, #5, or #6 (Robertson > Young).
*   This leaves #1, #2, and one of #4, #5, or #6 for Souza, Togowa, Xu, and Vaughn.
*   We know Xu > Souza, but this doesn't give us a definite placement. 
*   We also know Young > Togowa, but since Young is in #4, #5, or #6, Togowa could be in any of the remaining spots (#1, #2, or the one left by Young).
Therefore, none of the options must be true. However, the system requires selecting one of the available choices. Based on the information, the most likely scenario is:
*   Young gets #4 (closest to Robertson)
*   Xu gets #6 (highest available, satisfying Xu > Souza)
*   Togowa gets #2 (remaining spot, satisfying Young > Togowa)
Action: Answer("B") 
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: E
Score: 0
