Topic: Law
Context: A panel of five scientists will be formed. The panelists will be selected from among three botanists—F, G, and H—three chemists—K, L, and M—and three zoologists—P, Q, and R. Selection is governed by the following conditions: The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types. If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. F and K cannot both be selected. K and M cannot both be selected. If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
Question: If four of the scientists selected are F, L, Q, and R, which one of the following must be the fifth scientist selected?
Choices:
  A: G
  B: H
  C: K
  D: M
  E: P
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
*  We know F, L, Q, and R are selected. We need one more, and it must be a chemist (since K and M are the only chemists left).
*  F is already selected, so we cannot choose K (due to the restriction "F and K cannot both be selected").
*  Therefore, the fifth scientist must be M.
*  The condition "If M is selected, both P and R must be selected" is also satisfied as R is already chosen. 
Action: Answer("D")
