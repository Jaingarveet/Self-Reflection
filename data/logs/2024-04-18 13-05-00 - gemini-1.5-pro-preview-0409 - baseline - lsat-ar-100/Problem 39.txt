The organizer's selection of works must conform to the following requirements: No more than four French works are selected. At least three but no more than four novels are selected.

Thought:
We know there are 3 French novels selected. 
The rules state:
* No more than 4 French works total, so only 1 more French work can be selected.
* At least 3 but no more than 4 novels total, so 0 or 1 more novels can be selected.
* At least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected, so 0 to 3 Russian novels can be selected.
* If both French plays are selected, then the Russian play is not selected.
Analyzing the options:
* A: Possible (3 French novels + 1 Russian novel = 4 novels total)
* B: Not possible (violates the rule of maximum 4 French works)
* C: Possible (3 French novels + 1 Russian novel + 1 Russian play = 4 novels total)
* D: Not possible (violates the rule of maximum 4 French works)
