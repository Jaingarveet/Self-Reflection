Topic: Law
Context: For the school paper, five students—Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, Megregian, and O'Neill—each review one or more of exactly three plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation, but do not review any other plays. The following conditions must apply: Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
Question: Which one of the following could be an accurate and complete list of the students who review only Sunset?
Choices:
  A: Lopez
  B: O'Neill
  C: Jiang, Lopez
  D: Kramer, O'Neill
  E: Lopez, Megregian
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
*   We know Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, so neither of them can be the sole reviewer of Sunset (eliminating options B and D).
*   We also know that exactly two students review the same plays. 
*   If Jiang and Lopez only reviewed Sunset (option C), then they would be the pair with identical reviews, but this contradicts the information that Lopez doesn't review any play Jiang reviews. So, option C is also out.
*   If Lopez and Megregian only reviewed Sunset (option E), they would be the identical pair, but again, this contradicts the information that they don't share any reviewed plays. 
*   Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that Lopez alone reviews only Sunset. 
Action: Answer("A") 
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
