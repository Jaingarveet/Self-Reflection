Context: A realtor will show a prospective buyer seven houses—J, K, L, M, N, 0, and P—during a single day. The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning; the third, fourth, and fifth houses to be shown will be shown in the afternoon; the sixth and seventh houses to be shown will be shown in the evening. The houses will be shown according to the following rules: J must be shown in the evening. K cannot be shown in the morning. L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
Question: Which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: K is shown at some time after J is shown.
  B: L is shown at some time after J is shown.
  C: P is shown at some time after J is shown.
  D: Both N and O are shown at some time after M is
  E: Both N and P are shown at some time after K is
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
* J must be in the evening.
* K cannot be in the morning, so it must be afternoon or evening.
* L must be after K and before M. This means L and M are both afternoon or evening.
*  We don't know the exact order of N, O, and P, but they must fill the remaining slots (one afternoon, two evening).
Analysis of Choices:
* A: This could be true if K is afternoon and J is the last house shown in the evening. 
* B: This must be true because L is always after K, which cannot be in the morning, and J is always in the evening.
* C: This may or may not be true depending on the order of houses in the evening.
* D: This is impossible because M is either afternoon or evening, leaving only one remaining slot after M for either N or O, but not both.
* E: This may or may not be true depending on the order of houses in the afternoon and evening.
Action: Answer("B")
