Context: During a recital, two pianists—Wayne and Zara—will perform solos. There will be five solos altogether, performed one immediately after another. Each solo will be either a modern piece or a traditional piece. The choice of pianist and type of piece for the solos must conform to the following conditions: The third solo is a traditional piece. Exactly two of the traditional pieces are performed consecutively. In the fourth solo, either Wayne performs a traditional piece or Zara performs a modern piece. The pianist who performs the second solo does not perform the fifth solo. No traditional piece is performed until Wayne performs at least one modem piece.
Question: Which one of the following could be all of the solos that are traditional pieces?
Choices:
  A: the first, third, and fourth
  B: the second, third, and fourth
  C: the third and fourth
  D: the third and fifth
  E: the fourth and fifth
## Assistant 2:

*   **C:** Possible. Aligns with all rules depending on the order of the first two.
*   **D:** Violates Rule 2 (not consecutive).
*   **E:** Violates Rule 1 (third is not traditional).
