## User 2:
Topic: Law
Context: Exactly eight books—F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O—are placed on a bookcase with exactly three shelves—the top shelf, the middle shelf, and the bottom shelf. At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.
Question: If G is placed on the top shelf, then which one of the following could be a complete and accurate list of the books placed on the middle shelf?
Choices:
  A: H, I
  B: I, L
  C: H, I, L
  D: I, K, L
  E: F, I, M
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
*   G is on the top shelf, so the top shelf cannot have more than 2 books (due to the "more books on bottom than top" rule).
*   F and M must be together, and they cannot be on the top shelf with G.
*   K must be above F, so K cannot be on the middle shelf with F and M (if they were there).
*   This leaves only H, I, and L as possibilities for the middle shelf. 
Action: Answer("C") 
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: D
