Context: At a concert, exactly eight compositions—F, H, L, O, P, R, S, and T—are to be performed exactly once each, consecutively and one composition at a time. The order of their performance must satisfy the following conditions: T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R. At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F. O is performed either first or fifth. The eighth composition performed is either L or H. P is performed at some time before S. At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
Question: If S is performed fourth, which one of the following could be an accurate list of the compositions performed first, second, and third, respectively?
Choices:
  A: F, H, P
  B: H, P. L
  C: O, P, R
  D: O, P, T
  E: P, R, T
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
*   S is 4th, so options with S in the first three positions (A and B) are eliminated.
*   Condition "T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R" and "The eighth composition performed is either L or H"  means T cannot be 3rd (eliminating D).
*   Condition "At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F" means R cannot be 3rd with S being 4th (eliminating E).
Action: Answer("C")
