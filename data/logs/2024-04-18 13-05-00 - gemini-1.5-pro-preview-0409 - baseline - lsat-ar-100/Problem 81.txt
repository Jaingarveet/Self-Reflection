Context: The organizer of a reading club will select at least five and at most six works from a group of nine works. The group consists of three French novels, three Russian novels, two French plays, and one Russian play. The organizer's selection of works must conform to the following requirements: No more than four French works are selected. At least three but no more than four novels are selected. At least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected. If both French plays are selected, then the Russian play is not selected.
Question: Which one of the following could be true about the organizer's selection of works?
Choices:
  A: No Russian novels are selected.
  B: Exactly one French novel is selected.
  C: All three plays are selected.
  D: All three Russian novels are selected.
  E: All five French works are selected.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
*   **Rule 1:** No more than four French works (3 novels + 2 plays).
*   **Rule 2:** At least 3 but no more than 4 novels (3 French + 3 Russian).
*   **Rule 3:** At least as many French novels as Russian novels.
*   **Rule 4:** If both French plays are selected, then the Russian play is not.
**Analysis of Choices:**
*   **A:** Possible. This allows for 3 French novels and 2 French plays, satisfying all rules. 
*   **B:** Impossible. This violates Rule 3 as it would require at least one Russian novel.
*   **C:** Impossible. Selecting all three plays violates Rule 2 (max 4 novels).
*   **D:** Impossible. This violates Rule 1 (max 4 French works) as it would require at least 3 French novels to satisfy Rule 3.
*   **E:** Impossible. This directly violates Rule 1 (max 4 French works).
