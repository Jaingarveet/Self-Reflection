Topic: Law
Context: A maintenance company that takes service requests from three clients—Image, Solide, and Truvest—plans to set targets for its average service response times. Service targets will be set at 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day. Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail. The six targets are set according to the following conditions: None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
Question: Which one of the following targets CANNOT be set for more than one of the clients?
Choices:
  A: a 1-day website target
  B: a 2-day voicemail target
  C: a 2-day website target
  D: a 3-day voicemail target
  E: a 3-day website target
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
*   We know there are three target times (1, 2, and 3 days) and two methods of contact (website and voicemail) for three clients, making a total of six targets.
*   Each client must have a shorter or equal website target time than their voicemail target time.
*   Image's voicemail target must be the shortest.
*   Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
Analysis:
*   **A 1-day website target:** This could be assigned to multiple clients as long as their voicemail target is also 1 day. 
*   **A 2-day voicemail target:** This cannot be assigned to Image (their voicemail target must be the shortest), and if assigned to Solide or Truvest, it would force their website target to also be 2 days (violating the condition that Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's). So, this target can only be assigned to one client.
*   **A 2-day website target:** This could be assigned to multiple clients as long as their voicemail target is 2 or 1 day.
*   **A 3-day voicemail target:** This could be assigned to multiple clients as long as their website target is also 3 days.
*   **A 3-day website target:** This could be assigned to multiple clients as long as their voicemail target is also 3 days.
