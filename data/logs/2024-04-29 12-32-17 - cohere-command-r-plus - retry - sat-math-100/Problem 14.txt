# Model: cohere-command-r-plus | Agent: retry | Exam: sat-math-100 | Problem 14 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:
Topic: Geography
Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")

Question: \begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}\hline$x$ & $a$ & $3 a$ & $5 a$ \\\hline$y$ & 0 & $-a$ & $-2 a$ \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}Some values of $x$ and their corresponding values of $y$ are shown in the table above, where $a$ is a constant. If there is a linear relationship between $x$ and $y$, which of the following equations represents the relationship?
Choices:
  A: $x+2 y=a$
  B: $x+2 y=5 a$
  C: $2 x-y=-5 a$
  D: $2 x-y=7 a$

## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The table shows a linear relationship between x and y, with a constant ratio of -2/3.
This can be expressed as an equation: y = (-2/3)x
Multiplying both sides by 3 to clear the fraction: 3y = -2x
Subtracting 2y from both sides: 3y - 2y = -2x - 2y
Simplifying: y = -2/3 * x - 2/3 * y
Combining the y terms: y + 2/3 * y = -2/3 * x
Simplifying: 5/3 * y = -2/3 * x
Multiplying both sides by 3/5: (5/3)*(3/5)*y = (2/3)*(3/5)*x
Simplifying: y = (-2/5)*x
This equation represents the relationship between x and y.

Choice A is incorrect because it has a different coefficient for the x term.
Choice B is incorrect because it has a different intercept.
Choice C is incorrect because it has a different slope - the ratio of the coefficients of x and y should be -2/3, but in choice C, it is 2/1, which does not match the table.
Choice D is incorrect because it has a different y-intercept, and the slope is incorrect.
The correct answer is D: $2x - y = 7a$.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
