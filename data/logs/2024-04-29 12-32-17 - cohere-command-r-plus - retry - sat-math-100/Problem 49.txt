## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
We can simplify the equation as follows:
\[
\begin{align*}
\frac{24x^2 + 25x - 47}{ax - 2} + 8x + 3 + \frac{53}{ax - 2} &= 0 \\
\frac{24x^2 + (25+8a)x + (3a-47)}{ax - 2} &= 0
\end{align*}
\]

For the equation to be true for all $x \neq \frac{2}{a}$, the numerator must be equal to zero when simplified. This means that the discriminant of the quadratic equation, $(25 + 8a)^2 - 4 \cdot 24 \cdot (3a - 47)$, should be equal to zero. Solving this results in $a = 3$ or $a = -\frac{1}{3}$. However, $a = -\frac{1}{3}$ can be ruled out since the problem states that $a$ is a constant, and the choices provided include only integers.

Therefore, the value of $a$ is $3$.

Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: B
