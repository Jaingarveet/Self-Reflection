## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Let $x$ be the number of students in the class.
We can set up the equation $3x + 5 = nx$
Solving for $x$, we get $x = 20$.
However, this value does not satisfy the second condition.

Let's try using the second condition.
Setting up the equation, we have $4x - 21 = nx$, which simplifies to $x = 26$.
Checking this value, we find that $3(26) + 5 = 83$, which is not equal to $26n$.

So, we need to find the least common multiple of 3 and 4, which is 12.
Now, we can set up the equation $12 = nx$, and we get $x = 3$.
This means there are $3$ students in the class.

Therefore, the correct answer is $D: 3$.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
