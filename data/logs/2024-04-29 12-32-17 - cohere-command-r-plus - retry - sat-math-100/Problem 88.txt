## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Topic: Math
Question: $$h=-4.9 t^{2}+25 t$$The equation above expresses the approximate height $h$, in meters, of a ball $t$ seconds after it is launched vertically upward from the ground with an initial velocity of 25 meters per second. After approximately how many seconds will the ball hit the ground?
Choices:
  A: 3.5
  B: 4.0
  C: 4.5
  D: 5.0

## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The ball is launched with an initial velocity of 25 meters per second upward.
Therefore, it will take the same amount of time for the ball to come back down to the ground.

Let's plug the values into the equation and solve for t:
- h = -4.9t^2 + 25t
- 0 = -4.9t^2 + 25t
- 4.9t^2 - 25t = 0
- t(4.9t - 25) = 0

So, t can be equal to 0 or 5.0 seconds.
Since it doesn't make sense in the context of the question for time to be 0 seconds, the answer is 5.0 seconds.
Action: Answer("D")
