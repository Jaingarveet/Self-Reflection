## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.

Question: For a polynomial $p(x)$, the value of $p(3)$ is -2 .Which of the following must be true about $p(x)$ ?
Choices:
  A: $x-5$ is a factor of $p(x)$.
  B: $x-2$ is a factor of $p(x)$.
  C: $x+2$ is a factor of $p(x)$.
  D: The remainder when $p(x)$ is divided by $x-3$ is -2 .

## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Given that $p(3) = -2$, we can conclude that when $x=3$, the output of the polynomial $p(x)$ is $-2$. This means that $x - 3$ must be a factor of $p(x)$, as it equates to 0 when $x=3$.

However, this information alone does not provide sufficient evidence to determine the other factors or the remainder of $p(x)$. Therefore, the correct answer is "D: The remainder when $p(x)$ is divided by $x-3$ is -2."
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
