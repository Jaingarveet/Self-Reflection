## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Option A selects a random store and surveys all employees in that store. This doesn't give a good representation of all 50 stores.
Option B selects a random sample of 10 employees from each store, giving a better representation of the whole.
Option C selects employees based on pay, which may introduce bias and not give a random sample.
Option D uses a self-selected sample of employees who choose to respond, which may not be representative of all employees.

Therefore, option B is the correct answer as it uses random sampling to provide an estimate of job satisfaction for all employees.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
