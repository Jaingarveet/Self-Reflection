## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Solving the first equation for $x$, we get $x = -\frac{4}{3}y - \frac{23}{3}$. Substituting this expression for $x$ into the second equation, we get:
\[2y - \left(-\frac{4}{3}y - \frac{23}{3}\right) = -19\]
Combining like terms, we get:
\[\frac{2}{3}y = -\frac{14}{3}\]
Solving for $y$, we get $y = -2$. Substituting this value of $y$ back into the expression for $x$, we get $x = -\frac{4}{3} \cdot -2 - \frac{23}{3} = 3$. So, the solution is $(3, -2)$. 

Checking this solution in the original equations:
$3(3) + 4(-2) = -23$ and $2(-2) - 3(3) = -19$, both equations are satisfied.

Therefore, the correct solution is $(3, -2)$, which is choice **B**.
Action: Answer("B")
