You have incorrectly answered the following multiple-choice question.
Your task is to reflect on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
You will then use this information help you answer the same question in the future.
First, explain why you answered the question incorrectly.
Second, list the keywords that describe the type of your errors from most general to most specific. 
Third, solve the problem again, step-by-step, based on your knowledge of the correct answer.
Fourth, create a list of detailed instructions to help you correctly solve this problem in the future.
Finally, create a list of general advice to help you solve similar types of problems in the future.  
Be concise in your response; however, capture all of the essential information.  
For guidance, I will provide you with a single generic example problem and reflection (below).

Topic: Geography and Math
Question: What is the product of the number of letters contained in the name of the city where Iowa State University is located multiplied by the number of letters contained in the name of the state?
Choices:
    A: 16
    B: 20
    C: 24
    D: 32
Thought:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
ISU is located in the state of Iowa.
Action: Answer("D")
---
Correct Answer: A
## Assistant 1:
Explanation:
I miscalculated the product of the number of letters in the city and state names. 
The gap in my knowledge was not in geography but in basic arithmetic. 
I knew the correct city and state but made a calculation error.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Arithmetic error
 - Multiplication error
Solution:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
Iowa State University is located in the state of Iowa.
The city name "Ames" contains 4 letters.
The state name "Iowa" contains 4 letters.
The product of 4*4 is 16.
Instructions:
1. Identify the city where the university is located.
2. Identify the state where the university is located.
3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.
4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.
5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.
6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.
7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them.

Topic: Law
Context: A bakery makes exactly three kinds of cookieâ€”oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar. Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day. The following conditions apply: No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
Question: If the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday, then each of the following could be true EXCEPT:
Choices:
  A: Two different kinds of cookie have their first batch made on Monday.
  B: Two different kinds of cookie have their first batch made on Tuesday.
  C: Two different kinds of cookie have their second batch made on Wednesday.
  D: Two different kinds of cookie have their second batch made on Thursday.
  E: Two different kinds of cookie have their third batch made on Friday.

Thought:
Since the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies, and the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday, the second batch of oatmeal cookies is also made on Tuesday.
Since no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day, the first batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Tuesday.
Since at least one batch of cookies is made on Monday, the first batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Monday.
Since the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, the first batch of sugar cookies cannot be made on Thursday.
Since no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day, the first batch of sugar cookies cannot be made on Tuesday.
Since at least one batch of cookies is made on Monday, the first batch of sugar cookies must be made on Monday.
Therefore, two different kinds of cookies (oatmeal and sugar) have their first batch made on Monday.
Action: Answer("B")

Correct Answer: C
## Assistant 2:
Response:
Explanation:
I made an incorrect assumption about the conditions of the problem.
The gap in my knowledge was not in law but in logical reasoning.
I assumed that since the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies, and the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday, the second batch of oatmeal cookies must also be made on Tuesday. However, this is not necessarily true.
Error Keywords:
 - Incorrect assumption
 - Logical reasoning error
 - Misinterpretation of conditions
Solution:
Since the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies, and the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday, the second batch of oatmeal cookies is also made on Tuesday.
Since no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day, the first batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Tuesday.
Since at least one batch of cookies is made on Monday, the first batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Monday.
Since the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, the first batch of sugar cookies cannot be made on Thursday.
Since no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day, the first batch of sugar cookies cannot be made on Tuesday.
Since at least one batch of cookies is made on Monday, the first batch of sugar cookies must be made on Monday.
Therefore, two different kinds of cookies (oatmeal and sugar) have their first batch made on Monday.
Since no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day, the second batch of peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Tuesday.
Since the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Tuesday, the second batch of peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Wednesday.
Therefore, two different kinds of cookies (oatmeal and peanut butter) cannot have their second batch made on Wednesday.
Instructions:
1. Identify the conditions of the problem.
2. Identify the relationships between the different kinds of cookies.
3. Use logical reasoning to determine the possible and impossible scenarios.
4. Work step-by-step through your reasoning.
5. Double-check your reasoning to ensure accuracy.
6. Choose the answer that matches your determined scenario.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never make assumptions about the conditions of the problem.
 - Always double-check your reasoning and final answer.
 - Remember that logical reasoning is a critical skill in solving complex problems.
