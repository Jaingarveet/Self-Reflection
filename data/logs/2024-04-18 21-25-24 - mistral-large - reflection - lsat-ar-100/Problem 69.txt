## System:
You are an expert in Law.
You have incorrectly answered the following multiple-choice question.
Your task is to reflect on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
You will then use this information help you answer the same question in the future.
First, explain why you answered the question incorrectly.
Second, list the keywords that describe the type of your errors from most general to most specific. 
Third, solve the problem again, step-by-step, based on your knowledge of the correct answer.
Fourth, create a list of detailed instructions to help you correctly solve this problem in the future.
Finally, create a list of general advice to help you solve similar types of problems in the future.  
Be concise in your response; however, capture all of the essential information.  
For guidance, I will provide you with a single generic example problem and reflection (below).

Topic: Geography and Math
Question: What is the product of the number of letters contained in the name of the city where Iowa State University is located multiplied by the number of letters contained in the name of the state?
Choices:
    A: 16
    B: 20
    C: 24
    D: 32
Thought:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
ISU is located in the state of Iowa.
Action: Answer("D")
---
Correct Answer: A
## Assistant 1:
Explanation:
I miscalculated the product of the number of letters in the city and state names. 
The gap in my knowledge was not in geography but in basic arithmetic. 
I knew the correct city and state but made a calculation error.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Arithmetic error
 - Multiplication error
Solution:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
Iowa State University is located in the state of Iowa.
The city name "Ames" contains 4 letters.
The state name "Iowa" contains 4 letters.
The product of 4*4 is 16.
Instructions:
1. Identify the city where the university is located.
2. Identify the state where the university is located.
3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.
4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.
5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.
6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.
7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them.

Topic: Law
Context: At a concert, exactly eight compositions—F, H, L, O, P, R, S, and T—are to be performed exactly once each, consecutively and one composition at a time. The order of their performance must satisfy the following conditions: T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R. At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F. O is performed either first or fifth. The eighth composition performed is either L or H. P is performed at some time before S. At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
Question: If P is performed third and S is performed sixth, the composition performed fifth must be either
Choices:
  A: F or H
  B: F or O
  C: F or T
  D: H or L
  E: O or R

Thought:
Given that P is performed third and S is performed sixth, we know that O cannot be performed first or fifth because it must be performed either first or fifth, and it cannot be performed first because P is performed third. Therefore, O must be performed fifth.
Action: Answer("B")

 --- 
Correct Answer: C
## Assistant 2:
Response:
Explanation:
I made an incorrect assumption about the order of the compositions based on the given conditions.
The gap in my knowledge was not in law but in logical reasoning.
I did not consider all the possible scenarios that could satisfy the given conditions.
Error Keywords:
 - Incorrect assumption
 - Logical reasoning error
 - Incomplete analysis
Solution:
Given that P is performed third and S is performed sixth, we know that O cannot be performed first or fifth because it must be performed either first or fifth, and it cannot be performed first because P is performed third. Therefore, O must be performed fifth.
However, this does not mean that F must be performed fourth or sixth. We know that T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R. Since O is performed fifth, T cannot be performed immediately before F. Therefore, T must be performed immediately after R.
Since at least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F, and since T is performed immediately after R, F cannot be performed immediately after R. Therefore, F must be performed immediately before T.
Since P is performed third and S is performed sixth, and since O is performed fifth, the only possible compositions that can be performed fourth are H and L.
Instructions:
1. Identify the given conditions for the order of the compositions.
2. Identify the given information about the order of the compositions.
3. Use logical reasoning to determine the possible scenarios that satisfy the given conditions.
4. Consider all possible scenarios, not just the most obvious ones.
5. Use the given information to eliminate impossible scenarios.
6. Use the remaining possible scenarios to determine the correct answer.
7. Double-check your reasoning and final answer.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never make assumptions without considering all possible scenarios.
 - Always use logical reasoning to determine the possible scenarios that satisfy the given conditions.
 - Always double-check your reasoning and final answer.
 - Remember that the correct answer may not be the most obvious one.
