## System:
You are an expert in Law.
You have incorrectly answered the following multiple-choice question.
Your task is to reflect on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
You will then use this information help you answer the same question in the future.
First, explain why you answered the question incorrectly.
Second, list the keywords that describe the type of your errors from most general to most specific. 
Third, solve the problem again, step-by-step, based on your knowledge of the correct answer.
Fourth, create a list of detailed instructions to help you correctly solve this problem in the future.
Finally, create a list of general advice to help you solve similar types of problems in the future.  
Be concise in your response; however, capture all of the essential information.  
For guidance, I will provide you with a single generic example problem and reflection (below).

Topic: Geography and Math
Question: What is the product of the number of letters contained in the name of the city where Iowa State University is located multiplied by the number of letters contained in the name of the state?
Choices:
    A: 16
    B: 20
    C: 24
    D: 32
Thought:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
ISU is located in the state of Iowa.
Action: Answer("D")
---
Correct Answer: A
## Assistant 1:
Explanation:
I miscalculated the product of the number of letters in the city and state names. 
The gap in my knowledge was not in geography but in basic arithmetic. 
I knew the correct city and state but made a calculation error.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Arithmetic error
 - Multiplication error
Solution:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
Iowa State University is located in the state of Iowa.
The city name "Ames" contains 4 letters.
The state name "Iowa" contains 4 letters.
The product of 4*4 is 16.
Instructions:
1. Identify the city where the university is located.
2. Identify the state where the university is located.
3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.
4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.
5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.
6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.
7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them.
## User 2:
Topic: Law
Context: A software company employs exactly seven sales representatives—Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall—to work in its three sales zones—Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3. Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Question: If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Kim works in Zone 2.
  B: Mahr works in Zone 1.
  C: Parra works in Zone 3.
  D: Stuckey works in Zone 2.
  E: Tiao works in Zone 1.

Thought:
Since Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, and Stuckey works in the same sales zone as Udall, Mahr, Stuckey, and Udall must all work in the same sales zone.
Since either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2, Udall cannot work in Zone 2, so Mahr, Stuckey, and Udall must all work in either Zone 1 or Zone 3.
Since there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, Zone 3 must have at least 3 sales representatives, so Mahr, Stuckey, and Udall must all work in Zone 3.
Since either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, and Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other, Parra and Quinn must both work in Zone 3 with Mahr, Stuckey, and Udall.
Therefore, Kim must work in Zone 1, and Tiao must work in Zone 2.
Action: Answer("C")

 --- 
Correct Answer: A
## Assistant 2:
Response:
Explanation:
I made an incorrect assumption about the distribution of sales representatives in the zones.
The gap in my knowledge was not in the law but in logical reasoning.
I incorrectly assumed that Zone 3 must have at least 3 sales representatives, but it could have more.
I also incorrectly assumed that Parra and Quinn must work in Zone 3 with Mahr, Stuckey, and Udall, but they could work in Zone 1.
Error Keywords:
 - Incorrect assumption
 - Logical reasoning error
 - Distribution error
Solution:
Since Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, and Stuckey works in the same sales zone as Udall, Mahr, Stuckey, and Udall must all work in the same sales zone.
Since either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2, Udall cannot work in Zone 2, so Mahr, Stuckey, and Udall must all work in either Zone 1 or Zone 3.
Since there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, Zone 3 must have at least 2 sales representatives, and Zone 2 must have at most 2 sales representatives.
Since either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, and Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other, Parra and Quinn must both work in either Zone 1 or Zone 3.
If Parra and Quinn work in Zone 1, then Tiao must work in Zone 2, and Mahr, Stuckey, and Udall must all work in Zone 3.
If Parra and Quinn work in Zone 3, then Tiao must work in Zone 1, and Mahr, Stuckey, and Udall must all work in Zone 1.
Therefore, Kim could work in Zone 2.
Instructions:
1. Identify the sales representatives who work in the same sales zone as each other.
2. Identify the sales representatives who cannot work in the same sales zone as each other.
3. Identify the minimum and maximum number of sales representatives who can work in each sales zone.
4. Consider all possible distributions of sales representatives in the sales zones.
5. Eliminate the distributions that violate the given conditions.
6. Choose the answer that corresponds to a possible distribution.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never make assumptions that are not supported by the given information.
 - Always consider all possible distributions of elements in the problem.
 - Always double-check your reasoning and final answer.
 - Remember that logical reasoning is a critical skill in law and many other fields.
