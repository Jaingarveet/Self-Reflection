## System:
You are an expert in Law.
You have incorrectly answered the following multiple-choice question.
Your task is to reflect on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
You will then use this information help you answer the same question in the future.
First, explain why you answered the question incorrectly.
Second, list the keywords that describe the type of your errors from most general to most specific. 
Third, solve the problem again, step-by-step, based on your knowledge of the correct answer.
Fourth, create a list of detailed instructions to help you correctly solve this problem in the future.
Finally, create a list of general advice to help you solve similar types of problems in the future.  
Be concise in your response; however, capture all of the essential information.  
For guidance, I will provide you with a single generic example problem and reflection (below).

Topic: Geography and Math
Question: What is the product of the number of letters contained in the name of the city where Iowa State University is located multiplied by the number of letters contained in the name of the state?
Choices:
    A: 16
    B: 20
    C: 24
    D: 32
Thought:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
ISU is located in the state of Iowa.
Action: Answer("D")
---
Correct Answer: A
## Assistant 1:
Explanation:
I miscalculated the product of the number of letters in the city and state names. 
The gap in my knowledge was not in geography but in basic arithmetic. 
I knew the correct city and state but made a calculation error.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Arithmetic error
 - Multiplication error
Solution:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
Iowa State University is located in the state of Iowa.
The city name "Ames" contains 4 letters.
The state name "Iowa" contains 4 letters.
The product of 4*4 is 16.
Instructions:
1. Identify the city where the university is located.
2. Identify the state where the university is located.
3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.
4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.
5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.
6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.
7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them.
## User 2:
Topic: Law
Context: A loading dock consists of exactly six bays numbered 1 through 6 consecutively from one side of the dock to the other. Each bay is holding a different one of exactly six types of cargoâ€”fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles. The following apply: The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock. The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles. The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel. The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
Question: If bay 4 is holding produce, then for exactly how many of the six bays is the type of cargo that bay is holding completely determined?
Choices:
  A: two
  B: three
  C: four
  D: five
  E: six

Thought:
The bay holding produce is bay 4.
The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce, so it must be either bay 3 or bay 5.
If the bay holding textiles is bay 3, then the bay holding livestock must be bay 2, and the bay holding grain must be either bay 5 or bay 6.
If the bay holding textiles is bay 5, then the bay holding livestock must be bay 3, and the bay holding grain must be either bay 5 or bay 6.
In either case, the bay holding fuel must be either bay 1 or bay 6.
Therefore, the type of cargo that bay 4 is holding (produce) is completely determined, and the type of cargo that either bay 3 or bay 5 is holding (textiles) is also completely determined.
Action: Answer("A")

 --- 
Correct Answer: C
## Assistant 2:
Response:
Explanation:
I made an incorrect assumption about the number of bays with determined cargo.
The gap in my knowledge was not in the law but in logical reasoning.
I knew the correct relationships between the cargo types but made an incorrect assumption about the number of bays with determined cargo.
Error Keywords:
 - Incorrect assumption
 - Logical reasoning error
 - Overlooking information
Solution:
The bay holding produce is bay 4.
The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce, so it must be either bay 3 or bay 5.
If the bay holding textiles is bay 3, then the bay holding livestock must be bay 2, and the bay holding grain must be either bay 5 or bay 6.
If the bay holding textiles is bay 5, then the bay holding livestock must be bay 3, and the bay holding grain must be either bay 1 or bay 2.
In either case, the bay holding fuel must be either bay 1 or bay 6.
Therefore, the type of cargo that bay 4 is holding (produce) is completely determined, the type of cargo that either bay 3 or bay 5 is holding (textiles) is also completely determined, and the type of cargo that either bay 2 or bay 3 is holding (livestock) is also completely determined.
Instructions:
1. Identify the bay holding produce.
2. Identify the possible locations of the bay holding textiles.
3. Identify the possible locations of the bay holding livestock based on the location of the bay holding textiles.
4. Identify the possible locations of the bay holding grain based on the location of the bay holding livestock.
5. Identify the possible locations of the bay holding fuel based on the location of the bay holding produce.
6. Determine the number of bays with completely determined cargo.
7. Work step-by-step through your logical reasoning.
8. Double-check your reasoning and final answer.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never make assumptions; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your reasoning and final answer.
 - Remember that logical reasoning is essential in solving complex problems.
