## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The density of red-clay bricks is 2000 kg/m^3. This means that 1 m^3 of bricks has a mass of 2000 kg.
   - 2 m^3 of bricks would have a mass of 2 * 2000 = 4000 kg
   - 4 m^3 of bricks would have a mass of 4 * 2000 = 8000 kg
2. The density of air is 1 kg/m^3. This means that 1 m^3 of air has a mass of 1 kg. 
   - 6000 m^3 of air would have a mass of 6000 * 1 = 6000 kg
   - 10,000 m^3 of air would have a mass of 10,000 * 1 = 10,000 kg
3. Comparing the masses:
   - 2 m^3 of bricks: 4000 kg
   - 4 m^3 of bricks: 8000 kg 
   - 6000 m^3 of air: 6000 kg
   - 10,000 m^3 of air: 10,000 kg
4. The lowest mass is 2 m^3 of bricks at 4000 kg.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
