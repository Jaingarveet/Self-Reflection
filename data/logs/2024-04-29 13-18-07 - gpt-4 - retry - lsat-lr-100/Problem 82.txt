Context: Patricia: During Japan's Tokugawa period, martial arts experts known as ninjas were trained for the purposes of espionage and assassination. Yet at that time there was actually very little ninja activity in Japan, and most Japanese did not fear ninjas. Tamara: That is not true. Many wealthy Japanese during the Tokugawa period had their houses constructed with intentionally squeaky floors so that they would receive warning if a ninja were in the house.
Question: Of the following, which one, if true, is the strongest counter Patricia can make to Tamara's objection?
Choices:
  A: Many poor Japanese during the Tokugawa period also had houses constructed with intentionally squeaky floors.
  B: As part of their secret training, ninjas learned to walk on squeaky floors without making a sound.
  C: The wealthy made up a small portion of Japan's population during the Tokugawa period.
  D: The fighting prowess of ninjas was exaggerated to mythic proportions in the years following the Tokngawa period.
  E: There were very few ninjas at any time other than during the Tokugawa period.

## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Patricia's argument is that there was little ninja activity and most Japanese did not fear ninjas during the Tokugawa period. Tamara counters this by saying that many wealthy Japanese had squeaky floors installed as a defense against ninjas. The strongest counter Patricia can make would be to provide evidence that even if the floors were squeaky, it wouldn't have mattered because ninjas could move silently. 
Action: Answer("B")
