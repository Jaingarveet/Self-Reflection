## Self-Reflection
**Previous Incorrect Answer:** C
**Reasoning for Incorrect Answer:** I incorrectly assumed that the chairman's opinion was the most doubtful because it was a subjective statement.
**Correct Answer:** D
**Reasoning for Correct Answer:** The statement "The skyrocketing housing prices are because supply has not kept up with demand" is the most doubtful because it is a simplistic explanation for a complex issue. It ignores other potential factors, such as rising land prices, speculation, and government policies.
**Key Takeaways:**
* Not all opinions are equally valid.
* When evaluating statements, it is important to consider the evidence that supports them.
* Simple explanations are not always the most accurate.
## Applying the Takeaways to the Current Question
**Analysis of Choices:**
* **A:** This statement provides evidence that land prices are rising, which supports the assertion that rising land prices are the chief culprit in soaring housing prices.
* **B:** This statement also provides evidence that land prices are rising, but to a lesser extent than in Shanghai.
* **C:** This statement is an opinion from a real estate chairman. While opinions from experts can be valuable, they should not be taken as definitive proof.
* **D:** This statement is a simplistic explanation that ignores other potential factors.
**Conclusion:**
Based on the analysis, the most doubtful statement is **D**.
**Action:** Answer("D")
