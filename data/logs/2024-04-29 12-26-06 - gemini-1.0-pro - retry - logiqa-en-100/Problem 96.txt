Question: If the following item is true, can the argument be strengthened most?
Choices:
  A: The cost and selling price of "Inferno" are lower than that of "Harbour".
  B: The above advertisers who refused to renew their contracts have not affected the benefits after switching to other publications.

## Assistant 2:
## Analyzing the Argument
The argument states that some advertisers prioritize ethical considerations over economic benefits. This is supported by the example of advertisers refusing to renew contracts with "Inferno" magazine due to its violent and pornographic content.
## Analyzing the Answer Choices
* **A**: This information is irrelevant to the argument's core point about ethical considerations.
* **B**: This information weakens the argument by suggesting that the advertisers' decision was not based on ethical concerns but on maintaining their own benefits.
* **C**: This information strengthens the argument by supporting the claim that the advertisers' decision was based on the magazine's content not aligning with their target audience.
* **D**: This information is irrelevant to the argument's focus on ethical considerations.
## Conclusion
Therefore, the answer that strengthens the argument most is **C**: Readers of family magazines are generally not interested in violent and pornographic content. This supports the claim that the advertisers' decision was based on ethical concerns and not simply on economic considerations.
## Action: Answer("C")
