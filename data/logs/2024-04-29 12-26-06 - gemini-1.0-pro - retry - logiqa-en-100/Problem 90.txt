Context: The problem faced by a developing country is that to maintain its economic development, it must constantly strengthen the competitiveness of domestic enterprises; to maintain social stability, it must constantly establish and improve social security systems such as pensions, medical care, and unemployment.To establish and improve the social security system, enterprises need to pay a certain percentage of social insurance premiums for employees every year.If an enterprise pays such a proportion of social insurance premiums for employees every year, it will reduce the competitiveness of the enterprise.
Question: Which of the following conclusions can be derived from the above statement?

  A: This country can either maintain its economic development or maintain its social stability.

## Assistant 2:
Let's analyze each choice:
* **A**: This is not necessarily true. The country may be able to find ways to achieve both goals, such as by investing in education and training to improve the skills of its workforce.
* **B**: This is a possible solution, but it may not be the best one. Reducing social insurance premiums could lead to lower quality of life for workers and their families.
* **C**: This is too extreme. The country may be able to find a balance between economic development and social stability.
* **D**: This is the most likely outcome. The country will need to find ways to mitigate the negative impact of social insurance premiums on its competitiveness.
Therefore, the best answer is **D**.
Action: Answer("D")
