## Applying the Lessons Learned to the Current Question:
Based on the information provided and the lessons learned from my previous mistake, I will analyze the current question step-by-step:
1. **Given:** X and F are assigned to the same department.
2. **Condition (1):** H and Y must be allocated in the same department.
3. **Condition (2):** F and G cannot be allocated in the same department.
4. **Condition (3):** If X is allocated in the sales department, W is allocated in the production department.
5. **Condition (4):** F must be allocated in the production department.
**Analyzing the statements:**
* **A: G is assigned to the sales department:** This statement contradicts condition (2) if F is also in the production department. Therefore, statement A cannot be true.
* **B: H is assigned to the production department:** This statement is possible as long as Y is also in the production department, fulfilling condition (1).
* **C: I was assigned to the sales department:** This statement is possible as long as X is not in the sales department, leaving space for I.
* **D: W is assigned to the public relations department:** This statement is possible as long as X is not in the sales department, negating condition (3).
**Conclusion:**
The statement that cannot be true is **A: G is assigned to the sales department**.
**Action: Answer("A")**
