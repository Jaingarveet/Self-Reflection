## Assistant 2:
Let's analyze each choice:
A: The group went to E city and J lake: This could be true, but it's not necessarily true. We only know that they didn't go to I Peak, not that they went to E city.
B: The group went to city E instead of city F: This could be true, but it's not necessarily true. We only know that they didn't go to I Peak, not that they went to E city instead of F city.
C: The group went to visit G Lake and H Mountain: This violates condition (2). If they didn't go to E city, they can't go to G lake. So, this is not true.
D: The group went to F city and G lake tour: This could be true. They could have gone to F city and G lake without going to I Peak. This satisfies all the conditions.
Therefore, the only option that must be true is:
Action: Answer("D") 
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
