## Assistant 2:
Action: Answer("B") 
Explanation:
The argument in the question is a deductive argument, which means that the conclusion is guaranteed to be true if the premises are true. The argument in choice B is also a deductive argument with the same structure. Both arguments have a general statement (all landscape rooms can see the landscape/vegetables in Dongdun Market are very cheap) followed by a specific statement that contradicts the general statement (Li Wenbing's family can't see the landscape/this basket of vegetables is not bought in Dongdun Market). The conclusion in both arguments is that the specific statement must be false because it contradicts the general statement. 
The other choices are not as similar to the argument in the question. Choice A is an inductive argument, which means that the conclusion is likely to be true if the premises are true, but it is not guaranteed to be true. Choice C is a deductive argument, but it has a different structure than the argument in the question. Choice D is a deductive argument, but it has a different conclusion than the argument in the question.
