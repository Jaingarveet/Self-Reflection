## Assistant 2:
## Analyzing the problem:
Let's analyze the information step-by-step:
1. **Human Resources and Sales are not adjacent:** This means they cannot be on floors directly above or below each other.
2. **Finance is above Planning:** Finance is on a higher floor than Planning.
3. **Administration is above Planning but below Human Resources:** Administration is on a floor higher than Planning but lower than Human Resources.
## Considering the options:
**A: Sales is above R&D:** This is possible. Sales could be above R&D with other departments in between.
**B: Sales is one level above Administration:** This is also possible. Sales could be on the floor above Administration with other departments in between.
**C: Sales is next to Planning:** This contradicts the information that Human Resources and Sales are not adjacent. 
**D: Sales is on the second floor:** This is possible, but we don't have enough information to confirm it.
## Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, options A, B, and D are all possible scenarios. We cannot determine which one is definitively correct with the given information.
## Action: 
Answer("None of the Above")
