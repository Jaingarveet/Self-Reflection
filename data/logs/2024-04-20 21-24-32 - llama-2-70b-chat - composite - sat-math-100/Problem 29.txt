The weight of an object on a given planet can be found by using the formula $W=m g$, where $W$ is the weight of the object measured in newtons, $m$ is the mass of the object measured in kilograms, and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity on the planet measured in $\frac{m}{\sec ^{2}}$
Question: An object on Earth has a weight of 150 newtons. On which planet would the same object have an approximate weight of 170 newtons?
Choices:
  A: Venus
  B: Saturn
  C: Uranus
  D: Neptune
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I made a calculation error.
I correctly identified the formula for weight, $W=mg$, but I plugged in the wrong values for the mass of the object and the acceleration due to gravity.
I used the mass of the object as 150 kg, which is the weight of the object on Earth, instead of using the correct mass of the object, which is not given in the problem.
I also used the acceleration due to gravity for [REDACTED], which is 10.7 $\frac{m}{\sec ^{2}}$, instead of using the acceleration due to gravity for [REDACTED], which is 11.1 $\frac{m}{\sec ^{2}}$.
Error Keywords:
- Calculation error
- Formula error
- Plugging in wrong values
Solution:
The correct solution is as follows:
The weight of an object on a planet can be found by using the formula $W=mg$, where $W$ is the weight of the object measured in newtons, $m$ is the mass of the object measured in kilograms, and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity on the planet measured in $\frac{m}{\sec ^{2}}$.
The object has a weight of 150 newtons on Earth, so we need to find the planet where the object would have an approximate weight of 170 newtons.
We can do this by finding the planet with an acceleration due to gravity that would result in a weight of 170 newtons for the object.
The acceleration due to gravity on [REDACTED] is 11.1 $\frac{m}{\sec ^{2}}$.
Using the formula $W=mg$, we can calculate the weight of the object on [REDACTED]:
$W=m(11.1)$
$W=150(11.1)$
$W=1665$
The weight of the object on [REDACTED] is approximately 1665 newtons, which is closest to the desired weight of 170 newtons.
Therefore, the object would have an approximate weight of 170 newtons on [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Identify the formula for weight, $W=mg$.
2. Identify the given information in the problem.
3. Plug in the given values for the acceleration due to gravity and the mass of the object.
4. Calculate the weight of the object on the given planet.
5. Compare the calculated weight to the desired weight.
6. Choose the planet with the closest weight to the desired weight.
Advice:
- Always read the problem carefully and identify the given information.
- Always use the correct formula for the problem.
- Always plug in the correct values for the formula.
- Always calculate the weight of the object on each planet.
- Always compare the calculated weight to the desired weight.
- Always choose the planet with the closest weight to the desired weight.

The answer is B: Saturn.

The formula for weight is W = mg, where W is the weight of the object measured in newtons, m is the mass of the object measured in kilograms, and g is the acceleration due to gravity on the planet measured in $\frac{m}{\sec ^{2}}$.

The given information in the problem is the weight of the object on Earth, which is 150 newtons, and the acceleration due to gravity for each planet.

To solve the problem, we need to find the planet where the object would have an approximate weight of 170 newtons. We can do this by finding the planet with an acceleration due to gravity that would result in a weight of 170 newtons for the object.

Using the formula W = mg, we can calculate the weight of the object on each planet by plugging in the given values for the acceleration due to gravity and the mass of the object.

The weight of the object on Saturn would be approximately 1665 newtons, which is closest to the desired weight of 170 newtons. Therefore, the object would have an approximate weight of 170 newtons on Saturn.

The correct answer is B: Saturn.

In summary, to solve this problem, we identified the formula for weight, identified the given information in the problem, plugged in the given values for the acceleration due to gravity and the mass of the object, calculated the weight of the object on each planet, compared the calculated weight to the desired weight, and chose the planet with the closest weight to the desired weight.
