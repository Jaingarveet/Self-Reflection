## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: A researcher surveyed a random sample of students from a large university about how often they see movies. Using the sample data, the researcher estimated that $23 \%$ of the students in the population saw a movie at least once per month. The margin of error for this estimation is $4 \%$. Which of the following is the most appropriate conclusion about all students at the university, based on the given estimate and margin of error?
Choices:
  A: It is unlikely that less than $23 \%$ of the students see a movie at least once per month.
  B: At least 23\%, but no more than $25 \%$, of the students see a movie at least once per month.
  C: The researcher is between $19 \%$ and $27 \%$ sure that most students see a movie at least once per month.
  D: It is plausible that the percentage of students who see a movie at least once per month is between $19 \%$ and $27 \%$.
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I answered choice [REDACTED], but the correct answer is [REDACTED].
I misunderstood the wording of the choices and selected the wrong one.
The correct answer, [REDACTED], states that it is plausible that the percentage of students who see a movie at least once per month is between $19 \%$ and $27 \%$.
This is consistent with the given information, including the estimated percentage and margin of error.
Error Keywords:
 - Misinterpretation of choices
 - Misunderstanding of the question
Solution:
1. Read the question carefully and understand the problem.
2. Evaluate each choice based on the given information.
3. Select the choice that best matches the conclusion based on the given estimate and margin of error.
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and understand the problem.
2. Identify the estimated percentage and margin of error.
3. Determine the possible range of the true percentage based on the margin of error.
4. Evaluate each choice based on the possible range of the true percentage.
5. Select the choice that best matches the conclusion based on the given estimate and margin of error.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always evaluate each choice based on the given information.
 - Always select the choice that best matches the conclusion based on the given estimate and margin of error.
 - Be careful when interpreting the choices, and pay attention to the wording.
 - Double-check your answer to ensure it is consistent with the given information.
