# Model: llama-2-70b-chat | Agent: composite | Exam: sat-math-100 | Problem 17 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:
Topic: Geography
Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?

  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: If $\frac{a}{b}=2$, what is the value of $\frac{4 b}{a} ?$
Choices:
  A: 0
  B: 1
  C: 2
  D: 4
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I made a mistake in my reasoning. I incorrectly cancelled out the $[REDACTED]$s in the numerator and denominator, leading me to conclude that $\frac{a}{b} = [REDACTED]$. The correct solution is to recognize that $\frac{a}{b} = [REDACTED]$ means that $a = [REDACTED]b$, and therefore, $\frac{[REDACTED]b}{a} = \frac{[REDACTED]b}{[REDACTED]b} = [REDACTED]$.

Error Keywords:

* Cancellation error
* Misapplication of rules
* Lack of attention to detail

Solution:

[REDACTED]. Recognize that $\frac{a}{b} = [REDACTED]$ means that $a = [REDACTED]b$.
[REDACTED]. Use this relationship to find $\frac{[REDACTED]b}{a} = \frac{[REDACTED]b}{[REDACTED]b} = [REDACTED]$.

Instructions:

[REDACTED]. Identify the given information in the problem.
[REDACTED]. Use the given information to find the value of the expression.
3. Simplify the expression, if possible.
[REDACTED]. Check your answer to ensure it is correct.

Advice:

* Always read the problem carefully and understand the given information.
* Use the given information to find the solution, rather than relying on general rules or formulas.
* Simplify your answer, if possible, to ensure it is correct.
* Double-check your answer to ensure it is correct.

Reflection:
I will be more careful in my reasoning and pay closer attention to the given information in the problem. I will also make sure to simplify my answer, if possible, to ensure it is correct. In the future, I will double-check my answer to prevent similar errors.
