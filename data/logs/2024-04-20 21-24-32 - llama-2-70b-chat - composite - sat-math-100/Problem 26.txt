# Model: llama-2-70b-chat | Agent: composite | Exam: sat-math-100 | Problem 26 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:
Topic: Geography
Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: $$\begin{aligned}& 3 x^{2}-5 x+2 \\& 5 x^{2}-2 x-6\end{aligned}$$Which of the following is the sum of the two polynomials shown above?
Choices:
  A: $8 x^{2}-7 x-4$
  B: $8 x^{2}+7 x-4$
  C: $8 x^{4}-7 x^{2}-4$
  D: $8 x^{4}+7 x^{2}-4$
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I made a mistake in my calculation.
I mistakenly added the like terms incorrectly.
Error Keywords:
- Calculation error
- Like terms error
- Polynomial addition error

Solution:
First polynomial: 3x^2 - 5x + 2
Second polynomial: 5x^2 - 2x - 6

1. Add the corresponding terms:
3x^2 + 5x^2 = 8x^2
-5x + 2x = -3x
2 + (-6) = -4

2. Combine like terms:
8x^2 - 3x - 4

Instructions:
1. Identify the corresponding terms in each polynomial.
2. Add the corresponding terms.
3. Combine like terms.
4. Simplify the expression, if possible.
5. Choose the answer that matches the simplified expression.

Advice:
- Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
- Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
- Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
- Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
- Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
- Remember that when adding polynomials, you must add the corresponding terms.
- Make sure to combine like terms correctly.

- Make sure to combine like terms correctly.

Reflection:
I reflected on the problem, my previous solution, and the correct answer.
I realized that I made a mistake in my calculation, specifically in adding the like terms incorrectly.
I also realized that I needed to be more careful in combining the like terms correctly.
I reviewed the instructions and advice to ensure I understand the problem and the steps required to solve it.
I will be more careful in my calculation and ensure that I combine like terms correctly.

Action: Answer("B")
