## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Context: $$.\begin{aligned}.& S(P)=\frac{1}{2} P+40 \\.& D(P)=220-P.\end{aligned}.$$.The quantity of a product supplied and the quantity of the product demanded in an economic market are functions of the price of the product. The functions above are the estimated supply and demand functions for a certain product. The function $S(P)$ gives the quantity of the product supplied to the market when the price is $P$ dollars, and the function $D(P)$ gives the quantity of the product demanded by the market when the price is $P$ dollars.
Question: At what price will the quantity of the product supplied to the market equal the quantity of the product demanded by the market?
Choices:
  A: $\$ 90$
  B: $\$ 120$
  C: $\$ 133$
  D: $\$ 155$
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I made a mistake in my calculation.
I misunderstood the equation and solved for $P$ as $133$, but the correct solution is $P = 120$.
Error Keywords:
- Calculation error
- Equation solving error
- Algebraic error
Solution:
We are given the supply function $S(P) = \frac{1}{2} P + 40$ and the demand function $D(P) = 220 - P$.
To find the price at which the quantity of the product supplied equals the quantity of the product demanded, we set the two functions equal to each other:
$S(P) = D(P)$
$\frac{1}{2} P + 40 = 220 - P$
$P = 120$
Instructions:
1. Set the supply function equal to the demand function.
2. Solve for $P$.
3. Check your calculation to ensure accuracy.
Advice:
- Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
- Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
- Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
- Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
- Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
- Make sure to carry out all calculations carefully and accurately, and avoid simple algebraic errors.
