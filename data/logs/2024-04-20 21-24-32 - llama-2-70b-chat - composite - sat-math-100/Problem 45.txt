Question: Shipping Charges

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly. After reviewing the problem, I realized that I misunderstood the question and chose the wrong function. The correct function should have a constant term that represents the base shipping charge, which is not included in choices A and C.

Action: Answer("B")

Explanation:
The correct function to determine the total shipping charge $f(x)$, in dollars, for an order with a merchandise weight of $x$ pounds, is given by $f(x)=0.99 x+11.99$. This function has a constant term of $11.99$, which represents the base shipping charge, and a linear term of $0.99x$, which represents the additional shipping charge per pound.

Error Keywords:

* "linear relationship"
* "total shipping charge"
* "merchandise weight"

Solution:
The correct solution is choice B: $f(x)=0.99 x+11.99$.

Instructions:

1. Identify the constant term in the function, which represents the base shipping charge.
2. Determine the linear term in the function, which represents the additional shipping charge per pound.
3. Ensure that the function has a constant term and a linear term to represent the given shipping charges.

Advice:

* Carefully read the question and ensure that you understand the context and requirements.
* Check your answer choices and ensure that they meet the conditions specified in the question.
* Reflect on your previous mistakes and use them as an opportunity to learn and improve.
