## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: $$\begin{aligned}& b=2.35+0.25 x \\& c=1.75+0.40 x\end{aligned}$$In the equations above, $b$ and $c$ represent the price per pound, in dollars, of beef and chicken, respectively, $x$ weeks after July 1 during last summer. What was the price per pound of beef when it was equal to the price per pound of chicken?
Choices:
  A: $\$ 2.60$
  B: $\$ 2.85$
  C: $\$ 2.95$
  D: $\$ 3.35$
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I made a mistake in my calculation. 
I incorrectly solved for x, which led to an incorrect solution for the price per pound of beef.
Error Keywords:
- Calculation error
- Algebraic error
- Equation-solving error
Solution:
We are given two equations:
b = 2.35 + 0.25x
c = 1.75 + 0.40x

We want to find when the price per pound of beef is equal to the price per pound of chicken.

We can set up an equation:
b = c

Substituting b and c with their equations:
2.35 + 0.25x = 1.75 + 0.40x

0.25x = 0.40x

x = 4

Now, we can find the price per pound of beef when x = 4:
b = 2.35 + 0.25(4)
b = 2.35 + 1.00
b = 3.35

Therefore, the price per pound of beef when it was equal to the price per pound of chicken was $\$3.35$.

Instructions:
1. Set up an equation for the given problem.
2. Solve the equation for x.
3. Substitute x into one of the original equations to find the desired price.
4. Check your answer by plugging it into the other original equation.
5. Be careful when solving equations, and double-check your work.
Advice:
- Always read the problem carefully and understand what is being asked.
- Make sure to check your calculations and solutions to ensure accuracy.
- Use a step-by-step approach to solving problems.
- Don't be afraid to ask for help or seek clarification when needed.
- Practice, practice, practice!

Reflection:
I made a mistake in my previous answer by incorrectly solving for x, which led to an incorrect solution for the price per pound of beef. This time, I took my time to carefully read the problem, set up the equation, and solved for x. I also double-checked my work by plugging the solution into one of the original equations. I learned that it's essential to be careful when solving equations and to always double-check your work to ensure accuracy.
