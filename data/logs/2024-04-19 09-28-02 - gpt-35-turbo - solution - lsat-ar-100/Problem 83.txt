Context: A chemistry class has six lab sessions scheduled over three days—Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday—one session heing held each morning and one each afternoon. Each session will be led by a different lab assistant—Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, or Rebecca. The assignment of lab assistants to sessions is constrained as follows: Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day. Nessa must lead an afternoon session. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
Question: If Julio and Kevin both lead morning sessions, then any of the following could be true EXCEPT:
Choices:
  A: Lan's session meets Wednesday morning.
  B: Lan's session meets Thursday afternoon.
  C: Nessa's session meets Friday afternoon.
  D: Olivia's session meets Thursday morning.
  E: Olivia's session meets Friday morning.

You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
To solve the problem, I need to consider all the constraints in the problem. 
If Julio and Kevin both lead morning sessions, then Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day. Nessa must lead an afternoon session. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's. 
If Julio and Kevin both lead morning sessions, then the possible combinations of lab assistants and lab sessions are:
- Wednesday morning: Julio, Kevin, (Lan, Olivia, Nessa, Rebecca)
- Thursday morning: Julio, Kevin, (Lan, Olivia, Nessa, Rebecca)
- Friday morning: (Lan, Olivia, Nessa, Rebecca), Julio, Kevin
Now, I need to check each answer choice to see which one is not possible:
[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] Possible.
[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] Not possible because Lan cannot lead a session that meets on the same day as Olivia, and Olivia's session must be on a later day than Julio's.
[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] Possible.
[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] Possible.
[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] Possible.
Therefore, the answer is [REDACTED].
