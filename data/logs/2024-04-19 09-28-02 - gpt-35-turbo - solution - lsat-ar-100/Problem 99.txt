Solution:
If O is performed immediately after T, then the order of the compositions must be T, O, and then the remaining six compositions. 
T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R. 
If T is performed immediately after R, then F must be performed immediately before T. 
If T is performed immediately before F, then at least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F. 
The eighth composition performed is either L or H. 
P is performed at some time before S. 
At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
If F is performed fourth, then R must be performed immediately before T, and S must be performed immediately after O. 
If F is performed sixth, then R must be performed immediately after T, and P must be performed before S. 
Therefore, F must be performed either [REDACTED].
