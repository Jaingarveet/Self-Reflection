Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1.
Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2.
Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone.
Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone.
There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
[REDACTED], and Stuckey are not mentioned in any of the conditions that specify which sales representatives work in which sales zones. Therefore, they could work in any of the three sales zones. 
If Parra works in Zone 1 and Tiao works in Zone 2, then neither Parra nor Tiao can work in Zone 3. 
If Udall works in Zone 2, then Udall cannot work in Zone 3. 
Therefore, the only sales representatives who could work in Zone 3 are Kim and Mahr.
