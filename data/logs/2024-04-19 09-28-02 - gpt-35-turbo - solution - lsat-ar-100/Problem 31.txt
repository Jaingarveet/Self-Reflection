Context: A bakery makes exactly three kinds of cookieâ€”oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar. Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day. The following conditions apply: No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
Question: Which one of the following could be a complete and accurate list of the days on which the batches of each kind of cookie are made?
Choices:
  A: oatmeal: Monday, Wednesday, Thursday peanut butter: Wednesday, Thursday, Friday sugar: Monday, Thursday, Friday
  B: oatmeal: Monday, Tuesday, Thursday peanut butter: Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday sugar: Monday, Wednesday, Thursday
  C: oatmeal: Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday peanut butter: Wednesday, Thursday, Friday sugar: Tuesday, Thursday, Friday

Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
To solve this problem, we need to carefully consider all of the given conditions and use logic to determine the possible days on which each batch of cookies could be made. 
From the given conditions, we know that:
- The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
- The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
- No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
- At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
- There are three batches of each kind of cookie.
- Each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day.
Using these conditions, we can eliminate some of the answer choices and determine that the correct answer is [REDACTED]:
- We know that the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, so answer choices [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] are incorrect because they have sugar cookies being made on Tuesday.
- We know that the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies, so answer choice [REDACTED] is incorrect because it has oatmeal cookies being made on Tuesday and Thursday, while peanut butter cookies are being made on Monday and Wednesday.
- Answer choice [REDACTED] has oatmeal cookies being made on Tuesday, which is not possible because the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies, which is either Monday or Wednesday.
Therefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED]:
- oatmeal: Monday, Wednesday, Thursday
- peanut butter: Wednesday, Thursday, Friday
- sugar: Monday, Thursday, Friday
