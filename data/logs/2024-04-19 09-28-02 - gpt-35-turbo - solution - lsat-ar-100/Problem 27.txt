Solution:
Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
Therefore, only two students can review Tamerlane.
However, neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews, and Megregian reviews more plays than Kramer and Lopez.
Therefore, the only possible combination is Kramer, Megregian, and O'Neill.
