Topic: Law
Context: On the first day of a two-day study for a cycling magazine, four riders—Reynaldo, Seamus, Theresa, and Yuki—will each test one of four bicycles—F, G, H, and J. Each rider will then test a different one of the bicycles on the second day. Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day. The assignment of riders to bicycles is subject to the following conditions: Reynaldo cannot test F. Yuki cannot test J. Theresa must be one of the testers for H. The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
Question: If Theresa tests G on the second day, then which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Reynaldo tests H on the first day.
  B: Reynaldo tests J on the first day.
  C: Theresa tests H on the second day.
  D: Theresa tests J on the first day.
  E: Yuki tests H on the second day.

Solution:
## Assistant 2:
If Theresa tests G on the second day, then Yuki must have tested G on the first day (because Yuki cannot test J). Therefore, Seamus must test H on the first day (because he must test the same bike that Yuki tested on the first day). This means that Reynaldo must test J on the first day (because he cannot test F). So, the correct answer is B: Reynaldo tests J on the first day. 
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: E
Score: 0
