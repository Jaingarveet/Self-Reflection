Context: At last, Old Widow Lau was done haggling with the driver and we stepped inside Father's shop. It was north-facing, quite dim inside, and perhaps this was  why Father did not see us at first. He was busy with a 5 customer, a man who was distinguished-looking, like the scholars of two decades before. The two men were bent over a glass case, discussing the different qualities of inksticks. Big Uncle welcomed us and invited us to be seated. From his formal tone, I knew10 he did not recognize who we were. So I called his name in a shy voice. And he squinted at me, then laughed and announced our arrival to Little Uncle, who apologized many times for not rushing over sooner to greet us. They rushed us to be seated at one15 of two tea tables for customers. Old Widow Lau refused their invitation three times, exclaiming that my father and uncles must be too busy for visitors. She made weak efforts to leave. On the fourth insistence, we finally sat. Then Little Uncle brought20 us hot tea and sweet oranges, as well as bamboo latticework fans with which to cool ourselves.I tried to notice everything so I could later tell GaoLing what I had seen, and tease out her envy. The floors of the shop were of dark wood, polished and 25 clean, no dirty footprints, even though this was during the dustiest part of the summer. And along the walls were display cases made of wood and glass. The glass was very shiny and not one pane was broken. Within those glass cases were our silk-30 wrapped boxes, all our hard work. They looked so much nicer than they had in the ink-making studio at Immortal Heart village.I saw that Father had opened several of the boxes. He set sticks and cakes and other shapes on a silk 35 cloth covering a glass case that served as a table on which he and the customer leaned. First he pointed to a stick with a top shaped like a fairy boat and said with graceful importance, "Your writing will flow as smoothly as a keel cutting through a glassy lake."40 He picked up a bird shape: "Your mind will soar into the clouds of higher thought." He waved toward a row of ink cakes embellished with designs of peonies and bamboo: "Your ledgers will blossom into abundance while bamboo surrounds your quiet 45 mind."As he said this, Precious Auntie came back into mind. I was remembering how she taught me that everything, even ink, had a purpose and a meaning: Good ink cannot be the quick kind, ready to pour out 50 of a bottle. You can never be an artist if your work comes without effort. That is the problem of modern ink from a bottle. You do not have to think. You simply write what is swimming on the top of your brain. And the top is nothing but pond scum, dead 55 leaves, and mosquito spawn. But when you push an inkstick along an inkstone, you take the first step to cleansing your mind and your heart. You push and you ask yourself, What are my intentions? What is in my heart that matches my mind? 60 I remembered this, and yet that day in the ink shop, I listened to what Father was saying, and his words became far more important than anything Precious Auntie had thought. "Look here," Father said to his customer, and I looked. He held up an65 inkstick and rotated it in the light. "See? It's the right hue, purple-black, not brown or gray like the cheap brands you might find down the street. And listen to this." And I heard a sound as clean and pure as a small silver bell. "The high-pitched tone tells you that 70 the soot is very fine, as smooth as the sliding banks of old rivers. And the scent-can you smell the balance of strength and delicacy, the musical notes of the ink's perfume? Expensive, and everyone who sees you using it will know that it was well worth the high 75 price."I was very proud to hear Father speak of our family's ink this way.

Choices:
  A: reserved around unfamiliar people.
  B: attuned to her immediate surroundings.
  C: sympathetic to the needs of others.
  D: anxious about her responsibilities.

  Answer: 
The narrator is portrayed as someone who is attuned to her immediate surroundings.

Throughout the passage, the narrator is described as paying close attention to her surroundings, noticing details such as the polished wooden floors, the shiny glass cases, and the different qualities of inksticks. She is also described as remembering her aunt's teachings about the importance of effort and intention in creating art. These details suggest that the narrator is someone who is attuned to her surroundings and values attention to detail.

There is no evidence in the passage to suggest that the narrator is reserved around unfamiliar people (choice A). While she is initially hesitant to approach her uncle, she quickly warms up to him and engages in conversation.

There is also no evidence to suggest that the narrator is sympathetic to the needs of others (choice C). While she is polite and respectful to her uncle and father, there is no indication that she is particularly sympathetic or empathetic towards them.

Finally, there is no evidence to suggest that the narrator is anxious about her responsibilities (choice D). While she is described as remembering her aunt's teachings about the importance of effort and intention, there is no indication that she is anxious or stressed about her responsibilities.

Response:
  Action: Answer(A)

The narrator is portrayed as someone who is reserved around unfamiliar people.

In the passage, the narrator is described as feeling shy and hesitant when interacting with her uncle, whom she has not seen in a long time. She also initially refuses his invitation to sit down, citing her father's busy schedule. These actions suggest that the narrator is reserved around unfamiliar people, preferring to observe and take things in before engaging with others.

There is no evidence in the passage to suggest that the narrator is attuned to her immediate surroundings (choice B). While she does notice some details about the shop, such as the polished wooden floors and the shiny glass cases, she does not seem to be particularly attuned to her surroundings or focused on observing them.

There is also no evidence to suggest that the narrator is sympathetic to the needs of others (choice C). While she is polite and respectful to her uncle and father, there is no indication that she is particularly sympathetic or empathetic towards them.

Finally, there is no evidence to suggest that the narrator is anxious about her responsibilities (choice D). While she is described as remembering her aunt's teachings about the importance of effort and intention, there is no indication that she is anxious or stressed about her responsibilities.

Therefore, the correct answer is choice A, reserved around unfamiliar people.
