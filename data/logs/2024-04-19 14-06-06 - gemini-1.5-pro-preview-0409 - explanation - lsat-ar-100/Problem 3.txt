Topic: Law
Context: An administrator must assign parking spaces to six new employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young. Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
Question: If Robertson is assigned parking space #3, then which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Souza is assigned parking space #4.
  B: Togowa is assigned parking space #2.
  C: Vaughn is assigned parking space #5.
  D: Xu is assigned parking space #6.
  E: Young is assigned parking space #2.

Explanation:
## Assistant 2:
## Reflection on Previous Attempt:
In my previous attempt, I likely focused too much on the individual rules and not enough on the combined implications of those rules in relation to Robertson being assigned space #3. This led me to a conclusion that didn't necessarily follow from the given constraints.
## Reasoning for Current Attempt:
1. **Robertson in #3**: This means spaces #1, #2, and #4 are still available, along with #5 and #6.
2. **Young > Togowa**: Since Robertson is in #3, Young must be in #4, #5, or #6. This leaves Togowa to be in #1 or #2.
3. **Xu > Souza**: We don't have enough information to pinpoint their exact spaces, but we know Xu must be in a higher numbered space than Souza. 
4. **Constraints**: With Robertson in #3 and Young in #4, #5, or #6, the remaining spaces (#1, #2, and one from #4-#6) must be assigned to Souza, Togowa, and Xu.
## Conclusion:
Based on the above reasoning, none of the options A, B, C, or E are *necessarily* true. However, option D, **Xu being assigned parking space #6**, must be true. This is because with Young occupying one of the spaces #4-#6, the only way for Xu to have a higher-numbered space than Souza is by taking #6. 
**Action: Answer("D")** 
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: E
Score: 0
