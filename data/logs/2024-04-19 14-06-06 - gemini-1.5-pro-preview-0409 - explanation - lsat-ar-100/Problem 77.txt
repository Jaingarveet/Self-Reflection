Context: An administrator must assign parking spaces to six new employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young. Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.

Explanation:
## Assistant 2:
## Reflection on Previous Attempt:
My previous approach likely involved misinterpreting the constraints or making an error in deduction.  It's crucial to analyze each rule and its implications carefully.
## Step-by-Step Deduction:
1. **Robertson's Constraint:**  Robertson must be in spaces #1-4 and above Young. This leaves only two options:  **(R1, Y2)** or **(R2, Y3)**.
2. **Young & Togowa:** Young must be above Togowa, so Togowa can only be in **T1** in the first scenario and **T1 or T2** in the second scenario.
3. **Xu & Souza:** Xu must be above Souza, leaving multiple possibilities for their placement depending on the first two deductions.
4. **Remaining Space:** The last space (#6) will be filled by whoever among Xu, Souza, and Togowa hasn't been placed yet.
## Conclusion:
Only **Robertson and Young** have their parking space limited to two possibilities. 
**Action: Answer("B")** 
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
