Context: An administrator must assign parking spaces to six new employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young. Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.

Choices:

Explanation:
## Assistant 2:
## Reflection on Previous Attempt:
In my previous attempt, I likely focused too much on the individual rules and not enough on the combined implications of those rules and the specific condition that "Young is assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza." This led me to overlook a possible scenario that satisfied all conditions.
## Reasoning:
1. **Young > Souza:** This is the given condition we must satisfy.
2. **Robertson > Young:** This means Robertson must have a higher numbered space than both Young and Souza.
3. **Xu > Souza:** This adds another person who must have a higher numbered space than Souza.
4. **Robertson's limit:** Robertson can only be in spaces #1-4.
Combining these, we know there are at least 3 people (Robertson, Xu, and Young) who need spaces higher than Souza. Since Robertson's maximum is #4, the only way to accommodate everyone is if Souza has space #1. This leaves options for the others to fill #2-6.
## Analyzing Choices:
* **A: Togowa is assigned parking space #1:** This contradicts the deduction that Souza must be in space #1. 
* **B: Young is assigned parking space #2:** This is possible as long as Robertson, Xu are in #3-6 and Togowa is in #1.
* **C: Robertson is assigned parking space #3:** This is possible as long as Xu and Young are in #4-6 and Togowa and Souza are in #1-2.
* **D: Souza is assigned parking space #3:** This contradicts the deduction that Souza must be in space #1.
* **E: Vaughn is assigned parking space #4:** This is possible as long as Robertson, Xu, and Young are in #5-6 and Togowa and Souza are in #1-2.
Therefore, options B, C, and E are all possible scenarios. 
## Action: 
Since I must choose one, I will select the first possible option: **Answer("B")** 
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
