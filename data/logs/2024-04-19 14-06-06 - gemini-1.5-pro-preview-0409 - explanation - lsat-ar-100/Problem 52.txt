Explanation:
## Assistant 2:
## Reflection on Previous Attempt:
In my previous attempt, I focused too much on the constraint of Franco and Garcia not testifying on the same day and overlooked the specific conditions related to Wednesday's schedule. This led me to a wrong conclusion.
## Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Wednesday:** We know Iturbe and Jackson are testifying on Wednesday. This leaves Monday and Tuesday for the remaining three witnesses (Franco, Garcia, and Hong).
2. **Tuesday:** The condition states "Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday." So, two out of the remaining three (Franco, Garcia, and Hong) must testify on Tuesday.
3. **Monday:** Since Hong cannot testify on Monday and at least one witness must testify on Monday, the only option left is for **Franco or Garcia to testify on Monday**. 
Therefore, we cannot definitively say which one of them (Franco or Garcia) will testify on Monday, but we know **exactly one of them will**.
Action: Answer("C") 
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
