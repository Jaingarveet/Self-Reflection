Context: A shopping center has exactly seven spaces—space 1 through space 7—arranged in a straight row. Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.

Explanation:
## Assistant 2:
## Reflection on Previous Attempt:
In my previous attempt, I likely focused too much on the placement of the pharmacy and restaurants, neglecting the constraint about the toy store and veterinarian. This led me to a solution that violated that specific rule. 
## Reasoning for Correct Answer:
1. **Pharmacy Placement:** We know the pharmacy is at one end, and it must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. 
2. **Optometrist and Shoe Store:**  Since the optometrist is next to the shoe store, and the pharmacy needs to be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, placing the pharmacy next to the optometrist/shoe store pair would leave no room for the veterinarian due to the toy store restriction. 
3. **Restaurant Placement:** Therefore, the other end of the row must be occupied by a restaurant, and the pharmacy must be next to the veterinarian on the opposite end. 
4. **Toy Store Restriction:**  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so it must be placed next to the optometrist/shoe store pair.
5. **Remaining Restaurant:** This leaves only one possible position for the remaining restaurant, which is between the veterinarian and the toy store.
Therefore, the businesses immediately on either side of the optometrist/shoe store pair must be **a restaurant and the toy store**.
Action: Answer("D")
