## Assistant 2:
  Sure, I'll do my best to answer the question. Here's my reflection on the problem:

The problem states that exactly six students will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. The conditions are:

* Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report.
* Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
* If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.

From the conditions, we can deduce the following:

* George can only give a report on Tuesday.
* Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports, so they must give morning reports.
* If Nina gives a report, then Helen and Irving must give reports the next day, unless Nina's report is on Wednesday.

Now, let's consider the choices:

A: Helen gives a report on Wednesday.

If Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Wednesday. However, this would violate the condition that neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. Therefore, this choice is incorrect.

B: Nina gives a report on Monday.

If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday, which is impossible since George can only give a report on Tuesday. Therefore, this choice is incorrect.

C: Nina gives a report on Tuesday.

This choice is possible. If Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then George can give a report on Tuesday, and Helen and Irving must give reports on Wednesday. This satisfies all the conditions.

D: Olivia gives a report on Monday.

If Olivia gives a report on Monday, then Robert must give a report on Tuesday, which is impossible since George can only give a report on Tuesday. Therefore, this choice is incorrect.

E: Robert gives a report on Wednesday.

If Robert gives a report on Wednesday, then Olivia must give a report on Monday, which is impossible since Olivia cannot give an afternoon report. Therefore, this choice is incorrect.

In conclusion, the correct answer is C: Nina gives a report on Tuesday.
