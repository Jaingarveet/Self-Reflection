## Assistant 2:
  My apologies for my previous mistake. Let's reflect on the problem and the correct answer.
The formula for finding the average weight of a group of objects is:
average = (sum of all weights) / (number of objects)

In this case, the average weight of the 10 vehicles before adding the new truck is 12.2 tons, so we can set up the equation:
12.2 = (sum of weights of 10 vehicles) / 10

Now, let's consider the weight of the new heavy-duty truck. If the average weight of the group of vehicles increased by 2.6 tons after adding the new truck, we can set up another equation:
12.2 + 2.6 = (sum of weights of 10 vehicles + weight of new truck) / (10 + 1)

We can simplify this equation by combining the fractions:
14.8 = (sum of weights of 10 vehicles + weight of new truck) / 11

Now, we can solve for the weight of the new truck:
weight of new truck = 14.8 x 11 - sum of weights of 10 vehicles

Unfortunately, we don't have the information about the sum of weights of the 10 vehicles, so we cannot calculate the weight of the new truck exactly.
However, we can eliminate some answer choices that are clearly incorrect.

Answer choice A, 40.8, is too low, as the average weight of the group of vehicles before adding the new truck is already 12.2 tons.

Answer choice E, 44.8, is too high, as it exceeds the average weight of the group of vehicles after adding the new truck, which is 14.8 tons.

Answer choice D, 43.5, is also too high, as it is closer to the average weight of the group of vehicles after adding the new truck than the weight of the new truck itself.

Therefore, the correct answer is answer choice B, 41.6, which is the weight of the new heavy-duty truck.

Action: Answer("B")
