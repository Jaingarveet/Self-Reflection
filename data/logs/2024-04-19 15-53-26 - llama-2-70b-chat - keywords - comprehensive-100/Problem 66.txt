Question: $$m=\frac{\left(\frac{r}{1,200}\right)\left(1+\frac{r}{1,200}\right)^{N}}{\left(1+\frac{r}{1,200}\right)^{N}-1} P$$The formula above gives the monthly payment $m$ needed to pay off a loan of $P$ dollars at $r$ percent annual interest over $N$ months. Which of the following gives $P$ in terms of $m, r$, and $N$ ?
Choices:
  A: $P=\frac{\left(\frac{r}{1,200}\right)\left(1+\frac{r}{1,200}\right)^{N}}{\left(1+\frac{r}{1,200}\right)^{N}-1} m$
  B: $P=\frac{\left(1+\frac{r}{1,200}\right)^{N}-1}{\left(\frac{r}{1,200}\right)\left(1+\frac{r}{1,200}\right)^{N}} m$
  C: $P=\left(\frac{r}{1,200}\right) m$
  D: $P=\left(\frac{1,200}{r}\right) m$

## Assistant 2:
  My apologies for my previous mistake. Let's analyze the given formula:

$$m = \frac{\left(\frac{r}{1,200}\right)\left(1 + \frac{r}{1,200}\right)^{N}}{\left(1 + \frac{r}{1,200}\right)^{N} - 1} P$$

We can see that $P$ is in the numerator of the fraction inside the parentheses. Therefore, to isolate $P$, we need to move the numerator to the other side of the equation.

We can do this by subtracting the denominator from both sides:

$$m = \frac{\left(\frac{r}{1,200}\right)\left(1 + \frac{r}{1,200}\right)^{N}}{\left(1 + \frac{r}{1,200}\right)^{N} - 1} P$$

$$m - \left(1 + \frac{r}{1,200}\right)^{N} + 1 = \frac{\left(\frac{r}{1,200}\right)\left(1 + \frac{r}{1,200}\right)^{N}}{\left(1 + \frac{r}{1,200}\right)^{N} - 1} P$$

$$\left(1 + \frac{r}{1,200}\right)^{N} - 1 = \frac{\left(\frac{r}{1,200}\right)\left(1 + \frac{r}{1,200}\right)^{N}}{\left(1 + \frac{r}{1,200}\right)^{N} - 1} P - m$$

Now, we can solve for $P$:

$$P = \frac{\left(1 + \frac{r}{1,200}\right)^{N} - 1}{\left(\frac{r}{1,200}\right)\left(1 + \frac{r}{1,200}\right)^{N}} m$$

The correct answer is choice B:

$$P = \frac{\left(1 + \frac{r}{1,200}\right)^{N} - 1}{\left(\frac{r}{1,200}\right)\left(1 + \frac{r}{1,200}\right)^{N}} m$$

I apologize for my previous mistake and thank you for the opportunity to correct it.
