## Assistant 2:
  My previous answer was incorrect because I misunderstood the question and used an incorrect equation. I thought that the population of City X in 2015 was 120,000, and I used that number to calculate the population of City Y in 2015. However, the question states that the population of City X in 2010 was 120,000, and I should have used that number to calculate the population of City Y in 2010.

Let's break down the information given in the question:

* The population of City X in 2010 was 120,000.
* The population of City X in 2015 was 120,000 + 20% of 120,000 = 144,000.
* The population of City Y in 2015 was equal to the population of City X in 2015, so the population of City Y in 2015 was also 144,000.
* The population of City Y in 2010 was 144,000 - 10% of 144,000 = 129,600.

Therefore, the correct answer is B: 90,000.
