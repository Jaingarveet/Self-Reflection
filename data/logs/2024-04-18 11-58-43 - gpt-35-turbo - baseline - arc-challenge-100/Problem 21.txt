Thought:
Since there is no light in the deep ocean, stout beardfish would need a characteristic that would help them navigate and locate food in the dark.
A mouth full of bristles or two whiskers that locate food would be helpful in finding food in the dark.
A brightly colored body would not be helpful in the dark.
Swimming quickly would not be as helpful as finding food.
