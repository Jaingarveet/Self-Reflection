Question: Red-clay bricks have a density of approximately 2000 kg/m^3. Air has a density of 1 kg/m^3. Which of the following has the lowest mass?
Choices:
  A: 2 m^3 of bricks
  B: 4 m^3 of bricks
  C: 6000 m^3 of air
  D: 10,000 m^3 of air
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
To find the lowest mass, we need to calculate the mass of each option.
Mass = Density x Volume
Option A: Mass = 2000 kg/m^3 x 2 m^3 = 4000 kg
Option B: Mass = 2000 kg/m^3 x 4 m^3 = 8000 kg
Option C: Mass = 1 kg/m^3 x 6000 m^3 = 6000 kg
Option D: Mass = 1 kg/m^3 x 10,000 m^3 = 10,000 kg
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
