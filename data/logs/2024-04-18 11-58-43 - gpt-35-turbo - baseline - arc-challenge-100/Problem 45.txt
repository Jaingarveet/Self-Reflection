Question: As part of an experiment, an astronaut takes a scale to the Moon and weighs himself. The scale reads 31 pounds. If the astronaut has a mass of about 84 kilograms, which are the approximate weight and mass of the astronaut when standing on the Earth?
Choices:
  A: 31 pounds and 14 kilograms
  B: 31 pounds and 84 kilograms
  C: 186 pounds and 14 kilograms
  D: 186 pounds and 84 kilograms
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The weight of an object is the force exerted on it by gravity, and it depends on the mass of the object and the gravitational field strength. The gravitational field strength on the Moon is about 1/6th of that on Earth. Therefore, the weight of the astronaut on the Moon is about 1/6th of his weight on Earth. To find the weight and mass of the astronaut on Earth, we need to multiply the weight on the Moon by 6 and convert the mass from kilograms to pounds.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
