## System:
You are an expert in Science.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")

The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Science
Question: Two pieces of the same metal are placed on a table. The pieces of metal have the same density, mass, and texture. Which characteristic must be the ONLY difference between the two samples?
Choices:
  A: They have different dimensions.
  B: They have different boiling points.
  C: They are made up of a different type of matter.
  D: They contain a different amount of matter per unit volume.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Density is mass per unit volume, so if the two pieces of metal have the same density and mass, they must have the same volume.
Texture is not a characteristic that can be measured quantitatively.
Boiling point is a physical property of a substance, but it is not related to the density or mass of the metal.
The only characteristic that can be different between the two samples is their dimensions, which would affect their volume and therefore their density.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
