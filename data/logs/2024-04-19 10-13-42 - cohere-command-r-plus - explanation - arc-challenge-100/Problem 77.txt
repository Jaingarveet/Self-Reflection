Question: Sheep Challenge Evolution A species of sheep lives on the Scottish island of Hirta. Hirta has plenty of grass for the sheep to eat, and no natural predators of the sheep live on the island. Some sheep have dark wool, and some have light wool. The sheep with dark wool tend to be much larger and stronger than the sheep with light wool. However, researchers have found that in the last 20 years, the sheep with light wool have increased in number. Usually, strength and size help animals survive and breed. A new sheep predator is introduced to the island. Which change to the sheep population will most likely occur first?
Choices:
  A: a decrease in the population of sheep with dark wool
  B: a decrease in the population of sheep with light wool
  C: an increase in the population of sheep with dark wool
  D: an increase in the population of sheep with light wool

Explanation:
I misinterpreted the question and applied an incorrect rule of natural selection. I assumed that the introduction of a predator would favor the traits of light wool and smaller size, leading to a decline in the dark-wool sheep population. However, the correct interpretation is that the presence of any predator, regardless of the specific traits it targets, will initially reduce the overall number of sheep, which are now easier prey. This results in a decrease in the population of light-wool sheep, as they were previously the dominant population on the island.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The introduction of a predator to Hirta will initially result in a decline in the overall sheep population, as they are now vulnerable to predation.

Previously, in the absence of significant selective pressures, the light-wool sheep had become the dominant population on the island. With the introduction of a predator, there will likely be an initial decrease in the population of light-wool sheep as they are now more susceptible to being preyed upon.

This reflects the correct interpretation of the question and the principles of natural selection.
