Question: Red-clay bricks have a density of approximately 2000 kg/m^3. Air has a density of 1 kg/m^3. Which of the following has the lowest mass?
Choices:
  A: 2 m^3 of bricks
  B: 4 m^3 of bricks
  C: 6000 m^3 of air

Explanation:
## Assistant 2:
Reflection: The previous answer was incorrect because I made a mistake in calculating the mass of the bricks and air. I should have multiplied the volume by the density to find the mass. For bricks, with a density of 2000 kg/m^3, 2m^3 would give a mass of 4000 kg, and 4m^3 would give 8000 kg. For air, 6000m^3 gives a mass of 6000 kg, and 10,000m^3 gives 10,000 kg. Now it is clear that 6000 m^3 of air has the lowest mass.

Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
