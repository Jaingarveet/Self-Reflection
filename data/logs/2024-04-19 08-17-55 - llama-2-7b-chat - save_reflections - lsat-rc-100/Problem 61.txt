## Get Reflection:
  Great, you have correctly identified the answer. The author of the passage refers to "self, life, and writing" (lines 12â€“13) most probably in order to explain how the assumptions that underlie European-style autobiography arose. The passage highlights the cultural constructs of highly diverse Native American peoples and how they viewed self, life, and writing differently than Europeans. The author argues that the concept of autobiography is shaped by the creator's ideas about the audience for which it is intended, and that early Native American autobiographical expressions were shaped by the cultural perspectives of the people who transmitted them. Therefore, option E is the best answer.

Here are some key points to help you remember the answer:

* The author refers to "self, life, and writing" to explain how the assumptions that underlie European-style autobiography arose.
* The passage highlights the cultural constructs of highly diverse Native American peoples and how they viewed self, life, and writing differently than Europeans.
