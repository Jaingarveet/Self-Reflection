  Thank you for providing the passage and the question. I'll be happy to help you with this.

The correct answer is (B) The frequent use of proverbs within any community functions, at least in part, to convey a sense of their ethnicity to children within that community.

The passage suggests that proverbs are used in Mexican American communities to teach children about their heritage and to foster a consciousness of their ethnicity. The passage states that proverbs are a means of transmitting the Spanish language and Mexican culture, and that they provide a way for children to learn about their heritage and strengthen their ties to Mexican tradition. This implies that the use of proverbs in any community serves, at least in part, to convey a sense of ethnicity to children within that community.

The other options are not supported by the passage:

Option (A) is not implied by the passage, as it does not mention anything about table manners.

Option (C) is not accurate, as the passage does mention that Mexican Americans use Spanish-language proverbs, but it does not suggest that their use of proverbs is typical of Spanish speakers throughout the world.

Option (D) is partially correct, as the passage does mention that the meaning of a proverb depends on the social context in which it is used. However, the passage does not suggest that the meaning of a proverb is dependent on the verbal context alone.

Option (E) is not supported by the passage, as it does not mention anything about the emphasis on teaching children about peer-group relationships in Mexican American communities being distinct from other communities in the United States.
