## Get Reflection:
  Great, you've provided the correct answer! Here's why:

The purpose of passage B is to criticize the type of argument made in passage A by attempting to create an analogous argument with a conclusion that is clearly false. The author of passage B argues that the type of evidence used in passage A is often derived from inaccurate observation, and that the claims made in passage A are vacuous because no possible evidence could confirm or disconfirm them. The author of passage B seeks to undermine the type of argument made in passage A by suggesting that it relies on questionable reasoning.

Therefore, the best answer is (B) - The author of passage B argues that the type of argument made in passage A is flawed by attempting to create an analogous argument with a clearly false conclusion.

Well done!
