## Get Reflection:
  My apologies, thank you for pointing that out. Here is my revised answer:

Action: Answer("B")

Passage B differs from passage A in that passage B is more tentative in its claims. While passage A presents a more optimistic view of fingerprint identification, passage B acknowledges the limitations and uncertainties of the technique. It highlights the lack of objective standards for evaluating fingerprint matches and the uncertainty surrounding the error rate of fingerprint identification in actual practice. Therefore, the best answer is (C) tentative in its claims.
