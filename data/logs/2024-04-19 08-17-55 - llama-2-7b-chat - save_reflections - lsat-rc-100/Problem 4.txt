## Get Reflection:
  Great, let's break down why the passage provides the most support for statement (C): Marshall's tactics were initially opposed by some other members of the NAACP who favored a more traditional approach.

The passage states that "Marshall and the NAACP developed innovations that forever changed the landscape of public interest law," indicating that their approach was not widely accepted at the time. The passage also notes that "since the time of Marshall's work with the NAACP, the number of public interest law firms in the U.S. has grown substantially, and they have widely adopted his combination of strategies for litigation," suggesting that Marshall's methods were not universally accepted during his time at the NAACP.

Furthermore, the passage provides specific examples of how Marshall's tactics were initially opposed by some other members of the NAACP. For instance, it states that "Marshall declined to pursue some cases that were in keeping with the NAACP's goals but whose plaintiffs' likely impression on the public he deemed to be unfavorable." This suggests that there were some within the NAACP who preferred a more traditional approach that focused on cases with more sympathetic plaintiffs.

Overall, the passage provides the most support for statement (C) because it suggests that Marshall's innovative tactics were not universally accepted within the NAACP during his time there, and that there were some who preferred a more traditional approach.
