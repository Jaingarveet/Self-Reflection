## Get Reflection:
  Great, you have accurately identified the organization of the passage! Option B is the correct answer. The passage does indeed describe two sides of a debate in the legal community and uses an economic principle, utility maximization, to resolve the conflict between them. The passage presents an economic analysis that shows how the two positions are not fundamentally in conflict, and that the optimal approach to crime deterrence would include elements of both deterrence strategies. Well done!
