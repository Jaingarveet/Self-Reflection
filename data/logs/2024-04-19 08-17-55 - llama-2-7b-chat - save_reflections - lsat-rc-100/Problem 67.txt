Now, let's move on to the correct answer. The primary function of the reference to maximization of financial success (lines 52-54) is to serve as the author's logical conclusion from the data presented in the preceding paragraph regarding the social consequences of technological development. The author argues that entrepreneurs and investors often cannot maximize their financial success without expanding their market, which involves structuring their prices to make their technologies accessible to an ever-larger share of the population. This leads to a tendency for prices to be driven down, which in turn diffuses access to new technology across society. Therefore, the reference to maximization of financial success is used to support the author's argument that technological development has served as a democratizing force in society, narrowing the gap in benefits accruing to different groups of people in the long term.

In conclusion, the correct answer is (D) Serves as part of a causal explanation that reinforces the thesis in the first paragraph regarding the benefits of technological development.
