## Get Reflection:
  Great, let's break down the answer:

The correct answer is (C) A similar ritual for assuming a new name is used in diverse communities.

The author suggests that in pre-contact Native American cultures, identity was not merely individual but also relational to a society, a specific landscape, and the cosmos. The expression of life experiences tended to be oriented toward current events, with the participation of fellow tribal members, and included songs, chants, stories, and dance. The author also notes that a tribe would contribute to the individual's narrative actively by joining in the expression of that narrative.

Option C aligns with these ideas as it states that a similar ritual for assuming a new name is used in diverse communities, which is consistent with the author's description of the cultural constructs of highly diverse Native American peoples. In pre-contact Native American cultures, the process of assuming a new name was not unique to an individual but was a common practice among many communities, suggesting a shared understanding of identity that was relational and communal.

The other options do not align as well with the author's ideas:

Option A is incorrect because in pre-contact Native American cultures, a person who is born into one tribe but is brought up by members of another tribe did not necessarily retain a name given at birth. While there may have been some consistency in naming practices across tribes, there is no evidence to suggest that a person's name was tied to their birth tribe in the way suggested in Option A.

Option B is incorrect because while pictographs may have represented specific people or events, they did not necessarily incorporate the symbol for a constellation. The author does not provide any evidence to suggest that pictographs were used in this way.

Option D is incorrect because in pre-contact Native American cultures, a name given to one member of a community could be given to another member of the same community. While there may have been some consistency in naming practices across tribes, there is no evidence to suggest that a name given to one member of a community could not be given to another member of the same community.

Option E is incorrect because while decorated shields may have been used in some Native American cultures as a means of recording important events and deeds, they did not necessarily incorporate the symbol for a particular tribe. The author does not provide any evidence to suggest that decorated shields were used in this way.

Overall, Option C is the best answer as it aligns most closely with the author's ideas about identity in pre-contact Native American cultures.
