  Great, you have provided a clear and concise explanation of the passage. Here's a summary of your answer:

* The description of a work of literature as "useful" in the passage mainly refers to its effectiveness at communicating the author's ideas.
* According to Dostoyevsky, the task of the writer is to explore the boundaries of the real world, and a literary work must stand or fall on its artistic merit.
* The utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work are of secondary importance so long as its goal is good and its purpose clear is a contradiction in terms.
* Therefore, the passage suggests that the usefulness of a work of literature is primarily measured by its ability to effectively communicate the author's ideas, rather than its ability to bring about social change or help people understand the world around them.

You have covered all the key points in the passage and provided a clear explanation of why the correct answer is (C) ability to communicate the author's ideas. Well done!
