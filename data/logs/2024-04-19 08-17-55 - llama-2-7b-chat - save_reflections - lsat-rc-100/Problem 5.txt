## Get Reflection:
  Great, let's break down the passage and analyze the answer to the question:

The passage presents three positions on the role of art in society:

1. The first position is that art stands high above the present and the everyday.
2. The second position is that art has a right to exist only if it finds its sources in concrete reality and contributes to the creation of a new society.
3. The third position is Dostoyevsky's realist position, which recognizes that reality is shaped by the person experiencing it, and that art must explore the boundaries of the so-called real world.

The passage differentiates the third position from the first two by providing more detail on Dostoyevsky's understanding of reality and his rejection of the radical critics' demand that art serve a particular political view.

Therefore, the best answer is option B: "Three positions are presented and the third is differentiated from the first two in detail."

The passage does not present a hierarchy of the three positions, but rather presents each position in detail, highlighting their differences and similarities. Option A is not accurate, as the passage does not present three positions in detail, but rather presents one position (Dostoyevsky's) in detail, while briefly mentioning the other two positions. Option C is also not accurate, as the passage does not present the third position as inferior to the second. Option D is not accurate, as the passage does not present the third position as superior to the first two. Option E is not accurate, as the passage does not present a comparison between the three positions.
