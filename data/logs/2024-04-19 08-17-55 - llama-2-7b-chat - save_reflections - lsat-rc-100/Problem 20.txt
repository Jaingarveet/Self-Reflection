## Get Reflection:
  Great, thank you for providing the reflection and the correct answer. Here's a summary of the key points:

* The author believes that defense lawyers have a twofold obligation: to their clients and to the court and society.
* Defense lawyers should not present false or insincere arguments, even if they know their clients are guilty.
* Instead, they should appraise the case in their client's favor, after giving due consideration to the facts on the other side, and present any extenuating circumstances to argue for leniency in sentencing.
* The author emphasizes that the best defense can only be provided by an advocate who is convinced of the merits of the case.
* Defense lawyers should not be mere mouthpieces for their clients but instead advocates for their rights.

The correct answer is (E) convinced that it does not represent a conflict of interest for defense lawyers. The author does not see the twofold obligation as a conflict of interest, but rather as an essential part of the defense lawyer's role.
