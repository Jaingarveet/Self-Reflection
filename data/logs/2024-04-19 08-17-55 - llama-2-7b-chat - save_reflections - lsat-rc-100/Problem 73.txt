The passage contains information that most helps to answer question (E): What characteristic of Jazz is also present in the work of some other African American writers?

The passage explains that Toni Morrison's use of a musical genre as the structuring principle for an entire novel was innovative and groundbreaking, as it redefined the possibilities of narrative point of view. The passage cites Duke Ellington's compositions, which were constructed with individual musicians' unique "voices" in mind, as an example of how Morrison has achieved a similar effect in Jazz. The passage also notes that by simulating the style of a genius of music while exhibiting Morrison's own linguistic virtuosity, Jazz serves to redefine the very possibilities of narrative point of view. These details suggest that other African American writers may have also used musical genres or techniques in their work, similar to Morrison's use of jazz in Jazz.

So, the passage provides information that most helps to answer question (E), which asks about the characteristic of Jazz that is also present in the work of some other African American writers.
