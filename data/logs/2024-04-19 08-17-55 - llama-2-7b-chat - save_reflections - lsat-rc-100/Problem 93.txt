## Get Reflection:
 Explanation:
The passage suggests that digital publishing will eliminate the need for several traditional publishing practices, including:

* Warehousing printed books (Option A)
* Shipping books to retail stores (Option C)
* Displaying books in retail stores (Option E)

However, it does not mention the need for book covers to be designed (Option B) or for unsold books to be returned to publishers (Option D). Therefore, the correct answer is (B) Having book covers designed.
