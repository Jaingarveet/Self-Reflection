## Get Reflection:
  My apologies, you are correct. Here is my revised answer:

Action: Answer("B")

The critics who raise the objection discussed in the second paragraph of the passage would most likely agree with option B: The historical and social circumstances of a culture can play an important role in the development of that culture's values. The passage suggests that the methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are value-laden and may not take into account the unique perspectives and values of the culture being studied. This implies that understanding a culture's values requires considering the historical and social circumstances that gave rise to those values, rather than relying solely on Western scientific methods. Therefore, option B is the best answer.
