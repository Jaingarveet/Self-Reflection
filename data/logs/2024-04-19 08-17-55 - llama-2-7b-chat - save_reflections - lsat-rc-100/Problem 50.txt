## Get Reflection:
  Great, let's break down the answer:

The passage suggests that the author would agree with statement D, "The invention of the telephone has had a greater democratizing influence on society than has the invention of the printing press."

The author argues that technology has a democratizing influence by making it more accessible to a wider range of people, leading to a narrowing of the gap in benefits accruing to different groups. The passage specifically highlights the expansion of access to printed texts and personal computing power as examples of this democratizing influence.

Therefore, the author would likely agree that the invention of the telephone, which has made communication more accessible to a wider range of people, has had a greater democratizing influence on society than the invention of the printing press, which initially made written materials more accessible to a smaller group of people.

So, the correct answer is (D) The invention of the telephone has had a greater democratizing influence on society than has the invention of the printing press.
