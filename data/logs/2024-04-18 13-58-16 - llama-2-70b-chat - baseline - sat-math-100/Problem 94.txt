Topic: Math
Question: $$\sqrt{9 x^{2}}$$If $x>0$, which of the following is equivalent to the given expression?
Choices:
  A: $3 x$
  B: $3 x^{2}$
  C: $18 x$
  D: $18 x^{4}$
## Assistant 2:
  Thought: 
The square root of $9 x^{2}$ can be simplified by factoring out a $3$ from the radicand.
If $x>0$, then we can take the square root of both sides of the equation $x^{2} = 9 x^{2}$ to get $x = 3 x$.
Therefore, the given expression is equivalent to $3 x$.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
