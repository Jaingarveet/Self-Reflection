## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:
Topic: Geography
Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: \begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}\hline$x$ & $f(x)$ \\\hline0 & 3 \\\hline2 & 1 \\\hline4 & 0 \\\hline5 & -2 \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}The function $f$ is defined by a polynomial. Some values of $x$ and $f(x)$ are shown in the table above. Which of the following must be a factor of $f(x)$ ?
Choices:
  A: $x-2$
  B: $x-3$
  C: $x-4$
  D: $x-5$
## Assistant 2:
  Thought:
The given table shows some values of $x$ and $f(x)$.
We can observe that $f(x)$ is a polynomial function of degree $3$.
The factors of a polynomial of degree $3$ are binomials of the form $(x-a)$, where $a$ is a constant.
We can compare the given choices with the values in the table to find the factor of $f(x)$.
Action: Answer("B")

Explanation:
The value of $f(x)$ at $x=2$ is $1$, which means that $f(x)$ must have a factor of $x-2$.
Therefore, the correct answer is $B$.
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
