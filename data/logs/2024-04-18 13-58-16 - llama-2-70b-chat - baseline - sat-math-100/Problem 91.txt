## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.

Question: \begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|c||c|c|c|c|}\hline$n$ & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\\hline$f(n)$ & -2 & 1 & 4 & 7 \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}The table above shows some values of the linear function $f$. Which of the following defines $f$ ?
Choices:
  A: $f(n)=n-3$
  B: $f(n)=2 n-4$
  C: $f(n)=3 n-5$
  D: $f(n)=4 n-6$
## Assistant 2:
  Thought: 
Let's analyze the given choices.

A: $f(n)=n-3$
This choice doesn't match the given values. For example, $f(1)=1-3=-2$, which is not equal to the given value of $f(1)=-2$.

B: $f(n)=2 n-4$
This choice also doesn't match the given values. For example, $f(1)=2(1)-4=-2$, which is not equal to the given value of $f(1)=-2$.

C: $f(n)=3 n-5$
This choice matches the given values. For example, $f(1)=3(1)-5=-2$, which is equal to the given value of $f(1)=-2$.

D: $f(n)=4 n-6$
This choice doesn't match the given values. For example, $f(1)=4(1)-6=-2$, which is not equal to the given value of $f(1)=-2$.

Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
