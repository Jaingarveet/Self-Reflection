Question: A television with a price of $\$ 300$ is to be purchased with an initial payment of $\$ 60$ and weekly payments of $\$ 30$. Which of the following equations can be used to find the number of weekly payments, $w$, required to complete the purchase, assuming there are no taxes or fees?
Choices:
  A: $300=30 w-60$
  B: $300=30 w$
  C: $300=30 w+60$
  D: $300=60 w-30$
## Assistant 2:
  Thought: 
The equation for the total cost of the television is $300$.
The weekly payment is $\$ 30$, and the initial payment is $\$ 60$.
The total amount paid so far can be represented as $30w$, where $w$ is the number of weekly payments.
The amount remaining to be paid can be represented as $300 - 30w$.
The equation that can be used to find the number of weekly payments required to complete the purchase is:
$300 = 30w - 60$
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
