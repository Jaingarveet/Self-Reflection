Question: $$C=\frac{5}{9}(F-32)$$The equation above shows how a temperature $F$, measured in degrees Fahrenheit, relates to a temperature $C$, measured in degrees Celsius. Based on the equation, which of the following must be true?I. A temperature increase of 1 degree Fahrenheit is equivalent to a temperature increase of $\frac{5}{9}$ degree Celsius.II. A temperature increase of 1 degree Celsius is equivalent to a temperature increase of 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit.III. A temperature increase of $\frac{5}{9}$ degree Fahrenheit is equivalent to a temperature increase of 1 degree Celsius.
Choices:
  A: I only
  B: II only
  C: III only
  D: I and II only
## Assistant 2:
  Let's analyze the given equation:

$$C = \frac{5}{9}(F - 32)$$

We can rearrange this equation as follows:

$$F = \frac{9}{5}C + 32$$

Now, let's consider the three options:

I. A temperature increase of 1 degree Fahrenheit is equivalent to a temperature increase of $\frac{5}{9}$ degree Celsius.

This statement is false. If the temperature increases by 1 degree Fahrenheit, the temperature in Celsius will increase by $\frac{9}{5}$ degrees.

II. A temperature increase of 1 degree Celsius is equivalent to a temperature increase of 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit.

This statement is true. We can see this by rearranging the equation:

$$F = \frac{9}{5}C + 32$$

If the temperature in Celsius increases by 1 degree, the temperature in Fahrenheit will increase by $\frac{9}{5}$ degrees, which is approximately 1.8 degrees.

III. A temperature increase of $\frac{5}{9}$ degree Fahrenheit is equivalent to a temperature increase of 1 degree Celsius.

This statement is false. If the temperature increases by $\frac{5}{9}$ degrees Fahrenheit, the temperature in Celsius will increase by less than 1 degree.

Therefore, the correct answer is option B: II only. A temperature increase of 1 degree Celsius is equivalent to a temperature increase of 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit.
