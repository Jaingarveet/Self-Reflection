## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Question: $$h=3 a+28.6$$A pediatrician uses the model above to estimate the height $h$ of a boy, in inches, in terms of the boy's age $a$, in years, between the ages of 2 and 5. Based on the model, what is the estimated increase, in inches, of a boy's height each year?
Choices:
  A: 3
  B: $\quad 5.7$
  C: 9.5
  D: 14.3
## Assistant 2:
  Thought: 
We are given the equation h = 3a + 28.6, which represents a linear function.
To find the estimated increase in height each year, we need to find the slope of the line.
The slope of a line is calculated as (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1), where (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are two points on the line.
In this case, we can choose any two values for a, such as a = 2 and a = 3.
Substituting a = 2 into the equation, we get h = 3(2) + 28.6 = 3(3) + 28.6 = 100.8.
Substituting a = 3 into the equation, we get h = 3(3) + 28.6 = 108.6.
Now we can calculate the slope:
Slope = (108.6 - 100.8) / (3 - 2) = 7.8 / 1 = 7.8
The slope tells us that the boy's height increases by 7.8 inches each year.
Action: Answer("B")
