Question: A retail company has 50 large stores located in different areas throughout a state. A researcher for the company believes that employee job satisfaction varies greatly from store to store. Which of the following sampling methods is most appropriate to estimate the proportion of all employees of the company who are satisfied with their job?
Choices:
  A: Selecting one of the 50 stores at random and then surveying each employee at that store
  B: Selecting 10 employees from each store at random and then surveying each employee selected
  C: Surveying the 25 highest-paid employees and the 25 lowest-paid employees
  D: Creating a website on which employees can express their opinions and then using the first 50 responses
## Assistant 2:
  Thought:
To estimate the proportion of all employees of the company who are satisfied with their job, we need to select a sample that is representative of the population of all employees.

Option A is not appropriate because it would only give us information about the employees at one store, and we cannot generalize the results to the entire population.

Option B is also not appropriate because it would only give us information about 10 employees from each store, which is not enough to accurately represent the population.

Option C is not appropriate because it would only give us information about the 25 highest-paid employees and the 25 lowest-paid employees, which is not representative of the entire population.

Option D is not appropriate because it is not a random sample, and we cannot generalize the results to the entire population.

Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
