Question: The sum of three numbers is 855 . One of the numbers, $x$, is $50 \%$ more than the sum of the other two numbers. What is the value of $x$ ?
Choices:
  A: 570
  B: 513
  C: 214
  D: 155
## Assistant 2:
  Let's call the other two numbers y and z. Since the sum of the three numbers is 855, we can write:

x + y + z = 855

We know that x is 50% more than the sum of y and z, so we can write:

x = 1.5(y + z)

Substituting this expression for x into the first equation, we get:

1.5(y + z) + y + z = 855

Combine like terms:

2y + 2z = 855

Subtract z from both sides:

2y = 740

Divide both sides by 2:

y = 370

Now we can find z:

z = 855 - 2y
= 855 - 2(370)
= 855 - 740
= 115

So, x = 1.5(y + z) = 1.5(370 + 115) = 1.5(485) = 727.5

Therefore, the value of x is between 727 and 728 (since x is an integer). The closest answer is:

Action: Answer("B")
