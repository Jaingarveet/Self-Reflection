Question: The equation $\frac{24 x^{2}+25 x-47}{a x-2}=-8 x-3-\frac{53}{a x-2}$ is true for all values of $x \neq \frac{2}{a}$, where $a$ is a constant.What is the value of $a$ ?
Choices:
  A: -16
  B: -3
  C: 3
  D: 16
## Assistant 2:
  Thought: 
We can set the numerator and the denominator of the fraction on the left-hand side equal to each other and simplify.

$$\frac{24 x^{2} + 25 x - 47}{ax - 2} = -8x - 3 - \frac{53}{ax - 2}$$

$$24x^2 + 25x - 47 = -8ax - 24 - 53x + 106$$

Now, we can equate the coefficients of the variables:

$$24 = -8a$$

$$25 = 53$$

We can solve for $a$ from the first equation:

$$a = \frac{24}{-8} = -3$$

So, the value of $a$ is $-3$.

Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
