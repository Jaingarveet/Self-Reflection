## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Context: $$.\begin{aligned}.& S(P)=\frac{1}{2} P+40 \\.& D(P)=220-P.\end{aligned}.$$.The quantity of a product supplied and the quantity of the product demanded in an economic market are functions of the price of the product. The functions above are the estimated supply and demand functions for a certain product. The function $S(P)$ gives the quantity of the product supplied to the market when the price is $P$ dollars, and the function $D(P)$ gives the quantity of the product demanded by the market when the price is $P$ dollars.
Question: How will the quantity of the product supplied to the market change if the price of the product is increased by $\$ 10$ ?
Choices:
  A: The quantity supplied will decrease by 5 units.
  B: The quantity supplied will increase by 5 units.
  C: The quantity supplied will increase by 10 units.
  D: The quantity supplied will increase by 50 units.
## Assistant 2:
  Let's analyze the supply function $S(P)$:

$S(P) = \frac{1}{2} P + 40$

We can see that the coefficient of $P$ is $\frac{1}{2}$, so a $10$ dollar increase in the price ($P + 10$) will result in a $\frac{10}{2} = 5$ unit increase in the quantity supplied.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
