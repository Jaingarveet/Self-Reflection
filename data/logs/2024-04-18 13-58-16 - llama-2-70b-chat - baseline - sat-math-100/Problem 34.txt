Question: A book was on sale for $40 \%$ off its original price. If the sale price of the book was $\$ 18.00$, what was the original price of the book? (Assume there is no sales tax.)
Choices:
  A: $\$ 7.20$
  B: $\$ 10.80$
  C: $\$ 30.00$
  D: $\$ 45.00$
## Assistant 2:
  Let X be the original price of the book.

The sale price of the book is $40\%$ off its original price, so we can write:

Sale price = X - (40/100)X

Sale price = X - 0.4X

Sale price = 0.6X

Given that the sale price is $\$ 18.00$, we can set up the equation:

0.6X = 18

To solve for X, we can divide both sides by 0.6:

X = 18/0.6

X = 30

So, the original price of the book was $\$ 30.00$.

Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
