Question: $$\begin{aligned}1 \text { decagram } & =10 \text { grams } \\1,000 \text { milligrams } & =1 \text { gram }\end{aligned}$$A hospital stores one type of medicine in 2-decagram containers. Based on the information given in the box above, how many 1-milligram doses are there in one 2-decagram container?
Choices:
  A: $\quad 0.002$
  B: $\quad 200$
  C: $\quad 2,000$
  D: 20,000
## Assistant 2:
  Thought: 
We can start by converting 2 decagrams to grams. 
2 decagrams = 2 x 10 grams = 20 grams

Next, we can convert 20 grams to milligrams.
20 grams = 20,000 milligrams

Now, we can divide the number of milligrams by 1 milligram per dose to find the number of doses.
20,000 milligrams รท 1 milligram per dose = 20,000 doses

Therefore, there are 20,000 1-milligram doses in one 2-decagram container.

Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
