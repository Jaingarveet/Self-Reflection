## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:

  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: $$\sqrt{4 x}=x-3$$What are all values of $x$ that satisfy the given equation?I. 1II. 9
Choices:
  A: I only
  B: II only
  C: I and II
  D: Neither I nor II
## Assistant 2:
  Thought: 
The given equation is a square root equation, and we need to find the values of x that satisfy it.
We can start by squaring both sides of the equation to get rid of the square root:
$$4x = (x - 3)^2$$
Expanding the right-hand side of the equation, we get:
$$4x = x^2 - 6x + 9$$
Moving all terms to the left-hand side and simplifying, we get:
$$3x = 9$$
Dividing both sides by 3, we get:
$$x = 3$$
So, the only value of x that satisfies the given equation is x = 3.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: B
