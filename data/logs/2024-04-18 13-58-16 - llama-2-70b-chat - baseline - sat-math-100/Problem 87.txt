## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Topic: Math
Question: In the $x y$-plane, the parabola with equation $y=(x-11)^{2}$ intersects the line with equation $y=25$ at two points, $A$ and $B$. What is the length of $\overline{A B}$ ?
Choices:
  A: 10
  B: 12
  C: 14
  D: 16
## Assistant 2:
  Thought: 
The parabola and the line intersect at two points, so we can find the x-coordinates of these points by setting the equations equal to each other and solving for x.

$y = (x - 11)^2$
$y = 25$

$ (x - 11)^2 = 25$
$x - 11 = ±√25$
$x = 11 ± √25$

Now we can find the distance between the two points:

$AB = √((11 + √25) - (11 - √25))^2$
$AB = √(2(11 + √25)) = 2(11 + √25)$

$AB = 2(11) + 2(√25) = 22 + 2√25$

$AB = 22 + 2(5) = 22 + 10 = 32$

Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
