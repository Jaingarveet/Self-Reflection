## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: \begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}\hline\multicolumn{7}{|c|}{Lengths of Fish (in inches)} \\\hline8 & 9 & 9 & 9 & 10 & 10 & 11 \\\hline11 & 12 & 12 & 12 & 12 & 13 & 13 \\\hline13 & 14 & 14 & 15 & 15 & 16 & 24 \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}The table above lists the lengths, to the nearest inch, of a random sample of 21 brown bullhead fish. The outlier measurement of 24 inches is an error. Of the mean, median, and range of the values listed, which will change the most if the 24 -inch measurement is removed from the data?
Choices:
  A: Mean
  B: Median
  C: Range
  D: They will all change by the same amount.
## Assistant 2:
  The range is the difference between the largest and smallest values in a dataset. Since the 24-inch measurement is the largest value in the dataset, removing it would decrease the range.
The mean and median are both affected by outliers, but the mean is more sensitive to outliers than the median. The mean is calculated by summing all the values and dividing by the number of values, so the 24-inch measurement significantly affects the mean.
On the other hand, the median is the middle value in the dataset when the values are arranged in order, and it is less affected by outliers.
Therefore, the answer is:
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
