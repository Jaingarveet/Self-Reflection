Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: $$y=-(x-3)^{2}+a$$In the equation above, $a$ is a constant. The graph of the equation in the $x y$-plane is a parabola. Which of the following is true about the parabola?
Choices:
  A: Its minimum occurs at $(-3, a)$.
  B: Its minimum occurs at $(3, a)$.
  C: Its maximum occurs at $(-3, a)$.
  D: Its maximum occurs at $(3, a)$.
## Assistant 2:
  Thought: 
The given equation is a quadratic equation in the form $y = a x^2 + b x + c$.
The parabola opens upwards, meaning that the minimum value of $y$ occurs at $x = -3$.
The value of $y$ at $x = -3$ is $a$.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
