## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Context: \begin{center}.\begin{tabular}{|l|c|}.\hline.\multicolumn{1}{|c|}{Planet} & Acceleration due to gravity $\left(\frac{\mathrm{m}}{\mathrm{sec}^{2}}\right)$ \\.\hline\hline.Mercury & 3.6 \\.\hline.Venus & 8.9 \\.\hline.Earth & 9.8 \\.\hline.Mars & 3.8 \\.\hline.Jupiter & 26.0 \\.\hline.Saturn & 11.1 \\.\hline.Uranus & 10.7 \\.\hline.Neptune & 14.1 \\.\hline.\end{tabular}.\end{center}.The chart above shows approximations of the acceleration due to gravity in meters per.second squared $\left(\frac{\mathrm{m}}{\sec ^{2}}\right)$ for the eight planets in our solar system. The weight of an object on a given planet can be found by using the formula $W=m g$, where $W$ is the weight of the object measured in newtons, $m$ is the mass of the object measured in kilograms, and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity on the planet measured in $\frac{m}{\sec ^{2}}$
Question: An object on Earth has a weight of 150 newtons. On which planet would the same object have an approximate weight of 170 newtons?
Choices:
  A: Venus
  B: Saturn
  C: Uranus
  D: Neptune
## Assistant 2:
  Thought: 
The weight of an object on a planet is given by the formula $W=mg$, where $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity on the planet.
The chart provides the acceleration due to gravity for each planet.
The object has a weight of 150 newtons on Earth, so we need to find the planet where the object would have an approximate weight of 170 newtons.
We can do this by finding the planet with an acceleration due to gravity that would result in a weight of 170 newtons for the object.
Action: Answer("C") 

Explanation: 
The acceleration due to gravity on Uranus is 10.7 $\frac{m}{\sec ^{2}}$.
Using the formula $W=mg$, we can calculate the weight of the object on Uranus:
$W=m(10.7)$
$W=150(10.7)$
$W=1605$
The weight of the object on Uranus is approximately 1605 newtons, which is closest to the desired weight of 170 newtons.
Therefore, the object would have an approximate weight of 170 newtons on Uranus.
