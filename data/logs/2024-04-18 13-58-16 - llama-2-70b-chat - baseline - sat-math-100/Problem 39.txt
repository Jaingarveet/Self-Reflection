## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: $$\begin{aligned}& -3 x+y=6 \\& a x+2 y=4\end{aligned}$$In the system of equations above, $a$ is a constant. For which of the following values of $a$ does the system have no solution?
Choices:
  A: -6
  B: -3
  C: 3
  D: 6
## Assistant 2:
  Thought: 
We can solve the system of equations by substituting the second equation into the first equation.

$$-3x + y = 6$$

$$a x + 2y = 4$$

Substituting the second equation into the first equation, we get:

$$-3x + y = 6$$

$$a x + 2y = 4$$

$$-3x + y - 2y = 6 - 4$$

$$-3x = 2$$

Now, we can solve for x:

$$x = \frac{2}{-3}$$

Since $x$ must be a real number, we can see that $a = -6$ is the only value that makes the system have no solution.

Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
