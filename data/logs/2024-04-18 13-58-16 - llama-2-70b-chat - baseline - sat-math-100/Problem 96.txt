Question: A rectangle was altered by increasing its length by 10 percent and decreasing its width by $p$ percent. If these alterations decreased the area of the rectangle by 12 percent, what is the value of $p$ ?
Choices:
  A: 12
  B: 15
  C: 20
  D: 22
## Assistant 2:
  Let's call the original length and width of the rectangle $L$ and $W$, respectively.
The area of the original rectangle is $A = LW$.

After the alterations, the length is $L + 10\%$ of $L$ = $1.1L$ and the width is $W - p\%$ of $W$ = $0.9W$ (since $p$ is a percentage, we can write it as $0.9W$).

The area of the modified rectangle is $A' = (1.1L)(0.9W) = 0.99LW$.

The question states that the area of the modified rectangle is 12% less than the area of the original rectangle, so we can set up the equation:

$0.99LW = 0.88A$

Now, we can solve for $p$. We know that $L$ and $W$ are positive, so we can divide both sides of the equation by $LW$ to get:

$0.99 = 0.88\frac{LW}{LW}$

$1 = 0.88\frac{L}{W}$

$W = 0.88L$

Now, we can substitute this expression for $W$ into the equation for the area of the modified rectangle:

$A' = (1.1L)(0.88L) = 0.99L^2$

We know that the area of the modified rectangle is 12% less than the area of the original rectangle, so we can set up the equation:

$0.99L^2 = 0.88A$

Now, we can solve for $L$:

$L = \sqrt{\frac{0.88A}{0.99}} = \sqrt{\frac{A}{1.1}}$

Now, we can substitute this expression for $L$ into the equation for $W$:

$W = 0.88L = 0.88\sqrt{\frac{A}{1.1}}$

Now, we can find $p$ by substituting $W$ into the equation for $A'$:

$A' = (1.1L)(0.88\sqrt{\frac{A}{1.1}}) = 0.99L^2$

$0.99L^2 = 0.88A$

$L^2 = \frac{0.88A}{0.99}$

$L = \sqrt{\frac{0.88A}{0.99}}$

$W = 0.88L = 0.88\sqrt{\frac{0.88A}{0.99}}$

$p = \frac{W}{L} = \frac{0.88\sqrt{\frac{0.88A}{0.99}}}{\sqrt{\frac{0.88A}{0.99}}} = 0.88$

Therefore, the value of $p$ is $0.88$, which corresponds to choice $B$.
