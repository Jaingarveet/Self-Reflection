Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: If $\frac{5}{x}=\frac{15}{x+20}$, what is the value of $\frac{x}{5} ?$
Choices:
  A: 10
  B: 5
  C: 2
  D: $\frac{1}{2}$
## Assistant 2:
  Thought: 
We can start by rewriting the given equation as:

$$\frac{5}{x} = \frac{15}{x+20}$$

We can then multiply both sides by x to eliminate the fraction:

$$5 = 15(x+20)$$

Expanding the right-hand side, we get:

$$5 = 15x + 300$$

Subtracting 300 from both sides gives us:

$$-295 = 15x$$

Dividing both sides by 15 gives us:

$$-\frac{295}{15} = x$$

Therefore, the value of $\frac{x}{5}$ is $-\frac{295}{15}$.

Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
