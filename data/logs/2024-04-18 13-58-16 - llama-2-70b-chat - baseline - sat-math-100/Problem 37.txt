## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Topic: Math
Question: The volume of right circular cylinder A is 22 cubic centimeters. What is the volume, in cubic centimeters, of a right circular cylinder with twice the radius and half the height of cylinder A?
Choices:
  A: 11
  B: 22
  C: 44
  D: 66
## Assistant 2:
  Thought: 
The volume of a right circular cylinder is given by V = πr^2h, where r is the radius and h is the height.
If the radius of the new cylinder is twice the radius of cylinder A, then it is 2r.
If the height of the new cylinder is half the height of cylinder A, then it is h/2.
The volume of the new cylinder is π(2r)^2(h/2) = 4πr^2h/2 = 2V.
Since the volume of cylinder A is 22 cubic centimeters, the volume of the new cylinder is 2(22) = 44 cubic centimeters.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
