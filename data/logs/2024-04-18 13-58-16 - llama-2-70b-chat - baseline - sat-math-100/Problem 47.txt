## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Topic: Math
Question: In air, the speed of sound $S$, in meters per second, is a linear function of the air temperature $T$, in degrees Celsius, and is given by $S(T)=0.6 T+331.4$. Which of the following statements is the best interpretation of the number 331.4 in this context?
Choices:
  A: The speed of sound, in meters per second, at $0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$
  B: The speed of sound, in meters per second, at $0.6^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$
  C: The increase in the speed of sound, in meters per second, that corresponds to an increase of $1^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$
  D: The increase in the speed of sound, in meters per second, that corresponds to an increase of $0.6^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$
## Assistant 2:
  The given equation, $S(T)=0.6T+331.4$, implies that the speed of sound $S$ increases by 0.6 meters per second for every degree Celsius increase in temperature $T$.

Therefore, the best interpretation of the number 331.4 in this context is:

C: The increase in the speed of sound, in meters per second, that corresponds to an increase of $1^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.

This means that for every degree Celsius increase in temperature, the speed of sound increases by 331.4 meters per second.

Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
