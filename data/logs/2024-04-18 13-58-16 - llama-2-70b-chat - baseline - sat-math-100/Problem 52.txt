Question: Katarina is a botanist studying the production of pears by two types of pear trees. She noticed that Type A trees produced 20 percent more pears than Type B trees did. Based on Katarina's observation, if the Type A trees produced 144 pears, how many pears did the Type B trees produce?
Choices:
  A: 115
  B: 120
  C: 124
  D: 173
## Assistant 2:
  Let's X be the number of pears produced by Type B trees.
Since Type A trees produced 20% more pears than Type B trees, Type A trees produced (1 + 0.2) * X = 1.2X pears.
We know that Type A trees produced 144 pears, so we can set up the equation:
1.2X = 144

Now, divide both sides by 1.2 to solve for X:
X = 115

Therefore, the answer is A: 115.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: B
