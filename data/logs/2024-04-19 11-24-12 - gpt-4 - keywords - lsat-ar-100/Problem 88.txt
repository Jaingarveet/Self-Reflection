Context: Exactly eight books—F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O—are placed on a bookcase with exactly three shelves—the top shelf, the middle shelf, and the bottom shelf. At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.
Question: It is fully determined which of the shelves each of the books is placed on if which one of the following is true?

## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The conditions state that I is on the middle shelf, K is higher than F, and O is higher than L. F and M are on the same shelf. If L and F are on the same shelf (Choice C), then they must be on the bottom shelf because O has to be higher than L and K has to be higher than F. This would mean that the remaining books (G, H) would be on the top shelf. This arrangement satisfies all conditions and fully determines the placement of all books.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
