## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Given that T is performed fifth and F is performed sixth, it means that R cannot be performed after T. Therefore, R must be performed before T. Also, at least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F. Since F is performed after T, it means that R must be performed before T and at least two compositions must be performed between R and F. Therefore, S cannot be performed fourth or seventh because P is performed before S and at least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O. Therefore, S must be performed either third or second.
