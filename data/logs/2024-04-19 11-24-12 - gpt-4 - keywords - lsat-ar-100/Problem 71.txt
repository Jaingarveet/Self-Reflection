Context: A software company employs exactly seven sales representatives—Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall—to work in its three sales zones—Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3. Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
From the conditions, we know that either Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1, and either Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2. This means that Tiao cannot be in Zone 3 because he must be in either Zone 1 or Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same zone, and Stuckey and Udall work in the same zone. Since Udall could be in Zone 2, Stuckey also could be in Zone 2. Therefore, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, and Udall cannot all be in Zone 3. The only option left that does not include Tiao, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, or Udall is Kim and Mahr.
Action: Answer("A")
