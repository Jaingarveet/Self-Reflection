## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Given the constraints, if Julio and Kevin both lead morning sessions, then:
- Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's, so Olivia's session cannot be on Wednesday or Thursday morning. 
- Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day, so if Kevin is leading a morning session, Rebecca must be leading an afternoon session on the same day. 
- Nessa must lead an afternoon session, which can be any day.
- Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day, so if Lan's session is on Wednesday morning, Olivia's session cannot be on Wednesday.
