## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Given that T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R, and O is performed immediately after T, it means that T and O are performed consecutively. If O is performed first, then T would be performed second, and F would be performed third. If O is performed fifth, then T would be performed sixth, and F would be performed seventh. Therefore, F must be performed either third or seventh.
