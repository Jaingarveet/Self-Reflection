Context: An administrator must assign parking spaces to six new employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young. Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.

## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The rules state that Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa, Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, and Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Also, Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4. If Young is assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, then Souza must be in a lower-numbered parking space. Given these rules, let's evaluate the options:
A: Togowa is assigned parking space #1. This could be true as there is no rule that Togowa cannot be assigned parking space #1.
B: Young is assigned parking space #2. This cannot be true because Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young and Robertson can only be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
C: Robertson is assigned parking space #3. This cannot be true because Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa and Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Therefore, Young cannot be assigned parking space #4 (the only higher number than #3) because Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
D: Souza is assigned parking space #3. This cannot be true because Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza and the only higher numbers than #3 are #4, #5, and #6. But Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza and Young cannot be assigned parking space #5 or #6 because Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young and Robertson can only be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
E: Vaughn is assigned parking space #4. This could be true as there is no rule that Vaughn cannot be assigned parking space #4.
