Context: A government needs to assign new ambassadors to Venezuela, Yemen, and Zambia. The candidates for these ambassadorships are Jaramillo, Kayne, Landon, Novetzke, and Ong. One ambassador will be assigned to each country, and no ambassador will be assigned to more than one country. The assignment of the ambassadors must meet the following constraints: Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships. If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne. If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen. If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
Question: Which one of the following CANNOT be true?
Choices:
  A: Jaramillo is assigned as ambassador to Zambia.
  B: Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Zambia.
  C: Novetzke is assigned as ambassador to Zambia.
  D: Landon is not assigned to an ambassadorship.
  E: Ong is not assigned to an ambassadorship.

## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The constraints are as follows:
1. Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
2. If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne.
3. If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
4. If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
From these constraints, we can deduce that:
- If Jaramillo is assigned as ambassador to Zambia, then Kayne must also be assigned to an ambassadorship. But since Landon is the only one who can be assigned to Zambia, Jaramillo cannot be assigned as ambassador to Zambia. So, choice A cannot be true.
- Kayne, Novetzke, and Ong can be assigned to any ambassadorship, as long as the constraints are met.
- Landon can only be assigned to Zambia, but it's not mandatory that he be assigned to an ambassadorship.
- There's no constraint that Ong must be assigned to an ambassadorship.
Action: Answer("A")
