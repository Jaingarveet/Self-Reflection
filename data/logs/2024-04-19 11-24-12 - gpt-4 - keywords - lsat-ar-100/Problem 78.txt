Context: Of the eight students—George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert—in a seminar, exactly six will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.

Choices:
  A: Helen gives a report on Wednesday.
  B: Nina gives a report on Monday.

## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Given that George, Nina, and Robert give reports on different days, and considering the conditions:
- George can only report on Tuesday.
- Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
- If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
From these conditions, we can deduce that:
- Nina cannot give a report on Monday because Helen and Irving would have to report on Tuesday, but George is already reporting on Tuesday.
- Nina cannot give a report on Tuesday because Helen and Irving would have to report on Wednesday, but there are only two slots on Wednesday and one is already taken by Robert.
- Therefore, Nina must give a report on Wednesday.
- This means Helen cannot give a report on Wednesday because Nina is giving a report on Wednesday and Helen can only report the day after Nina.
- Robert cannot give a report on Wednesday because Nina is giving a report on Wednesday.
- Therefore, Robert must give a report on Monday.
- This leaves Tuesday for George and Wednesday for Nina.
- Olivia can give a report on Monday because neither George, Nina, nor Robert are giving a report on Monday.
