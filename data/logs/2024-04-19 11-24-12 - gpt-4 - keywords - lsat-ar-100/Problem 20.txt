## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Kyle and Lenore are not giving reports. 
George can only give a report on Tuesday. 
Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report, so they can only report in the morning. 
If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. 
Looking at the choices:
A: Helen, George, and Nina - This is not possible because if Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports. But Helen is already giving a report on Monday.
B: Irving, Robert, and Helen - This is possible. Irving can give a report on Monday, Robert (who can only give a report in the morning) can give a report on Tuesday, and Helen can give a report on Wednesday.
C: Nina, Helen, and Olivia - This is not possible because if Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports. But Helen is already giving a report on Monday.
D: Olivia, Robert, and Irving - This is not possible because Robert and Olivia can only give reports in the morning, and they are both scheduled to give reports on the same day (Tuesday).
E: Robert, George, and Helen - This is not possible because Robert and George are both scheduled to give reports on the same day (Tuesday).
Action: Answer("B")
