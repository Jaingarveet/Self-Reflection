## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The conditions state that I is placed on the middle shelf, K is placed on a higher shelf than F, O is placed on a higher shelf than L, and F is placed on the same shelf as M. If G is placed on the top shelf, then K must also be on the top shelf because it must be placed on a higher shelf than F. Therefore, F and M cannot be on the top shelf and must be on the middle or bottom shelf. Since more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, F and M are likely on the bottom shelf. This leaves H, I, L, and O for the middle shelf. However, since O must be on a higher shelf than L, L must be on the middle shelf and O on the top shelf. This leaves H, I, and L for the middle shelf.
Action: Answer("C")
