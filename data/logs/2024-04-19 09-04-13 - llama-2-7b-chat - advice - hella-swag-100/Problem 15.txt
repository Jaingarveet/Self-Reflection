## Assistant 2:
  Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I realize now that I made an assumption without considering the context of the situation. I mistakenly assumed that the text was describing a different activity altogether.

To answer this question correctly, I will read the text carefully and consider the context in which it is being used. The text states that steaming hot water is poured over the lemons in the glasses, which suggests that the activity is related to making lemonade.

The most likely completion to the text is (B) are filled with ice and poured afterwards. This is because the text mentions that the glasses are stirred with a stirring rod, which suggests that the liquid inside the glasses is being mixed. Additionally, the text does not mention any other ingredients being added to the glasses, which further supports the conclusion that the activity is related to making lemonade.

In conclusion, I will double-check my answer to ensure accuracy and avoid making assumptions. I will use critical thinking skills to evaluate the context and make an informed decision.

Answer: (B) are filled with ice and poured afterwards.
