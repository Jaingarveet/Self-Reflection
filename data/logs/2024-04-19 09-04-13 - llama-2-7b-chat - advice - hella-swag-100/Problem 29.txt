[header] How to get rid of chilblains [title] Use calamine lotion or witch hazel for itching. [step] Chilblains can be extremely itchy, but scratching them may result in an infection. To ease the itchiness of chilblains without scratching, apply some calamine lotion or witch hazel onto your chilblains using a cotton ball.
Choices:
  A: This will leave your chilblains feeling soft and soothing. [substeps] Do not use witch hazel or similar products if you have sensitive skin.

[header] How to get rid of chilblains [title] Use calamine lotion or witch hazel for itching.

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and then I reflected on the problem, my solution, and the correct answer. I realized that I should have chosen option B: Let it sit on the itchy rash for up to 5 minutes. This option is the most likely completion to the text because it suggests allowing the calamine lotion or witch hazel to sit on the itchy rash for a longer period of time to help ease the itchiness without scratching. This is a common sense approach to dealing with chilblains, as scratching can lead to infection.

Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
