Choices:
A: rakes up dirt over the mulch.
B: uses a leaf blower to blow it around.
C: brings another wheelbarrow full of mulch and rakes it out over the lawn.
D: scoops out a puddle with the rake.

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I realized that I misunderstood the situation. The correct answer is (C) brings another wheelbarrow full of mulch and rakes it out over the lawn. This is because the text states that the man rakes the mulch out over the ground, which implies that he is adding more mulch to the lawn, not removing dirt or blowing it around.
