Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.

Context: Traditional "talk" therapy, in which a patient with a psychological disorder discusses it with a trained therapist, produces chemical changes in the brain. These changes seem to correspond to improvements in certain aspects of the patient's behavior. Thus, physicians will eventually be able to treat such patients as effectively through pharmacological intervention in the brain's neurochemistry as through the lengthy intermediary of traditional "talk" methods.
Question: Which one of the following is an assumption on which the argumoot depends?
Choices:
  A: All neurochemical changes produce corresponding psychological changes.
  B: improvements in a patient's behavior produced by "talk" therapy occur only through chemical changes in the brain's neurochemistry.
  C: Talk therapy has not been effective at bringing about psychological change.
  D: If chemical changes in the brain's neurochemistry correspond to improvemeots in patient behavior, then psychology and neuroscience will eventually be indistinguishable.
  E: Direct intervention in the brain's neurochemistry is likely to become a less expensive way of treating psychological disorders than is "talk" therapy.
## Assistant 2:
To determine the assumption the argument depends on, let's analyze the argument step-by-step:
1. The argument states that traditional "talk" therapy produces chemical changes in the brain that correspond to improvements in the patient's behavior.
2. Based on this, the argument concludes that physicians will eventually be able to treat patients as effectively through direct pharmacological intervention in the brain's neurochemistry as through traditional "talk" methods.
3. For this conclusion to be valid, the argument must assume that the chemical changes in the brain are the sole cause of the improvements in the patient's behavior. In other words, it assumes that there are no other factors involved in the effectiveness of "talk" therapy besides the chemical changes.
4. This assumption is best captured by choice B: "improvements in a patient's behavior produced by 'talk' therapy occur only through chemical changes in the brain's neurochemistry."
The other choices do not accurately represent assumptions necessary for the argument's conclusion:
- Choice A is too broad and not specifically related to the argument.
- Choice C is contrary to the information provided in the argument.
- Choices D and E are not assumptions but rather potential consequences or implications of the argument.
Therefore, the assumption the argument depends on is choice B.
Action: Answer("B")
