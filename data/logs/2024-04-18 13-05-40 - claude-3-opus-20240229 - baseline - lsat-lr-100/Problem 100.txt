## User 2:
Topic: Law
Context: In some jurisdictions, lawmakers have instituted sentencing guidelines that mandate a penalty for theft that is identical to the one they have mandated for bribery. Hence, lawmakers in those jurisdictions evidently consider the harm resulting from theft to be equal to the harm resulting from bribery.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would most strengthen the argument?
Choices:
  A: In general, lawmakers mandate penalties for crimes that are proportional to the harm they believe to result from those crimes.
  B: In most cases, lawmakers assess the level of harm resulting from an act in determining whether to make that act illegal.
  C: Often, in response to the unusually great harm resulting from a particular instance of a crime, lawmakers will mandate an increased penalty for that crime.
  D: In most cases, a victim of theft is harmed no more than a victim of bribery is harmed.
  E: If lawmakers mandate penalties for crimes that are proportional to the harm resulting from those crimes, crime in those lawmakers' jurisdictions will be effectively deterred.
## Assistant 2:
To strengthen the argument that lawmakers consider the harm from theft equal to the harm from bribery, we need to find a choice that supports the link between the penalties mandated and the lawmakers' assessment of the resulting harm.
A: This choice directly supports the argument by stating that lawmakers generally mandate penalties proportional to the harm they believe results from the crimes. If theft and bribery have the same penalty, lawmakers likely consider their harms to be equal.
B: While this choice suggests lawmakers consider harm in criminalizing acts, it doesn't directly address the relationship between penalties and perceived harm.
C: This choice weakens the argument by providing an alternative explanation for the equal penalties - that they could be a response to a particular instance rather than a general assessment of the crimes' harms.
D: The relative harm to victims doesn't necessarily reflect lawmakers' views on the overall societal harm of the crimes.
E: The deterrent effect of proportional penalties is not directly relevant to whether lawmakers view theft and bribery as equally harmful.
Therefore, choice A most strengthens the argument.
Action: Answer("A")
