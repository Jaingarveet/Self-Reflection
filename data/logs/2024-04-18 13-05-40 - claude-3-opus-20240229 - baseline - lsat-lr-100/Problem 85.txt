Context: Ditalgame Corporation's computer video games are subject to widespread illegal copying. To combat this piracy, Ditalgame will begin using a new copy protection feature on its games. Ditalgame's president predicts a substantial increase in sales of the company's games once the new copy protection feature is implemented.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, provides the most support for the president's prediction?
Choices:
  A: Ditalgame has spent millions of dollars developing the new copy protection feature , and the company can recoup these costs only if its sales increase substantially.
  B: Over the last several years, the market for computer games has grown steadily, but Ditalgame's share of that market has shrunk considerably.
  C: The copy protection feature causes a copied game to be playable just long enough for most people to come to enjoy it so much that they decide they have to have it.
  D: Game Review Monthly, the most commonly read magazine among people who frequently copy computer games, generally gives favorable reviews to Ditalgame games.
  E: Computer games produced by Ditalgame are copied more frequently than computer games
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. Ditalgame is introducing a new copy protection feature to combat piracy of its video games.
2. The president predicts this will lead to a substantial increase in sales.
3. We need to find the choice that best supports this prediction.
Now, let's examine each choice:
A: The fact that Ditalgame spent a lot on developing the feature and needs to recoup costs doesn't necessarily mean the feature will be effective and lead to increased sales.
B: The shrinking market share suggests Ditalgame has other issues beyond piracy. This doesn't support the prediction that the anti-piracy feature alone will boost sales substantially.
C: If the copy protection allows people to play the game long enough to enjoy it and want to buy it, this could indeed lead to increased sales as the president predicts.
D: Favorable reviews might encourage more piracy, but don't directly support the prediction that the copy protection will boost sales.
E: This choice is incomplete, but even if Ditalgame games are copied more than others, it doesn't mean the new feature will necessarily reduce that and increase sales.
Choice C provides the most direct support for the president's prediction. If the copy protection itself encourages people to buy the game after trying it, sales are likely to increase.
Action: Answer("C")
