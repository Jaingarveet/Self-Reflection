## User 2:
Topic: Law
Context: Mike: Tom did not tell me that I could use his computer, but it would not be wrong for me to use it anyway. Last week Tom used Mary's bicycle even though she had not told him he could use it.
Question: Which one of the following principles, if valid, would most help to justif Y Mike's reasoning?
Choices:
  A: Using the possessions of others without their permission is not always theft.
  B: Generally one should tell the truth, but there are cases in which it is permissible not to.
  C: If people have used your property without your permission, it is not wrong for you to use their property without their permission.
  D: It is permissible to treat people in a way that is siruilar to the way in which they have treated others.
  E: Using another person's property is wrong if the person is harmed by that use.
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. Mike is justifying using Tom's computer without permission by pointing out that Tom used Mary's bicycle without her permission.
2. Mike seems to be arguing that because Tom used someone else's property without permission, it's okay for Mike to do the same to Tom.
3. This reasoning doesn't rely on whether using others' property without permission is always theft (A), or on the permissibility of lying (B).
4. Mike's reasoning also doesn't depend on whether Tom was harmed by Mike's use of his computer (E).
5. Mike's argument is essentially: Tom did X to Mary, so it's okay for me to do X to Tom. This is a form of reciprocity or "tit for tat" reasoning.
6. Choice (C) directly captures this idea - if someone has used your property without permission, it's okay to do the same to them. 
7. Choice (D) also fits, but is broader - it justifies treating people similarly to how they've treated others in general, not just in terms of property use.
8. Between (C) and (D), (C) is more specific to Mike's reasoning about property use.
Therefore, the principle that would most justify Mike's reasoning is (C) - if people have used your property without permission, it's not wrong for you to use their property without permission.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: D
