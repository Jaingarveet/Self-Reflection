Topic: Law
Context: Hana said she was not going to invite her brothers to her birthday party. However, among the gifts Hana received at her party was a recording in which she had expressed an interest. Since her brothers had planned to give her that recording, at least some of Hana's brothers must have been among the guests at Hana's birthday party after all.
Question: A reasoning error in the argument is that the argument
Choices:
  A: disregards the possibility that a change of mind might be justified by a change in circumstances
  B: treats the fact of someone's presence at a given event as a guarantee that that person had a legitimate reason to be at that event
  C: uses a term that is intrinsically evaluative as though that term was purely descriptive
  D: fails to establish that something true of some people is true of only those people
  E: overlooks the possibility that a person's interest in one kind of thing is compatible with that person's interest in a different kind of thing
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The argument concludes that some of Hana's brothers must have been at her party because she received a gift (a recording) that her brothers had planned to give her.
2. However, the argument doesn't consider the possibility that someone else could have given Hana the same recording, knowing her interest in it. 
3. Just because Hana received a gift she wanted, which her brothers had planned to give her, doesn't necessarily mean her brothers were the ones who gave it to her.
4. The argument assumes that only Hana's brothers could have given her that specific gift, without establishing that this is indeed the case.
5. Therefore, the reasoning error in the argument is that it fails to establish that something true of some people (Hana's brothers planning to give her a specific gift) is true of only those people (that only Hana's brothers could have given her that gift).
