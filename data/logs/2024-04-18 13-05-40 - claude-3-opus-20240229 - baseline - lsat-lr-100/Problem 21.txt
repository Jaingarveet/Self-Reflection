Context: Editorial: The structure of the present school calendar was established to satisfy the requirements of early-twentieth-century agricultural life. In those days, farmers needed their children to have long breaks during which they could remain at home and help with the harvest. The contemporary school year is thus made up of periods of study interspersed with long breaks. But agricultural life no longer occupies most of our citizens, so we can now make changes that serve the interests of children. Therefore, long breaks should be removed from the school calendar.
Question: Which one of the following is an assumption on which the editorial's argument depends?
Choices:
  A: During long breaks children have a tendency to forget what they have learned.
  B: Children of farmers need to continue observing a school calendar made up of periods of study interspersed with long breaks.
  C: Long breaks in the school calendar should be replaced with breaks that are no longer than workers' average vacations.
  D: A change in the present school calendar that shortened breaks would serve the interests of agricultural life.
  E: A school calendar made up of periods of study without long breaks would serve the interests of children more than a school calendar with long breaks.
## Assistant 2:
Let's analyze the argument step-by-step:
1. The current school calendar was designed to accommodate early 20th-century agricultural life, where children needed long breaks to help with the harvest.
2. Most citizens are no longer involved in agricultural life.
3. Therefore, changes can be made to the school calendar to serve children's interests, and long breaks should be removed.
The argument concludes that long breaks should be removed because they are no longer needed to accommodate agricultural life. However, for this conclusion to be valid, there must be an unstated assumption that a school calendar without long breaks would better serve children's interests.
Without this assumption, the argument would not make sense. Just because long breaks are no longer needed for agricultural reasons does not necessarily mean they should be removed. There could be other reasons to keep them.
Therefore, the argument depends on the assumption that a school calendar without long breaks would serve children's interests more than the current calendar with long breaks.
