Context: Counselor: Many people assume that personal conflicts are inevitable, but that assumption is just not so. Personal conflicts arise primarily because people are being irrational. For instance, people often find it easier to ascribe bad qualities to a person than good ones-even when there is more evidence of the latter. If someone suspects that a friend is unreliable, for example, a single instance may turn this suspicion into a feeling of certainty, whereas a belief that someone is reliable is normally built up only after many years of personal interaction.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main conclusion drawn in the argument?
Choices:
  A: Many people assume that personal conflicts are inevitable.
  B: Even when there is more evidence of good qualities than of bad ones, people find it easier to ascribe bad qualities than good ones.
  C: It is irrational to allow a single instance to turn one's suspicion that a friend is unreliable into a feeling of certainty.
  D: Personal conflicts are not inevitable.
  E: Unlike a suspicion that a friend is unreliable, a belief that someone is reliable is normally built up only after many years of personal interaction.
## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1. The passage begins by stating that many people assume personal conflicts are inevitable, but that this assumption is incorrect. 
2. It then provides the main reason why the author believes this assumption is wrong: personal conflicts arise primarily because people are being irrational.
3. The author provides an example of this irrationality: people often find it easier to ascribe bad qualities to a person than good ones, even when there is more evidence of the good qualities.
4. The passage concludes by contrasting how easily a suspicion of unreliability can turn into certainty, versus how long it takes to build up a belief in someone's reliability.
5. Looking at the answer choices, D most accurately captures the main conclusion of the argument: "Personal conflicts are not inevitable." This directly contradicts the assumption stated at the beginning of the passage.
The other choices are either supporting points or examples used in the argument, but do not express the main conclusion.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
