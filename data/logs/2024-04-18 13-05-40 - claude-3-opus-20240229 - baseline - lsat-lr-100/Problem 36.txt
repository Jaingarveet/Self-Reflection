Context: Native speakers perceive sentences of their own language as sequences of separate words. But this perception is an illusion. This is shown by the fact that travelers who do not know a local language hear an unintelligible, uninterrupted stream of sound, not sentences with distinct words.
Question: Which one of the following is an assumption on which the argument depends?
Choices:
  A: It is impossible to understand sentences if they are in fact uninterrupted streams of sound.
  B: Those who do not know a language cannot hear the way speech in that language actually sounds.
  C: People pay less close attention to the way their own language sounds than they do to the way an unfamiliar language sounds.
  D: Accomplished non-native speakers of a language do not perceive sentences as streams of sound.
  E: Native speakers' perceptions of their own language are not more accurate than are the perceptions of persons who do not know that language.
## Assistant 2:
To determine the assumption the argument depends on, let's analyze the argument:
1. The argument states that native speakers perceive sentences in their language as separate words, but this is an illusion.
2. The evidence provided is that travelers who don't know the local language hear an uninterrupted stream of sound instead of distinct words.
The argument assumes that the travelers' perception of the unfamiliar language as an uninterrupted stream of sound is more accurate than the native speakers' perception of distinct words.
Looking at the answer choices:
A. The argument doesn't assume that understanding is impossible if sentences are uninterrupted streams of sound.
B. The argument doesn't make any assumptions about the actual sound of the language, only the perception of it.
C. The argument doesn't compare the attention paid by native speakers and non-native speakers.
D. The argument doesn't discuss the perceptions of accomplished non-native speakers.
E. This choice matches the assumption that the travelers' perception is more accurate than the native speakers' perception.
Therefore, the assumption the argument depends on is:
Action: Answer("E")
## Result:
Agent Answer: E
Correct Answer: E
Score: 1
