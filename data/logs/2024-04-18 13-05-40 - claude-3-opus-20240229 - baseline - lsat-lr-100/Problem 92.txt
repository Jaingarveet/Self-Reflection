Context: Museum curakor: Our ancient Egyptian collection includes an earthenware hippopotamus that resembles a child's roy. It was discovered in a tomb, upside down, with its legs broken off. We know that the ancient Egyptians believed the dead had to wage eternal war with beasts. Breaking the legs off a representation of an animal was thought to help a deceased person in this war. We conclude that, far from being a roy, this hippopotamus was a religious object.
Question: Which one of the following is an assumption required by the curator's argument?
Choices:
  A: The tomb in which the hippopotamus was found was not the tomb of a child.
  B: Earthenware figures were never used as children's roys in ancient Egypt.
  C: The tomb in which the hippopotamus was found was not reentered from the time of burial until archaeologists opened it.
  D: The hippopotamus' legs were not broken 1hrough some natural occurrence after it was placed in the tomb.
  E: The hippopotamus was originally placed upside down in the tomb.
## Assistant 2:
To determine the assumption required by the curator's argument, let's analyze the argument step-by-step:
1. The ancient Egyptian earthenware hippopotamus was found in a tomb, upside down, with its legs broken off.
2. Ancient Egyptians believed the dead had to wage eternal war with beasts.
3. Breaking the legs off a representation of an animal was thought to help a deceased person in this war.
4. The curator concludes that the hippopotamus was a religious object, not a toy.
For the curator's conclusion to be valid, there must be an assumption that the hippopotamus' legs were intentionally broken off for religious purposes, and not broken by some other means.
Looking at the answer choices:
A. The age of the tomb's occupant is not relevant to the argument.
B. This is not necessary for the argument, as the hippopotamus could have been a religious object even if some earthenware figures were used as toys.
C. The tomb being undisturbed until archaeologists opened it is not required for the argument.
D. This assumption is required. If the legs were broken through a natural occurrence after placement in the tomb, it would undermine the curator's conclusion that it was a religious object.
E. The hippopotamus being originally placed upside down is not necessary for the argument.
Therefore, the assumption required by the curator's argument is:
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
