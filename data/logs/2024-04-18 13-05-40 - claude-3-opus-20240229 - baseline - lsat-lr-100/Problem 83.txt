Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Context: Although Pluto has an atmosphere and is much larger than any asteroid, Pluto is not a true planet. Pluto formed in orbit around the planet Neptune and was then ejected from orbit around Neptune when Triton, Neptune's largest moon, was captured by Neptune's gravity.
Question: The conclusion of the argument follows logically if which one of the following is assumed?
Choices:
  A: No celestial body can simultaneously be a moon and a planet.
  B: Not all celestial bodies that have an atmosphere and orbit the sun are true planets.
  C: If Pluto had not been ejected from its orbit around Neptune, Pluto would not have its current orbit around the sun and would still be a moon.
  D: The size of a celestial body in orbit around the sun is not relevant to determining whether or not it is a true planet.
  E: For a celestial body to be a true planet it must have formed in orbit around the sun exclusively.
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The argument concludes that Pluto is not a true planet.
2. The reasons given are:
   - Pluto has an atmosphere and is larger than any asteroid.
   - Pluto formed in orbit around Neptune.
   - Pluto was ejected from orbit around Neptune when Triton was captured by Neptune's gravity.
3. For the conclusion to follow logically, there must be an unstated assumption that connects these reasons to the conclusion.
4. Looking at the choices:
   - A is not assumed; the argument doesn't mention moons.
   - B is implied by the argument, but it's not necessary for the conclusion.
   - C is not directly relevant to the conclusion.
   - D is not assumed; the argument mentions Pluto's size.
   - E provides the missing link: if a true planet must have formed in orbit around the sun, and Pluto formed in orbit around Neptune, then Pluto is not a true planet.
Therefore, E is the assumption that makes the conclusion follow logically.
Action: Answer("E")
## Result:
Agent Answer: E
Correct Answer: E
