Context: Carl is clearly an incompetent detective. He has solved a smaller percentage of the cases assigned to him in the last 3 years—only 1 out of 25—than any other detective on the police force.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument above?
Choices:
  A: Because the police chief regards Carl as the most capable detective, she assigns him only the most difficult cases, ones that others have failed to solve.
  B: Before he became a detective, Carl was a neighborhood police officer and was highly respected by the residents of the neighborhood he patrolled.
  C: Detectives on the police force on which Carl serves are provided with extensive resources, including the use of a large computer database, to help them solve crimes.
  D: Carl was previously a detective in a police department in another city, and in the 4 years he spent there, he solved only 1 out of 30 crimes.
  E: Many of the officers in the police department in which Carl serves were hired or promoted within the last 5 years.
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The argument concludes that Carl is an incompetent detective based on his low case-solving rate compared to other detectives.
2. To weaken this argument, we need to find a choice that provides an alternative explanation for Carl's low case-solving rate, one that doesn't imply his incompetence.
3. Choice A states that Carl is assigned only the most difficult cases that others have failed to solve. This provides a strong alternative explanation for his low success rate - it's not due to his incompetence, but rather the inherent difficulty of the cases he's given.
4. Choices B, C, D, and E provide additional information about Carl's background or the police department, but none of them directly address or undermine the reason given for Carl's perceived incompetence.
Therefore, choice A is the best answer as it most seriously weakens the argument by offering a compelling alternative explanation for Carl's low case-solving rate.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
