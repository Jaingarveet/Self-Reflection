Context: A computer game publisher has recently released its latest adventure game. The game's inventive puzzles and compelling plot induce even casual players to become preoccupied with completing it. The game can be purchased from retail outlets or rented for two-day intervals. The publisher offers a rebate equal to the cost of one rental for renters who go on to purchase the game, saving them a significant portion of the purchase price. Since the rate of sales now meets expectations and rentals are exceeding expectations, the publisher predicts that soon sales of the game will also exceed expectations.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to justify the publisher's prediction?
Choices:
  A: The game can be purchased directly from the publisher as well as from retailers.
  B: It takes several weeks for most players to complete the game.
  C: The publisher's games are among the most popular computer games on the market.
  D: Most people who complete the game do not play it extensively afterward.
  E: Some people buy and complete the game and then give it away to a friend.
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The publisher predicts that sales of the game will soon exceed expectations. This is based on the current sales meeting expectations and rentals exceeding expectations.
2. For this prediction to be justified, there needs to be a connection between the high rental numbers and future sales. In other words, something about the high rental numbers should suggest that sales will increase.
3. Let's look at each choice:
   A: The availability of direct purchase from the publisher doesn't seem to have a clear connection to the prediction.
   
   B: If it takes several weeks to complete the game, this could explain why people are renting it first - to see if they like it enough to buy it. This supports the idea that high rentals could lead to high sales.
   
   C: The general popularity of the publisher's games doesn't directly connect the high rental numbers to future sales of this specific game.
   
   D: If people don't replay the game much after completing it, this doesn't seem to affect whether they would buy it after renting it.
   
   E: People giving the game away after buying and completing it doesn't seem to connect rentals to future sales.
4. Choice B provides the most direct link between the high rental numbers and potential future sales. If it takes several weeks to complete the game, people may be renting it to try it out before deciding to buy it. This helps justify the prediction that high rentals will lead to high sales.
Action: Answer("B")
