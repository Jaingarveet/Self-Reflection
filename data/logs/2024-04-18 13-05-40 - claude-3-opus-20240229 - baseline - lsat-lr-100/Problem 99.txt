Topic: Law
Context: Professor: It has been argued that freedom of thought is a precondition for intellectual progress, because freedom of thought allows thinkers to pursue their ideas, regardless of whom these ideas offend, in whatever direction they lead. However, it is clear that one must mine the full implications of interrelated ideas to make intellectual progress, and for this, thinkers need intellectual discipline. Therefore, this argument for freedom of thought fails.
Question: The conclusion drawn by the professor follows logically if which one of the following is assumed?
Choices:
  A: Thinkers who limit their line of thought to a particular orthodoxy are hindered in their intellectual progress.
  B: Thinkers can mine the full implications of interrelated ideas only in the context of a society that values intellectual progress.
  C: In societies that protect freedom of thought, thinkers invariably lack intellectual discipline.
  D: Freedom of thought engenders creativity, which aids the discovery of truth.
  E: Without intellectual discipline, thinkers can have no freedom of thought.
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The professor's argument is that freedom of thought alone is not sufficient for intellectual progress. Intellectual discipline is also necessary to fully explore interrelated ideas.
2. The conclusion is that the argument for freedom of thought (as a precondition for intellectual progress) fails.
3. For this conclusion to logically follow, there must be an assumption that links the premise (intellectual discipline is necessary) to the conclusion (the argument for freedom of thought fails).
4. Looking at the choices:
   A. This doesn't directly link to the conclusion about freedom of thought.
   B. This is not directly relevant to the argument.
   C. If this were assumed, it would logically connect the premise to the conclusion. If freedom of thought necessarily leads to a lack of intellectual discipline, and intellectual discipline is necessary for progress, then freedom of thought would not be sufficient for progress.
   D. This goes against the professor's argument.
   E. This is the reverse of what the professor is arguing.
Therefore, the assumption that makes the professor's conclusion follow logically is C: In societies that protect freedom of thought, thinkers invariably lack intellectual discipline.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
