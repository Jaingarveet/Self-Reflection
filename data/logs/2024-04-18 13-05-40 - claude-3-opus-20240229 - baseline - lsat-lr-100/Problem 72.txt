## System:
You are an expert in Law.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")

Topic: Law
Context: Seemingly inconsequential changes in sea temperature due to global warming eventually result in declines in fish and seabird populations. A rise of just two degrees prevents the vertical mixing of seawater from different strata. This restricts the availability of upwelling nutrients to phytoplankton. Since zooplankton, which feed upon phytoplankton, feed the rest of the food chain, the declines are inevitable.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes the role played in the argument by the statement that zooplankton feed upon phytoplankton?
Choices:
  A: It is a hypothesis supported by the fact that phytoplankton feed on upwelling nutrients.
  B: It is intended to provide an example of the ways in which the vertical mixing of seawater affects feeding habits.
  C: It helps show how global temperature changes affect larger sea animals indirectly.
  D: It is offered as one reason that global warming must be curtailed.
  E: It is offered in support of the idea that global warming poses a threat to all organisms.
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The main argument is that small changes in sea temperature due to global warming lead to declines in fish and seabird populations.
2. The argument states that a rise of two degrees prevents vertical mixing of seawater, which restricts the availability of nutrients to phytoplankton.
3. The statement "zooplankton, which feed upon phytoplankton, feed the rest of the food chain" is a key link in the argument. It shows how the effects on phytoplankton can impact the larger animals in the food chain.
4. This statement is not a hypothesis (A), an example (B), a reason to curtail global warming (D), or a broad threat to all organisms (E).
5. Rather, it is a crucial piece of information that connects the effects on phytoplankton to the declines in fish and seabird populations mentioned in the main argument.
Therefore, the best answer is (C): The statement helps show how global temperature changes affect larger sea animals indirectly, by impacting their food source down the food chain.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
