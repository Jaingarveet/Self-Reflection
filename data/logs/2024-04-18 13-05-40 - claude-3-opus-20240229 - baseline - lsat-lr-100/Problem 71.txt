Context: Curator: Our museum displays only twentieth-century works, which are either on loan from private collectors or in the museum's permanent collection. Prints of all of the latter works are available in the museum store. The museum store also sells prints of some works that are not part of the museum's permanent collection, such as Hopper's Nighthawks.
Question: If the curator's statements are true, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Every print in the museum store is of a work that is either on loan to the museum from a private collector or part of the museum's permanent collection.
  B: Every print that is sold in the museum store is a copy of a twentieth-century work.
  C: There are prints in the museum store of every work that is displayed in the museum and not on loan from a private collector.
  D: Hopper's Nighthawks is both a twentieth-century work and a work on loan to the museum from a private collector.
  E: Hopper's Nighthawks is not displayed in the museum.
## Assistant 2:
Let's break this down step-by-step:
1. The museum displays only twentieth-century works.
2. These works are either on loan from private collectors or in the museum's permanent collection.
3. Prints of all works in the museum's permanent collection are available in the museum store.
4. The museum store also sells prints of some works that are not part of the museum's permanent collection, such as Hopper's Nighthawks.
Now, let's examine each choice:
A: This is not necessarily true, as the store sells prints of some works not in the museum's collection, like Nighthawks.
B: This must be true. The museum only displays twentieth-century works, and the store sells prints of works from the museum's collection and some that aren't, but all are from the twentieth century.
C: This is not necessarily true. The store sells prints of all works in the permanent collection, but not necessarily all works on display (some may be on loan).
D: We can't determine this. Nighthawks is not part of the museum's permanent collection, but it's unclear if it's on loan to the museum or not displayed at all.
E: We can't determine this either. The fact that the store sells prints of Nighthawks doesn't necessarily mean it's not displayed in the museum.
Therefore, the only statement that must be true is B.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: C
