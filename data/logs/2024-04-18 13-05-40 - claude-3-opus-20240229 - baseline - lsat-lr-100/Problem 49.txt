Topic: Law
Context: A smoker trying to quit is more likely to succeed if his or her doctor greatly exaggerates the dangers of smoking. Similar strategies can be used to break other habits. But since such strategies involve deception, individuals cannot easily adopt them unless a doctor or some other third party provides the warning.
Question: Which one of the following is an assumption on which the argument depends?
Choices:
  A: People tend to believe whatever doctors tell them.
  B: Most of the techniques that help people quit smoking can also help people break other habits.
  C: The more the relevant danger is exaggerated, the more likely one is to break one's habit.
  D: People generally do not find it easy to deceive themselves.
  E: A doctor is justified in deceiving a patient whenever doing so is likely to make the patient healthier.
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The argument states that a smoker is more likely to quit if their doctor greatly exaggerates the dangers of smoking.
2. It then suggests that similar strategies involving deception can be used to break other habits.
3. However, it states that individuals cannot easily adopt these strategies themselves unless a doctor or some other third party provides the warning.
4. This implies that people cannot easily deceive themselves, which is why they need a third party to provide the deceptive warning.
5. Among the given choices, option D directly states this assumption: "People generally do not find it easy to deceive themselves."
The other choices, while possibly true, are not necessary assumptions for the argument to hold. The argument does not rely on people believing everything doctors say, the techniques for quitting smoking being applicable to other habits, the degree of exaggeration affecting the likelihood of breaking a habit, or the justification of a doctor's deception.
Action: Answer("D")
