Topic: Law
Context: Editorial: This political party has repeatedly expressed the view that increasing spending on education is a worthy goal. On other occasions, however, the same party has claimed that the government should not increase spending on education. So this party's policy is clearly inconsistent.
Question: The argument in the editorial depends on assuming which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: It is inconsistent for a legislator both to claim that increasing spending on education is a worthy goal and to vote against increasing spending on education.
  B: A consistent course of action in educational policy is usually the course of action that will reduce spending on education in the long run.
  C: Even if a goal is a morally good one, one should not necessarily try to achieve it.
  D: A consistent political policy does not hold that an action that comprises a worthy goal should not be performed.
  E: Members of one political party never have inconsistent views on how to best approach a political issue.
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The editorial claims that the political party's policy is inconsistent because:
   a) They say increasing education spending is a worthy goal.
   b) They also say the government should not increase education spending.
2. The editorial assumes that holding both these views is inconsistent.
3. Let's look at each answer choice:
   A) This matches the editorial's assumption. If it's inconsistent for a legislator to claim education spending is worthy but vote against it, then it would also be inconsistent for a party to do the same.
   B) The editorial doesn't discuss long-term spending reduction. This isn't assumed.
   C) The editorial doesn't discuss whether worthy goals should always be pursued. Not assumed.
   D) This is the opposite of what the editorial assumes. The editorial assumes a consistent policy would not say a worthy goal should not be pursued.
   E) The editorial doesn't assume party members never disagree. It just claims this specific inconsistency is a problem.
4. Therefore, choice A best represents the assumption the editorial's argument depends on.
Action: Answer("A")

Agent Answer: A
