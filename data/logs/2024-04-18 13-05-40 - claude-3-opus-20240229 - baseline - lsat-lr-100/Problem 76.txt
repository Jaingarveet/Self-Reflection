Topic: Law
Context: A diet whose protein comes from fish is much healthier than one whose protein comes from red meat. Yet if everyone were to adopt this healthier diet, most of the marine species on which it is based would become extinct, making it impossible. Hence, we should not recommend the universal adoption of such a diet.
Question: The reasoning in which one of the following arguments most closely resembles that in the argument above?
Choices:
  A: Some studies have provided evidence that taking a vitamin E supplement every day reduces one's risk of heart attack. However, it has not been conclusively established that vitamin E supplements are safe for all people. So we should not recommend that everyone take vitamin E supplements every day.
  B: Governments are within their rights to tax tobacco heavily and spend this tax revenue on education. If these taxes become too high, however, people might smoke less, thereby reducing the funding thus generated for education. So such taxes might eventually have to be supplemented by other sources of revenue.
  C: A consumer is better off when limiting purchases to what he or she truly needs and saving or investing any remaining income. If everyone did this, however, the economy would be thrown into a severe recession, thereby making saving and investing impossible for most people. So we should not recommend this spending pattern to everyone.
  D: If legislators spent less time campaigning, they would have more time to do the jobs for which they were elected. But if they did not spend so much time campaigning, they probably would not get reelected. So it is not surprising that legislators spend so much time campaigning.
  E: If we restrict land development in wilderness areas, we help preserve many of the species that now inhabit these areas. But we also thereby reduce the proliferation of the admittedly smaller number of species, such as deer, that flourish in developed areas. So it is not always clear which areas should be designated as wilderness areas.
## Assistant 2:
Let's analyze the reasoning in the original argument:
1. A diet based on fish protein is healthier than one based on red meat protein.
2. However, if everyone adopted this diet, the marine species it relies on would go extinct.
3. Therefore, we should not recommend universal adoption of this diet.
The key points are:
- Something is beneficial on an individual level
- But if everyone did it, it would lead to unsustainable consequences
- So we shouldn't recommend it for everyone
Now let's look at the answer choices:
A: This is about potential safety issues with vitamin E supplements, not about unsustainable consequences if everyone took them. The reasoning is different.
B: This is about potential consequences of high tobacco taxes, but not in the same way as the original argument. It's not about everyone doing something unsustainable.
C: This closely matches the original reasoning:
- Limiting purchases to needs and saving/investing the rest is good for an individual
- But if everyone did this, it would severely damage the economy, making saving/investing impossible
- So we shouldn't recommend this spending pattern to everyone
The reasoning is very similar to the original argument.
D: This is about legislators campaigning vs doing their jobs, not about unsustainable consequences if everyone did something. The reasoning is different.
E: This is weighing pros and cons of restricting wilderness development, not about unsustainable consequences if everyone did something. The reasoning is different.
Therefore, choice C has the reasoning that most closely resembles the original argument.
Action: Answer("C")
