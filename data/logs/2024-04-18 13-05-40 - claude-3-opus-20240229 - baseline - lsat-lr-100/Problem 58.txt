Context: In 1963, a young macaque monkey was observed venturing into a hot spring to retrieve food which had fallen in. Soon, other macaques began to enter the spring, and over a few years this behavior was adopted by the entire troop. Prior to 1963, no macaques had ever been observed in the hot spring; by 1990, the troop was regularly spending time there during the winters. Thus, these macaques are able to adopt and pass on new patterns of social behavior, and are not complete captives of their genetic heritage.
Question: Which one of the following is an assumption required by the argument above?
Choices:
  A: Mutations in the genetic heritage of a certain variety of macaques can occur over a time span as short as a few years or decades.
  B: New patterns of behavior that emerge in macaque populations over the course of a few years or decades are not necessarily genetically predetermined.
  C: Only when behaviors become typical among an animal population can we conclude that a genetic alteration has occurred in that variety or species.
  D: The social behaviors of macaques are completely independent of their genetic heritage.
  E: The macaques' new pattern of behavior will persist over several generations.
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The passage states that the macaques adopted a new behavior (entering the hot spring) over a few years, and this behavior spread throughout the troop.
2. The passage concludes that because of this, the macaques "are able to adopt and pass on new patterns of social behavior, and are not complete captives of their genetic heritage."
3. For this conclusion to be valid, it must be assumed that the new behavior was not predetermined by the macaques' genes. If it were genetically predetermined, the conclusion that they are not "complete captives of their genetic heritage" would not follow.
4. Looking at the answer choices:
   A. The argument does not require this assumption about genetic mutations.
   B. This directly states the necessary assumption.
   C. The argument does not make any claims about what is necessary to conclude a genetic alteration has occurred.
   D. The argument does not require assuming complete independence from genetic heritage, only that they are not "complete captives" of it.
   E. The argument does not require assuming the behavior will persist for generations, only that it was not genetically predetermined when it emerged.
5. Therefore, B is the best answer, as it states the assumption required by the argument.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
