## System:
You are an expert in Law.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Context: Astronomers have found new evidence that the number of galaxies in the universe is not 10 billion, as previously believed, but 50 billion. This discovery will have an important effect on theories about how galaxies are formed. But even though astronomers now believe 40 billion more galaxies exist, many astronomers' estimates of the universe's total mass remain virtually unchanged.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, does most to explain why the estimates remain virtually unchanged?
Choices:
  A: The mass of galaxies is thought to make up only a tiny percentage of the universe's total mass.
  B: The overwhelming majority of galaxies are so far from Earth that their mass can be only roughly estimated.
  C: The number of galaxies that astronomers believe exist tends to grow as the instruments used to detect galaxies become more sophisticated.
  D: Theories about how galaxies are formed are rarely affected by estimates of the universe's total mass.
  E: There is no consensus among astronomers on the proper procedures for estimating the universe's total mass.
## Assistant 2:
To determine which choice best explains why the estimates of the universe's total mass remain virtually unchanged despite the discovery of 40 billion more galaxies, let's consider each option:
A: If the mass of galaxies makes up only a tiny percentage of the universe's total mass, then even a large increase in the number of galaxies would have little impact on the total mass estimate. This directly explains the situation.
B: The difficulty in estimating the mass of distant galaxies doesn't explain why the total mass estimate is unchanged. Even rough estimates of the additional galaxies' mass would likely increase the total.
C: The increasing number of galaxies discovered with better instruments is tangential to the question of why the mass estimate is unchanged despite the discovery of more galaxies.
D: The relationship between galaxy formation theories and the universe's total mass is not directly relevant to explaining the unchanged mass estimate.
E: A lack of consensus on estimating the universe's total mass doesn't explain why the estimate is unchanged despite finding more galaxies.
Choice A provides the most direct explanation: if galaxies comprise only a small fraction of the universe's mass, then even a large increase in the number of galaxies would have minimal impact on the total mass estimate.
