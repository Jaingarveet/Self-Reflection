Topic: Law
Context: Ethicist: Only when we know a lot about the events that led to an action are we justified in praising or blaming a person for that actionâ€”as we sometimes are. We must therefore reject Tolstoy's rash claim that if we knew a lot about the events leading up to any action, we would cease to regard that action as freely performed.
Question: Which one of the following, if assumed, enables the conclusion of the ethicist's argument to be properly drawn?
Choices:
  A: People should not be regarded as subject to praise or blame for actions that were caused by conditions beyond their control.
  B: Whether an act is one for which the person doing it is genuinely responsible is not determined by how much information others possess about that act.
  C: We can be justified in praising or blaming a person for an action only when we regard that action as freely performed.
  D: The responsibility a person bears for an action is not a matter of degree; however, our inclination to blame or praise whoever performed the action varies with the amount of information available.
  E: If we do not know much about the events leading up to any given action, we will regard that action as freely performed.
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The ethicist argues that we can be justified in praising or blaming a person for an action only when we know a lot about the events that led to that action.
2. The ethicist rejects Tolstoy's claim that if we knew a lot about the events leading up to any action, we would cease to regard that action as freely performed.
3. For the ethicist's conclusion to follow, there must be a connection between knowing about the events leading to an action and regarding that action as freely performed.
Looking at the choices:
A. This is related but doesn't directly connect knowledge of events to regarding an action as free.
B. This contradicts the ethicist's argument by suggesting information doesn't determine responsibility.
C. This directly connects regarding an action as freely performed to being justified in praising or blaming for it. If we assume this, the ethicist's conclusion follows.
D. This is about degrees of praise/blame, not about the connection between knowledge and regarding an action as free.
E. This is the opposite of what the ethicist argues.
Therefore, assuming choice C allows the ethicist's conclusion to be properly drawn.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
