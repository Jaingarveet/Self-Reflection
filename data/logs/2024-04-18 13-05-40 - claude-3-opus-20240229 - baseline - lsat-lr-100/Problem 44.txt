Topic: Law
Context: Most people who shop for groceries no more than three times a month buy prepared frozen dinners regularly. In Hallstown most people shop for groceries no more than three times a month. Therefore, in Hallstown most people buy prepared frozen dinners regularly.
Question: Which one of the following arguments has a flawed pattern of reasoning most like the flawed reasoning in the argument above?
Choices:
  A: It is clear that most drivers in West Ansland are safe drivers since there are very few driving accidents in West Ansland and most accidents there are not serious.
  B: It is clear that John cannot drive, since he does not own a car and no one in his family who does not own a car can drive.
  C: It is clear that Fernando's friends usually drive to school, since all of his friends can drive and all of his friends go to school.
  D: It is clear that most people in Highland County drive sedans, since most people who commute to work drive sedans and most people in Highland County commute to work.
  E: It is clear that most of Janine's friends are good drivers, since she accepts rides only from good drivers and she accepts rides from most of her friends.
## Assistant 2:
Let's analyze the flawed reasoning in the original argument:
- It assumes that because most people who shop infrequently buy frozen dinners, and most people in Hallstown shop infrequently, then most people in Hallstown must buy frozen dinners.
- This is flawed because it doesn't consider that the people in Hallstown who shop infrequently might have different buying habits than the general population who shop infrequently.
Looking at the answer choices:
A) This doesn't make the same flawed assumption. It directly links few accidents to safe drivers.
B) This makes a similar flawed assumption - that because John's family members who don't own cars can't drive, and John doesn't own a car, then John can't drive. This doesn't consider that John might be an exception.
C) This doesn't make the same type of assumption. It logically links being able to drive and going to school to driving to school.
D) This makes the same type of flawed assumption - that because most commuters drive sedans, and most people in Highland County commute, then most people in Highland County must drive sedans. It fails to consider that Highland County commuters might differ from commuters in general.
E) This doesn't make the same assumption. It directly links Janine only accepting rides from good drivers to most of her friends being good drivers.
Therefore, the answer that best matches the flawed reasoning is D.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
