Topic: Law
Context: The number of tornadoes recorded annually in North America has more than tripled since 1953. Yet meteorologists insist that the climatic factors affecting the creation of tornadoes are unchanged.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to resolve the apparent discrepancy described above?
Choices:
  A: The factors affecting the creation of tornadoes were not well known to meteorologists before 1953.
  B: The intensity of the average tornado is greater now than it was in 1953.
  C: The number of tornadoes recorded annually has increased only slightly in the last five years.
  D: The amount of property damage done by tornadoes has grown substantially since 1953.
  E: Many more citizens are helping authorities detect tornadoes now than in 1953.
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The discrepancy is that the number of recorded tornadoes has increased significantly since 1953, but meteorologists say the factors causing tornadoes haven't changed.
2. We need to find the answer choice that best explains this discrepancy.
3. Choice A suggests meteorologists didn't understand tornado factors well before 1953. This doesn't directly explain the increase in recorded tornadoes.
4. Choice B mentions tornado intensity, which is not directly relevant to the number of tornadoes recorded.
5. Choice C notes the number has only slightly increased recently. This doesn't address the overall increase since 1953.
6. Choice D is about property damage, not the number of tornadoes.
7. Choice E states that many more citizens are helping detect tornadoes now compared to 1953. This could explain why more tornadoes are being recorded, even if the actual number of tornadoes hasn't changed much. More people looking means more tornadoes spotted.
Therefore, choice E seems to best resolve the apparent discrepancy.
Action: Answer("E")
