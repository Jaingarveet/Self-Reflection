Context: Only Canadian films are shown at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival. This year, most of the films that won prizes at that festival also won prizes at international film festivals.
Question: If the above statements are true, which one of the following statements must also be true?
Choices:
  A: This year, most of the Canadian films that were shown at international film festivals won prizes at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival.
  B: Most of the Canadian Films produced this year were shown at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival.
  C: Some of the films that won prizes at international film festivals this year were Canadian films.
  D: This year, not every film that won a prize at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival was also shown at an international film festival.
  E: This year, at least one Film that won a prize at an international Film festival was not shown at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival.
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The Lac Nichoutec Film Festival only shows Canadian films.
2. This year, most of the prize-winning films at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival also won prizes at international film festivals.
Now, let's consider each answer choice:
A: This can't be inferred. We don't know if most Canadian films shown at international festivals won prizes at Lac Nichoutec. The information is about the reverse - films that won at Lac Nichoutec also winning at international festivals.
B: We can't determine this. The information doesn't tell us about the proportion of Canadian films shown at Lac Nichoutec.
C: This must be true. If most Lac Nichoutec prize-winners, which are all Canadian films, also won at international festivals, then some of the international prize-winners must have been Canadian films.
D: This can't be determined. While we know most Lac Nichoutec winners also won internationally, we don't know if all of them did.
E: This can't be determined. The information doesn't preclude the possibility that all international prize-winners were shown at Lac Nichoutec.
Therefore, C is the correct answer.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
