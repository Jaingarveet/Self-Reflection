Topic: Law
Context: Editorial: Cell-phone usage on buses and trains is annoying to other passengers. This suggests that recent proposals to allow use of cell phones on airplanes are ill-advised. Cell-phone use would be far more upsetting on airplanes than it is on buses and trains. Airline passengers are usually packed in tightly. And if airline passengers are offended by the cell-phone excesses of their seatmates, they often cannot move to another seat.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes the role played in the editorial's argument by the statement that cell-phone use would be far more upsetting on airplanes than it is on buses and trains?
Choices:
  A: It is the main conclusion of the argument.
  B: It is a claim that the argument tries to rebut.
  C: It is a premise that indirectly supports the main conclusion of the argument by supporting a premise for that conclusion.
  D: It is a conclusion for which support is provided and that itself is used in turn to directly support the argument's main conclusion.
  E: It provides background information that plays no role in the reasoning in the argument.
## Assistant 2:
Let's analyze the argument step-by-step:
1. The main conclusion of the argument is that recent proposals to allow cell phone use on airplanes are ill-advised.
2. The argument provides two main reasons to support this conclusion:
   a) Cell-phone usage on buses and trains is annoying to other passengers.
   b) Cell-phone use would be far more upsetting on airplanes than it is on buses and trains.
3. The argument then provides further support for reason (b) by stating:
   - Airline passengers are usually packed in tightly.
   - If airline passengers are offended by cell-phone use, they often cannot move to another seat.
Looking at the answer choices:
A) It is not the main conclusion, as the main conclusion is about proposals to allow cell phone use on airplanes being ill-advised.
B) The argument is not trying to rebut this claim, but rather uses it to support the main conclusion.
C) It does not indirectly support the main conclusion by supporting another premise.
D) This accurately describes the role of the statement. It is a conclusion that cell-phone use would be more upsetting on airplanes, which is supported by the premises about airline passengers being packed tightly and not being able to move seats. This conclusion is then used to directly support the main conclusion.
E) It is not merely background information, as it plays a key role in the reasoning of the argument.
Therefore, the best answer is (D).
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
