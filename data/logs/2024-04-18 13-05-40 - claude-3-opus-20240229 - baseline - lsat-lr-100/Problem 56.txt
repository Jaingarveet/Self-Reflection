Topic: Law
Context: In some countries, there is a free flow of information about infrastructure, agriculture, and industry, whereas in other countries, this information is controlled by a small elite. In the latter countries, the vast majority of the population is denied vital information about factors that determine their welfare. Thus, these countries are likely to experience more frequent economic crises than other countries do.
Question: The conclusion follows logically if which one of the following is assumed?
Choices:
  A: It is more likely that people without political power will suffer from economic crises than it is that people in power will.
  B: Economic crises become more frequent as the amount of information available to the population about factors determining its welfare decreases.
  C: In nations in which the government controls access to information about infrastructure, agriculture, and industry, economic crises are common.
  D: The higher the percentage of the population that participates in economic decisions, the better those decisions are.
  E: A small elite that controls information about infrastructure, agriculture, and industry is likely to manipulate that information for its own benefit.
## Assistant 2:
Let's analyze the argument step-by-step:
1. The argument states that in some countries, information about infrastructure, agriculture, and industry is controlled by a small elite, while in others, there is a free flow of such information.
2. In countries where information is controlled, the majority of the population is denied vital information about factors determining their welfare.
3. The argument concludes that these countries with controlled information are likely to experience more frequent economic crises than other countries.
To reach this conclusion, the argument must assume a link between the control of information and the frequency of economic crises.
Looking at the answer choices:
A. This choice is irrelevant to the link between information control and economic crises.
B. This choice directly links the decrease in available information to an increase in the frequency of economic crises, which is necessary for the argument's conclusion to follow logically.
C. While this choice suggests a correlation between information control and economic crises, it doesn't establish the causal link needed for the conclusion.
D. The percentage of the population participating in economic decisions is not mentioned in the argument, making this choice irrelevant.
E. The manipulation of information by the elite is not directly related to the frequency of economic crises.
Therefore, choice B is the necessary assumption for the conclusion to follow logically.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
