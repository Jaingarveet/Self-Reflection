Context: Robinson: Wexell says that the museum wasted its money in purchasing props and costumes from famous stage productions, because such items have no artistic significance outside the context of a performance. But many of the props and costumes are too old and fragile for use in a performance. So clearly, the museum did not waste its money, for displaying these items is the only way of making them available to the public.
Question: The reasoning in Robinson's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it
Choices:
  A: offers anecdotal evidence insufficient to support a general claim
  B: gives reasons that do not address the point made in Wexell's argmnent
  C: attacks the person making the argument rather than the substance of the argument
  D: concludes that a claim is tilise merely on the grounds that the evidence for it is insufficient
  E: takes a condition that is sufficient for the conclusion to be true as one that is necessary for the conclusion to be true
## Assistant 2:
To determine which criticism best applies to Robinson's argument, let's break it down:
1. Wexell's claim: The museum wasted money because the props and costumes have no artistic significance outside of a performance context.
2. Robinson's counterargument: The props and costumes are too old and fragile for use in a performance, so displaying them is the only way to make them available to the public. Therefore, the museum did not waste its money.
Analyzing the answer choices:
A) The argument does not rely on anecdotal evidence.
C) The argument does not attack Wexell personally.
D) The argument does not conclude that Wexell's claim is false merely because there is insufficient evidence.
E) The argument does not confuse sufficient and necessary conditions.
B) Robinson's counterargument does not directly address Wexell's point about the props and costumes lacking artistic significance outside of a performance. Instead, it focuses on the idea that displaying the items is the only way to make them available to the public due to their fragility. This does not refute Wexell's claim about the items' artistic significance.
Action: Answer("B")
