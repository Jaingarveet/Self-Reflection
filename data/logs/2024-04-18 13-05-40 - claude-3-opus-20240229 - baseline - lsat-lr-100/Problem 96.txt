Context: A recent study shows that those highways that carry the most traffic, and thus tend to be the most congested, have the lowest rate of fatal traffic accidents.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain the phenomenon described above?
Choices:
  A: Drivers have more accidents when they become distracted.
  B: The highways that have the highest rate of fatal accidents have moderate volumes of traffic.
  C: Most of the motorists on very heavily traveled highways tend to be commuting to or from work.
  D: Most serious accidents occur when vehicles are moving at a high rate of speed.
  E: Heavily traveled highways do not always carry a higher proportion of large trucks.
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The question is asking for an explanation of why highways with the most traffic and congestion have the lowest rate of fatal accidents.
2. Choice A talks about distracted driving causing accidents, but it doesn't explain the phenomenon in question.
3. Choice B provides information about highways with the highest rate of fatal accidents, but it doesn't explain why heavily congested highways have fewer fatal accidents.
4. Choice C suggests that most motorists on heavily traveled highways are commuting to or from work. This could imply that these drivers are more familiar with the route and driving conditions, and may be more cautious. This could help explain the lower rate of fatal accidents.
5. Choice D states that most serious accidents occur at high speeds. On heavily congested highways, traffic is likely moving slower, which could contribute to fewer fatal accidents. This choice helps explain the phenomenon.
6. Choice E is about the proportion of large trucks on heavily traveled highways. This doesn't seem to offer a clear explanation for the lower rate of fatal accidents.
Both choices C and D offer plausible explanations, but D more directly addresses the key factor of speed in relation to fatal accidents.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
