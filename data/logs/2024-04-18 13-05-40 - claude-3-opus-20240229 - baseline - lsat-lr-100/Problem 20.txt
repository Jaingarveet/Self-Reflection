Topic: Law
Context: Judge: The defendant admits noncompliance with national building codes but asks that penalties not be imposed because he was confused as to whether national or local building codes applied to the area in which he was building. This excuse might be acceptable had he been charged with noncompliance with local codes, but since he is charged with noncompliance with national codes, his excuse is unacceptable.
Question: Which one of the following principles, if valid, most helps to justify the judge's reasoning?
Choices:
  A: Local codes and national codes must not overlap with each other.
  B: Local codes may be less strict, but not more strict, than national codes.
  C: Any behavior required by national codes is also required by local codes.
  D: Ignorance of the difference between two codes is not an adequate excuse for noncompliance.
  E: A behavior that is in compliance with one law is not necessarily in compliance with another.
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The defendant admits to not complying with national building codes.
2. The defendant's excuse is that he was confused about whether national or local codes applied.
3. The judge says this excuse might be acceptable if the defendant was charged with noncompliance with local codes.
4. But since the defendant is charged with noncompliance with national codes, the judge finds the excuse unacceptable.
Now, let's look at the answer choices:
A. This doesn't directly relate to the judge's reasoning.
B. The relative strictness of local vs. national codes is not the issue here.
C. This is not necessarily true and is not the basis for the judge's reasoning.
D. This captures the essence of the judge's reasoning - ignorance of the difference between two codes is not an excuse for noncompliance with one of them.
E. While this is generally true, it doesn't directly justify the judge's specific reasoning in this case.
Therefore, the principle that most helps to justify the judge's reasoning is D: Ignorance of the difference between two codes is not an adequate excuse for noncompliance.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
