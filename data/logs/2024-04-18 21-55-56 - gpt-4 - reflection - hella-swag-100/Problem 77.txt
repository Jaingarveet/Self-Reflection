Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to get rid of calluses on feet [title] Soak your feet on a regular basis. [step] If you have calluses, try soaking your feet on a regular basis to soften the dry and dead skin. Softening the skin with a warm water and mild soap foot bath will make removing that skin much easier.
Choices:
  A: [substeps] Fill a bowl with warm water and mild soap and add epsom salts. Gently immerse your feet in the bath for 10 to 15 minutes.
  B: The softer the skin on your feet, the less likely calluses will develop. Soak any areas that you have calluses on for at least thirty minutes.
  C: You may want to consider adding some dish soap to your foot bath to get your feet properly soaked. [title] Rinse off with warm water after soaking.
  D: [substeps] Use warm water instead of hot water. Hot water can dry out your skin and irritate your feet.

Thought: 
The question is asking for the most likely completion to the text about how to get rid of calluses on feet. The text already mentions soaking feet in warm water and mild soap. The best completion would provide more specific instructions on how to do this.
