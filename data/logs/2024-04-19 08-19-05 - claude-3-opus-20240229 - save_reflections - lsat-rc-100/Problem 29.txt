## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I incorrectly chose answer A because I focused too heavily on the theoretical calculations mentioned early in the passage and the researchers' lack of receptiveness to the possibility of splitting atoms. However, I overlooked the explicit statement in the passage that the physics community recognized the dangers of working with radioactive substances, which directly supports answer E.
Error Keywords:
 - Overlooking key information
 - Focusing on irrelevant details
 - Misinterpreting the question
 - Misreading the passage
 - Confirmation bias
Solution:
The passage states: "These products remained unidentified partly because precise chemical analyses were hampered by the minute quantities of the substances produced and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials..."
This sentence directly indicates that the physics community recognized the dangers of working with radioactive substances in the 1930s. None of the other answer choices are explicitly supported by the information provided in the passage.
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and identify the key information it is asking for.
2. Read the passage closely, paying attention to all relevant details.
3. Highlight or underline any sentences or phrases that directly address the question.
4. Evaluate each answer choice based on the specific information provided in the passage.
5. Eliminate answer choices that are not supported by the passage or are based on misinterpretations.
6. Choose the answer that is most clearly and directly supported by the passage.
7. Double-check your selected answer against the passage to ensure it is accurate.
Advice:
 - Always read the question and passage carefully to ensure you understand what is being asked and what information is provided.
 - Focus on the specific details and facts presented in the passage, rather than making assumptions or relying on outside knowledge.
 - Be cautious of answer choices that seem plausible but are not directly supported by the passage.
 - Eliminate answer choices that are contradicted by the passage or are based on misinterpretations of the information provided.
 - Always double-check your selected answer against the passage to verify its accuracy and ensure you haven't overlooked any key details.
 - Be aware of your own biases and try to approach the question objectively based on the information given.
