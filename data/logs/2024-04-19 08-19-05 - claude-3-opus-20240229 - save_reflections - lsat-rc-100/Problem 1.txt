## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I focused too narrowly on the critics' objection to using Western scientific methods to study non-Western cultures. While this is a key point, I overlooked that the critics would also likely object to using the theories or values of one culture to criticize another culture with different values. My error was in not fully considering all aspects of the critics' perspective.
Error Keywords:
 - Incomplete analysis
 - Overlooking key details
 - Narrow focus
 - Misinterpreting critics' perspective
Solution:
1. The third paragraph discusses critics who argue that real understanding of a culture can only be achieved by adopting the perspectives and methods of the culture being studied.
2. These critics would likely object to any study that uses the theories, methods, or values of one culture to examine or criticize another culture with different values.
3. Looking at the choices:
   A. Comparing moral codes doesn't necessarily involve judging one by the other's standards.
   B. Using a culture's own literature to understand it aligns with the critics' view.
   C. While using Western scientific methods to study a nonscientific culture is problematic for the critics, it's not the most direct answer.
   D. Using one society's literary theories to criticize another society's literature directly involves judging one culture by another's standards, which the critics would object to.
   E. Using Western methods to criticize Western culture is not what the critics are concerned about.
4. Choice D most completely captures what the critics in the third paragraph would find objectionable.
Instructions:
1. Read the passage carefully, paying attention to the perspectives of different groups discussed.
2. When a question asks about the view of a particular group, focus on what the passage says about that group's perspective.
3. Consider the implications and logical extensions of the group's stated views.
4. Evaluate each answer choice in light of the group's perspective, not just a single aspect of their view.
5. Choose the answer that most completely and directly represents what the group would think about the situation described.
Advice:
 - Always read the passage carefully, considering the views of all groups or individuals discussed.
 - When a question focuses on a particular group's perspective, prioritize what the passage directly says about that group's views.
 - Consider the full implications of a group's perspective, not just the most obvious aspects.
 - Evaluate all answer choices carefully, looking for the one that most completely captures the group's likely view on the specific situation presented.
 - Be careful not to be overly narrow in your analysis; consider the group's perspective holistically.
