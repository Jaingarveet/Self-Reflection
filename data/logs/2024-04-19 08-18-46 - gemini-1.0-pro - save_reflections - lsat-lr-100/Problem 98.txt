## Get Reflection:
## Explanation:
My initial answer was incorrect because I misinterpreted the argument's structure and the relationship between its premises and conclusion. I focused on the claim about the motivations of technological innovators and overlooked the crucial assumption that commercially viable technology cannot be beneficial to society.
## Error Keywords:
* Misinterpretation of argument structure
* Overlooking crucial assumption
* Focusing on irrelevant premise
## Solution:
1. **Identify the argument's conclusion:** The conclusion is that technological innovation rarely serves the interests of society as a whole.
2. **Identify the argument's premises:**
    * Premise 1: Those responsible for technological advances are almost without exception motivated by considerations of personal gain.
    * Premise 2: Commercially viable technology cannot be beneficial to society as a whole.
3. **Analyze the relationship between the premises and the conclusion:** The argument assumes that if technological innovation is primarily driven by personal gain, then it cannot be beneficial to society. This assumption is the weak point of the argument.
4. **Choose the answer that identifies the flaw in the argument:** Option D correctly points out that the argument takes for granted that an action is unlikely to produce a certain outcome unless it is motivated by a desire to produce that outcome. In this case, the desired outcome is societal benefit, and the argument assumes that this outcome cannot be achieved if the motivation is personal gain.
## Instructions for future similar problems:
1. Carefully read the argument and identify its conclusion and premises.
2. Analyze the relationship between the premises and the conclusion. Look for assumptions that are not explicitly stated but are necessary for the argument to be valid.
3. Identify the answer choice that correctly points out the flaw in the argument's reasoning.
4. Be cautious of answer choices that focus on irrelevant aspects of the argument or attack premises that are not crucial to the argument's conclusion.
## General advice for similar problems:
* **Break down complex arguments into smaller, more manageable parts.**
* **Focus on the logical structure of the argument, not just its content.**
* **Identify the assumptions that underlie the argument.**
* **Consider alternative explanations for the evidence presented.**
* **Be aware of common fallacies and logical errors.**
