## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that the editorial's criticism of the party's inconsistency was based on the assumption that it is inconsistent to claim that increasing spending on education is a worthy goal and to vote against increasing spending on education. However, the editorial's criticism is actually based on the assumption that a consistent political policy does not hold that an action that comprises a worthy goal should not be performed.
Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation of the editorial's argument
- Incorrect assumption about the basis of the editorial's criticism
Solution:
The editorial criticizes the party for having inconsistent views on education spending.
The editorial assumes that a consistent political policy does not hold that an action that comprises a worthy goal should not be performed.
The editorial does not assume that it is inconsistent to claim that increasing spending on education is a worthy goal and to vote against increasing spending on education.

2. Identify the assumptions underlying the editorial's argument.
