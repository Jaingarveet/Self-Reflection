## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:** My initial answer was incorrect because I focused on the immediate impact of the rental-purchase rebate program on sales, neglecting the longer-term effect of player engagement. While the rebate might incentivize some rentals and subsequent purchases, the prediction of exceeding sales expectations hinges on sustained demand beyond the initial rental period.
**Error Keywords:**
* **Short-term focus:** Analyzing only the immediate impact of the rebate program.
* **Neglecting player engagement:** Failing to consider the role of long-term player interest in driving sales.
* **Misinterpretation of evidence:** Assuming that high rental rates directly translate to exceeding sales expectations without considering player behavior after completing the game.
## Solution and Reasoning
**Step 1: Identify the key issue:** The publisher's prediction relies on exceeding sales expectations, not just maintaining current sales levels.
**Step 2: Analyze player behavior:** Consider how long it takes players to complete the game and their engagement afterward.
**Step 3: Evaluate options:** Choose the option that best supports the prediction based on player behavior.
**Step 4: Justification:** Option B ("It takes several weeks for most players to complete the game") aligns with the prediction because:
* **Extended engagement:** A longer completion time implies sustained player interest, increasing the likelihood of exceeding sales expectations as players who enjoyed the rental experience are more likely to purchase the game.
* **Word-of-mouth marketing:** Players who spend weeks engaged with the game are more likely to recommend it to others, further boosting sales.
