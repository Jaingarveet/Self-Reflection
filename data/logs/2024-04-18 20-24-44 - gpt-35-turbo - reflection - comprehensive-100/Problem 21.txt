Context: On each of exactly seven consecutive days (day 1 though day 7), a pet shop features exactly one of three breeds of kitten—Himalayan, Manx, Siamese—and exactly one of three breeds of puppy—Greyhound, Newfoundland, Rottweiler. The following conditions must apply: Greyhounds are featured on day 1. No breed is featured on any two consecutive days. Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7. Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1. Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.
Question: Which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Greyhounds and Siamese are both featured on day 2.
  B: Greyhounds and Himalayans are both featured on day 7.
  C: Rottweilers and Himalayans are both featured on day 4.
  D: Rottweilers and Manx are both featured on day 5.
  E: Newfoundlands and Manx are both featured on day 6.

Thought:
Greyhounds are featured on day 1.
No breed is featured on any two consecutive days.
Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7.
Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.
Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.
Action: 
A: Greyhounds and Siamese cannot both be featured on day 2 because no breed can be featured on any two consecutive days.
B: Greyhounds are featured on day 1 and cannot be featured on day 7. Himalayans are not featured on day 1, so they could be featured on day 7. Therefore, Greyhounds and Himalayans could both be featured on day 7. 
C: Himalayans are not featured on day 1, so they cannot be featured on day 4. Rottweilers are not featured on any day that features Himalayans, so they cannot be featured on day 4 either. Therefore, Rottweilers and Himalayans cannot both be featured on day 4.
D: Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, so they could be featured on day 5. Manx could also be featured on day 5 because it is not featured on any of the other days. Therefore, Rottweilers and Manx could both be featured on day 5.
E: Newfoundlands and Manx cannot both be featured on day 6 because no breed can be featured on any two consecutive days.
