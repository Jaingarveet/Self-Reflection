## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:

Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: $$\begin{array}{r}3 x+4 y=-23 \\2 y-x=-19\end{array}$$What is the solution $(x, y)$ to the system of equations above?
Choices:
  A: $(-5,-2)$
  B: $(3,-8)$
  C: $(4,-6)$
  D: $(9,-6)$
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I made a sign error when substituting the value of y back into the first equation. This led to an incorrect value for x and ultimately the wrong solution.
Error Keywords:
 - Sign error
 - Substitution error
 - Arithmetic error
Solution:
Following the initial steps correctly:
1. We multiplied the second equation by 3 to eliminate x:
$$\begin{array}{r}3 x+4 y=-23 \\ 6 y-3 x=-57\end{array}$$
2. We added the two equations together: 
$$10y = -80$$
3. We solved for y:
$$y = -8$$
4. Now, substitute y = -8 back into the first equation:
$$3x + 4(-8) = -23$$
5. Solve for x, paying close attention to the signs:
$$3x - 32 = -23$$
$$3x = 9$$
$$x = 3$$
Therefore, the correct solution is (3, -8).
Instructions:
1. Choose a variable to eliminate by manipulating one or both equations.
2. Multiply one or both equations by appropriate constants to achieve the same coefficient for the chosen variable with opposite signs.
3. Add or subtract the equations to eliminate the chosen variable.
4. Solve for the remaining variable.
5. Substitute the value of the found variable back into one of the original equations.
6. Solve for the other variable, paying close attention to signs during calculations.
7. Write the solution as an ordered pair (x, y).
8. Double-check your solution by substituting both values back into both original equations to ensure they hold true.
Advice:
 - Pay close attention to signs when manipulating equations and performing calculations.
 - Double-check your work at each step, especially when substituting values back into equations.
 - Consider using different methods (substitution, graphing) to verify your solution if unsure. 
 - Practice solving systems of equations regularly to improve accuracy and speed.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
I will follow the instructions and my previous reflection to solve this system of equations.
I will eliminate x by multiplying the second equation by 3 and then adding the equations.
Then, I will solve for y and substitute it back into the first equation to solve for x.
Action: Answer("B") 
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
