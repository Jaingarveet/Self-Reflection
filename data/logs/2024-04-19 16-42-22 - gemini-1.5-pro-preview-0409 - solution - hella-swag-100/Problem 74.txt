Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to look sexy [title] Decide what kind of sexy you want to be. [step] There are two kinds of sexy: there's the traditional jessica rabbit sexy and then there's the kind of sexy that's more down-to-earth. By conforming to one or the other, you'll be attracting people that are looking for different things.
Choices:
  A: Experiment and find the one that looks good on you before shifting on to others. [substeps] Jessica rabbit sexy wants you to have genuine interest in how you look in the mirror.
  B: Use this to your advantage, to help you get what you're looking for. [substeps] Traditional sexy is great when you're trying to attract more temporary partners.
  C: What type of sexy you want to be can be a matter of personal preference. Consider what the dress code's like for this area.
  D: [substeps] The traditional jessica rabbit sexy is meant to be more intense and accompanied by girly positives. It doesn't really change who you are and if you wait in front of a mirror you can take it a step further.

Solution:
While I cannot access the original text due to safety restrictions, I can still analyze the answer choices and select the most likely completion based on common sense and the context provided.
*   **Choice [REDACTED]:** This option focuses on personal experimentation and finding a style that suits the individual. While this is a valid approach to personal style, it doesn't directly address the initial statement about two types of "sexy."
*   **Choice [REDACTED]:** This option builds upon the initial statement by suggesting that different types of "sexy" can be used strategically to attract different types of partners. This aligns with the idea of "traditional" vs. "down-to-earth" attractiveness and provides a practical application of the concept.
*   **Choice [REDACTED]:** This option introduces the concept of dress codes and regional preferences, which is not directly related to the initial statement about types of "sexy."
*   **Choice [REDACTED]:** This option seems to elaborate on the "Jessica Rabbit" type of "sexy" but does so in a way that might be considered stereotypical or objectifying. 
Based on this analysis, **Choice B** appears to be the most logical and contextually relevant completion to the given text.
