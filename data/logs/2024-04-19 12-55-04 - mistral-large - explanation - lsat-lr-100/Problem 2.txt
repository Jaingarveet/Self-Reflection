Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I misinterpreted the given statements and failed to consider all possible scenarios.
The gap in my knowledge was in logical reasoning and critical thinking.
I misunderstood the relationship between the films that won prizes at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival and the films that won prizes at international film festivals.
I also failed to consider the possibility that some films that won prizes at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival may not have been shown at international film festivals.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The given statements only tell us that most of the films that won prizes at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival also won prizes at international film festivals. It does not necessarily mean that all of the films that won prizes at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival were shown at international film festivals.
The only statement that must be true is that some of the films that won prizes at international film festivals this year were Canadian films, since we know that only Canadian films are shown at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival.
Action: Answer("C")

Agent Answer: C

Score: 0
