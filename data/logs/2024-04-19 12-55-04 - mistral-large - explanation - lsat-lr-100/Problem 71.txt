Context: Curator: Our museum displays only twentieth-century works, which are either on loan from private collectors or in the museum's permanent collection.

Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I focused on the wrong aspect of the curator's statements. I focused on the fact that the museum store sells prints of all works in the museum's permanent collection, which are all twentieth-century works, and that the store also sells prints of some works that are not part of the permanent collection, such as Hopper's Nighthawks. However, I failed to consider the fact that the museum displays only twentieth-century works, which are either on loan from private collectors or in the museum's permanent collection.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The curator's statements indicate that the museum displays only twentieth-century works, which are either on loan from private collectors or in the museum's permanent collection. The museum store sells prints of all works in the museum's permanent collection and some works that are not part of the permanent collection, such as Hopper's Nighthawks.
The correct answer must be true based on the curator's statements.
Action: Answer("B")
Explanation:
The curator's statements indicate that all works displayed in the museum are twentieth-century works. Therefore, every print that is sold in the museum store must be a copy of a twentieth-century work. This answer is the only one that must be true based on the curator's statements.
