Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the context.
 - Pay attention to the keywords that indicate the relative positions of objects.
 - Do not make assumptions about the positions of objects based on incomplete information.
 - Consider all possible scenarios based on the given information.
 - Choose the answer that is consistent with all the information provided.
 - Draw a diagram or sketch to visualize the relative positions of the objects, if necessary.
## Assistant 2:
Self-reflection: 
* I previously made the mistake of assuming that Jiushang being adjacent to Haoyun meant they were directly next to each other, which led to an incorrect answer.
* I need to be more careful in considering all possible scenarios based on the given information.
Thought process:
* Jiushang is adjacent to Haoyun and east of Haoyun, meaning there could be another station between them.
* Fuyi is west of Huyao and adjacent to it, so they are directly next to each other.
* Yinling is adjacent to Jiushang, so they could be on either side of Jiushang.
Based on this analysis, only option B is guaranteed to be true: Fuyi is west of Huyao.
Action: Answer("B") 
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
