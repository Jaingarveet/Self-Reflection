## System:
You are an expert in Logic.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Logic
Context: There must be an outside world, because if there is something outside me that can shine or reflect, shining the light into my eyes, which gives me a visual experience, I ca nâ€™t see the buildings, the crowds and the stars these things.And, not only have visual experience like me, but others also have such visual experience; book knowledge also tells us repeatedly that there is an outside world outside of us.
Question: Which of the following does not constitute doubt or rebuttal to the above argument?
Choices:
  A: To use sensory evidence to explain the existence of the external world requires presupposing the existence of the external world in the mind.
  B: How do you prove that others have similar visual experience to you?
  C: Since the visual experience is reliable, Mirage is not a so-called illusion, but a real existence.
  D: If there is no external world and natural science knowledge is not a true reflection of it, then why does natural science achieve such great success in practice?
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Advice:
 - Pay close attention to the wording of the argument and the answer choices.
 - Consider the logical structure of the argument and how each option interacts with it.
 - Be wary of options that seem intuitively appealing but do not directly address the argument.
 - Remember that the goal is to identify the option that casts doubt on or refutes the argument, not necessarily the option that is most obviously wrong.
## Assistant 2:
Self-reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly because I did not carefully consider the wording of the argument and the answer choices. I focused too much on the conclusion of the argument (that there must be an outside world) and not enough on the premises that support it.
I have learned that it is important to pay close attention to the details of the argument and to consider how each answer choice interacts with those details. I have also learned that it is important to be wary of options that seem intuitively appealing but do not directly address the argument.
I will use this knowledge to answer the question correctly this time.
Thought:
The argument claims that the existence of visual experience is evidence for the existence of an outside world. Option A challenges this claim by pointing out that using sensory evidence to explain the existence of the external world requires presupposing the existence of the external world in the mind. This is a valid point, as it shows that the argument is circular. Option B asks how we can prove that others have similar visual experience to us. This is a valid question, as it shows that the argument relies on an unproven assumption. Option C claims that mirages are real, which contradicts the argument's claim that visual experience is reliable evidence for the existence of an outside world. Option D asks why natural science is so successful if there is no external world. This is a valid question, as it shows that the argument's conclusion is inconsistent with our experience of the world.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: D
