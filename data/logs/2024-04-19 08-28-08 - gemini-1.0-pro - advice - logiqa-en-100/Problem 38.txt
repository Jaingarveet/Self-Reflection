Topic: Logic
Context: The number of crocodiles in the North Atlantic Ocean has declined sharply, but the number of seals has increased significantly at almost the same time.Some people say that it is the seal that caused the reduction of crocodiles.This argument is difficult to establish because seals rarely feed on crocodiles.
Question: Which of the following, if true, would most weaken the above argument?
Choices:
  A: Seawater pollution causes more damage to crocodiles than seals.
  B: Despite the sharp decrease in the number of crocodiles and the increase in the number of seals, there are still fewer seals in the North Atlantic Ocean than crocodiles.
  C: Before the number of seals increased, the number of crocodiles in the North Atlantic Ocean decreased.
  D: Crocodiles only eat capelin, and capelin is also the main food for seals.
