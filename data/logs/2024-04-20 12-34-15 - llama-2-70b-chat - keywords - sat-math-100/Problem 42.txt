## Assistant 2:
  My apologies for my previous mistake. Let's reflect on the problem and the correct answer.
The given equation is $(a x+2)(b x+7)=15 x^{2}+c x+14$.
We know that $a+b=8$.
We can expand the product as follows:
$$(a x+2)(b x+7) = ab x^{2} + 2bx + 7a x + 14$$
Since $a+b=8$, we can write $a=4$ and $b=4$.
Substituting these values into the equation, we get:
$$(4x+2)(4x+7) = 16x^{2} + 28x + 28$$
Expanding and simplifying, we get:
$$16x^{2} + 28x + 28 = 15x^{2} + 14$$
Subtracting $16x^{2}$ from both sides gives:
$$12x + 28 = 14$$
Subtracting $28$ from both sides gives:
$$12x = 14 - 28$$
$$12x = -14$$
Dividing both sides by $12$ gives:
$$x = -14/12$$
Since $x$ cannot be negative, we have a contradiction.
Therefore, the given equation has no solutions.
Hence, the correct answer is (D) None of the above.

Action: Answer("D")
