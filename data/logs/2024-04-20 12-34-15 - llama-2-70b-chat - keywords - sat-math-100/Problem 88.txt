## Assistant 2:
  My apologies for my previous mistake. I made a unit confusion error. I mistakenly took the initial velocity as 25 meters per second squared, which led me to incorrectly calculate the time it would take for the ball to reach its maximum height.

The correct calculation is as follows:

First, we need to find the time it takes for the ball to reach its maximum height. We can do this by setting the velocity equal to zero and solving for time:

$$0 = -4.9t^2 + 25t$$

$$t = \frac{25}{4.9}$$

$$t \approx 5.1$$

Now, we need to find the time it takes for the ball to hit the ground. We can do this by subtracting the time it takes to reach the maximum height from the total time the ball is in the air:

$$Time\ to\ hit\ the\ ground = Total\ Time\ in\ Air - Time\ to\ Reach\ Maximum\ Height$$

$$Total\ Time\ in\ Air = 5.1 + 5.1 = 10.2$$

$$Time\ to\ hit\ the\ ground = 10.2 - 5.1 = 5.1$$

Therefore, the ball will hit the ground approximately 5.1 seconds after it is launched.
