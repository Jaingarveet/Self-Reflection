## Assistant 2:
  My previous answer was incorrect because I misunderstood the problem and used an incorrect equation. I thought that the discount was 20% off the original price, but it was actually 20% off the price including the 8% sales tax.

Let's break down the information given:

* The original price of the laptop was $x$ dollars.
* The discount was 20% off the price including the 8% sales tax, so the discounted price was $0.8(1.08)x$ dollars.
* The total amount Alma paid to the cashier was $p$ dollars, including an 8% sales tax on the discounted price.

Now, we can set up an equation:

$p = 0.8(1.08)x + 0.08(0.8(1.08)x)$

Simplifying and solving for $x$, we get:

$x = \frac{p}{0.8(1.08)}$

So, the correct answer is B: $\frac{p}{0.8(1.08)}$.

Action: Answer("B")
