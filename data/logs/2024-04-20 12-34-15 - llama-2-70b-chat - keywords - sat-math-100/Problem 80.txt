## Assistant 2:
  My apologies for my previous mistake. Let's analyze the system of equations:

$$\begin{aligned}
k x - 3 y &= 4 \\
4 x - 5 y &= 7
\end{aligned}$$

We can solve the first equation for $x$:

$$x = \frac{4}{k} + \frac{3 y}{k}$$

Now, substitute this expression for $x$ into the second equation:

$$4 \left(\frac{4}{k} + \frac{3 y}{k}\right) - 5 y = 7$$

Expand and simplify:

$$\frac{16}{k} + 4 \frac{3 y}{k} - 5 y = 7$$

Collect like terms:

$$\frac{16}{k} - \frac{5 y}{k} = 7$$

Now, we can see that the left-hand side is a constant expression, and it is equal to $7$. Therefore, the system of equations has no solution if and only if this expression is equal to $7$ for some value of $k$.

Let's evaluate the expression for the given choices:

A: $\frac{12}{5}$:

$$\frac{16}{7} - \frac{5 y}{7} = \frac{16}{7} - \frac{5}{7} = \frac{11}{7} \neq 7$$

B: $\frac{16}{7}$:

$$\frac{16}{7} - \frac{5 y}{7} = \frac{16}{7} - \frac{5}{7} = \frac{11}{7} \neq 7$$

C: $-\frac{16}{7}$:

$$\frac{16}{7} - \frac{5 y}{7} = -\frac{16}{7} - \frac{5 y}{7} = -\frac{21}{7} \neq 7$$

D: $-\frac{12}{5}$:

$$\frac{16}{7} - \frac{5 y}{7} = -\frac{12}{5} - \frac{5 y}{7} = -\frac{17}{7} \neq 7$$

Therefore, the value of $k$ that makes the system of equations have no solution is $-\frac{17}{7}$.
