## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Context: \begin{center}.\begin{tabular}{|l|c|}.\hline.\multicolumn{1}{|c|}{Planet} & Acceleration due to gravity $\left(\frac{\mathrm{m}}{\mathrm{sec}^{2}}\right)$ \\.\hline\hline.Mercury & 3.6 \\.\hline.Venus & 8.9 \\.\hline.Earth & 9.8 \\.\hline.Mars & 3.8 \\.\hline.Jupiter & 26.0 \\.\hline.Saturn & 11.1 \\.\hline.Uranus & 10.7 \\.\hline.Neptune & 14.1 \\.\hline.\end{tabular}.\end{center}.The chart above shows approximations of the acceleration due to gravity in meters per.second squared $\left(\frac{\mathrm{m}}{\sec ^{2}}\right)$ for the eight planets in our solar system. The weight of an object on a given planet can be found by using the formula $W=m g$, where $W$ is the weight of the object measured in newtons, $m$ is the mass of the object measured in kilograms, and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity on the planet measured in $\frac{m}{\sec ^{2}}$
Question: An object on Earth has a weight of 150 newtons. On which planet would the same object have an approximate weight of 170 newtons?
Choices:
  A: Venus
  B: Saturn
  C: Uranus
  D: Neptune

## Assistant 2:
  My apologies for my previous mistake. Let's reflect on the problem and the correct answer. The correct answer is C: Uranus.
The formula to calculate the weight of an object on a planet is W = mg, where W is the weight of the object measured in newtons, m is the mass of the object measured in kilograms, and g is the acceleration due to gravity on the planet measured in $\frac{m}{\sec ^{2}}$.
I previously made a calculation error by plugging in the wrong values. I mistakenly used the mass of the object instead of the acceleration due to gravity.
To find the planet where the object would have an approximate weight of 170 newtons, we need to find the planet with an acceleration due to gravity that would result in a weight of 170 newtons when plugged into the formula W = mg.
We can do this by solving the equation for g:
g = W/m

We know the mass of the object is 150 newtons, so we can plug that value in:
g = 170/150
g â‰ˆ 1.13

Now, we can look at the chart and find the planet with an acceleration due to gravity closest to 1.13. The closest value is Uranus, with an acceleration due to gravity of 10.7.
Therefore, the correct answer is C: Uranus.
