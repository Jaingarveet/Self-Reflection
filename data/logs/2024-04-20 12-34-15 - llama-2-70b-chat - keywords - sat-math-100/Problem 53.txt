## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Assistant 2:
  My apologies for my previous mistake. Let's reflect on the problem and the correct answer.
The line in the $x y$-plane passes through the origin, so it can be represented by the equation $y = mx$, where $m$ is the slope. In this case, the slope is given as $\frac{1}{7}$.
Therefore, the equation of the line is $y = \frac{1}{7}x$.
Now, let's check the given choices:

A: $(0,7)$
Substituting $x = 0$ and $y = 7$ into the equation $y = \frac{1}{7}x$, we get $7 = 0 \times \frac{1}{7}$, which is not true. So, this point does not lie on the line.

B: $(1,7)$
Substituting $x = 1$ and $y = 7$ into the equation $y = \frac{1}{7}x$, we get $7 = \frac{1}{7} \times 1$, which is true. So, this point lies on the line.

C: $(7,7)$
Substituting $x = 7$ and $y = 7$ into the equation $y = \frac{1}{7}x$, we get $7 = \frac{1}{7} \times 7$, which is not true. So, this point does not lie on the line.

D: $(14,2)$
Substituting $x = 14$ and $y = 2$ into the equation $y = \frac{1}{7}x$, we get $2 = \frac{1}{7} \times 14$, which is not true. So, this point does not lie on the line.

Based on the above analysis, the point that lies on the line is $(1,7)$.
