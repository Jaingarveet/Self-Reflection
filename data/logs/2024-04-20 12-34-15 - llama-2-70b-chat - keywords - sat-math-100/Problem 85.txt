## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: $$C=\frac{5}{9}(F-32)$$The equation above shows how a temperature $F$, measured in degrees Fahrenheit, relates to a temperature $C$, measured in degrees Celsius. Based on the equation, which of the following must be true?I. A temperature increase of 1 degree Fahrenheit is equivalent to a temperature increase of $\frac{5}{9}$ degree Celsius.II. A temperature increase of 1 degree Celsius is equivalent to a temperature increase of 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit.III. A temperature increase of $\frac{5}{9}$ degree Fahrenheit is equivalent to a temperature increase of 1 degree Celsius.
Choices:
  A: I only
  B: II only
  C: III only
  D: I and II only

## Assistant 2:
  Sure, I'll do my best to answer the question.

Here's my reflection on the previous answer:

I previously answered this question incorrectly, selecting choice A: I only.
Upon reflection, I realized that my mistake was in not carefully considering the units of measurement.
The equation given in the question, C = (5/9)(F - 32), shows that 1 degree Celsius is equivalent to (5/9) degrees Fahrenheit.
Therefore, a 1-degree increase in Celsius corresponds to a (5/9) degree increase in Fahrenheit, and vice versa.
So, the correct answer is choice D: I and II only.

Now, let's evaluate the choices:

A: I only - Incorrect.
As mentioned above, a 1-degree increase in Celsius corresponds to a (5/9) degree increase in Fahrenheit, so statement I is true.
However, statement II is false because a 1-degree increase in Fahrenheit corresponds to a (5/9) degree increase in Celsius, not the other way around.

B: II only - Incorrect.
Statement II is false, as mentioned above.
A 1-degree increase in Fahrenheit corresponds to a (5/9) degree increase in Celsius.

C: III only - Incorrect.
Statement III is false because a temperature increase of (5/9) degrees Fahrenheit is equivalent to a temperature increase of 1 degree Celsius, not the other way around.

D: I and II only - Correct.
Both statements I and II are true.
A 1-degree increase in Celsius corresponds to a (5/9) degree increase in Fahrenheit, and a 1-degree increase in Fahrenheit corresponds to a (5/9) degree increase in Celsius.

Therefore, the correct answer is choice D: I and II only.
