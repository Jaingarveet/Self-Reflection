## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Assistant 2:
  My apologies for my previous mistake. Let's reflect on the problem and the correct answer.
The question asks for the value of $d$, which is the y-coordinate of the vertex of the parabola.
The correct answer is C: $-5 a$.

My previous answer was A: $-9 a$, which is incorrect. I made a calculation error in my previous response.

The vertex of a quadratic equation of the form $y = ax^2 + bx + c$ is given by $(-b/2a, -c/a)$.
In this case, we have $y = a(x-2)(x+4) = a(x^2 - 8x + 8) = a(x^2 - 4x + 4)$.
The vertex is given by $(-4/2a, -4/a) = (-2, -2a/a) = (-2, -2)$.
Therefore, $d = -2$.

Action: Answer("C")
