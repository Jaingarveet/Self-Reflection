## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: A circle in the $x y$-plane has center $(5,7)$ and radius 2. Which of the following is an equation of the circle?
Choices:
  A: $(x-5)^{2}+(y-7)^{2}=4$
  B: $(x+5)^{2}+(y+7)^{2}=4$
  C: $(x-5)^{2}+(y-7)^{2}=2$
  D: $(x+5)^{2}+(y+7)^{2}=2$

## Assistant 2:
  My apologies for my previous mistake. Let's reflect on the problem and the correct answer.
The correct answer is indeed option C: $(x-5)^{2}+(y-7)^{2}=2$.
I made a mistake in my previous answer by not paying attention to the given information. The center of the circle is $(5,7)$, and the radius is 2, so the equation of the circle should have a radius of 2, not 4.
I also mistakenly used the formula for the equation of a circle with a center at the origin, which is not the case here.
To avoid this mistake in the future, I will make sure to carefully read the given information and use the correct formula for the equation of a circle.
Action: Answer("C")
