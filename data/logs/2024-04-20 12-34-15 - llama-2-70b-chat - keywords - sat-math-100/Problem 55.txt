## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

  C: Its maximum occurs at $(-3, a)$.
  D: Its maximum occurs at $(3, a)$.

## Assistant 2:
  My apologies for my previous mistake. Let's analyze the given equation:

$$y = - (x - 3)^2 + a$$

The parabola opens downward, meaning the minimum value of $y$ occurs at the vertex of the parabola. The vertex is located at $x = 3$, as we can see by setting $x - 3 = 0$ and solving for $y$.

Now, let's evaluate the given choices:

A: Its minimum occurs at $(-3, a)$.

This is incorrect. The minimum value of $y$ occurs at $x = 3$, not $-3$.

B: Its minimum occurs at $(3, a)$.

This is correct! The minimum value of $y$ occurs at $x = 3$, which means the vertex of the parabola is located at $(3, a)$.

C: Its maximum occurs at $(-3, a)$.

This is incorrect. The maximum value of $y$ does not occur at $(-3, a)$.

D: Its maximum occurs at $(3, a)$.

This is incorrect. The maximum value of $y$ does not occur at $(3, a)$.

Therefore, the correct answer is B: Its minimum occurs at $(3, a)$.

Reflection:
My previous mistake was due to a misconception about the location of the vertex of a downward-opening parabola. I incorrectly assumed the minimum value of $y$ occurred at $x = -3$, rather than $x = 3$. By carefully analyzing the equation and considering the shape of the parabola, I was able to correct my mistake and arrive at the correct answer.
