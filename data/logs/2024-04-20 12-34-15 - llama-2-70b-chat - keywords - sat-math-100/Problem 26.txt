## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Assistant 2:
  My apologies for my previous mistake. Let's break down the problem step by step:

The first polynomial is 3x^2 - 5x + 2.
The second polynomial is 5x^2 - 2x - 6.

To add the two polynomials, we need to add the corresponding terms:

* 3x^2 + 5x^2 = 8x^2
* -5x + 2x = 7x
* 2 + (-6) = -4

Therefore, the sum of the two polynomials is 8x^2 + 7x - 4.

The correct answer is choice B: 8x^2 + 7x - 4.

I made a calculation error in my previous response, but I have corrected it now. Thank you for the opportunity to reflect and improve my answer.
