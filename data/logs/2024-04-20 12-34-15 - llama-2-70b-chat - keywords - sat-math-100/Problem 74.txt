## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

  B: $\frac{x^{2}+5 x+6}{2 x+5}$
  C: $2 x+5$
  D: $x^{2}+5 x+6$

## Assistant 2:
  My apologies for my previous mistake. Let's analyze the question again.
If $x>3$, we can write:

$$\frac{1}{\frac{1}{x+2}+\frac{1}{x+3}} = \frac{x+2}{x+3}$$

Now, we can simplify:

$$\frac{x+2}{x+3} = \frac{x+2}{x+2} \times \frac{x+2}{x+3} = 1 \times \frac{x+2}{x+3}$$

So, the equivalent expression is:

$$\frac{x+2}{x+3}$$

Therefore, the correct answer is:

$$\boxed{B: \frac{x^{2}+5 x+6}{2 x+5}}$$

I made a simplification error in my previous response. I incorrectly simplified $\frac{x+2}{x+3}$ to $1$. Thank you for bringing it to my attention.
## Result:
