## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Assistant 2:
  My apologies for my previous mistake. Let's reflect on the problem and the correct answer.
The parabola with equation $y=(x-11)^{2}$ intersects the line with equation $y=25$ at two points, $A$ and $B$. We can find the coordinates of $A$ and $B$ by solving the system of equations:
$y=(x-11)^{2}$
$y=25$
We get:
$x-11=\pm\sqrt{25}$
$x-11=\pm 5$
$x=11\pm 5$
Therefore, the coordinates of $A$ and $B$ are:
$A(11+5, 25)$
$B(11-5, 25)$
Now, we can find the length of $\overline{A B}$ using the distance formula:
$d=\sqrt((x_2-x_1)^2+(y_2-y_1)^2)$
$d=\sqrt((11+5-11-5)^2+(25-25)^2)$
$d=\sqrt(10^2+0^2)$
$d=10\sqrt{2}$
The correct answer is:
Action: Answer("B") 
The length of $\overline{A B}$ is 12 units.
I made a calculation error in my previous response by not simplifying the square root correctly. I also made a distance error by not using the correct coordinates for the points $A$ and $B$. Thank you for the opportunity to reflect and correct my mistake.
