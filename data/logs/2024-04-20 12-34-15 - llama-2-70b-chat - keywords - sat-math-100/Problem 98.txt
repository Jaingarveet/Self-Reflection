## Assistant 2:
  My apologies for my previous mistake. Let's analyze the system of equations:

3x + 4y = -23 ... (1)
2y - x = -19 ... (2)

I will use substitution to solve the system. Solving (1) for x, we have:

x = -4y - 23/3

Now, substituting this expression for x into (2), we get:

-4y^2 - 23y/3 - 19 = 0

Expanding and simplifying, we get:

-4y^2 - 15y - 19 = 0

Now, we can factor the left-hand side as:

(2y + 3)(2y - 6) = 0

Therefore, we have two possible solutions:

2y + 3 = 0 or 2y - 6 = 0

The first equation gives us y = -3/2, and substituting this into the first equation, we get:

x = -4(-3/2) - 23/3 = 3

So, the solution is (3, -3/2).

Action: Answer("B")
