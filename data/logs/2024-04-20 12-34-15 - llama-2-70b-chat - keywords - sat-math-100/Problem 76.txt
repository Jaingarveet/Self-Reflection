## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Reflection:
Previously, I answered this question as follows:
Action: Answer("B")
However, upon reflection, I realized that my answer was incorrect due to a calculation error.
I made a mistake in simplifying the expression.
Here's my corrected solution:
We are given the equation:
$$\frac{5}{x} = \frac{15}{x+20}$$
We can simplify the equation by multiplying both sides by x:
$$5 = 15(x+20)$$
Now, we can expand the right-hand side:
$$5 = 15x + 300$$
Subtract 300 from both sides:
$$-295 = 15x$$
Now, divide both sides by 15:
$$\frac{x}{5} = \frac{-295}{15}$$
The correct answer is D: $\frac{1}{2}$.

Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
