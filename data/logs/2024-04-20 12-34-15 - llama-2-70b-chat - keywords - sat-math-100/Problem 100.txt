# Model: llama-2-70b-chat | Agent: keywords | Exam: sat-math-100 | Problem 100 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:
Topic: Geography
Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Context: $$.a=1,052+1.08 t.$$.The speed of a sound wave in air depends on the air temperature. The formula above shows the relationship between $a$, the speed of a sound wave, in feet per second, and $t$, the air temperature, in degrees Fahrenheit $\left({ }^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\right)$.
Question: At which of the following air temperatures will the speed of a sound wave be closest to 1,000 feet per second?
Choices:
  A: $-46^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$
  B: $-48^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$
  C: $-49^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$
  D: $-50^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$

Error Keywords:

* Misunderstanding of the formula
* Incorrect reasoning
## Assistant 2:
  My apologies for my previous mistake. I misunderstood the formula and used incorrect reasoning.
The formula $a=1,052+1.08 t$ shows that as the temperature $t$ increases, the speed of the sound wave $a$ also increases.
To find the temperature at which the speed of the sound wave is closest to 1,000 feet per second, we need to find the temperature that makes $a$ as close to 1,000 as possible.
Since $a$ increases as $t$ increases, the temperature that will give us the closest value to 1,000 will be the lowest temperature among the given choices.
Therefore, the correct answer is:
Action: Answer("A")

Reflection:
After reflecting on my previous mistake, I realized that I misunderstood the formula and used incorrect reasoning. I learned that it's essential to carefully read and understand the formula and the given information before jumping into calculations. In this case, I should have noticed that the formula shows a direct relationship between the speed of the sound wave and the air temperature, and that the speed increases as the temperature increases. I will be more careful in my future responses to ensure that I provide accurate and correct answers.
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
