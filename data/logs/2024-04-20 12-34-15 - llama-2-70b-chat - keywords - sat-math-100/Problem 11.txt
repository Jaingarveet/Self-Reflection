## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.

## Assistant 2:
  My apologies for my previous mistake. I made a careless mistake and paid little attention to detail.
I incorrectly compared the like terms.
The given expression $2 x\left(x^{2}-3 x\right)$ can be factored out $x$ from the first two terms and the last two terms:

$2 x\left(x^{2}-3 x\right)$ $=$ $2 x\left(x\left(x-3\right)\right)$ $=$ $2\left(x^{2}-3 x\right)$

Therefore, the correct answer is:

Action: Answer("A")

The correct answer is A: $-4 x^{2}$.
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
