Context: A chemistry class has six lab sessions scheduled over three days—Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday—one session heing held each morning and one each afternoon. Each session will be led by a different lab assistant—Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, or Rebecca. The assignment of lab assistants to sessions is constrained as follows: Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day. Nessa must lead an afternoon session. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
Question: If Julio and Kevin both lead morning sessions, then any of the following could be true EXCEPT:
Choices:
  A: Lan's session meets Wednesday morning.
  B: Lan's session meets Thursday afternoon.
  C: Nessa's session meets Friday afternoon.
  D: Olivia's session meets Thursday morning.
  E: Olivia's session meets Friday morning.

Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Advice:
 - In constraint satisfaction problems, always consider the most restrictive conditions first.
 - Mentally simulate the schedule chronologically, assigning roles one at a time.
 - At each step, check if any constraints are violated before proceeding.
 - If a partial assignment leads to an irreconcilable conflict, backtrack and consider a different assignment.
 - Be sure to consider all constraints for each possible choice before deciding if it can be true or not.
 - Don't rush to judgment; carefully reason through each choice step-by-step.
## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step, considering the most restrictive constraints first:
1. Nessa must lead an afternoon session. This eliminates her from the two morning slots Julio and Kevin are assigned to.
2. Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions on the same day. Since Kevin has a morning session, Rebecca must have the afternoon session that same day. 
3. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions on the same day. 
4. Julio's session must be on an earlier day than Olivia's.
Now let's consider each answer choice:
A: Lan's session meets Wednesday morning. 
This would mean Olivia has to lead the Thursday or Friday session. That works, so this could be true.
B: Lan's session meets Thursday afternoon.
If Lan is Thursday afternoon, Olivia has to be Wednesday or Friday. Julio is in the morning before Olivia, so Julio, Kevin and Rebecca fill the Wednesday or Friday slots. This schedule works without violating constraints, so this could be true.
C: Nessa's session meets Friday afternoon. 
Nessa must be in the afternoon. If she's Friday afternoon, Julio and Kevin are Wednesday or Thursday morning. Rebecca is the same day afternoon as Kevin. Lan and Olivia fill the remaining slots without being on the same day. This works, so it could be true.
D: Olivia's session meets Thursday morning.
If Olivia is Thursday morning, Julio must be Wednesday morning to be earlier. But Kevin is also in a morning slot and must be the same day as Rebecca. That only leaves Friday for Kevin, Rebecca and Lan. But Rebecca needs to be in the afternoon, and Nessa has the only afternoon slot. This violates the constraints, so this CANNOT be true.
E: Olivia's session meets Friday morning.
With Olivia on Friday, Julio must be Wednesday or Thursday morning. Kevin gets the other morning, with Rebecca that same afternoon. Lan and Nessa get the remaining slots without conflict. So this could be true.
Action: Answer("D")
