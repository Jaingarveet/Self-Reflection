Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.

## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The pharmacy must be at one end, and a restaurant at the other end. 
2. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two businesses.
3. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. 
4. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
5. We're told the optometrist is next to the shoe store. Let's call this pair OS.
Now, what businesses could be on either side of the OS pair to satisfy the constraints?
- It can't be the two restaurants, as they need at least two businesses between them.
- The pharmacy must be at one end, so it could be on one side of OS. 
- If the pharmacy is on one side, the other side can't be the veterinarian (as the pharmacy must be next to the optometrist or veterinarian). 
- The other side also can't be the toy store, as that would put the veterinarian next to the toy store.
So if the pharmacy is on one side of OS, the other side must be a restaurant. This satisfies all the constraints.
Therefore, the correct answer is:
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
