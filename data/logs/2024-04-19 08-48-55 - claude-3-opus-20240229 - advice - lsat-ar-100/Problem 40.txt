Context: A shopping center has exactly seven spaces—space 1 through space 7—arranged in a straight row. Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
Question: If the shoe store is in space 2, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: The optometrist is in space 5.
  B: The pharmacy is in space 1.
  C: A restaurant is in space 3.
  D: The toy store is in space 6.
  E: The veterinarian is in space 4.

Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Advice:
 - Always consider all possibilities before drawing conclusions.
 - Make sure to satisfy all given constraints in your analysis.
 - Work through each constraint systematically.
 - Eliminate choices only when they clearly violate constraints.
 - In arrangement problems, try constructing concrete examples to test possibilities.
## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step, considering each constraint:
1. The pharmacy must be at one end (space 1 or 7) and a restaurant at the other end. 
2. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
3. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. 
4. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
5. The shoe store is given to be in space 2.
With the shoe store in space 2, the pharmacy must be in space 1 to satisfy constraint 1. This eliminates choice A.
If the pharmacy is in space 1, then by constraint 3, either the optometrist or veterinarian must be in space 2. But space 2 is occupied by the shoe store. So the optometrist or veterinarian must be in space 3.
By constraint 4, if the veterinarian is in space 3, then the toy store cannot be in space 4. 
But if the optometrist is in space 3, the toy store could be in space 4, 5 or 6 without violating any constraints.
So choice D, "The toy store is in space 6", is a possibility that does not violate any constraints.
The other choices can be eliminated:
B is false because the pharmacy must be in space 1, not 7, if the shoe store is in space 2.
C is false because space 3 must be the optometrist or veterinarian, not a restaurant.
E is false because the veterinarian cannot be next to the toy store.
Therefore, the correct answer is choice D.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
