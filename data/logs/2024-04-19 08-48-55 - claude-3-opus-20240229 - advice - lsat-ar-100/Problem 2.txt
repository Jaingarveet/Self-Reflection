Topic: Law
Context: A shopping center has exactly seven spaces—space 1 through space 7—arranged in a straight row. Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
Question: Which one of the following, if substituted for the constraint that the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, would have the same effect in determining the locations of the businesses?
Choices:
  A: A restaurant must be in either space 3, space 4, or space 5.
  B: A restaurant must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  C: Either the toy store or the veterinarian must be somewhere between the two restaurants.
  D: No more than two businesses can separate the pharmacy and the restaurant nearest it.
  E: The optometrist cannot be next to the shoe store.

## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
The original constraint is that the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. This means there must be at least 3 spaces between the restaurants.
Looking at each answer choice:
A) If a restaurant must be in space 3, 4, or 5, this would put the restaurants next to each other or only 1 space apart. This is not equivalent to the original constraint. 
B) The pharmacy must be next to the optometrist or veterinarian, not a restaurant. This contradicts the given constraints.
C) If the toy store or veterinarian is between the restaurants, that would mean the restaurants are separated by only 1 business. This is not the same as being separated by at least 2 businesses.
D) If no more than 2 businesses separate the pharmacy and nearest restaurant, the restaurants could still be only 1 business apart (if the pharmacy is at one end and a restaurant is 2 spaces away). This allows arrangements prohibited by the original constraint.
E) The location of the optometrist and shoe store is not directly relevant to the separation of the restaurants. Prohibiting them from being adjacent does not have the same effect as requiring the restaurants to have at least 2 businesses between them.
After analyzing each choice, none of them have the exact same effect as the original constraint about the separation of the restaurants.
Action: Answer("E")
