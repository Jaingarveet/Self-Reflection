Context: A maintenance company that takes service requests from three clients—Image, Solide, and Truvest—plans to set targets for its average service response times. Service targets will be set at 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day. Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail. The six targets are set according to the following conditions: None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
Question: Which one of the following targets CANNOT be set for more than one of the clients?
Choices:
  A: a 1-day website target
  B: a 2-day voicemail target

## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The question is asking which target cannot be set for more than one client. So I need to figure out which targets are possible for each client, and see if there are any that only one client can have.
2. Image's voicemail target must be the shortest. The shortest possible target is 1 day. So Image's targets could be:
   Voicemail: 1 day, Website: 1 day, 2 days or 3 days
3. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's. So Solide's and Truvest's targets could be:
   Solide - Voicemail: 2 or 3 days, Website: 1 or 2 days 
   Truvest - Voicemail: 2 or 3 days, Website: 2 or 3 days
4. Looking at the possible targets:
   - A 1-day website target could apply to Image and Solide
   - A 2-day voicemail target could apply to Solide and Truvest 
   - A 2-day website target could apply to any client
   - A 3-day voicemail target could apply to Solide and Truvest
   - A 3-day website target can only apply to Truvest, since Image and Solide must have shorter website than voicemail targets
Therefore, the only target that cannot be set for more than one client is a 3-day website target.
