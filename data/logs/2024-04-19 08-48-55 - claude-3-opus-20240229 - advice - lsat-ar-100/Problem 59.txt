Context: At a concert, exactly eight compositions—F, H, L, O, P, R, S, and T—are to be performed exactly once each, consecutively and one composition at a time. The order of their performance must satisfy the following conditions: T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R. At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F. O is performed either first or fifth. The eighth composition performed is either L or H. P is performed at some time before S. At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
Question: P CANNOT be performed
Choices:
  A: second
  B: third
  C: fourth
  D: sixth
  E: seventh

Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Advice:
- Always consider all given conditions when solving a problem.
- Break down the problem into smaller, manageable parts.
- Analyze the implications of each condition on the problem's solution.
- Systematically work through each possible scenario to find the correct answer.
- Double-check your reasoning to ensure you haven't overlooked any important details.
## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step, considering all the given conditions:
1. T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.
2. At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F. 
3. O is performed either first or fifth.
4. The eighth composition performed is either L or H.
5. P is performed at some time before S.
6. At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
Now, let's break it down:
- If O is first, then S must be after the fifth position (due to condition 6). 
- P must be before S (condition 5).
- The eighth composition is L or H (condition 4).
- T must be next to either F or R (condition 1).
- There must be at least two compositions between F and R (condition 2).
Considering all this, P cannot be seventh because:
- If P is seventh, S must be eighth. 
- But the eighth composition must be L or H.
- So P cannot be seventh.
P also cannot be sixth, because:
- If P is sixth and S is seventh, the eighth composition would have to be L or H.
- But there would be no room to satisfy the condition of having at least two compositions between F and R.
Therefore, the two positions that P cannot occupy are sixth and seventh.
