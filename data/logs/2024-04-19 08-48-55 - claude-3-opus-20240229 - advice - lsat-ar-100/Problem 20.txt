Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Advice:
 - Always carefully read and identify all scheduling conditions and restrictions.
 - Always consider conditional restrictions and how one person's scheduled slot impacts others.
 - Work through the schedule systematically, filling in the most restricted slots first.
 - Continually check the evolving schedule against the conditions to ensure validity.
 - If a condition is violated, backtrack and revise the schedule until all conditions are met.
 - Double-check the final schedule against all conditions before finalizing your answer.
## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step, taking into account the scheduling conditions and restrictions:
1. Tuesday is the only day George can report. So George must report on Tuesday, either morning or afternoon.
2. Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports. So if they report, it must be in the morning. 
3. If Nina reports, then the next day both Helen and Irving must report (unless Nina reports on Wednesday). 
4. Kyle and Lenore are not reporting.
5. There must be exactly 2 reports per day, 1 in the morning and 1 in the afternoon.
Let's start filling in the schedule, being mindful of the restrictions:
- Tuesday morning must be George. That's the only slot he can take.
- Monday morning could be Olivia or Robert since they can only do mornings. Let's tentatively put Robert on Monday morning.
- If Nina reports Wednesday, then Helen and Irving must report on a non-existent Thursday. So Nina cannot report Wednesday. She must report Monday or Tuesday.
- If Nina reports Monday afternoon, then Helen and Irving must report Tuesday. But George has to report Tuesday. So Nina cannot report Monday. 
- Nina must report Tuesday afternoon. That puts Helen and Irving on Wednesday.
Checking the final schedule:
Monday morning: Robert
Monday afternoon: [someone]
Tuesday morning: George 
Tuesday afternoon: Nina
Wednesday morning: Helen
Wednesday afternoon: Irving
This matches choice E: Robert, George, and Helen give the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday respectively.
Action: Answer("E")
