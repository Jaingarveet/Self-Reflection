## System:
You are an expert in Law.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## User 2:
Topic: Law
Context: Exactly five witnesses—Franco, Garcia, Hong, Iturbe, and Jackson—are to be scheduled to testify at a hearing that is to take exactly three days of one week—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Each witness testifies on exactly one day of the hearing. The schedule must meet the following conditions: Franco does not testify on the same day that Garcia testifies. Iturbe testifies on Wednesday. Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday. Hong does not testify on Monday. At least one witness testifies on Monday.
Question: Which one of the following CANNOT be true of the schedule?
Choices:
  A: Franco is the only witness scheduled to testify on Monday.
  B: Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Iturbe.
  C: Garcia and Hong are both scheduled to testify on Tuesday.
  D: Garcia is the only witness scheduled to testify on Monday and Hong is one of two witnesses scheduled to testify on Wednesday.
  E: Jackson is scheduled to testify on Tuesday and two witnesses are scheduled to testify on Monday.
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Advice:
- Always read the constraints carefully and identify the non-negotiable ones.
- Consider the implications of each constraint on the possible scenarios.
- Methodically test each answer choice against the constraints.
- Be careful not to introduce unstated assumptions.
- Double-check that your answer does not introduce any constraint violations.
## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
The key constraints are:
1. Franco and Garcia cannot testify on the same day
2. Iturbe must testify on Wednesday 
3. Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday
4. Hong cannot testify on Monday
5. At least one witness must testify on Monday
Now let's consider each answer choice:
A: If Franco is the only witness on Monday, this satisfies constraints 1, 4 and 5. It's possible.
B: If Franco testifies on Wednesday with Iturbe, this satisfies constraint 1. It's possible. 
C: If Garcia and Hong both testify Tuesday, this satisfies constraints 1, 3 and 4. It's possible.
D: If Garcia is the only witness Monday, this violates constraint 1 since Franco would have to also testify Monday. This is impossible.
E: If Jackson testifies Tuesday and two testify Monday, this satisfies all constraints. It's possible.
Therefore, the only scenario that CANNOT be true is D.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: E
Score: 0
