Context: Exactly eight books—F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O—are placed on a bookcase with exactly three shelves—the top shelf, the middle shelf, and the bottom shelf. At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.
Question: If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: F and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  B: G and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  C: H and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  D: I and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  E: K and O are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Advice:
 - Carefully read and understand all the given conditions before starting to place books.
 - Break down the problem into smaller steps, placing books one at a time based on the given conditions.
 - Use the process of elimination to determine the positions of books that are not explicitly mentioned in the conditions.
 - Always double-check your final arrangement to ensure it satisfies all the given conditions.
 - Be flexible in your thinking and ready to adjust your reasoning if a contradiction arises.
## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. More books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. So the bottom shelf must have at least 3 books.
2. I is on the middle shelf. 
3. K is on a higher shelf than F. And F is on the same shelf as M. So K must be on the top shelf, while F and M are together on either the middle or bottom shelf.
4. O is on a higher shelf than L. 
5. The key condition: L is on a higher shelf than H. 
   This means the order from top to bottom is: K, O, L, H (not necessarily next to each other).
6. Since I is on the middle shelf, and K is on the top shelf, O must also be on the top shelf with K.
7. L and H must be on the bottom shelf, since L is above H but below O.
8. F and M must be on the middle shelf with I, since they can't be with K on top or with L and H on bottom.
9. This leaves only G, which must go on the bottom shelf to have at least 3 books there.
So the arrangement is:
- Top: K, O  
- Middle: I, F, M
- Bottom: L, H, G
Therefore, G and H are placed on the same shelf (bottom).
Action: Answer("B")
