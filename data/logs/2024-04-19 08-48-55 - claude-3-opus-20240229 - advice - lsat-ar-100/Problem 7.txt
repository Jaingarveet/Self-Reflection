Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Advice:
 - Always consider all possible scenarios before concluding that something is impossible.
 - Eliminate answer choices that are not certain conclusions based on the given information.
 - If a question asks what must be true, look for the answer choice that is true in all possible scenarios.
 - Be careful not to make unwarranted assumptions or inferences beyond what the information strictly implies.
 - In scheduling problems, start with the most constrained elements and work towards the less constrained ones.
## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. We know Iturbe testifies on Wednesday. 
2. Jackson is the only one testifying on Monday, so that leaves Franco, Garcia and Hong to testify on Tuesday and Wednesday.
3. Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday. Since Iturbe is on Wednesday, that means the other Wednesday slot must be filled by either Franco, Garcia or Hong.
4. Franco and Garcia cannot testify on the same day. So if one is on Tuesday, the other must be on Wednesday. 
5. Hong does not testify on Monday, so he must testify on either Tuesday or Wednesday.
Let's consider the possibilities:
- If Franco testifies on Tuesday, then Garcia must testify on Wednesday (along with Iturbe). That would leave Hong to testify on Tuesday. 
- If Garcia testifies on Tuesday, then Franco must testify on Wednesday (along with Iturbe). Again, Hong would testify on Tuesday.
- If Hong testifies on Wednesday, then both Franco and Garcia would have to testify on Tuesday. But that's not possible since they can't testify on the same day.
Therefore, the only possible scenarios are:
- Monday: Jackson, Tuesday: Franco & Hong, Wednesday: Garcia & Iturbe
- Monday: Jackson, Tuesday: Garcia & Hong, Wednesday: Franco & Iturbe
In both scenarios, Hong testifies on Tuesday. This is the only thing that must be true.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
