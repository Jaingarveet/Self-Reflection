Context: A chemistry class has six lab sessions scheduled over three days—Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday—one session heing held each morning and one each afternoon. Each session will be led by a different lab assistant—Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, or Rebecca. The assignment of lab assistants to sessions is constrained as follows: Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day. Nessa must lead an afternoon session. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
Question: If Lan does not lead a Wednesday session, then which one of the following lab assistants must lead a Thursday session?
Choices:
  A: Rebecca
  B: Olivia
  C: Nessa
  D: Kevin
  E: Julio
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and make sure you understand all the given constraints.
 - Be careful not to make any assumptions that are not explicitly stated in the problem.
 - When dealing with multiple constraints, start with the most restrictive ones and work your way down.
 - Consider each constraint separately and in combination with others to ensure no conflicts arise.
 - If you reach a contradiction, don't be afraid to backtrack and reconsider previous steps.
 - Double-check your reasoning to ensure that your conclusion follows logically from the given constraints.
## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions on the same day. 
2. If Lan does not lead a Wednesday session, then Olivia must lead a Wednesday session (to avoid being on the same day as Lan).
3. Julio's session must be earlier in the week than Olivia's. So if Olivia leads on Wednesday, Julio must lead a session on Wednesday morning (the only earlier slot).
4. Nessa must lead an afternoon session. The remaining afternoon slots are Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.
5. Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions on the same day. With Julio and Olivia on Wednesday, and Lan on Thursday or Friday, the only way for Kevin and Rebecca to lead on the same day is if they both lead on Thursday.
Therefore, if Lan does not lead a Wednesday session, then both Kevin and Rebecca must lead Thursday sessions.
Action: Answer("D")
