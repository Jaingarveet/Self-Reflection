Context: At a concert, exactly eight compositions—F, H, L, O, P, R, S, and T—are to be performed exactly once each, consecutively and one composition at a time. The order of their performance must satisfy the following conditions: T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R. At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F. O is performed either first or fifth. The eighth composition performed is either L or H. P is performed at some time before S. At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
Question: If P is performed third and S is performed sixth, the composition performed fifth must be either
Choices:
  A: F or H
  B: F or O
  C: F or T

 - Consider multiple possibilities when conditions allow for them.
 - Eliminate possibilities only when they clearly violate a condition.

## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step considering the conditions:
1. T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R. 
2. At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
3. O is performed either first or fifth. 
4. The eighth composition performed is either L or H.
5. P is performed at some time before S. 
6. At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
We're also told that P is 3rd and S is 6th. 
From condition 3, since P is 3rd, O must be 5th (it can only be 1st or 5th).
Condition 6 is satisfied since there is one composition (P) after O and before S.
Condition 5 is satisfied since P (3rd) is before S (6th).
Condition 4 means either L or H is 8th. This leaves the other one to be either 2nd, 4th or 7th.
From 1 and 2, we can deduce that either:
- F is 1st, R is 4th, and T is 5th, or 
- R is 5th, F is 8th, and T is 4th or 7th
But we know O is 5th, so the first scenario is impossible. 
Therefore, R must be 5th, F must be 8th, and T must be 4th or 7th.
In summary:
1. ?
2. L or H
3. P
4. T or ?
5. O
6. S 
7. T or ?
8. F (L or H)
The only possible composition for the 5th position is O.
