Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and make sure you understand what it is asking for.
 - Focus on identifying necessary conditions that must be true in all valid scenarios, rather than getting caught up in constructing specific scenarios.
 - Analyze each constraint separately to determine what it implies must be true in all cases.
 - Remember that a statement is only necessarily true if it holds in all possible scenarios that satisfy the given constraints.
 - Avoid overspecifying the problem by adding unwarranted assumptions or details.
 - If you're unsure, try to disprove an answer choice by constructing a counterexample scenario where it doesn't hold.
## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step, focusing on what the constraints necessarily imply must be true in all valid scenarios:
1. The organizer must select at least 5 works total. 
2. No more than 4 French works can be selected. This means at least 1 Russian work must be selected.
3. At least 3 but no more than 4 novels must be selected. If only 3 novels are selected, both plays must be selected to reach the minimum of 5 works total.
4. At least as many French novels as Russian novels must be selected. This means the number of French novels is ≥ the number of Russian novels.
5. If both French plays are selected, the Russian play cannot be selected. 
Looking at the answer choices:
A) One French novel and one French play are not necessarily selected, e.g. if 3 French novels, 1 Russian novel and the Russian play are chosen.
B) The Russian play is not necessarily selected, e.g. if 3 French novels and 2 Russian novels are chosen. 
C) One Russian novel and one French play are not necessarily selected together, e.g. if 3 French novels and 2 Russian novels are chosen.
D) Two French novels must be selected. If only 1 French novel was selected, then 0 Russian novels could be selected (violating constraint 4), meaning ≤2 novels total (violating constraint 3).
E) Two Russian novels are not necessarily selected, e.g. if 3 French novels, 1 Russian novel and 1 French play are chosen.
Therefore, the only statement that must be true is D) Two French novels.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
