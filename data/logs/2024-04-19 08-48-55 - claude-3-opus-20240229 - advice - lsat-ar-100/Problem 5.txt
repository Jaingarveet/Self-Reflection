## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step, considering all the given conditions:
1. There are 8 books (F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O) and 3 shelves (top, middle, bottom). 
2. At least 2 books are on each shelf.
3. More books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
4. I is on the middle shelf. 
5. K is on a higher shelf than F.
6. O is on a higher shelf than L.
7. F and M are on the same shelf.
Now, let's consider each answer choice:
A) We don't know the relative positions of O and M. Insufficient information to conclude this.
B) We don't know the relative positions of K and G. Insufficient information to conclude this.
C) We know I is on the middle shelf. F and M are on the same shelf, which must be the bottom shelf (as there are more books on the bottom than top, and K is higher than F). So I is definitely higher than F.
D) We don't know the relative positions of G and O. Insufficient information to conclude this.
E) We know O is higher than L, but we don't know if F is higher or lower than L. Insufficient information to conclude this.
Therefore, the only statement that must be true based on the given information is C: I is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf F is placed on.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
