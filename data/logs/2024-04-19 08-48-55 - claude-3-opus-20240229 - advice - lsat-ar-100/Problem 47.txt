Topic: Law
Context: A maintenance company that takes service requests from three clients—Image, Solide, and Truvest—plans to set targets for its average service response times. Service targets will be set at 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day. Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail. The six targets are set according to the following conditions: None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
Question: If Image's website target is 2 days, which one of the following targets must also be 2 days?
Choices:
  A: Image's voicemail target
  B: Solide's website target
  C: Solide's voicemail target
  D: Truvest's website target
  E: Truvest's voicemail target

## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The key conditions are:
   - No client's website target can be longer than its voicemail target
   - Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets
   - Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target
2. We're told Image's website target is 2 days. 
3. Since no website target can be longer than the voicemail target, Image's voicemail target must be either 2 days or 1 day to satisfy this condition.
4. But Image's voicemail target also has to be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. 
5. So Image's voicemail target cannot be 2 days, because then it would not be possible for it to be shorter than both Solide's and Truvest's voicemail targets (as they can only be 1, 2 or 3 days).
6. Therefore, Image's voicemail target must be 1 day. This is the only way to satisfy the conditions that Image's voicemail target is not longer than its 2-day website target, and is also shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
7. None of the other options can be definitively determined from the given information and conditions.
Action: Answer("A")
