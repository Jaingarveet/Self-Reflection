Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

## User 2:
Topic: Law
Context: A loading dock consists of exactly six bays numbered 1 through 6 consecutively from one side of the dock to the other. Each bay is holding a different one of exactly six types of cargoâ€”fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles. The following apply: The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock. The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles. The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel. The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
Question: If bay 4 is holding produce, then for exactly how many of the six bays is the type of cargo that bay is holding completely determined?
Choices:
  A: two
  B: three
  C: four
  D: five
  E: six
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Advice:
 - Always carefully read and consider all given information in a problem.
 - Break the problem down into steps, applying each piece of information or constraint one at a time.
 - Consider the implications of each piece of information fully before moving on.
 - If you're able to narrow something down to a few options, don't stop there - see if the remaining constraints allow you to make a definitive determination.
 - Be thorough in your analysis and don't stop reasoning prematurely.
 - If the question asks for a count or a specific answer, make sure your final response directly addresses that.
## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step, applying the constraints one at a time:
1. Bay 4 is holding produce. This definitively determines bay 4's cargo.
2. Textiles must be next to produce. Since produce is in bay 4, textiles must be in either bay 3 or bay 5. This narrows it down but doesn't definitively determine the location of textiles yet.
3. Livestock has a lower number than grain. This tells us livestock and grain can't be in bays 5 or 6, as one of those must be textiles. But it doesn't definitively place livestock or grain.
4. Livestock has a higher number than textiles. Since textiles is in bay 3 or 5, this means livestock must be in whichever one of those textiles isn't in. So if textiles is in 3, livestock is in 5, and vice versa. This definitively determines the locations of both textiles and livestock.
5. Produce has a higher number than fuel. We know produce is in bay 4, so fuel must be in bay 1, 2, or 3. The only one of those not already determined is bay 2, so fuel must be in bay 2. This definitively determines the location of fuel.
6. The only two cargos left are machinery and grain. We determined above that grain must be in bay 5 or 6. The only one of those not definitively determined to be holding something else is bay 6, so grain must be in bay 6 and machinery must be in bay 1 by process of elimination. This definitively determines the locations of the final two cargos.
In summary, the locations definitively determined are:
Bay 1: Machinery 
Bay 2: Fuel
Bay 3: Textiles
Bay 4: Produce
Bay 5: Livestock
Bay 6: Grain
Therefore, the type of cargo is completely determined for all six bays.
Action: Answer("E")
