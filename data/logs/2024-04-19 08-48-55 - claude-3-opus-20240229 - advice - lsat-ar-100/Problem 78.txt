You are an expert in Law.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## User 2:
Topic: Law
Context: Of the eight students—George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert—in a seminar, exactly six will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
Question: If George, Nina, and Robert give reports and they do so on different days from one another, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Helen gives a report on Wednesday.
  B: Nina gives a report on Monday.
  C: Nina gives a report on Tuesday.
  D: Olivia gives a report on Monday.
  E: Robert gives a report on Wednesday.
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Advice:
 - Always carefully read and re-read the question and constraints.
 - Always consider each answer choice methodically.
 - Always try to construct concrete scenarios to test each answer choice.
 - Never assume an answer is impossible until you have thoroughly tried to find a valid scenario.
 - Always double-check that your chosen scenario satisfies all the given constraints.
 - Remember that for "could be true" questions, you only need to find one possible valid scenario.
## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step, keeping in mind the advice to carefully consider each answer choice and construct concrete scenarios to test them.
Given:
- George, Nina, and Robert give reports on different days from each other.
- George can only report on Tuesday.
- Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports.
- If Nina reports, then the next day Helen and Irving must both report, unless Nina reports on Wednesday.
Let's consider each answer choice:
A) Helen gives a report on Wednesday.
   Scenario: George (Tue), Nina (Mon), Robert (Wed morning), Helen (Wed afternoon)
   This works, so A could be true.
B) Nina gives a report on Monday.
   Scenario: Nina (Mon), George (Tue), Robert (Wed morning), Helen (Tue), Irving (Tue) 
   This satisfies all constraints, so B could be true.
C) Nina gives a report on Tuesday.
   If Nina reports Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must report Wednesday. But George must report Tuesday, so this violates the constraint of exactly two reports per day. C cannot be true.
D) Olivia gives a report on Monday.
   Scenario: Olivia (Mon morning), Nina (Mon afternoon), George (Tue), Robert (Wed morning)
   This works, so D could be true.
E) Robert gives a report on Wednesday.
   Scenario: Nina (Mon), George (Tue), Robert (Wed morning), Helen (Wed afternoon)
   This satisfies all constraints, so E could be true.
In summary, A, B, D, and E could all be true. C is the only choice that cannot be true.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
