Okay, let's think through this step-by-step and systematically check each answer choice against all the given requirements:
The key requirements are:
1. Select 5-6 works total
2. No more than 4 French works 
3. 3-4 novels
4. At least as many French novels as Russian novels
5. If both French plays are selected, the Russian play is not selected
A: 1 French novel, 2 Russian novels, 1 French play, 1 Russian play
- 5 works total (satisfies requirement 1)
- 2 French works (satisfies requirement 2) 
- 3 novels (satisfies requirement 3)
- Fewer French novels than Russian novels (violates requirement 4)
So A is not a valid selection.
B: 2 French novels, 1 Russian novel, 2 French plays, 1 Russian play
- 6 works total (satisfies requirement 1) 
- 4 French works (satisfies requirement 2)
- 3 novels (satisfies requirement 3)
- More French novels than Russian novels (satisfies requirement 4) 
- Both French plays are selected along with the Russian play (violates requirement 5)
So B is not a valid selection.
C: 2 French novels, 2 Russian novels, 2 French plays
- 6 works total (satisfies requirement 1)
- 4 French works (satisfies requirement 2)
- 4 novels (satisfies requirement 3) 
- Equal number of French and Russian novels (satisfies requirement 4)
- Both French plays selected, Russian play not selected (satisfies requirement 5)
C satisfies all the requirements, so it could be a valid selection.
D: 3 French novels, 1 Russian novel, 2 French plays
- 6 works total (satisfies requirement 1)
- 5 French works (violates requirement 2)
So D is not a valid selection.
E: 3 French novels, 2 Russian novels, 1 Russian play
- 6 works total (satisfies requirement 1)
- 3 French works (satisfies requirement 2)
- 5 novels (violates requirement 3)
So E is not a valid selection.
After systematically checking each choice against all the requirements, only C satisfies every single constraint. 
Action: Answer("C")
