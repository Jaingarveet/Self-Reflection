Context: Exactly eight books—F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O—are placed on a bookcase with exactly three shelves—the top shelf, the middle shelf, and the bottom shelf. At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.
Question: It is fully determined which of the shelves each of the books is placed on if which one of the following is true?
Choices:
  A: I and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  B: K and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  C: L and F are placed on the same shelf as each other.

## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
The given information is:
- 8 books (F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O) on 3 shelves 
- At least 2 books per shelf
- More books on bottom shelf than top shelf
- I is on the middle shelf
- K is on a higher shelf than F
- O is on a higher shelf than L
- F and M are on the same shelf
Since I is on the middle shelf, that leaves 7 books to arrange on the top and bottom shelves. 
More books must be on the bottom than top. So the only possible arrangements are:
2 books on top, 5 on bottom
3 books on top, 4 on bottom
F and M must be together. K must be higher than F. O must be higher than L.
Let's consider each choice:
A) If I and M are on the same (middle) shelf, then F is also middle. But then we can't determine if K and O are top or bottom. Eliminates A.
B) If K and G are on the same shelf, they could be either top or middle (above F). Can't fully determine. Eliminates B.
C) If L and F are on the same (bottom) shelf, then M is also bottom. K and O must be higher, so middle or top. Still can't fully determine. Eliminates C.
D) If M and H are on the same shelf as F (bottom), then L is also bottom. That's 5 books bottom. O and K must be middle and top in some order, with G on the remaining shelf. This fully determines the arrangement! 
E) If H and O are on the same shelf, they could be either middle or top. Can't fully determine. Eliminates E.
Therefore, the correct answer is D. If M and H are on the same shelf as F, the shelves for all books are fully determined.
Action: Answer("D")
