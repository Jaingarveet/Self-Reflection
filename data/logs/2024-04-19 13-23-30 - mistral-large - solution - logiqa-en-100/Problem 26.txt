Topic: Logic
Context: The late famous logician Jin Yuelin of China heard the words "Money is like dung" and "Friends are worth a thousand dollars" when he was a child, and found that there are logical problems because they can lead to the absurd conclusion of "friends are like dung".
Question: Since the conclusion of "friends like dung" is not true, it can be logically derived?
Choices:
  A: The expression "money is like dung" is false.
  B: If a friend is indeed worth a lot of money, then money is not like dung.
  C: The statement that "friends are valuable" is true.
  D: The words "Money is like dung" and "Friends are worth a thousand dollars" are either true or false.

Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
The conclusion "friends are like dung" is derived from the two statements "money is like dung" and "friends are worth a thousand dollars" by substituting the value of money with dung. However, this substitution is not logically valid because the two statements are not equivalent.

The first statement "money is like dung" is a metaphorical comparison, while the second statement "friends are worth a thousand dollars" is a literal valuation. The two statements are not logically related, and therefore, the conclusion "friends are like dung" is not logically derived.

However, if a friend is indeed worth a lot of money, then money is not like dung. Therefore, the answer is "[REDACTED]".
