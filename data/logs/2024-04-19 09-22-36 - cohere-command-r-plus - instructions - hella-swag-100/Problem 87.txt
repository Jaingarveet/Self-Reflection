Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to keep a cat out of potted plants [title] Use stones or rocks. [step] If you're struggling to keep your cat out of potted plants, a barrier method may be your best option to keep him out of the soil. Some owners find using rocks or stones can be a fun, aesthetically pleasing option.
Choices:
  A: A rock can be placed on the ground next to the plant that prevents your cat from accidentally planting it underneath the plant. [substeps] If you have your own small potted plant, try placing one rock or twig inside each plant.
  B: Block off any spaces around plant entrances to potted plants with rocks. [substeps] Make sure to check under the plants for broken glass, broken twigs, or other debris.
  C: [substeps] Lay the rocks around the base of the plant, making sure not to crush any stems or dig up the roots. When you water, the water should easily slip through the cracks of the rocks and get through to the soil.
  D: You can also create a barrier by setting up flat stones or pieces of furniture in small areas that your cat will be unable to easily get to. [substeps] Placing hidden objects above or below the plants is another suggestion.

## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The text describes a method of using stones or rocks to create a barrier that prevents cats from accessing potted plants.
Choice A suggests placing a rock next to the plant, which doesn't create an effective barrier.
Choice B mentions blocking spaces around plant entrances, which is not relevant to potted plants.
Choice C describes placing rocks around the base of the plant, creating a barrier while also allowing water to reach the soilâ€”this is a logical and coherent completion of the text.
Choice D refers to using flat stones or furniture, which may not be aesthetically pleasing or easily integrated with the rock/stone method described.

Based on the provided information and the context of creating an aesthetically pleasing and functional barrier, choice C is the most suitable completion for the text.
