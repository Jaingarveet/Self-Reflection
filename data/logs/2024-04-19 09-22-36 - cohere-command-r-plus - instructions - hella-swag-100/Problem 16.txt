## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The text advises talking to a true friend about concerns regarding a potential frenemy.

Choice A suggests confiding in someone who is unlike the frenemy, implying that similar people might not be supportive when discussing negative topics. This doesn't align with the text's advice to seek support from a trusted friend, regardless of their personality type.

Choice B recommends journaling, which is unrelated to the topic and doesn't address the risks of confiding in the wrong person.

Choice C suggests being open with the frenemy, which contradicts the text's warning about potential frenemies.

Choice D cautions against choosing a confidante who might betray your trust by sharing your concerns with the frenemy. It aligns with the text's theme of being cautious and selective when confiding in someone, avoiding potential risks to yourself and your relationships.
Action: Answer("D")
