## Assistant 2:
Self-reflection:
I previously answered the question incorrectly because I did not consider the temperature of the surface. I assumed that the water vapor would condense, but this is only true if the surface is above the freezing point of water. If the surface is below the freezing point, the water vapor will sublime.
Solution:
The water vapor in the air has sublimated.
