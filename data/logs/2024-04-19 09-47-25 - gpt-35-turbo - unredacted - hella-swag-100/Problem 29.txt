Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to get rid of chilblains [title] Use calamine lotion or witch hazel for itching. [step] Chilblains can be extremely itchy, but scratching them may result in an infection. To ease the itchiness of chilblains without scratching, apply some calamine lotion or witch hazel onto your chilblains using a cotton ball.
Choices:
  A: This will leave your chilblains feeling soft and soothing. [substeps] Do not use witch hazel or similar products if you have sensitive skin.
  B: Let it sit on the itchy rash for up to 5 minutes. [substeps] You can also purchase witch hazel at a pharmacy or physician's office.
  C: Both work well, so use whichever you have on hand. [substeps] Don't rub the lotion or witch hazel into your chilblains.
  D: Repeat this cycle every day for up to three days until the itch is gone. [substeps] If you are not used to scratching or do not want to seek medical treatment for an itch, ask your doctor to prescribe.

Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I incorrectly chose answer choice A because it seemed to provide additional information about the benefits of using calamine lotion or witch hazel. However, the text did not ask for additional information, but rather the most likely completion to the text. Answer choice C is the most likely completion because it provides a clear and concise statement that both calamine lotion and witch hazel work well, and it includes a substep to not rub the lotion or witch hazel into the chilblains.
