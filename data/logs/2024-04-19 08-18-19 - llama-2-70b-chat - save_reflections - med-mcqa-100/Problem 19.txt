## Get Reflection:
  Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I misunderstood the term "red infarcts." I associated it with inflammation and infection, which led me to choose the spleen as the correct answer. However, "red infarcts" actually refer to a specific type of lung injury that is characterized by the formation of red, consolidated lung tissue. This type of injury is often caused by bacterial or viral infections, such as pneumonia.
