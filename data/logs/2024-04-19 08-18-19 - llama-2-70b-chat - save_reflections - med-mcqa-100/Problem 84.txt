## Get Reflection:
  Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I confused the mechanism of action of Brinzolamide with that of Timolol, Pilocarpine, and Brimonidine.
I knew that Brinzolamide increases the outflow of aqueous humor, but I mistakenly thought it did so by reducing the production of aqueous humor, like the other three medications.
In reality, Brinzolamide works by increasing the permeability of the trabecular meshwork, allowing more aqueous humor to flow out of the eye.
Error Keywords:
- Confusion
- Misunderstanding
- Lack of attention to detail
Solution:
I should have carefully read the question and considered the mechanism of action of each medication before answering.
I should have known that Brinzolamide works by increasing the outflow of aqueous humor through the trabecular meshwork, not by reducing its production.
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and understand the mechanism of action of each medication.
2. Consider the specific action of each medication on the aqueous outflow.
3. Choose the medication that increases the outflow of aqueous humor through the trabecular meshwork.
Advice:
- Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
- Pay attention to the specific mechanism of action of each medication.
- Consider the specific action of each medication on the aqueous outflow.
- Double-check your answer to ensure it matches the correct mechanism of action.
