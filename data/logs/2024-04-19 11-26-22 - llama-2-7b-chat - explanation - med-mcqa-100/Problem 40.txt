Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question by selecting option [REDACTED], which is [REDACTED].

The correct answer is option [REDACTED], which is [REDACTED].

I misunderstood the question and thought that all of the options were enzymes produced and secreted by the liver. However, [REDACTED] (Alanine Aminotransferase) is an enzyme produced by the liver, but it is not secreted into the bloodstream. [REDACTED] (Aspartate Aminotransferase) is also an enzyme produced by the liver, but it is not secreted into the bloodstream. [REDACTED] (Alanine Transaminase) is an enzyme produced by the liver and secreted into the bloodstream.
## Assistant 2:

I previously answered this question incorrectly, selecting option [REDACTED], which is [REDACTED].
