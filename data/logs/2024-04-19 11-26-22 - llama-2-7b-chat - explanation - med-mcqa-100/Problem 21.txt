Question: Senescent RBC's are mainly attacked in-
Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I have reflected on the problem, my solution, and the correct answer.

The correct answer is (C) Plasmodium quartanum.

Explanation:
I mistakenly identified Plasmodium falciparum as the type of malaria that affects senescent RBCs. However, Plasmodium quartanum is the species that primarily infects senescent RBCs.

Plasmodium quartanum is a less severe form of malaria that is typically found in areas with temperate climates. It is characterized by a longer incubation period and a lower fever compared to other forms of malaria.

In contrast, Plasmodium falciparum is the most severe form of malaria and can cause severe anemia, organ failure, and death if left untreated.

I hope this reflection helps me provide the correct answer this time.
