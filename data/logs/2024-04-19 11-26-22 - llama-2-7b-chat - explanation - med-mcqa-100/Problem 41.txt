## Assistant 2:
  Thought: I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I want to use my self-reflection to help me get the correct answer this time.

Action: I will carefully review the choices and consider the properties of each agent used in chemical peeling.

Reflection:

* Glycolic acid is an alpha-hydroxy acid that is commonly used in chemical peeling to exfoliate the skin and improve its texture and appearance.
* Kojic acid is a beta-hydroxy acid that is derived from mushrooms and is used in chemical peeling to lighten the skin and reduce the appearance of dark spots.
* Phenol is a strong alpha-hydroxy acid that is used in chemical peeling to remove the outer layers of the skin and promote new collagen production.

Based on my reflection, the correct answer is (D) Salicylic acid. Salicylic acid is a beta-hydroxy acid that is commonly used in chemical peeling to exfoliate the skin and unclog pores. It is also used to treat conditions such as acne, psoriasis, and eczema.

Action: I will answer the question by selecting (D) Salicylic acid as the agent used in chemical peeling that is not listed.
## Result:
Agent Answer: None
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
