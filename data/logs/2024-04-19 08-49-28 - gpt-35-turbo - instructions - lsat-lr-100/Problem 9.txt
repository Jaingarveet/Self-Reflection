## System:
You are an expert in Law.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Law
Context: Microbiologist: Because heavy metals are normally concentrated in sewage sludge during the sewage treatment process, the bacteria that survive in the sludge have evolved the unusual ability to resist heavy-metal poisoning. The same bacteria also show a strong resistance to antibiotics. This suggests that the bacteria's exposure to the heavy metals in the sewage sludge has somehow promoted their resistance to antibiotics.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the microbiologist's argument?
Choices:
  A: Most bacteria that are not resistant to antibiotics are not resistant to heavy-metal poisoning either.
  B: Bacteria that live in sewage sludge that is free of heavy metals, but is in other respects similar to normal sewage, are generally resistant to neither heavy-metal poisoning nor antibiotics.
  C: Antibiotic resistance of bacteria that survive in sewage sludge in which heavy metals are concentrated contributes to their resistance to heavy-metal poisoning.
  D: Sewage sludge that contains high concentrations of heavy metals almost always contains significant concentrations of antibiotics.
  E: Many kinds of bacteria that do not live in sewage sludge are resistant to both heavy-metal poisoning and antibiotics.

4. Choose the option that strengthens the argument.
5. Double-check your answer to ensure accuracy.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The microbiologist's argument is that exposure to heavy metals in sewage sludge has promoted bacteria's resistance to antibiotics.
Option A is irrelevant to the argument.
Option B weakens the argument by suggesting that heavy metals are necessary for the bacteria's resistance to antibiotics.
Option C supports the argument by suggesting that antibiotic resistance contributes to heavy-metal poisoning resistance.
Option D is irrelevant to the argument.
Option E is irrelevant to the argument.
Action: Answer("C")
