Choices:
  A: The factors affecting the creation of tornadoes were not well known to meteorologists before 1953.
  B: The intensity of the average tornado is greater now than it was in 1953.
  C: The number of tornadoes recorded annually has increased only slightly in the last five years.
  D: The amount of property damage done by tornadoes has grown substantially since 1953.
  E: Many more citizens are helping authorities detect tornadoes now than in 1953.

## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The question describes an apparent discrepancy between the increase in the number of tornadoes and the unchanged climatic factors affecting their creation.
To resolve this discrepancy, we need to find an answer choice that explains why the number of tornadoes has increased despite the unchanged climatic factors.
Option A is irrelevant because it talks about the past knowledge of meteorologists.
Option B is also irrelevant because it talks about the intensity of tornadoes, not their frequency.
Option C does not help to resolve the discrepancy because it only talks about the last five years, not the overall trend since 1953.
Option D is also irrelevant because it talks about property damage, not the frequency of tornadoes.
Option E is also irrelevant because it talks about citizen involvement, not the climatic factors affecting tornado creation.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")

Agent Answer: N
Correct Answer: E
