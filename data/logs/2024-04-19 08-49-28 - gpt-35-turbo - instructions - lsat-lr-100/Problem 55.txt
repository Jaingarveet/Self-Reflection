## User 2:
Topic: Law
Context: Ethicist: Only when we know a lot about the events that led to an action are we justified in praising or blaming a person for that actionâ€”as we sometimes are. We must therefore reject Tolstoy's rash claim that if we knew a lot about the events leading up to any action, we would cease to regard that action as freely performed.
Question: Which one of the following, if assumed, enables the conclusion of the ethicist's argument to be properly drawn?
Choices:
  A: People should not be regarded as subject to praise or blame for actions that were caused by conditions beyond their control.
  B: Whether an act is one for which the person doing it is genuinely responsible is not determined by how much information others possess about that act.
  C: We can be justified in praising or blaming a person for an action only when we regard that action as freely performed.
  D: The responsibility a person bears for an action is not a matter of degree; however, our inclination to blame or praise whoever performed the action varies with the amount of information available.
  E: If we do not know much about the events leading up to any given action, we will regard that action as freely performed.
