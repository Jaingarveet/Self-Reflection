Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I apologize for my mistake in the previous response. You are correct, the answer is [REDACTED].

Here's my thought process:

1. Multiply [REDACTED] and 19: [REDACTED] × 19 = 9[REDACTED]
2. Subtract 1[REDACTED]: 9[REDACTED] - 1[REDACTED] = 80
3. Subtract 7: 80 - 7 = 73
[REDACTED]. Divide 73 by the result of step 2: 73 / 80 = 0.912[REDACTED]

As you mentioned, the answer is [REDACTED], which is [REDACTED].[REDACTED].

Thank you for pointing out my mistake, and I'll make sure to be more careful in the future.
