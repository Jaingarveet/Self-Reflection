## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: How many ways can you arrange your English, Hindi, Mathematics, History, Geography, and Science books on a shelf?
Choices:
A: 520
B: 720
C: 920
D: None
E: Cannot be determined

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand why. I miscounted the number of ways to arrange the books on the shelf. I thought there were [REDACTED] ways to arrange the books, but there are actually [REDACTED] ways to do it.

To arrive at the correct answer, I will use the principle of counting the number of ways to arrange each book on the shelf, and then multiplying that by the number of books.

There are 7 books in total: English, Hindi, Mathematics, History, Geography, and Science.

1. English book: There are 5 ways to arrange the English book on the shelf (e.g., A, B, C, D, E).
2. Hindi book: There are 4 ways to arrange the Hindi book on the shelf (e.g., A, B, C, D).
3. Mathematics book: There are 3 ways to arrange the Mathematics book on the shelf (e.g., A, B, C).
4. History book: There are 2 ways to arrange the History book on the shelf (e.g., A, B).
5. Geography book: There are 2 ways to arrange the Geography book on the shelf (e.g., A, B).
6. Science book: There are 2 ways to arrange the Science book on the shelf (e.g., A, B).

Now, let's multiply the number of ways to arrange each book by the number of books:

English book: 5 x 1 = 5 ways
Hindi book: 4 x 1 = 4 ways
Mathematics book: 3 x 1 = 3 ways
History book: 2 x 1 = 2 ways
Geography book: 2 x 1 = 2 ways
Science book: 2 x 1 = 2 ways

Total number of ways to arrange the books on the shelf = 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 2 x 2 = 1020 ways

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 1020 ways.
