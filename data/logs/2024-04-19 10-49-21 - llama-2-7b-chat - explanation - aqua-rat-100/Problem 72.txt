Explanation:
## Assistant 2:
  Thought: I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand that the yard is rectangular with one side being 100 feet wide. To find the length of the other side, I can use the formula for the area of a rectangle, which is A = L x W, where A is the area, L is the length, and W is the width.

Reflection: I realized that I made a mistake in my previous answer by not using the correct formula for the area of a rectangle. I also realized that I misunderstood the problem and thought the length of the other side was 30 feet, when in fact it is 60 feet.

Action: Answer("E")
## Result:
Agent Answer: E
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
