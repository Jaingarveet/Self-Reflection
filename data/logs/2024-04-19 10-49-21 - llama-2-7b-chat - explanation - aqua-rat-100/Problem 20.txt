Question: 64 boys and 40 girls form a group for social work. During their membership drive, the same number of boys and girls joined the group. How many members does the group have now, if the ratio of boys to girls is 4:3?
Choices:
A: 277
B: 288
C: 200
D: 277
E: 168

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly. My solution was based on a misunderstanding of the problem. Here is my reflection on the problem and my revised solution:

Initial Thoughts:
I understand that there are 64 boys and 40 girls in the group. The problem states that the same number of boys and girls joined the group during the membership drive. Therefore, the total number of members in the group is equal to the number of boys plus the number of girls.

Calculation:
Let B be the number of boys and G be the number of girls. Since the same number of boys and girls joined the group, we can write:
B + G = 64 + 40 = 104

Now, we are given that the ratio of boys to girls is 4:3. This means that for every 4 boys, there are 3 girls. So, we can write:
B = 4G

Substituting this equation into the previous equation, we get:
4G + G = 104

Combining like terms, we get:
5G = 104

Dividing both sides by 5, we get:
G = 20

So, there are 20 girls in the group. Therefore, the total number of members in the group is:
B + G = 64 + 20 = 84

Correct Answer: E: 84

Lesson Learned:
I learned that it is important to carefully read and understand the problem before starting the calculation. In this case, I misunderstood the problem and calculated the number of girls incorrectly. I also learned the importance of using the correct ratio to solve the problem.
