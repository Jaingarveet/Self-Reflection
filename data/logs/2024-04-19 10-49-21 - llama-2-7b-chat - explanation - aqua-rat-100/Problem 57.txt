Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I made a mistake in my answer by selecting option [REDACTED], which is incorrect. The correct answer is option [REDACTED], which is 3000π.

Here's why:

The formula for finding the distance traveled by a point on the edge of a rotating disk is:

distance = revolutions x radius x time

In this case, the radius of the fan blade is 10 cm, and the fan rotates at a rate of 300 revolutions per minute. To find the distance traveled by the point on the edge of the fan blade, we need to multiply the number of revolutions by the radius and time.

Using the formula, we get:

distance = 300 x 10 x 30 = 3000π

Therefore, the distance traveled by the point on the edge of the fan blade after 30 seconds is 3000π.
