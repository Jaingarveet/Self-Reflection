I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I want to use my self-reflection to help me get the correct answer this time.

When I was 2 years old, my brother was half my age, which means he was 2/2 = 1 year old.
Now, I am 60 years old, and my brother is also 60 years old, since he has aged the same amount as me.
