Explanation:
I miscalculated the interest rate by dividing the amount borrowed by the number of installments and the installment amount. I misunderstood the problem and thought it was asking for the total interest paid, rather than the interest rate.

Question: A man borrows Rs.360 If he pays it back in 12 monthly installments of Rs.31.50, what is his interest rate?
Choices:
  A: 1.5%
  B: 4.5%
  C: 10%
  D: 5%
  E: 12%

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand now that I made a mistake in my calculation. Here's how I miscalculated the interest rate:

I divided the amount borrowed (Rs.360) by the number of installments (12) and the installment amount (Rs.31.50) to get the interest rate. However, this is not the correct way to calculate the interest rate.

The correct formula to calculate the interest rate is:
Interest rate = (Total amount borrowed x Number of installments x Interest rate per installment) / Total amount paid

Using this formula, we can calculate the interest rate as follows:
Interest rate = (Rs.360 x 12 x 1.5%) / Rs.31.50 = 1.875%

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 4.5%.

I hope this reflection helps me to better understand the problem and answer it correctly this time.
