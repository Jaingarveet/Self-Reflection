Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
You are correct that the final concentration of tea that John drinks is 38.75%. However, the correct answer is (E) [REDACTED].

Here's why:

You calculated the concentration of tea after the first step correctly, which is 42.5% (50% x 0.85). Then, you calculated the concentration of tea after the second step incorrectly, which is 38.75% (42.5% x 0.9).

The correct calculation for the concentration of tea after the second step is 42.5% x 0.95 = 39.22%. Therefore, the final concentration of tea that John drinks is 39.22%.

So, the correct answer is (E) [REDACTED].

Thank you for your thorough explanation and steps to arrive at the answer. It's important to double-check calculations and ensure accuracy in problem-solving.
