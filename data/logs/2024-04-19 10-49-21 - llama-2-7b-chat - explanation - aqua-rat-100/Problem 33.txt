  A: 8.75
  B: 8.79
  C: 8.75
  D: 8.71
  E: 8.72

Explanation:
## Assistant 2:
  Thought: I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand that the semi-circles drawn on the opposite sides of the square paper are diameters, not radii.

Action: Let's use the formula for the area of a sector to find the area of the remaining paper.

The area of the sector = (θ/360) × π × r^2

Where θ is the angle subtended by the semi-circle at the center of the square, and r is the radius of the semi-circle.

Since the semi-circles are diameters, the radius of each semi-circle is equal to half the side length of the square.

So, the radius of each semi-circle is 20/2 = 10 cm.

θ = 360° - 180° = 180°

Now, we can plug in the values and calculate the area of the remaining paper:

Area = (180°/360°) × π × (10 cm)^2 = 8.75 cm^2

Action: The correct answer is (C) 8.75 cm^2.

Explanation: The area of the remaining paper is 8.75 cm^2, which is the area of the sector of the square that is outside of the two semi-circles.
