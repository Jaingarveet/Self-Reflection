Explanation:
I misunderstood the problem and calculated the time incorrectly. I thought the problem was asking for the time it would take to travel a distance of 48 miles, but it was actually asking for the time it would take to travel a distance of 48 miles divided by the speed of the cyclist.

Question: A cyclist travels at 12 miles per hour. How many minutes will it take to travel 48 miles?
Choices:
  A: 1
  B: 240
  C: 30
  D: 60
  E: 120
Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand now that the problem is asking for the time it would take to travel a distance of 48 miles divided by the speed of the cyclist.

To solve this problem, I will use the formula:
Time = Distance / Speed

In this case, the distance is 48 miles, and the speed is 12 miles per hour.

Time = 48 miles / 12 miles/hour = 4 hours

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 240 minutes.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
