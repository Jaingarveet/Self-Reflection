I previously answered this question incorrectly. Here is my self-reflection:

I made a mistake in my reasoning and calculation. I incorrectly set up the equation for the perimeter of the rectangle. I realized this after I had already made a calculation and arrived at an incorrect answer.

To solve the problem correctly, I need to use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle, which is P = 2(l + w), where l is the length and w is the width.

In this case, the length of the rectangle is 1m more than 4 times the breadth, so the length is 4w + 1.

The perimeter of the rectangle is then:
P = 2(4w + 1)

Substituting the value of w (which is half the breadth), I get:
P = 2(4w + 1) = 2(4(b) + 1) = 8b + 2

Therefore, the perimeter of the rectangular piece is 8b + 2.

So, the correct answer is (B) 61 m.

I hope this self-reflection helps me to better understand the problem and arrive at the correct answer.
