## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: If n is such that 36 ≤ n ≤ 72, then x = (n2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16) / (n+ 4√n+ 4) satisfies
Choices:
  A: 20 < x < 54
  B: 23 < x < 58
  C: 25 < x < 64
  D: 28 < x < 60
  E: None of these
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
You have correctly analyzed the expression for x and determined the range of values for x based on the values of n. However, you made a small mistake in your calculation for n = 72.

Here's the correct calculation for n = 72:

x = (722 + 2√72(72 + 4) + 16) / (72 + 4√72 + 4)
= (504 + 144 + 16) / (76 + 32 + 4)
= 1.29

So, the correct answer is (D) [REDACTED].
## Assistant 2:
  Reflection:

I previously answered this question incorrectly, and upon reviewing my solution, I realized that I made a mistake in my calculation for n = 72. Here's the correct calculation:

x = (722 + 2√72(72 + 4) + 16) / (72 + 4√72 + 4)
= (504 + 144 + 16) / (76 + 32 + 4)
= 1.29

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) [REDACTED].
## Result:
Agent Answer: None
Correct Answer: D
