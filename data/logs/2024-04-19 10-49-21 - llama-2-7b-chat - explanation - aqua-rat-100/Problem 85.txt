Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
You are correct! The speed of the elevator is 2 steps/minute.

Here's how you can arrive at the correct answer:

1. Convert the time taken to travel a certain distance into speed:
Speed = Distance / Time taken
2. For 20 steps, the time taken is 10 minutes, so the speed is:
Speed = 20 steps / 10 minutes = 2 steps/minute
3. For 10 steps, the time taken is 20 minutes, so the speed is:
Speed = 10 steps / 20 minutes = 0.5 steps/minute
4. Now, choose the correct answer from the options:
Answer("[REDACTED]")
