## Assistant 2:
  Thought: I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I need to reassess the problem to find the correct solution.

Action: Let's calculate the minimum selling price per component to guarantee a yearly profit of at least $626,400.

First, we need to calculate the production cost per component: $110 per month x 420 units per month = $46,800 per month.

Next, we need to calculate the revenue from sales: $46,800 per month x 12 months = $561,600 per year.

To guarantee a yearly profit of at least $626,400, we need to subtract the production costs from the revenue: $561,600 - $46,800 = $514,800.

Now, we can see that the minimum selling price per component is:

E: 280

Action: Answer("E")

Explanation: The minimum selling price per component is $280, as this is the only choice that will result in a yearly profit of at least $626,400 after subtracting the production costs.
## Result:
Agent Answer: E
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
