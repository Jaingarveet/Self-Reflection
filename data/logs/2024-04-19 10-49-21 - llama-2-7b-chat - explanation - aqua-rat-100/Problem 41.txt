## Assistant 2:
  Thought: 
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand the mistake in my reasoning and calculation.
Action: I will use my self-reflection to help me answer the question correctly.

Reflection:
The number of friends who attended the picnic is 12.
To calculate the amount spent on eatables, I will multiply the number of friends by the amount planned to spend, which is Rs. 96.
So, the amount spent on eatables is Rs. 96 x 12 = Rs. 1152.
Since four friends did not turn up, the remaining ones had to contribute Rs. 4 extra, each, which is Rs. 1152 / 8 = Rs. 144.
Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 12.
