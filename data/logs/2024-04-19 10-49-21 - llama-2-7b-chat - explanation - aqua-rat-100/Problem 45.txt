Question: At what price should the Karan mark a sewing machine that costs him Rs. 1200/- so that even after offering a 20% discount, he makes 20% profit?

  B: 1,875
  C: 1,876
  D: 1,872
  E: 1,800

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand where I went wrong. Here's my reflection:

I calculated the cost of the sewing machine after offering a 20% discount as follows:

Cost of sewing machine = Rs. 1200 x (1 - 0.20) = Rs. 960

However, I made a mistake in my calculation. The correct calculation is:

Cost of sewing machine = Rs. 1200 x (1 - 0.20) = Rs. 1080

Therefore, the price at which Karan should mark the sewing machine to make a 20% profit is:

Price = Cost + Profit = Rs. 1080 + Rs. 216 = Rs. 1306

So, the correct answer is (C) Rs. 1306.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.
