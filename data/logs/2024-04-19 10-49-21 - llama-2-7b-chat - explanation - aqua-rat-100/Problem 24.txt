Question: An exam is given in a certain class. The average (arithmetic mean) of the highest score and the lowest score is equal to x. If the average score for the entire class is equal to y and there are z students in the class, where z > 5, then in terms of x, y, and z, what is the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers?

Explanation:
I made a mistake in my answer. The correct solution is:

The average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers is:

[REDACTED]


We are given that the average of the highest and lowest scores is equal to x, and the average score for the entire class is equal to y. We also know that there are z > 5 students in the class.

To find the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers, we need to find the average of the remaining scores.

We can do this by using the formula:

[REDACTED]

Where x is the average of the highest and lowest scores, y is the average score for the entire class, and z is the number of students in the class.

So, the correct answer is option [REDACTED]: [REDACTED].
