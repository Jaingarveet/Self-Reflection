## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Explanation:
I misunderstood the problem and applied the wrong combinatorial principle. I thought the problem was asking for the number of ways to choose 2 oranges from a basket of 10 oranges, which is a classic problem in combinatorics. However, the correct approach is to use the principle of permutations, as we are counting the number of ways to arrange 2 oranges from the basket.

Problem: There are 10 oranges in a basket. Find the number of ways in which 2 oranges are chosen from the basket.

Solution (previous answer): I misunderstood the problem and applied the wrong combinatorial principle. I thought the problem was asking for the number of ways to choose 2 oranges from a basket of 10 oranges, which is a classic problem in combinatorics. However, the correct approach is to use the principle of permutations, as we are counting the number of ways to arrange 2 oranges from the basket.

Correct Answer: The number of ways to choose 2 oranges from a basket of 10 oranges is:

10C2 = 10 x 9 = 90

Explanation:
To count the number of ways to choose 2 oranges from a basket of 10 oranges, we need to use the principle of permutations. We are counting the number of ways to arrange 2 oranges from the basket, so we need to choose the first orange from the basket and then choose the second orange from the remaining 9 oranges. Therefore, the number of ways to choose 2 oranges from a basket of 10 oranges is 90.

Action: Answer("B")
