Explanation:
I made a mistake in my reasoning and calculation. I used the concept of relative speed correctly, but I misunderstood the problem statement.

The problem states that the plane started with 10 times the speed of the ship, but I misunderstood this to mean that the plane started at a speed of 100 miles per hour, which is not the correct answer.

The correct calculation is:

The distance traveled by the ship = 180 miles
The distance traveled by the plane = 180 miles x 10 = 1800 miles

Therefore, the distance between the starting point and where they meet is 1800 miles.
