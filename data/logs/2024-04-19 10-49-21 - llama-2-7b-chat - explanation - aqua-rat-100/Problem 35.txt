Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
You are correct! The minimum sale required for the servant to earn a monthly income of 6000 is indeed 4500. Well done!

Here's a breakdown of how you arrived at the correct answer:

1. You identified the problem as a mathematical equation, which is a great start.
2. You recognized that the total amount the shopkeeper will pay the servant is equal to the monthly salary + commission on monthly sale.
3. You calculated the commission on monthly sale using the percentage given in the question (15%).
4. You solved the equation by substituting the values given in the question: 1500 + (15% of monthly sale) = 6000.
5. You simplified the equation by subtracting 1500 from both sides, which gave you 900 = 4500.
6. You finally arrived at the answer: the minimum sale required for the servant to earn a monthly income of 6000 is 4500.

Great job! Keep practicing, and you'll become even better at solving math problems.

As for the incorrect answers, here's why they are incorrect:

A) [REDACTED] is much higher than the minimum sale required to earn a monthly income of 6000. In fact, it's more than double the minimum sale.

B) [REDACTED] is also much higher than the minimum sale required. It's more than 7 times the minimum sale.

C) [REDACTED] is lower than the minimum sale required, but still not the correct answer.

D) [REDACTED] is also lower than the minimum sale required, but still not the correct answer.

E) None of the above is the correct answer, as the minimum sale required to earn a monthly income of 6000 is not any of the options given.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.
