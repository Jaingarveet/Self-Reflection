Explanation:
I misunderstood the problem and applied the wrong reasoning. I thought the problem was asking for the number of men required to complete the work in half a day, so I calculated the answer based on that assumption. However, the problem is actually asking for the number of men required to complete the work in 1/2 day, which is different.

Question: 8 man work for 6 days to complete a work. How many men are required to complete same work in 1/2 day.
Choices:
  A: 93 men
  B: 94 men
  C: 95 men
  D: 96 men
  E: 97 men

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand now that the problem is asking for the number of men required to complete the work in 1/2 day. To solve this problem, I will use the information provided in the problem statement.

8 men work for 6 days to complete a work, which means they complete the work in 6 days.
To find out how many men are required to complete the same work in 1/2 day, we need to divide the number of days taken to complete the work by 2.

So, the number of men required to complete the work in 1/2 day is:
8 men x 6 days / 2 = 13 men

Therefore, the correct answer is (E) 97 men.
