Question: A hollow cube of size 5cm is taken, with the thickness of 1cm. It is made of smaller cubes of size 1cm .If the outer surface of the cube is painted how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted?
Choices:
A: 438
B: 550
C: 500
D: 450
E: 498

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand where I went wrong. Here is my self-reflection:

I misunderstood the problem and thought it was asking about the total number of faces of the smaller cubes, rather than the number of faces that remain unpainted. I calculated the total number of faces of the smaller cubes by multiplying the number of cubes by the number of faces per cube, without considering the fact that some faces may be painted.

To solve the problem correctly, I need to subtract the number of faces of the cube that is painted from the total number of faces of the smaller cubes. The answer is:

Number of faces of smaller cubes that remain unpainted = Total number of faces of smaller cubes - Number of faces of the cube that is painted
= 6 (faces of the smaller cubes) - 6 (faces of the cube that is painted)
= 6 - 6
= 0

Therefore, the answer is E: 498.

Action: Answer("E")
## Result:
Agent Answer: E
Correct Answer: A
