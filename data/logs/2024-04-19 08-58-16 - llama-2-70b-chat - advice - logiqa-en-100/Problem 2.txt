## Assistant 2:
  My apologize for my previous response, where I incorrectly answered the question. After reflecting on the problem, my solution, and the correct answer, I realize that I made an assumption based on incomplete information.

The information given in the question is:

* Chessman A defeats Chessman B.
* Chesser B applauds Chessman C.
* Tomorrow, Chess Armor and C will play.

From this information, we cannot conclude who will win between Chess Armor and C. We can't assume that Chess Armor will definitely win or lose based on the given information. The applause from Chesser B to Chessman C doesn't provide enough information to determine the outcome of the match between Chess Armor and C.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) The two will be tied.

Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
