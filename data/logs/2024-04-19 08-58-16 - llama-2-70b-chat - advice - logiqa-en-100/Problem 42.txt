Context: Aptripa Cave is located near the bay of Dilos in the Peninsula of Maina, and is as large as four football fields.This cave dates back to the Neolithic Age, but was not accidentally discovered by a man walking a dog until the 1950s.After decades of scientific research work, archaeologists excavated tools, pottery, obsidian, silver and copper utensils from the cave, and thus believed that hundreds of people had lived in the cave.
Question: Which of the following, if true, can best refute the above argument?
Choices:
  A: The cave inspired the description of hell in Greek mythology
  B: The cave is actually an ancient cemetery and funeral venue
  C: There is no prehistoric village in Europe that has been found earlier than the cave
  D: The entrance to the cave collapsed 5000 years ago

## Assistant 2:
  My previous answer was incorrect, and after reflection, I realized that I had made a mistake in my reasoning. The correct answer is D: The entrance to the cave collapsed 5000 years ago.

The argument states that the cave was not accidentally discovered until the 1950s, and archaeologists excavated tools, pottery, obsidian, silver, and copper utensils from the cave, leading them to believe that hundreds of people had lived in the cave. However, if the entrance to the cave collapsed 5000 years ago, it would explain why the cave was not discovered until the 1950s and why there were no signs of recent human habitation.

The other options do not refute the argument. Option A, the cave inspired the description of hell in Greek mythology, does not provide any evidence that the cave was not inhabited. Option B, the cave is actually an ancient cemetery and funeral venue, does not explain why the cave was not discovered until the 1950s. Option C, there is no prehistoric village in Europe that has been found earlier than the cave, does not rule out the possibility that the cave was inhabited at an earlier time.

Therefore, the correct answer is D: The entrance to the cave collapsed 5000 years ago, which refutes the argument by providing an alternative explanation for why the cave was not discovered until the 1950s.
