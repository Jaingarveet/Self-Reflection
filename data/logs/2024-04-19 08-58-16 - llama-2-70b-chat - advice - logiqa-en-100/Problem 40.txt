## Assistant 2:
  My previous answer was incorrect, and upon reflection, I realized that I made a mistake in my analysis of the options.
The authoritative person's statement implies that if a job seeker with an overseas degree has real knowledge and basic social skills, and can accurately position themselves in the career selection process, then they will not become a "sea waiter."
Therefore, based on the information provided, we can conclude that Daejeon, the returnee who has obtained a master's degree in the UK, lacks either real talent, basic social skills, or accurate positioning in the career selection process, which means option B is the correct answer.
Action: Answer("B")
