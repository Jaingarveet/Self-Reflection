Topic: Logic
Context: A certain online forum made a statistical comparison of posts about social issues published by netizens in the past year and 5 years ago, and found that posts such as money-gathering, poverty alleviation, and bravery have increased such posts by 50%. Posts related to evildoing, escaping evil, and killing more people have increased by 90%. This shows that the social atmosphere is rapidly deteriorating.
Question: Which of the following, if true, would weaken the above argument most?
Choices:
  A: "Good things don't go out, bad things spread thousands of miles." Throughout the ages
  B: The number of Internet users has quadrupled in the past 5 years
  C: In recent years, some people have used rumors online to achieve profit-making purposes.
  D: The online forum is a legal forum

Reflection:
In my previous answer, I incorrectly chose option A. Upon reflection, I realized that option A actually strengthens the argument rather than weakening it. The phrase "Good things don't go out, bad things spread thousands of miles" suggests that good things are less likely to be spread as widely as bad things, which would mean that the increase in negative posts on the forum is even more significant than the data suggests.

Therefore, the correct answer is option B: The number of Internet users has quadrupled in the past 5 years. This information weakens the argument because it suggests that the increase in negative posts may be due to the increase in the number of users, rather than a deterioration in the social atmosphere.

Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: D
