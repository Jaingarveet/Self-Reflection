  My apologize for my previous response, and I appreciate the opportunity to reflect on my mistake.
After re-reading the question, I realize that I misunderstood the question and incorrectly challenged the opinion stated in the question.
The correct answer is D: The increase in dust storms is mainly due to human factors such as overloaded grazing and predatory management of grasslands.

Therefore, the opinion stated in the question can be questioned.
