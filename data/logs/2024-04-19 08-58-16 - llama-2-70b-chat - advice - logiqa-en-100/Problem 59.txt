## Assistant 2:
  Sure, I'll do my best to answer the question using my self-reflection.

My previous answer was choice A, but I realized that it doesn't satisfy condition 3. If X is allocated in the sales department, W must be allocated in the production department. Therefore, choice A is incorrect.

My self-reflection led me to consider the other choices more carefully. I realized that choice C also violates condition 3, as X is in the public relations department and W is in the sales department.

Therefore, the correct answer is either B or D.

I will choose option B as my final answer, as it satisfies all the given conditions.

Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
