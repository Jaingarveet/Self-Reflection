Context: A maintenance company that takes service requests from three clients—Image, Solide, and Truvest—plans to set targets for its average service response times. Service targets will be set at 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day. Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail. The six targets are set according to the following conditions: None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
Question: Which one of the following targets CANNOT be set for more than one of the clients?
Choices:
  A: a 1-day website target
  B: a 2-day voicemail target
  C: a 2-day website target
  D: a 3-day voicemail target

## Self-Reflection (Previous Incorrect Answer)
**Mistake:** I initially focused only on the individual client restrictions and overlooked the overall target distribution requirement.
**Corrected Approach:**
1. **Client Restrictions:**
    - Image: Voicemail target < Other clients' voicemail targets
    - Solide: Website target < Truvest's website target
2. **Target Distribution:**
    - Two clients must have a 1-day website target.
    - Two clients must have a 2-day voicemail target.
    - Two clients must have a 3-day website target.
**Analysis:**
- **Option A:** A 1-day website target can be assigned to two clients as long as they are not both Image or Solide (due to their website target restrictions).
- **Option B:** A 2-day voicemail target can be assigned to two clients as long as they are not both Image (due to its voicemail target restriction).
- **Option C:** A 2-day website target can be assigned to two clients as long as they are not both Solide or Truvest (due to their website target restrictions).
- **Option D:** A 3-day voicemail target can be assigned to two clients without violating any restrictions.
- **Option E:** A 3-day website target can only be assigned to one client (either Image or Solide) due to the overall target distribution requirement (two clients must have a 1-day website target).
**Conclusion:**
Only a 3-day website target cannot be assigned to more than one client.
