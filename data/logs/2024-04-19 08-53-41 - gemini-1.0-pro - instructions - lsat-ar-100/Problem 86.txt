## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
I previously answered this question incorrectly because I did not consider all of the given information.
I now know that bay 4 is holding produce.
I also know that the bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
Therefore, bay 3 must be holding textiles.
I also know that the bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
Therefore, bay 5 or 6 must be holding grain.
I also know that the bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
Therefore, bay 6 must be holding livestock.
I also know that the bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
Therefore, bay 1 or 2 must be holding fuel.
Therefore, the type of cargo that bay 1, bay 2, bay 5, and bay 6 is holding is completely determined.
Action: Answer("D")
