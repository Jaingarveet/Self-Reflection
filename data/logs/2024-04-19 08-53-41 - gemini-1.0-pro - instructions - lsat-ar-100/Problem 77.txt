Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.

## Assistant 2:
Self-reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly because I did not carefully consider all of the rules. I initially assigned Robertson parking space #1, Souza parking space #2, Togowa parking space #3, Young parking space #4, Xu parking space #5, and Vaughn parking space #6. However, this assignment violates the rule that Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
To correct my mistake, I need to reassign the parking spaces so that Robertson is assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. One possible solution is to assign Robertson parking space #2, Souza parking space #1, Togowa parking space #3, Young parking space #4, Xu parking space #5, and Vaughn parking space #6. This assignment satisfies all of the rules.
Now, let's consider the question of how many of the six new employees have their parking space assignment limited to only two possible spaces.
* Robertson: Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
* Souza: Souza can be assigned any of the remaining five parking spaces.
* Togowa: Togowa can be assigned any of the remaining four parking spaces.
* Young: Young must be assigned a lower-numbered parking space than Robertson.
* Xu: Xu must be assigned a lower-numbered parking space than Robertson.
* Vaughn: Vaughn can be assigned any of the remaining three parking spaces.
Therefore, the assignment of a parking space is limited to only two possible spaces for two of the six new employees: Robertson and Young.
Action: Answer("B")
