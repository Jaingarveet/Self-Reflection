Context: A government needs to assign new ambassadors to Venezuela, Yemen, and Zambia. The candidates for these ambassadorships are Jaramillo, Kayne, Landon, Novetzke, and Ong. One ambassador will be assigned to each country, and no ambassador will be assigned to more than one country. The assignment of the ambassadors must meet the following constraints: Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships. If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne. If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen. If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
Question: Which one of the following CANNOT be true?
Choices:
  A: Jaramillo is assigned as ambassador to Zambia.
  B: Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Zambia.
  C: Novetzke is assigned as ambassador to Zambia.
  D: Landon is not assigned to an ambassadorship.
  E: Ong is not assigned to an ambassadorship.

## Assistant 2:
I understand the instructions. I will use my self-reflection to help me answer this question correctly.
**Self-reflection:**
* I previously answered this question incorrectly because I did not consider all of the constraints.
* I need to make sure that I consider all of the constraints when answering this question.
* I need to be careful not to make assumptions about the constraints.
**Answer:**
The correct answer is **A: Jaramillo is assigned as ambassador to Zambia.**
**Explanation:**
* If Jaramillo is assigned as ambassador to Zambia, then Kayne must also be assigned as ambassador to one of the other countries.
* However, if Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Zambia, then Landon must also be assigned as ambassador to one of the other countries.
* This would violate the constraint that no ambassador can be assigned to more than one country.
* Therefore, Jaramillo cannot be assigned as ambassador to Zambia.
**Action: Answer("A")**
