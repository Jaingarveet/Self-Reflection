Context: A shopping center has exactly seven spaces—space 1 through space 7—arranged in a straight row. Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
Question: If the optometrist is next to the shoe store, the businesses immediately on either side of this pair must be
Choices:
  A: the pharmacy and a restaurant
  B: the pharmacy and the toy store
  C: the two restaurants
  D: a restaurant and the toy store
  E: a restaurant and the veterinarian
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Read and understand all constraints.
2. Start with the most constrained element (pharmacy) and place it first.
3. Place elements with the most restrictions next.
4. Consider the separation requirements between elements.
5. Work step-by-step, placing elements and checking constraints.
6. Double-check placement against all constraints before finalizing.
## Assistant 2:
Let's analyze the constraints step-by-step:
1. **Pharmacy and Restaurant:** The pharmacy must be at one end and a restaurant at the other. Let's place the pharmacy in space 1 and the restaurant in space 7 for now.
2. **Optometrist and Pharmacy/Veterinarian:** The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. We don't have enough information to place the optometrist yet.
3. **Two Restaurants:** The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. Since one restaurant is already in space 7, the other restaurant cannot be in space 6 or 5 due to the separation requirement.
4. **Toy Store and Veterinarian:** The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian. We don't have enough information to place the toy store or veterinarian yet.
Now, let's consider the additional information:
* **Optometrist next to Shoe Store:** If the optometrist is next to the shoe store, we can place them in spaces 2 and 3 (optometrist in 2, shoe store in 3) or spaces 4 and 5 (optometrist in 4, shoe store in 5).
Let's analyze both options:
**Option 1: Optometrist in 2, Shoe Store in 3:**
* This satisfies the pharmacy-optometrist/veterinarian constraint as the pharmacy is in space 1.
* It also satisfies the two-restaurant separation as the other restaurant cannot be in space 5 or 6.
* However, it violates the toy store-veterinarian constraint as the toy store would have to be in space 4, next to the veterinarian.
**Option 2: Optometrist in 4, Shoe Store in 5:**
* This also satisfies the pharmacy-optometrist/veterinarian constraint.
* It satisfies the two-restaurant separation as the other restaurant is in space 7.
* Importantly, it also satisfies the toy store-veterinarian constraint as the toy store could be placed in space 6, not next to the veterinarian.
Therefore, with the optometrist next to the shoe store, the businesses immediately on either side of this pair must be a restaurant (space 3) and the toy store (space 6).
