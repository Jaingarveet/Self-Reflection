## Assistant 2:
Self-reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly because I did not consider all of the conditions in the problem. I only considered the condition that Franco and Garcia cannot testify on the same day. I did not consider the condition that Iturbe must testify on Wednesday.
To answer this question correctly, I need to consider all of the conditions in the problem. I also need to use the information that I have already been given.
I know that Iturbe must testify on Wednesday. I also know that Franco and Garcia cannot testify on the same day. This means that Franco and Garcia must testify on Monday or Tuesday.
If Franco and Garcia testify on Monday, then Hong must testify on Tuesday. But this would violate the condition that exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
Therefore, Franco and Garcia must testify on Tuesday. This means that Hong must testify on Monday.
The only answer choice that is consistent with this schedule is E: Iturbe is the only witness scheduled to testify on Wednesday.
Action: Answer("E")
## Result:
Agent Answer: E
