## Assistant 2:
I understand. I will use my previous reflection to answer this question correctly.
**Reflection:**
* I initially made a mistake because I did not carefully consider the requirement that "at least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected."
* I have learned that it is important to pay close attention to all of the requirements in a problem, even if they seem redundant.
* I will use this experience to improve my problem-solving skills in the future.
**Answer:**
The organizer must at least select **two French novels**.
**Explanation:**
* The requirement that "no more than four French works are selected" means that the organizer can select either four French works or three French works.
* The requirement that "at least three but no more than four novels are selected" means that the organizer can select either three novels or four novels.
* The requirement that "at least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected" means that the organizer must select at least two French novels.
* If the organizer selects four French works, then they must select two French novels and two French plays. However, this would violate the requirement that "at least three but no more than four novels are selected."
* Therefore, the organizer must select three French works, which means that they must select two French novels and one French play.
