Context: A bakery makes exactly three kinds of cookieâ€”oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar. Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day.

## Assistant 2:
I understand. I will use my previous reflection to answer this question correctly.
**Reflection:**
* I initially made a mistake by not considering all the conditions carefully.
* I assumed that the second batch of peanut butter cookies was made on Tuesday, which was incorrect.
* The correct answer is the one that satisfies all the given conditions.
**Analysis:**
* The number of batches made on Friday is exactly one.
* This means that the third batch of either oatmeal, peanut butter, or sugar cookies is made on Friday.
* Since the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, the third batch of sugar cookies cannot be made on Friday.
* Therefore, the third batch of either oatmeal or peanut butter cookies is made on Friday.
**Answer:**
Based on the analysis, the only option that satisfies all the conditions is:
**C: The third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Friday.**
This is because:
* The first batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Friday, as the second batch of peanut butter cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of oatmeal cookies.
* The second batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Friday, as the third batch of either oatmeal or peanut butter cookies is made on Friday.
* Therefore, the third batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Friday.
**Conclusion:**
The correct answer is **C: The third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Friday.**
