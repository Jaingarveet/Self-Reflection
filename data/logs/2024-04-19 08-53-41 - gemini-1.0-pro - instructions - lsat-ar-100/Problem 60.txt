## Self-Reflection
**Previous Incorrect Answer:** C
**Reasoning:** I incorrectly assumed that the condition "Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7" applied to both kittens and puppies. This led me to eliminate options A and D, which both featured the same breed on day 1 and day 7. However, this condition only applies to the breed of puppy featured on day 1, which was a Greyhound.
**Correct Answer:** E
**Reasoning:** Option E satisfies all the given conditions:
* **Greyhounds are featured on day 1.**
* **No breed is featured on any two consecutive days.**
* **Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7.** (Greyhounds are not featured on day 7.)
* **Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.** (Himalayans are featured on days 2, 4, and 7.)
* **Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.** (Rottweilers are featured on days 1, 3, and 5.)
Therefore, the correct answer is E: Siamese, Himalayan, Siamese, Himalayan, Manx, Siamese, Himalayan.
