## Assistant 2:
**Self-Reflection:**
* **Mistake:** I initially selected "D: Stuckey, Tiao, Udall" as the answer, which was incorrect.
* **Reasoning:** I mistakenly assumed that since Stuckey and Udall work in the same zone, they must be in Zone 3. However, this is not necessarily true.
* **Correct Answer:** The correct answer is **E: Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Udall**.
**Explanation:**
* **Zone 1:** Either Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1, but not both. Since Parra and Quinn work in the same zone, and there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, it follows that Parra and Quinn must be in Zone 3.
* **Zone 2:** Either Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2, but not both. Since Stuckey and Udall work in the same zone, and Parra and Quinn are in Zone 3, it follows that Stuckey and Udall must be in Zone 2.
* **Zone 3:** Since Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, and Udall are not in Zone 1 or Zone 2, they must be in Zone 3.
**Action:** Answer("E")
