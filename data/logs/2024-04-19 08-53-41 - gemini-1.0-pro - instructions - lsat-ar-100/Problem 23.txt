## Assistant 2:
Self-reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly because I did not consider all of the conditions. I assumed that if Nina gave a report, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on the next day, but I did not consider the possibility that Nina's report could be given on Wednesday.
To answer this question correctly, I need to consider all of the conditions and make sure that the list of students who give the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday satisfies all of the conditions.
I will start by considering the condition that Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. This means that George must give the morning report on Tuesday.
Next, I will consider the condition that neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. This means that Olivia and Robert must give the morning reports on Monday and Wednesday, respectively.
Now, I will consider the condition that if Nina gives a report, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on the next day, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. Since Kyle gives the afternoon report on Tuesday, Nina must give the morning report on Tuesday. This means that Helen and Irving must both give reports on Wednesday.
Therefore, the list of students who give the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, is Robert, George, and Irving.
