3. **Checking each pair of days:**
    - A: Day 1 and Day 3: This pair violates the condition that no breed is featured on two consecutive days (Manx on Day 1 and Day 3).
    - B: Day 2 and Day 6: This pair violates the condition that Himalayans are not featured on any day that features Rottweilers (Himalayans on Day 2 and Rottweilers on Day 6).
    - C: Day 3 and Day 5: This pair violates the condition that Himalayans are not featured on any day that features Rottweilers (Himalayans on Day 4 and Rottweilers on Day 5).
