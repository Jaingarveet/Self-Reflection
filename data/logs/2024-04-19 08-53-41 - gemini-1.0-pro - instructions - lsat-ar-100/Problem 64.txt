## Self-Reflection
**Previous Incorrect Answer:** C
**Reasoning for Incorrect Answer:** I incorrectly assumed that Parra and Quinn must work in Zone 3, which led me to conclude that Parra could work in Zone 3.
**Correct Answer:** B
**Reasoning for Correct Answer:**
1. **Given Conditions:**
    - Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
    - Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
    - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
    - Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
    - There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
2. **Additional Information:**
    - Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone.
3. **Analysis:**
    - Since Mahr and Stuckey work in the same zone, and Stuckey and Udall work in the same zone, Mahr must also work in the same zone as Udall.
    - This means that Tiao cannot work in Zone 2 (as Udall is already there), and therefore must work in Zone 1.
    - As a result, Parra cannot work in Zone 1 and must work in Zone 3 with Quinn.
    - This leaves Zone 2 with only one remaining sales representative, which must be Mahr.
4. **Conclusion:**
    - The only scenario that satisfies all the given conditions and constraints is:
        - Zone 1: Tiao
        - Zone 2: Mahr
        - Zone 3: Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Udall, Kim
**Action:** Answer("B")
