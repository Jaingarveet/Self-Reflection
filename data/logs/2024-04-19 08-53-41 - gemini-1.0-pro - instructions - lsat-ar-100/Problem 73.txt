## Self-Reflection
**Previous Incorrect Answer:**
I previously answered this question incorrectly by selecting **Answer("A")**. This was incorrect because I mistakenly assumed that Megregian must review Undulation if exactly three students review it. However, this is not necessarily true.
**Reasoning for Incorrect Answer:**
My reasoning for the incorrect answer was based on the following assumptions:
* If exactly three students review Undulation, then Megregian must be one of them because Kramer and Lopez each review fewer plays than Megregian.
* Since Megregian reviews Undulation, he cannot review any of the other plays (Sunset or Tamerlane) because he only reviews one or two plays.
**Correct Answer:**
The correct answer is **Answer("B")**. O'Neill does not review Undulation.
**Reasoning for Correct Answer:**
Here's the reasoning for the correct answer:
* If exactly three students review Undulation, then one of them must be either Kramer or Lopez (since Megregian reviews more plays than both of them).
* Since Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, and exactly two students review the same play(s), then Lopez must be the third student who reviews Undulation.
* Therefore, O'Neill cannot review Undulation because he already reviews Tamerlane.
**Key Takeaways:**
* It's important to carefully consider all the conditions and constraints of the problem before making assumptions.
* Double-check your reasoning and ensure it aligns with all the given information.
* Be mindful of potential biases or assumptions that might lead to incorrect conclusions.
**Updated Answer:**
Based on the self-reflection and corrected reasoning, the updated answer is:
