Context: David Warsh's book describes a great contradiction inherent in economic theory since 1776, when Adam Smith published The Wealth of Nations. Warsh calls it the struggle between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand. Using the example of a pin factory, Smith emphasized the huge increases in efficiency that could be achieved through increased size. The pin factory's employees, by specializing on narrow tasks, produce far more than they could if each worked independently. Also, Smith was the first to recognize how a market economy can harness self-interest to the common good, leading each individual as though "by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention." For example, businesses sell products that people want, at reasonable prices, not because the business owners inherently want to please people but because doing so enables them to make money in a competitive marketplace. These two concepts, however, are opposed to each other. The parable of the pin factory says that there are increasing returns to scaleâ€”the bigger the pin factory, the more specialized its workers can be, and therefore the more pins the factory can produce per worker. But increasing returns create a natural tendency toward monopoly, because a large business can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than a small business. So given increasing returns, bigger firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business, until each industry is dominated by just a few players. But for the invisible hand to work properly, there must be many competitors in each industry, so that nobody can exert monopoly power. Therefore, the idea that free markets always get it right depends on the assumption that returns to scale are diminishing, not increasing. For almost two centuries, the assumption of diminishing returns dominated economic theory, with the Pin Factory de-emphasized. Why? As Warsh explains, it wasn't about ideology; it was about following the line of least mathematical resistance. Economics has always had scientific aspirations; economists have always sought the rigor and clarity that comes from representing their ideas using numbers and equations. And the economics of diminishing returns lend themselves readily to elegant formalism, while those of increasing returns-the Pin Factory- are notoriously hard to represent mathematically. Many economists tried repeatedly to bring the Pin Factory into the mainstream of economic thought to reflect the fact that increasing returns obviously characterized many enterprises, such as railroads. Yet they repeatedly failed because they could not state their ideas rigorously enough. Only since the late 1970s has this "underground river" -a term used to describe the role of increasing returns in economic thought-surfaced into the mainstream of economic thought. By then, economists had finally found ways to describe the Pin Factory with the rigor needed to make it respectable.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would most undermine the connection that the author draws between increased size and monopoly power?
Choices:
  A: In some industries, there are businesses that are able to exert monopoly power in one geographical region even though there are larger businesses in the same industry in other regions.
  B: As the tasks workers focus on become narrower, the workers are not able to command as high a salary as when they were performing a greater variety of tasks.
  C: When an industry is dominated by only a few players, these businesses often collude in order to set prices as high as a true monopoly would.
  D: The size that a business must reach in order to begin to achieve increasing returns to scale varies widely from industry to industry.
  E: If a business has very specialized workers, any gains in productivity achieved by making workers even more specialized are offset by other factors such as higher training costs and increased turnover.

## Assistant 2:
  My apologize for my previous response. After reflecting on the problem, I realize that my answer was incorrect. The correct answer is (D) The size that a business must reach in order to begin to achieve increasing returns to scale varies widely from industry to industry.

The passage explains that the parable of the pin factory suggests that there are increasing returns to scale, meaning that larger businesses can produce more pins per worker than smaller businesses. However, this creates a natural tendency towards monopoly, as larger businesses can achieve lower costs than smaller businesses. The assumption of diminishing returns, which dominated economic theory for almost two centuries, assumes that returns to scale decrease as the size of the business increases. However, the Pin Factory example suggests that this is not always the case, and that there are industries where increasing returns to scale are a more accurate representation of reality.

Option (D) states that the size that a business must reach in order to begin to achieve increasing returns to scale varies widely from industry to industry. This means that some industries may require a larger size than others to achieve increasing returns, which would undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power. If some industries require a larger size to achieve increasing returns, then it is not necessarily the case that larger businesses will dominate smaller businesses in every industry. This would weaken the argument that free markets always get it right, as the assumption of diminishing returns would not always hold true.

Therefore, option (D) is the correct answer.

Reflection:

* I incorrectly answered the question the first time because I misunderstood the connection between increasing returns to scale and monopoly power. I mistakenly believed that the correct answer was (E) If a business has very specialized workers, any gains in productivity achieved by making workers even more specialized are offset by other factors such as higher training costs and increased turnover. However, this option does not directly address the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
* After reflecting on the problem, I realized that I needed to focus on the relationship between size and monopoly power, rather than the productivity of specialized workers.
* I also realized that I needed to consider the broader context of the passage, which discusses the Pin Factory example and the assumption of diminishing returns. This helped me to identify the correct answer, which is (D) The size that a business must reach in order to begin to achieve increasing returns to scale varies widely from industry to industry.
