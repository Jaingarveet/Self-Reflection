[header] How to avoid atm fees [title] Learn locations of atms associated with your bank. [step] If you want to avoid atm fees, the easiest way to do so is to use an atm associated with your bank. If you have a nationwide bank, such as chase bank or bank of america, you can find atms across the country.
Choices:
  A: If your savings account is in the same bank you will most likely need one. [substeps] Many banks will guarantee atm fees through use of their atm.
  B: [substeps] Try to learn where atms associated with your bank are located. Some chain stores typically have atms associated with a certain bank.
  C: It is not uncommon for atms associated with other major banks to remain open during the evening when banks require patrons to schedule their transactions. Finding atms related to your bank will typically save you time, but any atms linked to your bank might also be worth avoiding.
  D: This is a good way to avoid atm fees. [substeps] Las vegas banks are located in las vegas.

  Answer: B

Option C is also not relevant, as it mentions ATMs being open during the evening, but does not provide any information about how to avoid ATM fees. Option D is not a good completion, as it simply states that using an ATM associated with your bank is a good way to avoid ATM fees, without providing any additional information or advice.
