Topic: Law
Context: The characteristic smell or taste of a plant, to insects as well as to humans, depends on its chemical composition. Broadly speaking, plants contain two categories of chemical substances: primary and secondary. The primary substances, such as proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins, and hormones, are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants. The secondary substances are a diverse and multitudinous array of chemicals that have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism. Only a few of these substances occur in any one species of plant, but the same or similar ones tend to occur in related plants such as the various species that constitute a single family. It is these secondary substances that give plants their distinctive tastes and smells. Insects appear to have played a major role in many plants' having the secondary substances they have today. Such substances undoubtedly first appeared, and new ones continue to appear, as the result of genetic mutations in individual plants. But if a mutation is to survive and be passed on to subsequent generations, it must pass the muster of natural selectionâ€”that is, it must increase the likelihood of the organism's surviving and reproducing. Some secondary substances are favored by natural selection because they are scents that attract pollinating insects to blossoms. Such scents signal the presence of nectar, which nourishes the insects without damage to the plants. Other secondary substances that arose by mutation were conserved by natural selection because they proved to be biochemical defenses against the enemies of plants, the majority of which are insects. Some of these defensive substances cause insects to suffer unpleasant symptoms or even to die. Still other secondary substances are not in themselves harmful to insects, but are characteristic smells or tastes that dissuade the insect from feeding by warning it of the presence of some other substance that is harmful. For hundreds of millions of years there has been an evolutionary competition for advantage between plants and plant-eating insects. If insects are to survive as the plants they eat develop defenses against them, they must switch to other foods or evolve ways to circumvent the plants' defenses. They may evolve a way to detoxify a harmful substance, to store it in their bodies out of harm's way, or to avoid its effects in some other manner. Insects quickly come to prefer the plants whose defenses they can circumvent, and they eventually evolve the ability to identify them by their characteristic flavors or odors, or both. As the competition has progressed, fewer and fewer plants have remained as suitable food sources for any one species of insect; species of insects have thus tended to become associated with narrowly defined and often botanically restricted groups of plants.
Question: Based on the passage, the author would be most likely to agree with which one of the following statements about the relationship between plants and insects?
Choices:
  A: The diversity of secondary substances that develop in a plant population is proportional to the number of insects with which that plant population has interacted throughout its evolutionary history.
  B: Although few species of plants have benefited from evolutionary interaction with insects, many species of insects use plants without either harming the plants or increasing the plants' chances of survival.
  C: Throughout the process of evolutionary change, the number of plant species within each family has generally increased while the number of families of plants has decreased.
  D: No particular secondary substance has appeared in plants in direct response to insects, though in many instances insects have influenced which particular secondary substances are present in a plant species.
  E: While many species of insects have evolved ways of circumventing plants' chemical defenses, none has done this through outright immunity to plants' secondary substances.

  Based on the passage, the author would be most likely to agree with choice A: "The diversity of secondary substances that develop in a plant population is proportional to the number of insects with which that plant population has interacted throughout its evolutionary history."

The passage explains that the characteristic smell or taste of a plant is determined by its chemical composition, and that secondary substances, which are not required for the plant's growth or metabolism, give plants their distinctive tastes and smells. It also states that insects have played a major role in the development of secondary substances in plants, as some secondary substances are favored by natural selection because they attract pollinating insects or serve as biochemical defenses against insects.

Therefore, it can be inferred that the diversity of secondary substances in a plant population would be proportional to the number of insects with which that plant population has interacted throughout its evolutionary history, as the interaction between plants and insects has driven the development of these secondary substances.

The other choices do not accurately reflect the relationship between plants and insects as described in the passage. Choice B is incorrect because, while some species of insects may use plants without harming them, many species of insects have evolved ways to circumvent plants' chemical defenses, which suggests that plants have been affected by their interactions with insects. Choice C is also incorrect, as the passage does not mention any changes in the number of plant species within each family or the number of families of plants.

Choice D is partially correct in that the passage states that no particular secondary substance has appeared in plants in direct response to insects, but it also explains that insects have influenced which particular secondary substances are present in a plant species. Therefore, while insects have not directly caused the development of specific secondary substances, they have played a role in their development and distribution.

Finally, choice E is incorrect, as the passage does not mention anything about insects evolving immunity to plants' secondary substances. Instead, it states that insects have evolved ways to circumvent plants' defenses, which suggests that they have developed mechanisms to avoid or detoxify the harmful effects of these substances.

Response:
  Action: Answer(D)

The passage states that the diversity of secondary substances in a plant population is not directly proportional to the number of insects with which that plant population has interacted throughout its evolutionary history. Instead, the passage suggests that the diversity of secondary substances is the result of an evolutionary competition between plants and plant-eating insects, where plants develop defenses against insects through the production of secondary substances, and insects evolve ways to circumvent these defenses.

Therefore, choice A is incorrect, as it suggests a direct proportional relationship between the number of insects and the diversity of secondary substances, which is not supported by the passage.

Choice B is incorrect because, while some species of plants may have benefited from evolutionary interaction with insects, many species of insects have evolved ways to circumvent plants' chemical defenses, which suggests that plants have been affected by their interactions with insects.

Choice C is also incorrect, as the passage does not mention any changes in the number of plant species within each family or the number of families of plants.

Choice D is the correct answer, as it states that no particular secondary substance has appeared in plants in direct response to insects, though in many instances insects have influenced which particular secondary substances are present in a plant species. This is supported by the passage, which explains that insects have played a role in the development and distribution of secondary substances in plants.

Finally, choice E is incorrect, as the passage does not mention anything about insects evolving immunity to plants' secondary substances. Instead, it states that insects have evolved ways to circumvent plants' defenses, which suggests that they have developed mechanisms to avoid or detoxify the harmful effects of these substances.
