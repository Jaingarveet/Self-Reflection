Context: The chairperson of Acme Corporation has decided to move the company from its current location in Milltown to Ocean View.

  B: The chairperson of Acme has good financial reasons for wanting to move the company to Ocean View.
  C: None of Acme's employees except the chairperson are in favor of moving the company to Ocean View.
  D: Currently, most Acme employees have a commute of less than 30 minutes.

## Assistant 2:
## Reflection on Previous Attempt:
In my previous attempt, I incorrectly chose **Answer("E")**. This was based on a misinterpretation of the argument's structure. I focused on the potential consequences of the move (longer commutes) and assumed the argument required a reason why employees wouldn't simply move closer or seek a pay raise. 
However, the key lies in understanding the **basis** of the claim that most employees will have longer commutes after the move. This claim relies on the assumption that **currently**, most employees live close enough to have a short commute. Therefore, the correct answer should be the option that states this assumption.
## Applying the Reflection:
Based on the above reflection, the answer should be the option that states most Acme employees currently have a commute of less than 30 minutes.
Action: Answer("D") 
## Result:
Agent Answer: E
Correct Answer: E
Score: 1
