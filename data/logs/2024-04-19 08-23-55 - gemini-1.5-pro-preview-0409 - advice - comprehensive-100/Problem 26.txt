Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Context: A shopping center has exactly seven spaces—space 1 through space 7—arranged in a straight row. Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
Question: If the shoe store is in space 2, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: The optometrist is in space 5.
  B: The pharmacy is in space 1.
  C: A restaurant is in space 3.
  D: The toy store is in space 6.
  E: The veterinarian is in space 4.

## Reflection on Previous Attempt:
In my previous attempt, I likely focused too much on individual constraints and failed to consider the combined impact of multiple constraints simultaneously. This led me to overlook a possible valid configuration.  To improve, I should:
* **Map out the possibilities:**  Instead of jumping to conclusions, I should systematically explore different arrangements that satisfy each constraint.
* **Consider all constraints together:**  I should analyze how each constraint interacts with others to narrow down the possibilities.
* **Double-check the answer against all conditions:** Before selecting the final answer, I should ensure it doesn't violate any of the given constraints. 
**Applying this to the current problem:**
1. **Pharmacy Placement:** Since the shoe store is in space 2, the pharmacy cannot be in space 1 due to the constraint of being at one end. Therefore, the pharmacy must be in space 7. 
2. **Restaurant Placement:** With the pharmacy at one end (space 7), a restaurant must occupy the other end (space 1). 
3. **Remaining Constraints:** We know the two restaurants must have at least two spaces between them, the pharmacy needs the optometrist or veterinarian next door, and the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
**Analyzing the options:**
* **A: Optometrist in space 5:** This could be possible if the veterinarian is in space 4, satisfying the pharmacy constraint.  We would need to place the second restaurant in space 3 and the toy store in space 6. This arrangement satisfies all constraints. 
* **B: Pharmacy in space 1:** This is impossible as we already established the pharmacy must be in space 7 due to the shoe store in space 2.
* **C: Restaurant in space 3:** This is impossible as it would place both restaurants too close together, violating the constraint of having at least two spaces between them.
* **D: Toy store in space 6:** This could be possible if the veterinarian is in space 4 and the optometrist is in space 5, satisfying the pharmacy constraint. The second restaurant would then be in space 3. However, this violates the constraint of the toy store not being next to the veterinarian.
* **E: Veterinarian in space 4:** This is possible as per the analysis for option A.
Therefore, considering all constraints and possibilities, the only option that could be true is: 
**Action: Answer("A")** 
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
