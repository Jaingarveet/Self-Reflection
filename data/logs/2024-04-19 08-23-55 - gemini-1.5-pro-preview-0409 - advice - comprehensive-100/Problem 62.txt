## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Advice:
 - Pay close attention to signs when manipulating equations and performing calculations.
 - Double-check your work at each step, especially when substituting values back into equations.
 - Consider using different methods (substitution, graphing) to verify your solution if unsure. 
 - Practice solving systems of equations regularly to improve accuracy and speed.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
I will solve this system of equations using the elimination method. 
First, I will multiply the second equation by 2 to eliminate x:
$$\begin{array}{r}3x+4y=-23 \\ 4y-2x=-38\end{array}$$
Then, I will add the two equations together:
$$8y = -61$$
Next, I will solve for y by dividing both sides by 8:
$$y = -\frac{61}{8}$$
Finally, I will substitute this value of y back into one of the original equations to solve for x. I will use the first equation:
$$3x + 4(-\frac{61}{8}) = -23$$
$$3x - \frac{61}{2} = -23$$
$$3x = \frac{15}{2}$$
$$x = \frac{5}{2}$$
Therefore, the solution to the system of equations is $(\frac{5}{2}, -\frac{61}{8})$. However, this is not one of the answer choices. Let me review the problem to see if I made a mistake.
... (reviewing the problem and calculations) ...
Ah, I see my mistake! When multiplying the second equation by 2, I incorrectly wrote -2x instead of +2x. Let me correct that and solve again.
$$\begin{array}{r}3x+4y=-23 \\ 4y+2x=-38\end{array}$$
Adding the two equations:
$$5x + 8y = -61$$
Now, I need to use the original equations to eliminate one variable. I can multiply the first equation by 2 and the second equation by 3:
$$\begin{array}{r}6x+8y=-46 \\ 12y+6x=-114\end{array}$$
Subtracting the first equation from the second equation:
$$4y = -68$$
$$y = -17$$
Substituting this value of y back into the first original equation:
$$3x + 4(-17) = -23$$
$$3x = 45$$
$$x = 15$$
Therefore, the correct solution is $(15, -17)$.
