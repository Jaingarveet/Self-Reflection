  B: In general, persons under the age of 65 are less likely to be victims of violent crimes than persons over the age of 65.
  C: As a result of the town's community outreach programs, more people than ever are willing to report violent crimes to the proper authorities.

## Assistant 2:
  My apologize for my previous response. After reflecting on the problem, I realize that my answer was incorrect. The correct answer is (E) Community officials have shown that a relatively small number of repeat offenders commit the majority of violent crimes in the town.

This answer choice weakens the argument because it suggests that the increase in reported violent crimes may not necessarily indicate an increase in the overall crime rate. Instead, it could be that a small number of repeat offenders are responsible for the majority of violent crimes, and that the community outreach programs have been successful in encouraging people to report these crimes. Therefore, option (E) provides an alternative explanation for the increase in reported violent crimes, which weakens the argument that the average citizen of the town is more likely than ever to become a victim of a violent crime.

Action: Answer("E")

Agent Answer: E
