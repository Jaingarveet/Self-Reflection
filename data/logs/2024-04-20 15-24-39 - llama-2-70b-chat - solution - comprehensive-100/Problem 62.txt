# Model: llama-2-70b-chat | Agent: solution | Exam: comprehensive-100 | Problem 62 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:
Topic: Geography
Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: $$\begin{array}{r}3 x+4 y=-23 \\2 y-x=-19\end{array}$$What is the solution $(x, y)$ to the system of equations above?
Choices:
  A: $(-5,-2)$
  B: $(3,-8)$
  C: $(4,-6)$
  D: $(9,-6)$
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
We can solve the system of equations by substitution or elimination.
By substitution, we have:
$$\begin{array}{r}3 x+4 y=-23 \\2 y-x=-19\end{array}$$
Substituting the second equation into the first equation, we get:
$$3x + 4(2y - x) = -23$$
Expanding and simplifying, we get:
$$3x + 8y - 4x = -23$$
$$-x + 8y = -27$$
Solving for x and y, we get:
$$x = 3$$
$$y = -8$$
Therefore, the solution to the system of equations is $(3, -8)$.
## Assistant 2:
  Action: Answer("B")

Reflection:
Previously, I answered this question incorrectly, selecting choice A.
However, upon reflection, I realized that my mistake was in the calculation.
I incorrectly calculated the value of x and y.
I should have gotten x = 3 and y = -8.
Therefore, the correct answer is choice B: $(3,-8)$.
I will make sure to be more careful in my calculations in the future.
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
