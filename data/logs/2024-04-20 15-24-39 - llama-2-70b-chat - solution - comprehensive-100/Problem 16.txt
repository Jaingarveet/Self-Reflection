You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
From (1), we know that Prince Lima is tall, handsome, and a doctor.
From (2), we know that [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] are both doctors.
From (3), we know that [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] are the same height.
From (4), we know that [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] are not both tall.

We can deduce that [REDACTED] is not tall, and [REDACTED] is tall.
[REDACTED] is a doctor, and we know that he is tall because [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] are the same height, and [REDACTED] is not a doctor.
Therefore, [REDACTED] meets all of Li Na's requirements.
## Assistant 2:
  Action: Answer("B")

Explanation:
From the information provided, we can deduce that Li Qiang is the only person who meets all of Li Na's requirements. He is tall, handsome, and a doctor, which matches the description of Prince Lima in Li Na's mind.

The other options do not meet all the requirements:

* Liu Dawei is not tall, as revealed in (4).
* Wu Gang is a doctor, but he is not tall, as revealed in (3).
* Wang Wei is not handsome, as revealed in (1).

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) Li Qiang.
