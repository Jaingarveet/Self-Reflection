Context: There are two kinds of horror stories: those that describe a mad scientist's experiments and those that describe a monstrous beast. In some horror stories about monstrous beasts, the monster symbolizes a psychological disturbance in the protagonist. Horror stories about mad scientists, on the other hand, typically express the author's feeling that scientific knowledge alone is not enough to guide human endeavor. However, despite these differences, both kinds of horror stories share two features: they describe violations of the laws of nature and they are intended to produce dread in the reader.
Question: If the statements above are true, which one of the following would also have to be true?
Choices:
  A: All descriptions of monstrous beasts describe violations of the laws of nature.
  B: Any story that describes a violation of a law of nature is intended to invoke dread in the reader.
  C: Horror stories of any kind usually describe characters who are psychologically disturbed.
  D: Most stories about mad scientists express the author's antiscientific views.
  E: Some stories that employ symbolism describe violations of the laws of nature.

## Assistant 2:
  My apologize for my previous response. Upon reflection, I realize that my answer was incorrect. The correct answer is (B) Any story that describes a violation of a law of nature is intended to invoke dread in the reader.

The passage states that both horror stories about monstrous beasts and mad scientists describe violations of the laws of nature and are intended to produce dread in the reader. This suggests that any story that describes a violation of a law of nature is intended to evoke fear or dread in the reader. Therefore, option (B) is the correct answer.

Option (A) All descriptions of monstrous beasts describe violations of the laws of nature is not necessarily true. While many horror stories about monstrous beasts may involve violations of the laws of nature, not all descriptions of monstrous beasts necessarily involve such violations.

Option (C) Horror stories of any kind usually describe characters who are psychologically disturbed is also not necessarily true. While some horror stories may involve psychologically disturbed characters, many horror stories do not involve such characters.

Option (D) Most stories about mad scientists express the author's antiscientific views is not supported by the passage. The passage states that horror stories about mad scientists typically express the author's feeling that scientific knowledge alone is not enough to guide human endeavor, but it does not mention anything about the author's views on science.

Option (E) Some stories that employ symbolism describe violations of the laws of nature is not necessarily true. While some stories that employ symbolism may involve violations of the laws of nature, not all stories that employ symbolism do so.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) Any story that describes a violation of a law of nature is intended to invoke dread in the reader.
