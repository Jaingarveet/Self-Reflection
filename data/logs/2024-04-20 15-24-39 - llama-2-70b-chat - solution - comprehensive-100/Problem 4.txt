## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
1. The space shuttle can travel 700m high in 40 seconds, so its vertical speed is 700/40 = 17.5 m/s.
2. It takes 5 seconds to pass a point, so its horizontal speed is 700/5 = 140 m/s.
3. The total speed of the space shuttle is the square root of the sum of the squares of its horizontal and vertical speeds: v = sqrt(140^2 + 17.5^2) = 195 m/s.
4. The length of the space shuttle (L) can be found using the formula L = vt, where v is the total speed and t is the time it takes to pass a point (5 seconds in this case).
5. Substituting the values, we get L = 195 m/s x 5 s = 9[REDACTED].

Therefore, the length of the space shuttle is 9[REDACTED], which corresponds to choice [REDACTED]: [REDACTED].
