Question: A club consists of members whose ages are in A.P. The common difference being 3 months. If the youngest member of the club is just 7 years old and the sum of the ages of all the members is 250, then number of members in the club are :

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand where I went wrong. Here's my reflection:

I misunderstood the problem and thought the ages were given in a linear sequence instead of an arithmetic progression. I calculated the sum of the ages incorrectly and arrived at an incorrect answer.

To solve this problem correctly, I will use the formula for the nth term of an A.P.:

an = a1 + (n - 1)d

where a1 is the first term, n is the term number, and d is the common difference.

Given that the youngest member is 7 years old, and the sum of the ages is 250, we can set up the equation:

7 + (n - 1) Ã— 3 = 250

Solving for n, we get:

n = 26

Therefore, there are 26 members in the club.

Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
