## Assistant 2:
  Thought:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand the mistake. Let me re-evaluate the problem and find the correct solution.

The given information can be represented in a truth table:

| City | Lake G | Lake J |
| --- | --- | --- |
| E | ✘ | ✔ |
| F | ✘ | ✔ |
| G | ✔ | ✘ |
| H | ✘ | ✔ |
| I | ✘ | ✘ |

From the table, we can see that if the team does not go to I Peak (I), then at least one of Lake G and Lake J must be visited. Therefore, the correct answer is (C): The group went to visit G Lake and H Mountain.

Reflection:
I made a mistake in my initial answer by not considering the constraints of the problem. I reflected on my solution and identified the error. By re-evaluating the problem and taking into account the given constraints, I was able to find the correct answer.
## Result:
Agent Answer: None
Correct Answer: D
