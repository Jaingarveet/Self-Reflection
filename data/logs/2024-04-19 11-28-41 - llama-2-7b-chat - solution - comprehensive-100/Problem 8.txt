## Assistant 2:
  Thought: I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I want to use my self-reflection to help me get the correct answer this time.

Step 1: Identify the given information:
The two cars start at opposite ends of a 50-mile highway, and they are traveling at different speeds - 12 mph and 13 mph.

Step 2: Use the formula:
To find the time it takes for the cars to meet, we can use the formula:
Time = Distance / Speed

Substitute the given values:
Time = 50 miles / (12 mph + 13 mph)

Step 3: Simplify and solve:
Simplify the expression by combining the speeds:
Speed = 12 mph + 13 mph = 25 mph

Now, solve the equation:
Time = 50 miles / 25 mph

Time = 2 hours

Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: E
Score: 0
