Explanation:
I incorrectly calculated the cost price of the article. 
I knew the profit percentage and the selling price but made a calculation error.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Percentage error
 - Cost price error
Solution:
The selling price of the article is Rs.360.
The profit percentage is 20%.
The cost price is the selling price divided by one plus the profit percentage.
The cost price is 360 / (1 + 20/100) = 360 / 1.2 = Rs.300.
Instructions:
1. Identify the selling price of the article.
2. Identify the profit percentage.
3. Convert the profit percentage into a decimal.
4. Calculate the cost price using the formula: cost price = selling price / (1 + profit percentage).
5. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.
6. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
7. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that the cost price is the selling price divided by one plus the profit percentage.
