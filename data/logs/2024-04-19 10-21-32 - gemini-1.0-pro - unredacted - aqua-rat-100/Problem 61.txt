## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: Kevin drove from A to B at a constant speed of 70 mph. Once he reached B, he turned right around with pause, and returned to A at a constant speed of 90 mph. Exactly 3 hours before the end of his trip, he was still approaching B, only 70 miles away from it. What is the distance between A and B?
Choices:
  A: 180
  B: 90
  C: 270
  D: 360
  E: None of the above
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
My initial approach was correct, but I made a mistake in solving the equation. I incorrectly assumed that 3 hours before the end of the trip, Kevin was halfway between A and B. This led me to the wrong answer.
Error Keywords:
 - Misinterpretation of the problem
 - Incorrect assumption
 - Algebraic error
Solution:
Let's denote the distance between A and B as x.
The time it took Kevin to travel from A to B is x/70 hours.
The time it took Kevin to travel from B to A is x/90 hours.
The total time of the trip is x/70 + x/90 = 6 hours.
Three hours before the end of the trip, Kevin was 70 miles away from B, which means he had already traveled x - 70 miles.
Therefore, the time it took him to travel x - 70 miles is (x - 70)/70 hours.
We know that this time is 3 hours less than the total time of the trip, which is 6 - 3 = 3 hours.
So, (x - 70)/70 = 3
x - 70 = 210
x = 280 miles
Instructions:
1. Read the problem carefully and identify the given information.
