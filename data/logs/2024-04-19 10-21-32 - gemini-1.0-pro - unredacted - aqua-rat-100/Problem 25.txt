Topic: Math
Question: A car is being driven, in a straight line and at a uniform speed, towards the base of a vertical tower. The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower?
Choices:
  A: 5(√3 + 1)
  B: 6(√3 + √2)
  C: 7(√3 – 1)
  D: 8(√3 – 2)
  E: None of these

## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
My initial approach to the problem was conceptually correct. I used the tangent function to relate the angle of elevation, the height of the tower, and the distance between the car and the tower. However, I made a crucial error in interpreting the given information.
## Error Analysis
* **Misinterpretation of Time:** I misinterpreted the 10 minutes as the time it takes for the car to reach the base of the tower. Instead, it represents the time it takes for the angle of elevation to change.
* **Incorrect Calculation of Time:** Consequently, my calculation of the time to reach the base was based on the incorrect assumption that the car travels for 10 minutes at a constant speed.
## Correct Solution
1. **Define Variables:**
    * H: Height of the tower
    * D: Initial distance between the car and the tower
    * V: Speed of the car
    * T: Time for the car to reach the base of the tower
2. **Relate Variables using Tangent Function:**
    * tan(45°) = H / (D + 10V)
    * tan(60°) = H / D
3. **Solve for H:**
    * H = (D + 10V) * tan(45°)
    * H = D * tan(60°)
4. **Set Equations Equal and Solve for V:**
    * (D + 10V) * tan(45°) = D * tan(60°)
    * V = (D(√3 - 1)) / 10
5. **Calculate Time to Reach Base:**
    * T = D / V = D / ((D(√3 - 1)) / 10) = 10 / (√3 - 1)
