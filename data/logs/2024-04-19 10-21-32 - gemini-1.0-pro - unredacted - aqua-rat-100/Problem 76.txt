## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:
Topic: Geography
Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?

Choices:
  A: 20 < x < 54
  B: 23 < x < 58
  C: 25 < x < 64
  D: 28 < x < 60
  E: None of these

You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
My initial approach was correct in finding the range of both the numerator and denominator. However, I made a mistake in simplifying the final range of x. I incorrectly rounded the lower bound to 20 instead of 28.
Error Keywords:
 - Rounding error
 - Approximation error
 - Range calculation error
Solution:
1. Find the range of n^2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16.
2. Find the range of n + 4√n + 4.
3. Divide the range of the numerator by the range of the denominator.
4. Simplify the resulting range.
5. Choose the answer that matches the calculated range.
Instructions:
1. When finding the range of an expression, consider all possible values of the variable within the given constraints.
2. Be careful when simplifying expressions, especially when dealing with inequalities.
3. Double-check your calculations and final answer to ensure accuracy.
4. Pay attention to rounding errors and ensure they do not significantly impact the final result.
Advice:
 - When solving problems involving inequalities, it's often helpful to visualize the ranges of the expressions involved.
 - Consider using graphical representations or tables to aid in understanding the relationships between variables.
 - Be mindful of the potential for rounding errors and their impact on the final answer.
 - Always strive for precision in your calculations and reasoning.
