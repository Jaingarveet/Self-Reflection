Choices:
  A: 69:91
  B: 59:91
  C: 59:90

## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:**
My initial approach involved calculating the individual ratios of zinc and copper in alloys X and Y. However, I made a mistake in calculating the combined ratio in alloy Z. I incorrectly added the ratios of zinc and copper from both alloys, instead of calculating the weighted average based on the proportions of each alloy used.
**Error Keywords:**
* Ratio calculation error
* Weighted average error
* Proportion error
**Solution:**
1. **Calculate the ratio of zinc and copper in each alloy:**
    * Alloy X: 6 parts zinc, 9 parts copper (6:9)
    * Alloy Y: 7 parts zinc, 11 parts copper (7:11)
2. **Determine the proportion of each alloy used in alloy Z:**
    * Alloy X: 40 grams / 100 grams = 0.4
    * Alloy Y: 60 grams / 100 grams = 0.6
3. **Calculate the weighted average for zinc:**
    * Zinc in Z = (0.4 * 6) + (0.6 * 7) = 5.8
4. **Calculate the weighted average for copper:**
    * Copper in Z = (0.4 * 9) + (0.6 * 11) = 9.9
5. **Simplify the ratio of zinc to copper in Z:**
    * Zinc:Copper = 5.8:9.9 â‰ˆ 59:99
**Instructions:**
1. Calculate the individual ratios of zinc and copper in each alloy.
2. Determine the proportion of each alloy used in the final mixture.
3. Calculate the weighted average for zinc and copper using the proportions from step 2.
4. Simplify the resulting ratio to its lowest terms.
5. Choose the answer that matches the calculated ratio.
**General Advice:**
* Pay close attention to the wording of the problem and identify the key information.
* Break down complex problems into smaller, more manageable steps.
* Use clear and concise calculations, showing all steps for clarity and verification.
* Double-check your calculations and ensure your final answer aligns with the problem's requirements.
* Consider using alternative methods or representations (e.g., tables, diagrams) to visualize the problem and solution.
* Practice similar problems to solidify your understanding and identify potential pitfalls.
By following these steps and incorporating the general advice, I can improve my accuracy and problem-solving skills for similar questions in the future.
