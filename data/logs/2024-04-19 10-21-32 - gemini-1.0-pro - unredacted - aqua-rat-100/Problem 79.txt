## Explanation:
I incorrectly interpreted the distribution ratio between nephews, daughters, and sons. I assumed that daughters receive 4 times the amount of nephews and sons receive 5 times the amount of nephews, leading to an incorrect calculation.
## Error Keywords:
* Misinterpretation of ratios
* Incorrect application of ratios
* Distributive error
## Solution:
1. **Identify the total amount to be distributed:** Rs 8600
2. **Define variables:**
    * Let x be the amount each nephew receives.
    * Daughters receive 4x each.
    * Sons receive 5x each.
3. **Set up the equation based on the total amount:**
    5x (sons) + 4x (daughters) + 2x (nephews) = 8600
4. **Combine like terms:**
    11x = 8600
5. **Solve for x:**
    x = 8600 / 11
    x = 781.82 (rounded to two decimal places)
6. **Calculate the amount each daughter receives:**
    4x = 4 * 781.82 = 3127.28
## Instructions:
1. Carefully read the problem and identify the total amount to be distributed.
2. Define variables for each category of recipient.
3. Set up an equation based on the total amount and the defined variables, using the given ratios.
4. Combine like terms and solve for the variable representing the base amount (e.g., amount received by nephews).
5. Calculate the amount received by each category using the solved variable and the given ratios.
6. Double-check your calculations and ensure the sum of all amounts equals the total amount to be distributed.
## General Advice:
* Pay close attention to the wording of the problem and the relationships between different categories.
* Clearly define variables and use them consistently throughout the solution.
* Set up equations that accurately represent the given information and relationships.
* Carefully manipulate the equation to solve for the desired variable.
* Double-check your calculations and ensure your answer is consistent with the problem and the given choices.
