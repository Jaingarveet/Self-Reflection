Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
## Explanation:
My initial calculation was incorrect. I multiplied the map distance (20 inches) by the scale (10 miles/inch) but forgot to divide by 4, which represents the 1/4 inch increment on the map. This resulted in an overestimation of the actual distance.
## Error Keywords:
* Misinterpretation of scale
* Multiplication error
* Division error
* Unit conversion error
## Solution:
1. Identify the map distance: 20 inches
2. Identify the scale: 1/4 inch represents 10 miles
3. Convert the map distance to miles: 20 inches * (10 miles / 1/4 inch) = 800 miles
4. Simplify the expression: 800 miles
## Instructions:
1. Carefully read the problem and identify the given information.
2. Pay close attention to the units used in the problem.
3. Convert all units to a consistent system before performing calculations.
4. Accurately interpret the scale provided in the problem.
5. Perform calculations step-by-step, ensuring each step is correct.
6. Double-check your calculations and final answer before submitting.
## General Advice:
* Be mindful of unit conversions and ensure consistency throughout the problem.
* Visualize the problem and the scale to aid in understanding.
* Break down complex problems into smaller, more manageable steps.
* Double-check your work and calculations to avoid errors.
* Practice similar problems to solidify your understanding and problem-solving skills.
