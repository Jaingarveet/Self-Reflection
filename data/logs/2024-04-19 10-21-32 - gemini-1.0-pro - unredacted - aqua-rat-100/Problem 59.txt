Question: 20 marbles were pulled out of a bag of only white marbles, painted black, and then put back in. Then, another 20 marbles were pulled out, of which 1 was black, after which they were all returned to the bag. If the percentage of black marbles pulled out the second time represents their percentage in the bag, how many marbles in total Q does the bag currently hold?
Choices:
  A: 40
  B: 200
  C: 380
  D: 400
  E: 3200

## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:**
My initial solution involved setting the proportion of black marbles equal after both rounds of drawing. However, this approach was flawed because the total number of marbles changed after the first round. 
**Error Keywords:**
* Incorrect Proportion
* Changing Population Size
* Misunderstanding of Probability
**Correct Solution:**
1. **Define Variables:**
    * Let X be the total number of marbles in the bag.
    * Let B be the number of black marbles in the bag.
2. **Calculate Initial Black Marble Proportion:**
    * After the first round, there are 20 black marbles in the bag.
    * Therefore, the initial proportion of black marbles is B/X = 20/X.
3. **Calculate Second Round Black Marble Proportion:**
    * After the second round, there is 1 black marble drawn out of 20+X marbles.
    * Therefore, the second-round proportion of black marbles is 1/(20+X).
4. **Set Proportions Equal:**
    * Since the proportion of black marbles should be the same after both rounds, we can set the two proportions equal:
    * 20/X = 1/(20+X)
5. **Solve for X:**
    * Cross-multiplying and simplifying the equation, we get:
    * 400 + 20X = X
    * 399X = 400
    * X = 400/399
6. **Calculate Total Marbles:**
    * Since the question asks for the total number of marbles Q, we need to consider both black and white marbles:
    * Q = X + 20 (20 black marbles added initially)
    * Q = 400/399 + 20
    * Q â‰ˆ 400.50
**Detailed Instructions for Future:**
1. Carefully read and understand the problem, including any changes that occur throughout the scenario.
2. Define clear variables to represent the unknowns in the problem.
3. Calculate the relevant proportions or probabilities based on the given information.
4. Set up equations that reflect the relationships between the variables and the given conditions.
5. Solve the equations step-by-step to find the unknown values.
6. Consider all aspects of the problem when interpreting the final answer and ensure it aligns with the context.
**General Advice for Similar Problems:**
* Pay close attention to changes in population size or sample size throughout the problem.
* Distinguish between proportions and probabilities, and use them appropriately in calculations.
* Double-check your calculations and ensure your final answer makes sense in the context of the problem.
* Consider using different approaches or representations (e.g., tables, diagrams) to visualize the problem and check your reasoning.
* Practice solving similar problems to improve your understanding and problem-solving skills.
