## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: R, S, T, and U are points on a line, and U is the midpoint of line segment ST. If the lengths of line segments RS, RT, and ST are 5, 17, and 22, respectively. What is the length of line segment RU?
Choices:
  A: 6
  B: 7
  C: 8
  D: 9

Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that U is the midpoint of line segment RT instead of line segment ST. This led me to calculate the length of line segment RU incorrectly.
Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation
- Misunderstanding
- Midpoint error
Solution:
R, S, T, and U are points on a line, and U is the midpoint of line segment ST.
The lengths of line segments RS, RT, and ST are 5, 17, and 22, respectively.
Since U is the midpoint of line segment ST, the length of line segment SU is half the length of line segment ST, which is 22/2 = 11.
The length of line segment RU is the difference between the lengths of line segments RT and SU, which is 17 - 11 = 6.
Instructions:
1. Identify the points on the line and the midpoint of the line segment.
2. Determine the lengths of the line segments.
3. Calculate the length of the line segment that includes the midpoint.
4. Determine the relationship between the midpoint and the desired line segment.
5. Calculate the length of the desired line segment based on the relationship with the midpoint.
Advice:
- Carefully read the problem and identify all given information.
- Pay close attention to keywords like "midpoint" and "difference."
- Visualize the problem using a diagram or sketch.
- Break down the problem into smaller, more manageable steps.
- Double-check your calculations and reasoning before selecting an answer.
