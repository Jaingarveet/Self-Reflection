## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: Points A, B, C, D lie in this order on the circumference of a circle. Minor arc AC is 160°, and minor arc BD is 150°. If B bisects minor arc AC, then what is the measure of minor arc AD?
Choices:
  A: 80°
  B: 130°
  C: 140°
  D: 160°
  E: 220°

Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I incorrectly calculated the measure of minor arc AD. 
I correctly calculated the measure of minor arc AB but then added it to the measure of minor arc BD instead of subtracting it. 
I made a careless error in my calculations.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Addition error
 - Subtraction error
Solution:
Points A, B, C, D lie in this order on the circumference of a circle.
Minor arc AC is 160°, and minor arc BD is 150°.
If B bisects minor arc AC, then minor arc AB = minor arc BC = 160°/2 = 80°.
Minor arc AD = minor arc AB - minor arc BD = 80° - 150° = -70°.
Since the measure of a minor arc cannot be negative, we add 360° to get the positive measure of minor arc AD:
Minor arc AD = -70° + 360° = 290°.
Instructions:
1. Identify the given information about the circle and its arcs.
2. Determine the measure of minor arc AB based on the fact that B bisects minor arc AC.
3. Calculate the measure of minor arc AD by subtracting the measure of minor arc BD from the measure of minor arc AB.
4. If the result is negative, add 360° to obtain the positive measure of minor arc AD.
5. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
6. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
- Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
- Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
- Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
- Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
- Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
- Remember that the measure of a minor arc is always positive, even if the result of your initial calculation is negative.
