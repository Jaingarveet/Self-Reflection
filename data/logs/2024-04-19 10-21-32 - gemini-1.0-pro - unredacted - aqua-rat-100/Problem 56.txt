Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
## Explanation:
My initial answer was incorrect because I calculated the interest based on the monthly payment amount instead of the total amount borrowed. This led to an underestimation of the actual interest rate.
## Error Keywords:
* **Misinterpretation:** I misinterpreted the question and focused on the monthly payment instead of the total borrowed amount.
* **Incorrect calculation:** I used the wrong base for calculating the interest, leading to an inaccurate result.
* **Rounding error:** I might have rounded the interest rate prematurely, affecting the final answer.
## Solution:
1. **Calculate the total amount repaid:** 12 months * Rs.31.50/month = Rs.378
2. **Calculate the total interest paid:** Rs.378 - Rs.360 = Rs.18
3. **Calculate the interest rate:** (Rs.18 / Rs.360) * 100% = 5%
## Instructions for future problems:
1. **Read the question carefully:** Pay close attention to the details and identify the key information.
2. **Identify the base for calculations:** Determine the correct base value for calculating percentages or ratios.
3. **Perform calculations step-by-step:** Avoid mental math and write down each step to minimize errors.
4. **Double-check calculations:** Verify your calculations before arriving at the final answer.
5. **Consider alternative approaches:** Explore different methods to solve the problem and compare the results.
