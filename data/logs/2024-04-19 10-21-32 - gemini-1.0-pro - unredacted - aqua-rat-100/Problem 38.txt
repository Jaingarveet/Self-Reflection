## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:**
My initial answer was incorrect because I made several errors in my reasoning and calculations:
1. **Misunderstanding the problem:** I misinterpreted the question and assumed that the hollow cube was completely empty inside, which is not the case. The hollow cube still has smaller cubes inside, forming the walls of the hollow space.
2. **Incorrect calculation of unpainted faces:** I subtracted the number of small cubes on the outer surface from the total number of small cubes, which is not the correct way to calculate the number of unpainted faces.
3. **Ignoring the thickness of the walls:** I did not consider the thickness of the walls (1 cm) when calculating the number of small cubes on the outer surface.
**Error Keywords:**
* Misunderstanding the problem
* Incorrect calculation
* Ignoring details
* Misinterpretation
**Solution:**
Here's the correct step-by-step solution:
1. **Calculate the number of small cubes on each face:** 5 cm x 5 cm = 25 small cubes
2. **Calculate the number of small cubes on all six faces:** 25 cubes/face x 6 faces = 150 cubes
3. **Calculate the number of small cubes inside the hollow space:** (4 cm x 4 cm x 4 cm) = 64 cubes
4. **Calculate the total number of small cubes:** 150 cubes (outer surface) + 64 cubes (inside) = 214 cubes
5. **Calculate the number of unpainted faces:** 214 cubes - 150 cubes (outer surface) = 64 cubes
6. **Each unpainted cube has 5 faces:** 64 cubes x 5 faces/cube = 320 faces
**Instructions for Future Problems:**
1. Read the problem carefully and make sure you understand what is being asked.
2. Identify all the relevant information provided in the problem.
3. Break down the problem into smaller, more manageable steps.
