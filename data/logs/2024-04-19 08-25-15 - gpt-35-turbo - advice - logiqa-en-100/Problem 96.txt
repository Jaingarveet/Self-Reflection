Context: Based on the following questions? Most people think that advertisers do whatever they can to attract customers.But advertisers are not always like this.Recently, in order to expand sales, a family magazine called "Bay" was renamed "Inferno", which mainly published violent and pornographic content.As a result, some perennial advertisers from the original "Bay" magazine refused to renew the contract and turned to other publications.This shows that these advertisers not only consider economic benefits, but also take into account their ethical responsibilities.
Question: If the following item is true, can the argument be strengthened most?
Choices:
  A: The cost and selling price of "Inferno" are lower than that of "Harbour".
  B: The above advertisers who refused to renew their contracts have not affected the benefits after switching to other publications.
  C: Readers of family magazines are generally not interested in violent and pornographic content.
  D: Some clients who advertise in other family magazines and so on turn to "Inferno" magazine.

## Assistant 2:
Self-reflection:
The argument is that some advertisers refused to renew their contract with "Inferno" magazine because of its violent and pornographic content. The question asks which item can strengthen the argument the most. Option A is not relevant to the argument. Option B is not helpful in strengthening the argument. Option C is not relevant to the argument. Option D is not helpful in strengthening the argument. Therefore, the answer should be None of the Above. However, since "None of the Above" is not an option, the best answer would be the option that is least irrelevant to the argument, which is Option B.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
