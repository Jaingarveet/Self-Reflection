## System:
You are an expert in Logic.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Advice:
 - Always read the problem carefully and understand the conditions.
 - Always consider all possible combinations of players that could be selected.
 - Always eliminate combinations that do not satisfy the conditions.
 - Always choose the combination that satisfies all the conditions.
 - Always double-check your reasoning to ensure accuracy.
 - Remember that the correct answer is the one that satisfies all the conditions.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
E or F has one person to participate, but not both. So, either E or F will be selected.
One of J or K will participate, but not both. So, either J or K will be selected.
If J participates, then G participates. So, if J is selected, then G must be selected.
Unless F participates, M does not participate. So, if F is not selected, then M cannot be selected.
Therefore, the only possible combinations are:
1. E, J, G, H
2. E, J, G, M
3. E, K, H, M
4. F, J, G, H
5. F, K, G, H
6. F, K, G, M
Combination 1 violates the condition that either E or F will be selected.
Combination 2 violates the condition that if J participates, then G participates.
Combination 3 violates the condition that one of J or K will participate, but not both.
Combination 4 satisfies all the conditions.
Combination 5 violates the condition that unless F participates, M does not participate.
Combination 6 violates the condition that one of J or K will participate, but not both.
Therefore, the answer is G and J.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
