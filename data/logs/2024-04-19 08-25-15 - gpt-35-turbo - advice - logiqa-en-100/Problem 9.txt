## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The printing group consists of F, H, L, and M, and the binding group consists of G, H, and J.
If K replaces F, then the printing group will consist of H, L, M, and K, and the binding group will consist of G, H, and J.
This violates condition (2) because F and K cannot be in the same group.
If K replaces G, then the printing group will consist of F, H, L, and M, and the binding group will consist of H, J, and K.
This satisfies all the given conditions.
If K replaces H, then the printing group will consist of F, L, M, and K, and the binding group will consist of G, J, and H.
This violates condition (5) because there are no same employees in both groups.
If K replaces L, then the printing group will consist of F, H, M, and K, and the binding group will consist of G, H, and J.
This satisfies all the given conditions.
Action: Answer("D")
