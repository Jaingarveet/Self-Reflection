 - Never assume anything that is not explicitly stated in the problem.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that there may be more than one correct answer to a problem.
## Assistant 2:
Reflection:
If G is the northernmost island, then the order of the islands from north to south must be G _ _ _ _ or G _ _ _ I. 
From condition (1), F must be on the north side of H, so the order must be G _ _ F H or G _ F H I. 
From condition (3), G is somewhere in the north of F, so the order must be G F _ H or G F H I. 
From condition (2), E and I are adjacent, so the order must be G F H E I. 
Therefore, there is only one possible arrangement for this group of islands.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: C
