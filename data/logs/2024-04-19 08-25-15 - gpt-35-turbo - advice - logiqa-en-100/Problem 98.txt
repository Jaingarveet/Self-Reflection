## User 2:
Topic: Logic
Context: Right and wrong and whether they violate the rules are two things.There may be regulations that prohibit things that are not wrong in themselves, such as laws in certain countries that prohibit criticism of the government; there may also be regulations that require things that are inherently wrong, such as laws that require apartheid in public places.And, like evaluating behavior, we can also evaluate some of the prescribed right and wrong.
Question: Which of the following does not weaken, but supports the argument in the question stem?
Choices:
  A: If we do not follow some pre-existing regulations or standards, how can we judge right and wrong?
  B: "People are doing, heaven is watching." Failure to act in accordance with ethical regulations will incur punishment from heaven.
  C: Behind the judgment of right and wrong, you can always find the rules or standards on which people judge.
  D: The basis for judgment of right and wrong lies in pushing oneself and one's moral conscience.It is common and universal; however, the moral regulations on how to act for people vary from person to person and from place to place.

## Assistant 2:
Self-reflection:
The question stem talks about regulations that prohibit things that are not wrong in themselves and regulations that require things that are inherently wrong. It also mentions that we can evaluate some of the prescribed right and wrong. The correct answer should support this argument. 
I chose option B as it talks about punishment for not acting ethically. However, this option is not relevant to the argument and does not support it. 
Action: Answer("C") 
Option C supports the argument by stating that behind the judgment of right and wrong, there are rules or standards on which people judge. This reinforces the idea that regulations can dictate what is right and wrong.
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
