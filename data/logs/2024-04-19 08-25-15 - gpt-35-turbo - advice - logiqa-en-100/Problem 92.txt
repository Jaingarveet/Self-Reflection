## Assistant 2:
Thought:
There are three professors who made predictions about the winner of the football game.
Professor Zhao said that the champion is not the Tsinghua University team nor the Zhejiang University team.
Professor Qian said that the champion is not the Tsinghua University team, but the University of Science and Technology of China.
Professor Sun said that the champion is not the China University of Science and Technology team, but the Tsinghua University team.
Only one of them judged both, one 'S judgment is one-to-one wrong, the other one is wrong.
Action: Answer("B") 
Explanation:
From Professor Zhao's statement, we know that Tsinghua University and Zhejiang University are not the champions.
From Professor Qian's statement, we know that the University of Science and Technology of China is not the champion, but Tsinghua University could still be the champion.
From Professor Sun's statement, we know that Tsinghua University is not the champion, but China University of Science and Technology could still be the champion.
Therefore, the only team left that could be the champion is Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics.
Since only one of the professors judged both, and one's judgment is one-to-one wrong, the other one is wrong, we can conclude that Professor Qian's statement is correct, and the University of Science and Technology of China is not the champion. Therefore, the winner is Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics.
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
