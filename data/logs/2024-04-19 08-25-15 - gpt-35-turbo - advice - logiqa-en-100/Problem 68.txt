Topic: Logic
Context: Whether a person does good behavior or bad behavior depends on the length of his life.If he only lived one day, it would be best for him to steal other people â€™s things because he would not suffer the fear of being caught.Stealing things from others is not the best for someone who can still live for 20 years, because he will suffer the fear of being caught.
Question: Which of the following statements is the assumption upon which the above argument relies?
Choices:
  A: Before deciding whether to steal something from someone else, a person can know exactly how long he can live.
  B: Anyone who steals things from others will not live for a few days.

## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The argument states that the decision to do good or bad behavior depends on the length of a person's life. If a person only has one day to live, then stealing is the best option because they won't suffer the fear of being caught. If a person has a longer life expectancy, then stealing is not the best option because they will suffer the fear of being caught. The assumption upon which the argument relies is that the fear of being caught is the primary factor that determines whether a person engages in good or bad behavior.
Action: Answer("C")
