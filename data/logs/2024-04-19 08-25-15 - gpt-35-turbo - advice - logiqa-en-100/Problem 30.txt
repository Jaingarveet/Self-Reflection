## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The question states that five people were identified as candidates for the first prize, and we need to select four people out of them.
We need to consider the following factors:
1) At least one person of Bingding is selected.
2) If E is selected, then A and B are also selected.
3) A maximum of 2 people are selected.
If we select A, B, and Ding, then we can select either C or E to fulfill the first two conditions. However, if we select E, then we must select A and B, which violates the third condition. Therefore, E cannot be in the fourth.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
