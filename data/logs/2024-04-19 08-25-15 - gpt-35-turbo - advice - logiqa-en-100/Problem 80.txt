## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The finance department is on the next floor of the planning department, so the planning department must be on a floor other than the top or bottom floor. The administrative department is above the planning department, but below the human resources department, so it must be on a floor between the planning department and the human resources department. The two floors of the human resources department and the sales department are not adjacent, so they cannot be on floors next to each other. Therefore, the sales department must be on either the top or bottom floor. The R&D department must be on a floor other than the top or bottom floor, and it cannot be on the same floor as the planning department. 
Action: Answer("C")
