## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The given information is:
- Zhang Shan received a higher bonus than Li Si.
- Wang Wu's bonus was higher than Miao Xiaoqin's.
- Zhang Shan's bonus was also higher than Miao Xiaoqin's.
To make the inference hold, the following assumptions are necessary:
- Zhang Shan's bonus is higher than Miao Xiaoqin's.
- Wang Wu's bonus is higher than Li Si's.
- Li Si's bonus is higher than Miao Xiaoqin's.
- Li Si's bonus is not as high as Wang Wu's.
