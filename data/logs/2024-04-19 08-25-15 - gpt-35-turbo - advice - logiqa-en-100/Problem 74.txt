## Assistant 2:
Reflection:
To form a five-person support group, two girls and three boys are selected.
If He Zhilian is not selected, then Fang Rufen and Guo Yanran are selected.
From the requirements, we know that Guo Yanran and Tang Xiaohua cannot be selected at the same time.
Therefore, if Guo Yanran is selected, then Tang Xiaohua cannot be selected.
From the requirements, we also know that Qiu Zhijie and Tang Xiaohua cannot be selected at the same time.
Therefore, if Tang Xiaohua is not selected, then Qiu Zhijie can be selected.
From the requirements, we know that Peng Youwen and Song Wenkai cannot be selected at the same time.
Therefore, if Peng Youwen is selected, then Song Wenkai cannot be selected.
Therefore, if He Zhilian is not selected, then the remaining boys are Peng Youwen, Qiu Zhijie, Ren Xiangyang, and Song Wenkai.
The girl who is not selected is Tang Xiaohua.
Action: Answer("A")
