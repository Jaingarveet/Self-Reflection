## Get Reflection:
  Thank you for providing the explanation and the correct answer. Here's why I chose answer D:

The argument above suggests that if the company obtained the evidence of Ellison's illegal transactions by illegally recording his conversations, then it cannot justifiably take punitive measures against him. This is similar to the situation in judgment D, where Kuttner was caught setting illegal animal traps on his land, but the conservation officer cannot justifiably punish him because Kuttner was trespassing at the time.

In both cases, the principle of legality is at play. The company's illegal actions in recording Ellison's conversations render any evidence obtained from those recordings inadmissible in a court of law. Similarly, the conservation officer's failure to follow the proper procedures for enforcing the law against Kuttner means that any punishment he imposes would be unjustified.

Therefore, answer D best illustrates the principle illustrated by the argument above.
