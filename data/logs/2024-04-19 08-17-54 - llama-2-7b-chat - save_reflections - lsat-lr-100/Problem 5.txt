## Get Reflection:
  Explanation:
The correct answer is (E) Many more citizens are helping authorities detect tornadoes now than in 1953.

The passage states that the number of tornadoes recorded annually in North America has more than tripled since 1953, yet meteorologists insist that the climatic factors affecting the creation of tornadoes are unchanged. This implies that the increase in the number of tornadoes must be due to some other factor. Choice C suggests that the increase in the number of tornadoes has only occurred in the last five years, which is a more specific and plausible explanation for the discrepancy.

The other choices do not provide a plausible explanation for the discrepancy:

* Choice A is incorrect because the factors affecting the creation of tornadoes were likely known to meteorologists before 1953, and the discrepancy cannot be explained by a lack of knowledge.
* Choice B is incorrect because there is no evidence to suggest that the intensity of the average tornado has increased over time.
* Choice D is incorrect because while property damage from tornadoes has certainly increased over time, this does not explain the discrepancy in the number of tornadoes recorded.

Therefore, the correct answer is (E) Many more citizens are helping authorities detect tornadoes now than in 1953, which provides a plausible explanation for the discrepancy in the number of tornadoes recorded.
