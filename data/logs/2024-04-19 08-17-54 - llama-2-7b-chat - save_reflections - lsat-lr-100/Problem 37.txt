## Get Reflection:
  Thank you for providing the reflection and answer for the first question. Here is the next question:

Topic: Law
Context: Rossi: It is undemocratic for people to live under a government in which their interests are not represented. So children should have the right to vote, since sometimes the interests of children are different from those of their parents. Smith: Granted, children's interests are not always the same as their parents'; governmental deficits incurred by their parents' generation will later affect their own generation's standard of living. But even if children are told about the issues affecting them, which is not generally the case, their conceptions of what can or should be done are too simple, and their time horizons are radically different from those of adults, so we cannot give them the responsibility of voting.

Question: Which of the following arguments can most directly be used as part of an argument against Smith's position?
Choices:
  A: Children are not yet fully developed cognitively and therefore lack the capacity to make informed decisions about political issues.
  B: Children are not yet members of society and therefore do not have the same rights as adults.
  C: Children are not yet able to understand the long-term consequences of political decisions, and therefore cannot be trusted to make decisions that affect their future.
  D: Children are not yet able to participate in political discussions and debates, and therefore cannot be expected to vote in a meaningful way.
  E: Children have the same rights as adults and should be given the same political rights, including the right to vote.

Please select one of the options from the above choices.
