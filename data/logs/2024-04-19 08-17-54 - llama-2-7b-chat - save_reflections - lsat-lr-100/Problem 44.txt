## Get Reflection:
  Explanation:
The argument in the passage is an example of affirming the antecedent, which is a type of fallacy. The reasoning in the argument is flawed because it assumes that just because most people in Hallstown shop for groceries no more than three times a month, it follows that most people in Hallstown buy prepared frozen dinners regularly. However, this conclusion is not supported by any evidence or reasoning, and it ignores the possibility that some people in Hallstown may not buy prepared frozen dinners even if they shop for groceries frequently.

The correct answer is (D) Most people in Highland County drive sedans. This argument also uses affirming the antecedent, assuming that just because most people who commute to work drive sedans, it follows that most people in Highland County drive sedans. Like the original argument, this conclusion is not supported by any evidence or reasoning, and it ignores the possibility that some people in Highland County may not drive sedans.

Advice:

* Be aware of the affirming the antecedent fallacy, which occurs when a conclusion is based solely on the premise that the antecedent is true without considering any evidence or reasoning that might contradict the conclusion.
* Always consider alternative explanations and evidence that may contradict the conclusion.
* Avoid making assumptions about a conclusion based solely on the premise that the antecedent is true.
* Look for evidence and reasoning that supports the conclusion, rather than simply assuming it based on the premise.
