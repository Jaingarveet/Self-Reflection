## Get Reflection:
  Great job! Your explanation and answer are correct. Here's a breakdown of why each option is incorrect:

Option (A): Rey did not have permission from the store owner to access the computer, so this option is not justified.

Option (C): The police officer accessed files on Natalie's computer without her permission, which is not justified according to the lawyer's principles.

Option (B): While the police officers had reasonable grounds to believe that the computer files contained evidence usable in a legal proceeding against the firm's owner, they did not have permission from the firm's owner to access the files. Therefore, their action was not justified.

Option (E): The police officer accessed personal letters written by one of the company's employees, which are not data usable as evidence in a legal proceeding against the company's owner. Therefore, the police officer's action was not justified.

Option (D): This option aligns best with the lawyer's principles as customs officials examined all of the files stored on a laptop computer confiscated from an importer whom they suspected of smuggling. Since there were reasonable grounds for believing that the computer had typically been used in the operation of the importer's legitimate business, the customs officials' action was justified.

Great job!
