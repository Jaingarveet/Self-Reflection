## Get Reflection:
  My apologies, you are correct. Here is the corrected response:

Action: Answer("D")

The correct answer is (D): Most subscribers to scholarly journals are individuals, not libraries, and the subscription rates for individuals have generally increased over the past several years. This option provides a counterargument to the argument that the increase in subscription rates is due to the profitability of publishing scholarly journals. If most subscribers are individuals and their subscription rates have increased, then the increase in subscription rates cannot be attributed to the profitability of the journals themselves.
