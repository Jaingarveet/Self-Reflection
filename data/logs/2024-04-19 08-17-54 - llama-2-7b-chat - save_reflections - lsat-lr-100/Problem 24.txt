## Get Reflection:
  Explanation:
The argument in option C uses flawed reasoning similar to the one used in the argument above by making a generalization based on a minority of cases and then drawing a conclusion about the majority.

In option C, the argument states that some corporations feign concern for the environment when advertising a product as environmentally friendly, and then concludes that no corporation has a genuine concern for the environment. Similarly, in the argument above, it is stated that only a minority of people engage in political action out of a sense of social justice, and then concluded that some people who have a sense of social justice do not engage in political action.

Both arguments are flawed because they make a hasty generalization based on a limited sample size, and then use that generalization to make a conclusion about the entire group.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) Most scholars are not motivated by a desire to win prestigious academic prizes. Thus, some of those who want to win prestigious academic prizes are not scholars.

Advice:

* Be cautious of arguments that make generalizations based on a minority of cases.
* Always consider the possibility that the minority may not represent the majority.
* Avoid making conclusions about a group based on a single example or a limited number of examples.
* Look for evidence that supports the conclusion, rather than relying on assumptions or generalizations.
* Consider alternative explanations for the observed phenomenon.
