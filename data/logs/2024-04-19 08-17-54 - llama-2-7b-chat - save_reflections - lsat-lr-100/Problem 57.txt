## Get Reflection:
  Explanation:
The correct answer is (D) The more prone a jogger is to jogging injuries, the more likely he or she is to develop the habit of performing stretches before jogging.

The medical researcher's argument that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries is based on the finding that both groups of joggers incurred roughly the same number of injuries. However, if the more prone a jogger is to injuries, the more likely he or she is to develop the habit of performing stretches before jogging, then the effect of stretching on injury prevention may be different. In this case, the fact that both groups of joggers incurred similar numbers of injuries may indicate that stretching before jogging does help to prevent injuries, as the more prone joggers may be more likely to perform stretches and therefore less likely to incur injuries.

Therefore, if the more prone a jogger is to injuries, the more likely he or she is to develop the habit of performing stretches before jogging, then the argument that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries may be weakened.
