## Get Reflection:
 Explanation:
The journalist's statements provide information about the relationship between the presence of lithium in a celestial object's atmosphere and the object's internal nuclear furnace. Based on the statements, the most strongly supported answer is option C: No celestial object that has no lithium in its atmosphere is a brown dwarf.

The journalist explains that stars with more mass than the Sun have lithium remaining in their atmospheres because the mixing of elements in their internal nuclear furnaces is incomplete. This means that any celestial object without lithium in its atmosphere is likely to be a brown dwarf, which does not have a fully functional nuclear furnace. Therefore, option C is the most strongly supported by the journalist's statements.

Option A is incorrect because the journalist does not provide any information to suggest that any celestial object without lithium in its atmosphere is necessarily a star with less mass than the Sun. Option B is also incorrect because the journalist's statements do not provide any information about the relationship between the presence of lithium in an object's atmosphere and the object's mass. Option D is incorrect because the journalist's statements do not provide any information about the relationship between lithium and the mass of a celestial object. Option E is incorrect because the journalist's statements do not provide any information about the presence of lithium in the atmospheres of celestial objects with different masses.
