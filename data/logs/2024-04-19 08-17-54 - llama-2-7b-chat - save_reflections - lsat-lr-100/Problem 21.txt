## Get Reflection:
 Explanation:
The editorial's argument depends on the assumption that agricultural life no longer occupies most of our citizens. This assumption is choice (B).

The editorial argues that the current school calendar was established to meet the needs of early-twentieth-century agricultural life, but since most citizens no longer work in agriculture, the long breaks in the school calendar are no longer necessary. Therefore, the editorial suggests removing long breaks from the school calendar to better serve the interests of children.

Choices (A), (C), and (D) are not assumptions on which the editorial's argument depends. Choice (A) is incorrect because the editorial does not suggest that children forget what they have learned during long breaks. Choice (C) is incorrect because the editorial does not propose replacing long breaks with breaks that are no longer than workers' average vacations. Choice (D) is incorrect because the editorial does not argue that shortening breaks would serve the interests of agricultural life.

Therefore, the correct answer is choice (E), which states that a school calendar made up of periods of study without long breaks would serve the interests of children more than a school calendar with long breaks.
