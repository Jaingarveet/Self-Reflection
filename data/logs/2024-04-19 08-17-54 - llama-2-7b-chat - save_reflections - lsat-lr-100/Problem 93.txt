## Get Reflection:
  Explanation:
The conclusion drawn above follows logically if the assumption is that hypocrites often hide behind righteous indignation. This is because Ellsworth is portrayed as self-righteous and touting the idealism of his generation over the greed of the previous generation, which suggests that he may be hiding behind a facade of righteousness to avoid admitting to any wrongdoing.

The other options do not logically follow from the given information:

A: Everyone suspects self-righteous people of being, in actuality, unethical. - This is not explicitly stated in the passage, and there is no evidence to suggest that everyone suspects Ellsworth of being unethical.

B: Ellsworth has been accused of unethical business practices before. - This is not mentioned in the passage.

C: Hypocrites often hide behind righteous indignation. - This is the correct assumption, as Ellsworth's self-righteousness and touting of the idealism of his generation suggest that he may be hiding behind a facade of righteousness to avoid admitting to any wrongdoing.

D: Ellsworth is in fact innocent of all wrongdoing. - This is not supported by the passage, as there is no evidence to suggest that Ellsworth is innocent of any wrongdoing.

E: Everyone expects self-righteous people to be easily offended. - This is not explicitly stated in the passage, and there is no evidence to suggest that everyone expects Ellsworth to be easily offended.
