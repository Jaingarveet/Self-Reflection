## Get Reflection:
  Excellent! You have correctly identified the correct answer. Here's why:

The argument above suggests that Carl is the most incompetent detective on the police force, based on the fact that he has solved only 1 out of 25 cases assigned to him in the last 3 years. However, the statement "Carl was previously a detective in a police department in another city, and in the 4 years he spent there, he solved only 1 out of 30 crimes" provides an alternative explanation for Carl's poor performance on the current police force.

Option (D) Carl was previously a detective in a police department in another city, and in the 4 years he spent there, he solved only 1 out of 30 crimes, is the best answer because it provides a possible explanation for Carl's poor performance on the current police force. It suggests that Carl's poor performance may not be due to his incompetence as a detective, but rather due to factors unrelated to his detective skills, such as a lack of resources or support. Therefore, this information weakens the argument that Carl is the most incompetent detective on the police force.

Great job!
