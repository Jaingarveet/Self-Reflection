## Get Reflection:
  Explanation:
The argument is based on the fact that more cocker spaniels are registered to addresses in the Flynn Heights neighborhood than to addresses in all other neighborhoods combined. Therefore, the most useful piece of information to know in order to evaluate the argument is the number of cocker spaniels registered to addresses in Flynn Heights.

The correct answer is (E) whether residents of Flynn Heights are more likely to license their dogs than residents of other neighborhoods are. This information is relevant to evaluating the argument because if residents of Flynn Heights are more likely to license their dogs, then it is more likely that the stray cocker spaniel found in the area is actually licensed and belongs to someone in Flynn Heights.

The other options are not as relevant to evaluating the argument:

(A) whether cocker spaniels are more likely than dogs of other breeds to stray from their owners is not directly related to the number of cocker spaniels registered in Flynn Heights.

(B) whether there are more cocker spaniels registered to addresses in Flynn Heights than any other breed of dog is also not directly related to the number of cocker spaniels registered in Flynn Heights.

(C) whether the city's animal control officers find more stray dogs in and around Flynn Heights than in any other part of the city is relevant, but it is not the most important piece of information to know in order to evaluate the argument.

(D) whether the number of pets owned, per capita, is greater for residents of Flynn Heights than for residents of any other neighborhood is not directly related to the number of cocker spaniels registered in Flynn Heights.

Therefore, the correct answer is (E) whether residents of Flynn Heights are more likely to license their dogs than residents of other neighborhoods are.
