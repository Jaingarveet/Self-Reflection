## Get Reflection:
  Explanation:
The argument in the editorial relies on the assumption that a legislator's claim that increasing spending on education is a worthy goal and their vote against increasing spending on education are inconsistent. This assumption is based on the fact that the political party in question has expressed both views, which suggests that their policy is inconsistent.

The other options do not accurately describe the assumption made in the editorial:

Option B is not relevant to the argument, as it does not address the inconsistency between the party's expressed views on education spending.

Option C is also not relevant, as the editorial does not argue that the party's goal of increasing spending on education is morally wrong.

Option E is also not relevant, as the editorial does not suggest that members of one political party never have inconsistent views on political issues.

Therefore, the best answer is option D: A consistent political policy does not hold that an action that comprises a worthy goal should not be performed. The editorial assumes that the party's inconsistent views on education spending are a result of an inconsistent political policy.
