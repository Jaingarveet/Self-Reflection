## Get Reflection:
 Explanation:
The correct answer is choice C: The copy protection feature causes a copied game to be playable just long enough for most people to come to enjoy it so much that they decide they have to have it.

This choice provides the most support for the president's prediction because it suggests that the new copy protection feature will actually encourage people to buy the game, rather than simply preventing them from copying it. If the feature is making the game more enjoyable or desirable, then it is likely that sales will increase.
