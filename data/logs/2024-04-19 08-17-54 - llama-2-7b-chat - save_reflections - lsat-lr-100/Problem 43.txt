## Get Reflection:
  Explanation:
The ethicist's conclusion that marital vows to love "until death do us part" makes no sense if "love" refers to feelings, which are not within one's control, follows logically if the assumption is that promises should not be interpreted in such a way that they make no sense. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) Promises should not be interpreted in such a way that they make no sense.

The other options do not follow logically from the ethicist's conclusion:

* Option (A) None of our feelings are within our control is not necessarily true, and even if it were, it would not logically follow that marital vows to love "until death do us part" make no sense.
* Option (C) "Love" can legitimately be taken to refer to something other than feelings is possible, but it does not address the issue of whether marital vows to love "until death do us part" make sense if "love" refers to feelings.
* Option (E) Promises that cannot be kept do not make any sense is true, but it does not logically follow that marital vows to love "until death do us part" make no sense if "love" refers to feelings.

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) Promises should not be interpreted in such a way that they make no sense.
