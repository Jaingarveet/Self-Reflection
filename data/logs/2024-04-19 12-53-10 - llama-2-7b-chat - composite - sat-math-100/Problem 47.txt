Question: In air, the speed of sound $S$, in meters per second, is a linear function of the air temperature $T$, in degrees Celsius, and is given by $S(T)=0.6 T+331.4$. Which of the following statements is the best interpretation of the number 331.4 in this context?
Choices:
  A: The speed of sound, in meters per second, at $0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$
  B: The speed of sound, in meters per second, at $0.6^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$
  C: The increase in the speed of sound, in meters per second, that corresponds to an increase of $1^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$
  D: The increase in the speed of sound, in meters per second, that corresponds to an increase of $0.6^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$
