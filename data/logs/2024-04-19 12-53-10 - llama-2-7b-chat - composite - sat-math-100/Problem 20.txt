Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:

The correct answer is (A) [REDACTED].

To find the $x$-coordinate of the intersection point of the system of equations, we need to solve the first equation for $x$ and then substitute the solution into the second equation.

Solving the first equation for $x$, we get:

$2.4x - 1.5y = 0.3$

$x = 0.3 / 2.4$

$x = 0.125$

Now, substituting the value of $x$ into the second equation:

$1.6x + 0.5y = -1.3$

$1.6(0.125) + 0.5y = -1.3$

$0.19 + 0.5y = -1.3$

$0.7y = -1.41$

$y = -2.02$

Therefore, the $x$-coordinate of the intersection point is $x = 0.125$, which corresponds to the answer (B) [REDACTED].

However, there is a mistake in the answer key. The correct answer is (A) [REDACTED].

Advice:

* Always check your calculations and ensure that they are correct.
* When solving a system of equations, it is important to isolate each variable separately and then substitute the solutions into the other equation.
* When solving for $x$, always divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of $x$.
* When solving for $y$, always divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of $y$.
* Always check your work by plugging in the values of $x$ and $y$ into one of the equations and verifying that the result is true.
