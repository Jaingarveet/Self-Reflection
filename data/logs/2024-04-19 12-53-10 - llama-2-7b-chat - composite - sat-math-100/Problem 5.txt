## Assistant 2:
  Thought:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I am reflecting on my solution and the correct answer.

Action:
I realized that the equation should be $\frac{x}{2} = 30$, not $x + 30 = 2$.

Reflection:
I analyzed my mistake and realized that I misunderstood the problem. I mistakenly added 30 to the right-hand side of the equation instead of dividing the number of states that joined between 1850 and 1900 by 2.

Explanation:
The correct equation is $\frac{x}{2} = 30$, which means that $x = 60$.

Advice:
When solving a problem, it is essential to carefully read and understand the question, and to reflect on your previous solutions to ensure that you are on the right track. It is also helpful to check your work and double-check your calculations to avoid making mistakes.
