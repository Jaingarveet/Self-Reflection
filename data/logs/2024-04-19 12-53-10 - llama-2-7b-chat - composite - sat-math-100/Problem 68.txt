Question: $$0.10 x+0.20 y=0.18(x+y)$$Clayton will mix $x$ milliliters of a $10 \%$ by mass saline solution with $y$ milliliters of a $20 \%$ by mass saline solution in order to create an $18 \%$ by mass saline solution. The equation above represents this situation. If Clayton uses 100 milliliters of the $20 \%$ by mass saline solution, how many milliliters of the $10 \%$ by mass saline solution must he use?
Choices:
  A: 5
  B: 25
  C: 50
  D: 100

## Assistant 2:
  Thought:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand that the equation represents a proportion. To find the amount of the $10\%$ by mass saline solution needed, I can use the cross-multiplication method.

$$0.10x + 0.20y = 0.18(x+y)$$

$$0.10x = 0.18(x+y) - 0.20y$$

$$x = \frac{0.18(x+y) - 0.20y}{0.10}$$

$$x = \frac{0.18x + 0.20y - 0.20y}{0.10}$$

$$x = \frac{0.18x}{0.10}$$

$$y = \frac{0.20y}{0.10}$$

Now, I need to find the value of $y$ that will give me the desired percentage of $18\%$.

Reflection:
I reflected on my previous answer and realized that I made a mistake in my calculation. I misunderstood the proportion and the equation. I will use the cross-multiplication method to find the correct solution.

Action: Answer("B")
