# Model: llama-2-7b-chat | Agent: composite | Exam: sat-math-100 | Problem 87 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Assistant 2:
  Thought: 
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand the mistake. The equation of the line is $y = 25$, and it intersects the parabola at two points, $A$ and $B$. To find the length of $\overline{A B}$, I need to use the distance formula, which is $d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$.

Action: Answer("C")

Explanation:

The correct answer is (C) 14. To see why, let's plug in the values for $x_1 = 2$ and $y_1 = 13$ for point $A$, and $x_2 = 4$ and $y_2 = 21$ for point $B$.

Error Keywords:

* Solution: The mistake in my previous answer was that I did not use the correct equation of the line.
* Instructions: Make sure to use the correct equation of the line and the distance formula to find the length of $\overline{A B}$.
* Advice: Take your time to carefully read the problem and understand the equation of the line and the parabola. Use the distance formula to find the length of $\overline{A B}$.
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
