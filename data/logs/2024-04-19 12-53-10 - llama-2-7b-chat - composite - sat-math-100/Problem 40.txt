Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I made a mistake in my reasoning and calculation. I incorrectly solved the equation $20-x=1[REDACTED]$ and arrived at the wrong answer.

Error Keywords:

* Misunderstanding the equation
* Incorrect calculation
* Failure to check work

Solution:
The equation $20-x=1[REDACTED]$ can be solved by subtracting $x$ from both sides of the equation:

$20 - x = 1[REDACTED]$
$x = [REDACTED]$

Therefore, the value of $3x$ is $[REDACTED]: 1[REDACTED]$.

Instructions:

1. Read the question carefully and understand the problem.
2. Identify the given information and the unknown variable.
3. Use the given information to solve the equation.
4. Check your work to ensure accuracy.
[REDACTED]. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.

Advice:

* Always read the question carefully and understand the problem before starting to solve it.
* Use the correct mathematical operations and symbols.
