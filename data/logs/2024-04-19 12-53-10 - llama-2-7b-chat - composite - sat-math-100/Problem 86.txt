Question: If $y=k x$, where $k$ is a constant, and $y=24$ when $x=6$, what is the value of $y$ when $x=5$ ?
Choices:
  A: 6
  B: 15

Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I made a mistake in my reasoning and calculation. I correctly set up the equation $y = kx$ and substituted $x = [REDACTED]$ to get $y = 12$. However, I then made an error in my calculation by assuming that the value of $y$ when $x = 5$ would be the same as when $x = [REDACTED]$.

The correct solution is:

If $y = kx$ and $y = 24$ when $x = [REDACTED]$, then we can set up the equation:

$$y = kx$$

Substituting $x = 5$, we get:

$$y = k(5)$$

Which gives us:

$$y = 10$$

So, the value of $y$ when $x = 5$ is $10$.

Advice:

* Always double-check your calculations and assumptions.
* Make sure you are using the correct value of $k$.
* Consider the value of $y$ when $x = 5$ to be $10$.
* Be careful when substituting values into the equation.

  Great, let's solve this problem again! ðŸ˜Š

The question asks us to find the value of $y$ when $x = 5$. We know that $y = kx$, where $k$ is a constant. When $x = 6$, we have $y = 24$.

So, we can set up the equation:

$$y = kx$$

Substituting $x = 5$, we get:

$$y = k(5)$$

What is the value of $k$? We are given that $y = 24$ when $x = 6$, so we can write:

$$k = \frac{y}{x}$$

Substituting $x = 6$, we get:

$$k = \frac{24}{6} = 4$$

Now, we can substitute $k = 4$ into the equation $y = kx$:

$$y = 4x$$

Substituting $x = 5$, we get:

$$y = 4(5) = 20$$

So, the value of $y$ when $x = 5$ is $20$. ðŸ˜Š

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.
