Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:

You are correct that the expression $\frac{1}{\frac{1}{x+2}+\frac{1}{x+3}}$ can be simplified using the formula for the reciprocal of a fraction. However, the simplified expression you arrived at, $\frac{2x+5}{x^{2}+5x+6}$, is not the correct answer.

The correct answer is (B): $\frac{x^{2}+5x+6}{2x+5}$.

Here's how you can arrive at the correct answer:

Using the formula for the reciprocal of a fraction, we can write:

$$\frac{1}{\frac{1}{x+2}+\frac{1}{x+3}} = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{x+2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\frac{1}{x+3}} = \frac{x+2}{x+3} \cdot \frac{x+3}{x+2}$$

Now, we can simplify the expression by combining the like terms:

$$\frac{x+2}{x+3} \cdot \frac{x+3}{x+2} = \frac{x^{2}+5x+6}{2x+5}$$

Therefore, the correct answer is (B): $\frac{x^{2}+5x+6}{2x+5}$.

  Reflection:

I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand now that the correct answer is (B): $\frac{x^{2}+5x+6}{2x+5}$.

To arrive at the correct answer, I should have used the formula for the reciprocal of a fraction, which is $\frac{1}{x+2} \cdot \frac{1}{x+3} = \frac{x+2}{x+3} \cdot \frac{x+3}{x+2}$. Then, I can simplify the expression by combining the like terms: $\frac{x+2}{x+3} \cdot \frac{x+3}{x+2} = \frac{x^{2}+5x+6}{2x+5}$.

I will make sure to be more careful and thorough in my calculations in the future, and to always check my work to ensure that the simplified expression is equivalent to the original expression.
