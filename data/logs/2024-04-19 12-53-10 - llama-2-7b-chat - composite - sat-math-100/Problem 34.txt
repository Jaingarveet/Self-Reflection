Question: A book was on sale for $40 \%$ off its original price. If the sale price of the book was $\$ 18.00$, what was the original price of the book? (Assume there is no sales tax.)

Reflection:

I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I realized that I made a mistake in my calculation. I reflected on my solution and the correct answer.

Error Keywords:

* Misunderstood the percentage discount
* Did not calculate the original price correctly

Solution:

To find the original price of the book, we need to calculate 40% of the sale price and subtract it from the sale price.

40% of $\$ 18.00$ = $\$ 7.20$

So, the original price of the book was $\$ 18.00 - \$ 7.20 = \$ 10.80$.

Advice:

When solving a problem, it's essential to read the question carefully and make sure you understand what is being asked. In this case, I misunderstood the percentage discount and calculated the wrong answer. Always double-check your work and use the correct formula to ensure you get the right answer.
