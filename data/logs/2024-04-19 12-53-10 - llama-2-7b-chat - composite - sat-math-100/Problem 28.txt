## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: $$\frac{x^{2}-1}{x-1}=-2$$What are all values of $x$ that satisfy the equation above?
Choices:
  A: -3
  B: 0
  C: 1
  D: -3 and -1
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I made a mistake in my solution to the equation $\frac{x^{2}-[REDACTED]}{x-[REDACTED]} = -2$.

The correct solution is:

$$\frac{x^{2}-[REDACTED]}{x-[REDACTED]} = -2 \Rightarrow x^{2} - 2 = [REDACTED] \Rightarrow x^{2} = 2 \Rightarrow x = \pm [REDACTED]$$

So, the values of $x$ that satisfy the equation are $x = [REDACTED]$ and $x = -[REDACTED]$.

Error Keywords:

* Factoring error
* Simplification error
* Calculation error

Solution:

[REDACTED]. Start with the given equation: $\frac{x^{2}-[REDACTED]}{x-[REDACTED]} = -2$
2. Simplify the right-hand side of the equation by multiplying both sides by $x-[REDACTED]$, which gives us $x^{2} - 2 = [REDACTED]$
3. Factor the left-hand side of the equation as $x^{2} - 2 = (x + [REDACTED])(x - 2) = [REDACTED]$
4. Solve for $x$ by setting each factor equal to $[REDACTED]$ and solving for $x$
5. Check the solutions to ensure they satisfy the original equation

Instructions:

[REDACTED]. Always simplify and factor equations before solving them.
2. Check your work by verifying that the solutions satisfy the original equation.
3. Be careful when factoring and simplifying equations, as small mistakes can lead to large errors.
4. Use the correct order of operations when solving equations.
5. Double-check your calculations and ensure that they are accurate.

Advice:

* Always approach math problems with a clear and organized mindset.
* Break down complex problems into smaller, manageable steps.
* Use visual aids, such as graphs or diagrams, to help you understand the problem and find the solution.
* Practice regularly to improve your math skills and build confidence.
* Don't be afraid to ask for help when you need it.
