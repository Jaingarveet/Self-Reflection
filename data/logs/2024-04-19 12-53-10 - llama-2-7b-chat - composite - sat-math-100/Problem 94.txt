## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I correctly identified the square root of the given expression as $\sqrt{9x^2}$.

Error Keywords:

* None

Solution:
The given expression is $\sqrt{9x^2}$.

To find the equivalent expression, we need to find the square root of $9x^2$.

Step-by-step solution:

1. Identify the square root of $9x^2$: $\sqrt{9x^2} = 3x$

Therefore, the equivalent expression is (B): $3x$.

Instructions:

1. Identify the square root of the given expression.
2. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.
3. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
4. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.

Advice:

* Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
* Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
* Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
* Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
* Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
* Remember that the square root of a number is the value that, when multiplied by itself, gives the original number.
