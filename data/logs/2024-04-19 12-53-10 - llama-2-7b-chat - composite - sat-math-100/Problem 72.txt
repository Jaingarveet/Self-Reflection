Question: $$h=3 a+28.6$$A pediatrician uses the model above to estimate the height $h$ of a boy, in inches, in terms of the boy's age $a$, in years, between the ages of 2 and 5. Based on the model, what is the estimated increase, in inches, of a boy's height each year?
Choices:
  A: 3
  B: $\quad 5.7$
  C: 9.5
  D: 14.3

Question: $$h=3 a+28.6$$

Self-Reflection:

I previously answered this question incorrectly, and upon reflection, I realized that I made a mistake in my calculation. I misunderstood the model and calculated the increase in height per year incorrectly.

Error Keywords:

* Misunderstood the model
* Calculated the increase in height per year incorrectly

Solution:

To find the estimated increase in height per year, we need to solve for the coefficient of $a$ in the model.

$$h = 3a + 28.6$$

Subtracting $28.6$ from both sides gives us:

$$h = 3a$$

Dividing both sides by $3$ gives us:

$$a = \frac{h}{3}$$

Now, we can find the increase in height per year by subtracting the age of the boy at the beginning of the period from his age at the end of the period:

$$\Delta h = h_2 - h_1 = \frac{h_2}{3} - \frac{h_1}{3}$$

Where $h_1$ and $h_2$ are the heights of the boy at the beginning and end of the period, respectively.

Therefore, the estimated increase in height per year is:

$$\Delta h = \frac{h_2 - h_1}{3} = \frac{h}{3} - \frac{h}{3} = \frac{h}{9}$$

Correct Answer: B - $\quad 5.7$

Advice:

When solving a problem, it's essential to carefully read and understand the question, including any given information or constraints. Make sure to break down the problem into smaller, manageable parts, and use the appropriate mathematical techniques to solve it. In this case, we needed to divide the height by 3 to find the increase in height per year. Finally, double-check your answer to ensure it's correct.
