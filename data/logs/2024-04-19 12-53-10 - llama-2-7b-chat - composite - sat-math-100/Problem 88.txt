Question: $$h=-4.9 t^{2}+25 t$$The equation above expresses the approximate height $h$, in meters, of a ball $t$ seconds after it is launched vertically upward from the ground with an initial velocity of 25 meters per second. After approximately how many seconds will the ball hit the ground?
Choices:
  A: 3.5
  B: 4.0
  C: 4.5
  D: 5.0

## Assistant 2:
  Thought:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand that the ball will hit the ground after approximately 4.0 seconds.

Reflection:
I analyzed my previous solution and realized that I made a mistake in my calculations. I misunderstood the equation and calculated the time incorrectly.

Action:
To solve this problem, I will use the equation again and apply the correct calculations.

$$h=-4.9 t^{2}+25 t$$

Substituting t = 4.0 (the time it takes for the ball to hit the ground), we get:

$$h=-4.9 \times 4^{2}+25 \times 4=24.1+100=124.1$$

Therefore, the ball will hit the ground after approximately 124.1 seconds.

Answer: B: 4.0 seconds.
