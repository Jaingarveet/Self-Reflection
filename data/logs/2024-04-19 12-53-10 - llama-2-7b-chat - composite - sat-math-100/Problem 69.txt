Question: Alan drives an average of 100 miles each week. His car can travel an average of 25 miles per gallon of gasoline. Alan would like to reduce his weekly expenditure on gasoline by $\$ 5$. Assuming gasoline costs $\$ 4$ per gallon, which equation can Alan use to determine how many fewer average miles, $m$, he should drive each week?
Choices:
  A: $\frac{25}{4} m=95$
  B: $\frac{25}{4} m=5$
  C: $\frac{4}{25} m=95$
  D: $\frac{4}{25} m=5$
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I made a mistake in my previous answer. The correct equation to determine how many fewer miles Alan should drive each week to reduce his weekly expenditure on gasoline by $\$ 5$ is:

$$\frac{25}{4} m = 95$$

So, the correct answer is (D) $\frac{4}{25} m = 5$.

Error Keywords:

* Calculation error
* Arithmetic error
* Division error

Solution:

To reduce Alan's weekly expenditure on gasoline by $\$ 5$, he needs to drive fewer miles. Let's use the equation:

$$\frac{25}{4} m = 95$$

Where $m$ is the number of fewer miles Alan should drive each week.

Rearranging the equation, we get:

$$m = \frac{95}{25}$$

So, Alan should drive $5$ fewer miles each week to reduce his weekly expenditure on gasoline by $\$ 5$.

Instructions:

1. Identify the problem and the goal.
2. Write the equation that represents the problem.
3. Solve the equation to find the number of fewer miles Alan should drive each week.
4. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
5. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.

Advice:

* Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
* Always use the correct equation to solve the problem.
* Always double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
* Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
* Always choose the answer that matches your calculated result.

Reflection:
In my previous answer, I made a mistake in my calculation. I incorrectly solved the equation and arrived at the wrong answer. After reflecting on my mistake, I realized that the correct equation to determine how many fewer miles Alan should drive each week to reduce his weekly expenditure on gasoline by $\$ 5$ is:

$$\frac{25}{4} m = 95$$

So, the correct answer is (D) $\frac{4}{25} m = 5$.
