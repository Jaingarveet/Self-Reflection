Question: Mr. Kohl has a beaker containing $n$ milliliters of solution to distribute to the students in his chemistry class. If he gives each student 3 milliliters of solution, he will have 5 milliliters left over. In order to give each student 4 milliliters of solution, he will need an additional 21 milliliters. How many students are in the class?
Choices:
  A: 16
  B: 21
  C: 23
  D: 26
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
You are correct that the number of students in the class is [REDACTED]. However, your reasoning for arriving at that answer is not correct. Here's why:

You said that if Mr. Kohl gives each student 3 milliliters of solution, he will have 5 milliliters left over. So, the total amount of solution he has is 5 milliliters + (n-3) milliliters, where n is the number of students.

But that's not the correct equation. The equation should be:

Total amount of solution = 5 milliliters + (n-3) milliliters

So, if Mr. Kohl wants to give each student 4 milliliters of solution, he will need an additional [REDACTED] milliliters. Therefore, the total amount of solution he needs is:

Total amount of solution = 5 milliliters + (n-3) milliliters + [REDACTED] milliliters = [REDACTED] milliliters

Since he has 5 milliliters left over after giving 3 milliliters to each student, he must have had a total of [REDACTED] milliliters - 5 milliliters = [REDACTED] milliliters of solution to start with.

So, the number of students in the class is indeed [REDACTED].

I hope this clears up any confusion. Thank you for sharing your thought process!

## Assistant 2:
  Thank you for the feedback and the opportunity to reflect on my previous answer. I understand now that the correct equation for determining the amount of solution needed is:

Total amount of solution = 5 milliliters + (n-3) milliliters + [REDACTED] milliliters

Where n is the number of students in the class.

Using this equation, we can see that if Mr. Kohl wants to give each student 4 milliliters of solution, he will need an additional 21 milliliters of solution. Therefore, the total amount of solution he needs is:

Total amount of solution = 5 milliliters + (n-3) milliliters + 21 milliliters = [REDACTED] milliliters

Since he has 5 milliliters left over after giving 3 milliliters to each student, he must have had a total of [REDACTED] milliliters - 5 milliliters = [REDACTED] milliliters of solution to start with.

So, the number of students in the class is indeed [REDACTED].

Thank you again for pointing out my mistake and providing me with the opportunity to improve my understanding of the problem.
