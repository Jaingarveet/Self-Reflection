Topic: Law
Context: Of the eight students—George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert—in a seminar, exactly six will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
Question: If George, Nina, and Robert give reports and they do so on different days from one another, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Helen gives a report on Wednesday.
  B: Nina gives a report on Monday.
  C: Nina gives a report on Tuesday.
  D: Olivia gives a report on Monday.

Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misunderstood the conditions regarding when Nina can give a report. I assumed that Nina could not report on Monday because George is the only one who can report on Tuesday. However, the condition is that if Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. This means that Nina can report on Monday, and Helen and Irving can report on Tuesday.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Given the conditions, if George, Nina, and Robert give reports on different days, Nina can give a report on Monday, Helen and Irving can give reports on Tuesday (since George can only report on Tuesday), and Robert can give a report on Wednesday (since he can't give an afternoon report). Therefore, Helen can give a report on Wednesday.
Action: Answer("A")
