Explanation:
I made a mistake in my calculations when substituting the values of a and b into the equation $7a + 2b = c$. I incorrectly calculated the values of c as 35 and 21, when they should have been 41 and 31.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The equation $(a x+2)(b x+7)=15 x^{2}+c x+14$ expands to $abx^2 + (7a + 2b)x + 14 = 15x^2 + cx + 14$. 
Since the coefficients on the left and right sides of the equation must be equal, we have $ab = 15$ and $7a + 2b = c$. 
Given that $a + b = 8$, we can substitute $b = 8 - a$ into the equation $ab = 15$ to get $a(8 - a) = 15$, which simplifies to $a^2 - 8a + 15 = 0$. 
Solving this quadratic equation gives $a = 3$ or $a = 5$. 
Substituting these values into the equation $7a + 2b = c$ gives $c = 7*3 + 2*(8 - 3) = 31$ and $c = 7*5 + 2*(8 - 5) = 41$. 
So, the two possible values for $c$ are 31 and 41.
