## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Explanation:
I made an error in my reasoning. I thought that because there were two unknowns (x and y) and only one equation, it would be impossible to determine the value of the expression. However, I failed to recognize that the expression $\frac{8^x}{2^y}$ can be simplified to $2^{3x-y}$, which is exactly the left-hand side of the given equation multiplied by 2. Therefore, the value of the expression can be determined.
## Assistant 2:
You're right, I made a mistake before. Let's solve this step-by-step:
1) We are given the equation $3x - y = 12$
2) The expression we want to evaluate is $\frac{8^x}{2^y}$
3) $8^x$ can be written as $(2^3)^x = 2^{3x}$
4) So $\frac{8^x}{2^y} = \frac{2^{3x}}{2^y} = 2^{3x-y}$
5) But from the given equation, we know that $3x - y = 12$
6) Therefore, $2^{3x-y} = 2^{12}$
So the value of the expression is $2^{12}$.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
