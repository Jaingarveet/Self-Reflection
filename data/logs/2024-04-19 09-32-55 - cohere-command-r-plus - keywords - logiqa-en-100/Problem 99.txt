## User 2:
Topic: Logic
Context: Conne Levi with a "moe" look looks like other newborns.But because it is the world's first test-tube baby screened by next-generation gene sequencing technology, his advent has attracted the attention of experts and scholars.Not long ago, this news detonated the audience at the "European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology Annual Meeting" held in London, England.And ordinary people also believe that humans may usher in the era of "customized babies".
Question: Which of the following, if true, would best refute the views of ordinary people?
Choices:
  A: "Artificial" genetic screening does not rule out that there will be loopholes; in natural conception, the guidelines for survival of the fittest in nature seem to be more subtle and effective
  B: It can be seen from the development history of modern science and technology that technological development is often faster than human cognition, and sometimes technology will go further and deviate from the track of human cognition
  C: Gene screening is mainly to avoid reproductive defects, this technology brings opportunities for human eugenics and eugenics; as for "customized babies", the concept of cloning is more involved, the two should not be confused
  D: "Customized babies" have not been tried globally, this concept also challenges the most controversial human reproductive ethics

## Assistant 2:
Reflection: I misinterpreted the question and answered based on the current reality that 'customized babies' have not been achieved yet, ignoring the context provided and the assumption made by ordinary people. The correct answer should focus on refuting the assumption that 'customized babies' are possible with the given technology, and the best option is choice A, highlighting the limitations and complexities of artificial genetic screening.

Thought: The argument by ordinary people assumes that the technology of "customized babies" is achievable and upon us. Choice A refutes this by pointing out the limitations of artificial genetic screening and the intricate natural selection process, which cannot be easily replicated. This choice addresses the fallacy in the assumption and provides a contrasting perspective, thus best refuting the views of ordinary people.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
