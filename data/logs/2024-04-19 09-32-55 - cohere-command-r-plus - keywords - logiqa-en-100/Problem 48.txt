Context: According to a report, in the year to March, mainland Chinese buyers became the second largest group of foreign buyers buying US real estate, with a transaction volume of US $ 9 billion, second only to Canada.This is 23% higher than the previous year ’s USD 7.3 billion transaction volume and 88% higher than the previous year ’s USD 4.8 billion transaction volume.Some people think that there are more and more rich people in China who are transferring their property abroad.
Question: Which of the following is true is the best argument against the above argument
Choices:
  ?: Although the turnover has increased by 23%, the volume of Chinese buyers has not increased this year
  C: There are groups of real estate speculators among the wealthy Chinese who have speculated in Beijing and Shanghai
  D: The risk of the US real estate market has been small in recent years and has a certain function of value preservation and appreciation

- Lack of focus on argument structure
## Assistant 2:
Reflection: I focused on the fact that the report mentioned a higher transaction volume, which is indeed true, but this does not strengthen the argument; it was a distraction. The key phrase is "some people think," which indicates a presumption based on the report's findings. The argument is about the presumption of wealthy Chinese individuals moving their property abroad. My answer should have focused on countering this presumption, not strengthening it with additional true statements.

Thought: 
The argument presumes that an increase in US real estate transactions by Chinese buyers indicates a trend of wealthy Chinese individuals transferring their property abroad. 

A potential counter-argument is that the increase in transactions does not necessarily reflect a shift in property ownership. 

Choice "A" is the best counter-argument as it highlights that the 23% increase in transaction volume does not equate to an increase in the number of Chinese buyers. This could mean that the same group of wealthy individuals are responsible for the increased transactions, rather than an influx of new, wealthy individuals moving their property abroad.
Action: Answer("A")
