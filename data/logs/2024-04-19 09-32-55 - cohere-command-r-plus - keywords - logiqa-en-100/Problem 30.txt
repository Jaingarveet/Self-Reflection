## Assistant 2:
Reflection: I made an error by misinterpreting the condition "A maximum of 2 people are selected." I initially thought this meant a minimum of two people, which led me to incorrectly conclude that 'C' was the correct answer. However, upon reflection, it is clear that this condition states a maximum, not a minimum, limiting the selection to only two people.

Thought: 
Given the conditions:
1. At least one person of Binding is selected.
2. If E is selected, then A and B are also selected.
3. A maximum of 2 people can be selected.

It can be concluded that person C cannot be in the fourth position. This is because selecting C would violate the third condition, as it would result in three people being selected (C, A, and B).
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
