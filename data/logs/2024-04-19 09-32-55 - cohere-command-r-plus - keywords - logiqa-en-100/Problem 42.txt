Context: Aptripa Cave is located near the bay of Dilos in the Peninsula of Maina, and is as large as four football fields.This cave dates back to the Neolithic Age, but was not accidentally discovered by a man walking a dog until the 1950s.After decades of scientific research work, archaeologists excavated tools, pottery, obsidian, silver and copper utensils from the cave, and thus believed that hundreds of people had lived in the cave.
Question: Which of the following, if true, can best refute the above argument?
Choices:
  A: The cave inspired the description of hell in Greek mythology
  B: The cave is actually an ancient cemetery and funeral venue
  C: There is no prehistoric village in Europe that has been found earlier than the cave
  D: The entrance to the cave collapsed 5000 years ago

## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The argument concludes that hundreds of people lived in Aptripa Cave because the archaeological findings suggest human activity. A true statement that refutes this conclusion would suggest that the human activity was not indicative of habitation.

Choice D states that the entrance to the cave collapsed 5,000 years ago. This suggests that the human activity in the cave may have occurred after the collapse and that the cave was not inhabited, but rather used for other purposes over a shorter period. This statement effectively refutes the argument's conclusion and is, therefore, the correct answer.

The other choices are irrelevant or do not refute the conclusion.

Previous reflection: I misinterpreted "refute" and looked for a statement that supported, rather than contradicted, the argument.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
