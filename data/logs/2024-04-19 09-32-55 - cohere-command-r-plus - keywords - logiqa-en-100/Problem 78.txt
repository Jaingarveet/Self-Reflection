## Assistant 2:
Reflection: I made an assumption that the guests were distinct individuals, but the question does not specify this. The uncle and grandfather could be the same person, as could the mother-in-law and grandmother-in-law. As such, the correct answer is one guest - the father of Mr. Chen's brother-in-law, who is also the brother of Mr. Chen's uncle, and the father of Mr. Chen's brother's wife, and the brother of Mr. Chen's wife's brother.

Action: Answer("B")
