## Assistant 2:
I apologize for the previous incorrect answer. After reflecting on my mistake, I understand that I need to focus on the specific context of the question, which is the surgical procedure "cyst-gastrostomy" and its complications. 
Here's my thought process for this question:
1. **Cyst-gastrostomy**: This is a surgical procedure that creates a connection between a pancreatic cyst and the stomach.
2. **Pseudo pancreatic cyst**: This is a collection of fluid near the pancreas that is not a true cyst.
3. **Major complication**: This refers to a serious problem that can occur after surgery.
Based on this information, I can eliminate choices A, B, and D:
* **Infection**: While infection is a possible complication of any surgery, it is not specific to cyst-gastrostomy for pseudo pancreatic cysts.
* **Obstruction**: This is not a common complication of cyst-gastrostomy.
* **Hemorrhage**: This is a rare complication of cyst-gastrostomy.
Therefore, the most likely major complication of cyst-gastrostomy for pseudo pancreatic cyst is:
**C: Fistula**
A fistula is an abnormal connection between two organs or vessels. In the case of cyst-gastrostomy, a fistula can develop between the pancreatic cyst and another organ, such as the colon or the small intestine. This can lead to serious complications, such as infection and malnutrition.
Action: Answer("C") 
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
