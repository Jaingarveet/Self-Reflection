## Assistant 2:
I understand. I will use my self-reflection to answer this question correctly.
**Self-Reflection:**
* **Problem:** I previously answered the question incorrectly, selecting "AR" as the answer.
* **Solution:** I need to carefully analyze the choices and consider the characteristics of Hypophosphatemic Vitamin D Resistant Rickets (HVDRR).
* **Correct Answer:** The correct answer is **B: AD**.
**Answer:**
Action: Answer("B") 
**Explanation:**
HVDRR is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder, meaning that only one copy of the mutated gene is needed to cause the disease. This is in contrast to autosomal recessive disorders, which require two copies of the mutated gene. 
I apologize for the previous error and am confident that I have now provided the correct answer.
