Context: Medical researcher: Scientists compared a large group of joggers who habitually stretch before jogging to an equal number of joggers who do not stretch before jogging. Both groups of joggers incurred roughly the same number of injuries. This indicates that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would most weaken the medical researcher's argument?
Choices:
  A: For both groups of joggers compared by the scientists, the rate of jogging injuries during the study was lower than the overall rate of jogging injuries.
  B: Among the joggers in the groups compared by the scientists, many of those previously injured while jogging experienced difficulty in their efforts to perform stretches.
  C: Most jogging injuries result from falls, collisions, and other mishaps on which the flexibility resulting from stretching would have little if any effect.
  D: The more prone a jogger is to jogging injuries, the more likely he or she is to develop the habit of performing stretches before jogging.
  E: Studies have found that, for certain forms of exercise, stretching beforehand can reduce the severity of injuries resulting from that exercise.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The researcher's argument is that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries. This argument would be weakened if there was a factor that skewed the results of the study. Choice D suggests that joggers who are more prone to injuries are more likely to stretch before jogging. This could mean that the group of joggers who stretch had a higher risk of injury to begin with, which could explain why they had roughly the same number of injuries as the group that did not stretch. This would weaken the researcher's argument.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
