Question: A club consists of members whose ages are in A.P. The common difference being 3 months. If the youngest member of the club is just 7 years old and the sum of the ages of all the members is 250, then number of members in the club are :
Choices:
  A: 18
  B: 20
  C: 25
  D: 26
  E: 27
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The ages are in an arithmetic progression (A.P.) with a common difference of 3 months or 0.25 years. The youngest member is 7 years old. The sum of the ages of all the members is 250 years. 
The sum of an arithmetic series is given by the formula: n/2 * (2a + (n-1)d), where n is the number of terms, a is the first term, and d is the common difference.
We can set up the equation: 250 = n/2 * (2*7 + (n-1)*0.25) and solve for n.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
