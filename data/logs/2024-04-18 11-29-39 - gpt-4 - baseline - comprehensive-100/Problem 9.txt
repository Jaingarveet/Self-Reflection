Question: On a map, the length of the road from Town F to Town G is measured to be 20 inches. On this map, 1/4 inch represents an actual distance of 10 miles. What is the actual distance, in miles, from Town F to Town G along this road?
Choices:
  A: 800
  B: 720
  C: 960
  D: 1140
  E: 1160
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
If 1/4 inch represents 10 miles, then 1 inch represents 40 miles (since 10 miles * 4 = 40 miles). 
So, 20 inches would represent 800 miles (since 20 inches * 40 miles/inch = 800 miles).
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
