Context: Prince Lima in Li Na's mind is tall, handsome and doctor.She knew four men, Wang Wei, Wu Gang, Li Qiang, and Liu Dawei, and one of them met all the conditions she required.(1) Among the 4 men, there are 3 tall men, 2 doctors, and 1 is handsome; (2) Wang Wei and Wu Gang are both doctors; (3) Liu Dawei and Li Qiang are the same height; (4) Li Qiang and Wang Wei Not all are tall.
Question: Who can meet all the requirements of Li Na?
Choices:
  A: Liu Dawei
  B: Li Qiang
  C: Wu Gang
  D: Wang Wei
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
From the conditions, we know that:
- There are 3 tall men, 2 doctors, and 1 is handsome.
- Wang Wei and Wu Gang are both doctors.
- Liu Dawei and Li Qiang are the same height.
- Li Qiang and Wang Wei are not both tall.
From these conditions, we can deduce that:
- Since there are only 2 doctors and they are Wang Wei and Wu Gang, Liu Dawei and Li Qiang cannot be doctors.
- Since Li Qiang and Wang Wei are not both tall, and there are 3 tall men, the tall men must be Liu Dawei, Wu Gang, and either Li Qiang or Wang Wei.
- Since Liu Dawei and Li Qiang are the same height, they must both be tall or both not tall. Since we know that at least one of them is tall (Liu Dawei), they must both be tall.
- This means that the tall men are Liu Dawei, Li Qiang, and Wu Gang, and Wang Wei is not tall.
- Since there is only one handsome man and he must be a tall doctor, the handsome man must be Wu Gang, as he is the only tall doctor.
Action: Answer("C")
