## User 2:
Topic: Science
Question: Which of these has the greatest capacity for storing thermal energy from the Sun?
Choices:
  A: air
  B: land
  C: oceans
  D: plants
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Thermal energy storage is the ability to store heat for later use. The capacity for storing thermal energy depends on the specific heat capacity of the substance, which is the amount of heat required to change the temperature of one unit mass of the substance by one degree. Oceans, due to their large mass and high specific heat capacity, can store more thermal energy than air, land, or plants.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
