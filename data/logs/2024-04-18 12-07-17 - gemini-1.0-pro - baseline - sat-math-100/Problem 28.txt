## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: $$\frac{x^{2}-1}{x-1}=-2$$What are all values of $x$ that satisfy the equation above?
Choices:
  A: -3
  B: 0
  C: 1
  D: -3 and -1
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
First, we need to factor the numerator of the fraction on the left-hand side of the equation. We can do this by recognizing that the numerator is in the form of a difference of squares: $x^2 - 1 = (x+1)(x-1)$.
Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by $(x-1)$, but only if $x \neq 1$. This gives us:
$$x+1 = -2$$
Solving for $x$, we get:
$$x = -3$$
However, we need to remember that we divided by $(x-1)$, so $x = 1$ is not a valid solution.
Therefore, the only value of $x$ that satisfies the equation is $x = -3$.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
