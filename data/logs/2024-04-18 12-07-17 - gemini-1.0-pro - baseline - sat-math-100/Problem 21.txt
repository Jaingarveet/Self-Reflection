# Model: gemini-1.0-pro | Agent: baseline | Exam: sat-math-100 | Problem 21 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Topic: Math
Question: What are the solutions to $3 x^{2}+12 x+6=0 ?$
Choices:
  A: $x=-2 \pm \sqrt{2}$
  B: $x=-2 \pm \frac{\sqrt{30}}{3}$
  C: $x=-6 \pm \sqrt{2}$
  D: $x=-6 \pm 6 \sqrt{2}$
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
We can solve this equation by factoring or using the quadratic formula.
Factoring:
$3 x^{2}+12 x+6=0$
$3(x^{2}+4 x+2)=0$
$3(x+2)(x+1)=0$
$x=-2$ or $x=-1$
Quadratic formula:
$x=\frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^{2}-4 a c}}{2 a}$
$x=\frac{-12 \pm \sqrt{12^{2}-4 \cdot 3 \cdot 6}}{2 \cdot 3}$
$x=\frac{-12 \pm \sqrt{144-72}}{6}$
$x=\frac{-12 \pm \sqrt{72}}{6}$
$x=\frac{-12 \pm 6 \sqrt{2}}{6}$
$x=-2 \pm \sqrt{2}$
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
