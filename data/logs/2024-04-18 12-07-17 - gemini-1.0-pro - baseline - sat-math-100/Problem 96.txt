Question: A rectangle was altered by increasing its length by 10 percent and decreasing its width by $p$ percent. If these alterations decreased the area of the rectangle by 12 percent, what is the value of $p$ ?
Choices:
  A: 12
  B: 15
  C: 20
  D: 22
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let the original length of the rectangle be $l$ and the original width be $w$.
The original area of the rectangle is $lw$.
After the alterations, the length is $1.1l$ and the width is $(1-p/100)w$.
The new area of the rectangle is $1.1l(1-p/100)w$.
The area decreased by 12%, so we have the equation:
$0.88lw = 1.1l(1-p/100)w$
Dividing both sides by $lw$ gives:
$0.88 = 1.1(1-p/100)$
$0.88 = 1.1 - 0.011p$
$0.011p = 1.1 - 0.88$
$0.011p = 0.22$
$p = 0.22/0.011$
$p = 20$
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
