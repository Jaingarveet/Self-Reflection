## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.

Topic: Math
Question: $$\begin{aligned}& 2.4 x-1.5 y=0.3 \\& 1.6 x+0.5 y=-1.3\end{aligned}$$The system of equations above is graphed in the $x y$-plane. What is the $x$-coordinate of the intersection point $(x, y)$ of the system?
Choices:
  A: -0.5
  B: -0.25
  C: 0.8
  D: 1.75
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
We can solve for $x$ by adding the equations together after multiplying the second equation by 3.
The first equation becomes: $2.4x - 1.5y = 0.3$
The second equation becomes: $4.8x + 1.5y = -3.9$
Adding the equations together, we get: $7.2x = -3.6$
Dividing both sides by 7.2, we get: $x = -0.5$
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
