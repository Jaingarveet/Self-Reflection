## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Question: $$y=a(x-2)(x+4)$$In the quadratic equation above, $a$ is a nonzero constant. The graph of the equation in the $x y$-plane is a parabola with vertex $(c, d)$. Which of the following is equal to $d$ ?
Choices:
  A: $-9 a$
  B: $-8 a$
  C: $-5 a$
  D: $-2 a$
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The vertex form of a quadratic equation is $y=a(x-h)^2+k$, where $(h, k)$ is the vertex.
Expanding the given equation, we get $y=a(x^2+2x-8)$.
Completing the square, we get $y=a(x+1)^2-9a$.
Therefore, the vertex is $(-1, -9a)$, so $d=-9a$.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
