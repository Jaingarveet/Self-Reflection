## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: $$g(x)=a x^{2}+24$$For the function $g$ defined above, $a$ is a constant and $g(4)=8$. What is the value of $g(-4)$ ?
Choices:
  A: 8
  B: 0
  C: -1
  D: -8
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
We are given that $g(x)=a x^{2}+24$ and $g(4)=8$. We need to find the value of $g(-4)$.
Let's substitute $x=4$ into the equation $g(x)=a x^{2}+24$ to find the value of $a$.
$g(4)=a \cdot 4^{2}+24=8$
$16a+24=8$
$16a=-16$
$a=-1$
Now, let's substitute $x=-4$ and $a=-1$ into the equation $g(x)=a x^{2}+24$ to find the value of $g(-4)$.
$g(-4)=-1 \cdot (-4)^{2}+24=-16+24=8$
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
