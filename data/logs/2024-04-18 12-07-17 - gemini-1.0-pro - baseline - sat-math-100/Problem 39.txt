## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: $$\begin{aligned}& -3 x+y=6 \\& a x+2 y=4\end{aligned}$$In the system of equations above, $a$ is a constant. For which of the following values of $a$ does the system have no solution?
Choices:
  A: -6
  B: -3
  C: 3
  D: 6
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
If we multiply the first equation by 2, we get:
$$\begin{aligned}& -6 x+2 y=12 \\& a x+2 y=4\end{aligned}$$If we subtract the second equation from the first, we get:
$$-7x=8$$This equation has no solution if $x$ is not equal to $-\frac{8}{7}$.
Therefore, the system has no solution if $a=-6$.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
