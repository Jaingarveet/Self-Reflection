## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: A square field measures 10 meters by 10 meters. Ten students each mark off a randomly selected region of the field; each region is square and has side lengths of 1 meter, and no two regions overlap. The students count the earthworms contained in the soil to a depth of 5 centimeters beneath the ground's surface in each region. The results are shown in the table below.\begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}\hlineRegion & $\begin{array}{c}\text { Number of } \\ \text { earthworms }\end{array}$ & Region & $\begin{array}{c}\text { Number of } \\ \text { earthworms }\end{array}$ \\\hlineA & 107 & $\mathrm{~F}$ & 141 \\\hlineB & 147 & $\mathrm{G}$ & 150 \\\hlineC & 146 & $\mathrm{H}$ & 154 \\\hlineD & 135 & $\mathrm{I}$ & 176 \\\hlineE & 149 & $\mathrm{~J}$ & 166 \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}Which of the following is a reasonable approximation of the number of earthworms to a depth of 5 centimeters beneath the ground's surface in the entire field?
Choices:
  A: $\quad 150$
  B: $\quad 1,500$
  C: 15,000
  D: 150,000
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The area of the field is $10 \times 10 = 100$ square meters.
Each student's region has an area of $1 \times 1 = 1$ square meter.
The total area of the regions marked off by the students is $10 \times 1 = 10$ square meters.
The average number of earthworms per square meter in the regions marked off by the students is $\frac{107 + 147 + 146 + 135 + 149 + 141 + 150 + 154 + 176 + 166}{10} = 150.5$.
A reasonable approximation of the number of earthworms to a depth of 5 centimeters beneath the ground's surface in the entire field is $100 \times 150.5 = 15,050$.
Action: Answer("C")
