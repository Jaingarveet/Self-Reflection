Topic: Math
Question: In the $x y$-plane, the parabola with equation $y=(x-11)^{2}$ intersects the line with equation $y=25$ at two points, $A$ and $B$. What is the length of $\overline{A B}$ ?
Choices:
  A: 10
  B: 12
  C: 14
  D: 16
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The parabola $y=(x-11)^{2}$ intersects the line $y=25$ when $(x-11)^{2}=25$.
Solving for $x$, we find $x=11\pm 5$, so the $x$-coordinates of $A$ and $B$ are $6$ and $16$.
Therefore, the length of $\overline{A B}$ is $16-6=\boxed{10}$.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
