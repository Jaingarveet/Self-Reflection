Topic: Math
Question: If $20-x=15$, what is the value of $3 x ?$
Choices:
  A: 5
  B: 10
  C: 15
  D: 35
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Add $x$ to both sides of the equation: $20-x+x=15+x$
Simplify: $20=15+x$
Subtract $15$ from both sides of the equation: $20-15=15+x-15$
Simplify: $5=x$
Multiply both sides of the equation by $3$: $3\cdot5=3\cdot x$
Simplify: $15=3x$
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
