Question: Alan drives an average of 100 miles each week. His car can travel an average of 25 miles per gallon of gasoline. Alan would like to reduce his weekly expenditure on gasoline by $\$ 5$. Assuming gasoline costs $\$ 4$ per gallon, which equation can Alan use to determine how many fewer average miles, $m$, he should drive each week?
Choices:
  A: $\frac{25}{4} m=95$
  B: $\frac{25}{4} m=5$
  C: $\frac{4}{25} m=95$
  D: $\frac{4}{25} m=5$
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Alan wants to reduce his weekly expenditure on gasoline by $\$ 5$.
This means he wants to spend $\$ 4 \times 5 = \$ 20$ less on gasoline each week.
Since he can travel 25 miles per gallon, he needs to drive 20 / 25 = 0.8 fewer gallons each week.
Since each gallon allows him to travel 25 miles, he needs to drive 0.8 x 25 = 20 fewer miles each week.
Action: Answer("D")
