## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: $$\begin{aligned}y & =x^{2} \\2 y+6 & =2(x+3)\end{aligned}$$If $(x, y)$ is a solution of the system of equations above and $x>0$, what is the value of $x y$ ?
Choices:
  A: 1
  B: 2
  C: 3
  D: 9
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
From the first equation, we have $y=x^2$.
Substituting this into the second equation, we get $2x^2+6=2(x+3)$.
Simplifying, we get $2x^2+6=2x+6$.
Subtracting $2x+6$ from both sides, we get $2x^2-2x=0$.
Factoring out $2x$, we get $2x(x-1)=0$.
Since $x>0$, we have $x=1$.
Substituting this into the first equation, we get $y=1^2=1$.
Therefore, $xy=1\cdot1=1$.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
