## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Question: A circle in the $x y$-plane has center $(5,7)$ and radius 2. Which of the following is an equation of the circle?
Choices:
  A: $(x-5)^{2}+(y-7)^{2}=4$
  B: $(x+5)^{2}+(y+7)^{2}=4$
  C: $(x-5)^{2}+(y-7)^{2}=2$
  D: $(x+5)^{2}+(y+7)^{2}=2$
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The standard equation of a circle with center $(h, k)$ and radius $r$ is $(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2$
We are given that the center of the circle is $(5, 7)$ and the radius is $2$.
Plugging these values into the standard equation, we get $(x - 5)^2 + (y - 7)^2 = 2^2$.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
