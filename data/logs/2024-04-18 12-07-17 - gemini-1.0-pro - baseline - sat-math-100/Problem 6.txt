Question: $$\begin{aligned}& b=2.35+0.25 x \\& c=1.75+0.40 x\end{aligned}$$In the equations above, $b$ and $c$ represent the price per pound, in dollars, of beef and chicken, respectively, $x$ weeks after July 1 during last summer. What was the price per pound of beef when it was equal to the price per pound of chicken?
Choices:
  A: $\$ 2.60$
  B: $\$ 2.85$
  C: $\$ 2.95$
  D: $\$ 3.35$
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
To find the price per pound of beef when it was equal to the price per pound of chicken, we need to find the value of $x$ for which $b=c$.
Setting the two equations equal to each other, we get:
$$2.35+0.25 x = 1.75+0.40 x$$
Solving for $x$, we get:
$$0.15 x = 0.6$$
$$x = 4$$
Substituting $x = 4$ into the equation for $b$, we get:
$$b=2.35+0.25 (4)$$
$$b=2.35+1$$
$$b=3.35$$
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
