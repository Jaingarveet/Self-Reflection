## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Question: A researcher surveyed a random sample of students from a large university about how often they see movies. Using the sample data, the researcher estimated that $23 \%$ of the students in the population saw a movie at least once per month. The margin of error for this estimation is $4 \%$. Which of the following is the most appropriate conclusion about all students at the university, based on the given estimate and margin of error?
Choices:
  A: It is unlikely that less than $23 \%$ of the students see a movie at least once per month.
  B: At least 23\%, but no more than $25 \%$, of the students see a movie at least once per month.
  C: The researcher is between $19 \%$ and $27 \%$ sure that most students see a movie at least once per month.
  D: It is plausible that the percentage of students who see a movie at least once per month is between $19 \%$ and $27 \%$.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The margin of error tells us that the true population percentage is likely between $23\% - 4\% = 19\%$ and $23\% + 4\% = 27\%$.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
