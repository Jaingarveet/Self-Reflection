The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: If $x>3$, which of the following is equivalent to $\frac{1}{\frac{1}{x+2}+\frac{1}{x+3}}$ ?
Choices:
  A: $\frac{2 x+5}{x^{2}+5 x+6}$
  B: $\frac{x^{2}+5 x+6}{2 x+5}$
  C: $2 x+5$
  D: $x^{2}+5 x+6$
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
To simplify the expression, we need to find a common denominator for the two fractions in the denominator.
The common denominator is $(x+2)(x+3)$.
We can then simplify the expression as follows:
$\frac{1}{\frac{1}{x+2}+\frac{1}{x+3}} = \frac{(x+2)(x+3)}{(x+3)+(x+2)} = \frac{x^{2}+5 x+6}{2 x+5}$
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
