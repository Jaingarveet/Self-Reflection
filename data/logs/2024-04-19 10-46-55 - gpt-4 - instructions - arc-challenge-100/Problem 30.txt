## System:
You are an expert in Science.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")

Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Science
Question: When moist air comes in contact with a cold surface in the winter, one result can be frost. What has happened to the water vapor in the air to cause frost?
Choices:
  A: It has melted.
  B: It has sublimated.
  C: It has evaporated.
  D: It has condensed.
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Understand the question and what is being asked.
2. Recall the process of frost formation, which involves water vapor turning directly into ice.
3. Recognize that this process is a form of sublimation, where a substance transitions from a gas to a solid without passing through the liquid phase.
4. Choose the answer that correctly describes this process.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Frost forms when water vapor in the air comes into contact with a cold surface and changes directly from a gas (water vapor) to a solid (ice). This process is called sublimation.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
