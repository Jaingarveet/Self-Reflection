2. Recall the steps of the scientific method.
3. Identify the current step in the scientific method based on the situation.
4. Determine the next step in the scientific method.
5. Choose the answer that matches the next step in the scientific method.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The scientific method involves making a hypothesis, conducting an experiment, observing the results, and then refining the hypothesis if necessary. If Michelle's results did not match her hypothesis, she should reconsider her hypothesis in light of the new data. This could involve changing the hypothesis to better fit the results, or considering if there were any errors in the experiment that could have led to the unexpected results. 
Action: Answer("B")
