Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to play fight with your girlfriend [title] Initiate the fight. [step] Start by playfully pushing or bumping into your partner on purpose. Whether she's concentrating profusely on a task, or just simply standing idle, approach her and nudge her gently.

  C: Touch her shoulder and tell her that you desire to capture her attention. You could say, " i know you've been thinking we've been talking about this, but let's get your mind on the night ".
