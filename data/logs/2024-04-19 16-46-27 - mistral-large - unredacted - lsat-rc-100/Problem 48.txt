Context: David Warsh's book describes a great contradiction inherent in economic theory since 1776, when Adam Smith published The Wealth of Nations. Warsh calls it the struggle between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand. Using the example of a pin factory, Smith emphasized the huge increases in efficiency that could be achieved through increased size. The pin factory's employees, by specializing on narrow tasks, produce far more than they could if each worked independently. Also, Smith was the first to recognize how a market economy can harness self-interest to the common good, leading each individual as though "by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention." For example, businesses sell products that people want, at reasonable prices, not because the business owners inherently want to please people but because doing so enables them to make money in a competitive marketplace. These two concepts, however, are opposed to each other. The parable of the pin factory says that there are increasing returns to scaleâ€”the bigger the pin factory, the more specialized its workers can be, and therefore the more pins the factory can produce per worker. But increasing returns create a natural tendency toward monopoly, because a large business can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than a small business. So given increasing returns, bigger firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business, until each industry is dominated by just a few players. But for the invisible hand to work properly, there must be many competitors in each industry, so that nobody can exert monopoly power. Therefore, the idea that free markets always get it right depends on the assumption that returns to scale are diminishing, not increasing. For almost two centuries, the assumption of diminishing returns dominated economic theory, with the Pin Factory de-emphasized. Why? As Warsh explains, it wasn't about ideology; it was about following the line of least mathematical resistance. Economics has always had scientific aspirations; economists have always sought the rigor and clarity that comes from representing their ideas using numbers and equations. And the economics of diminishing returns lend themselves readily to elegant formalism, while those of increasing returns-the Pin Factory- are notoriously hard to represent mathematically. Many economists tried repeatedly to bring the Pin Factory into the mainstream of economic thought to reflect the fact that increasing returns obviously characterized many enterprises, such as railroads. Yet they repeatedly failed because they could not state their ideas rigorously enough. Only since the late 1970s has this "underground river" -a term used to describe the role of increasing returns in economic thought-surfaced into the mainstream of economic thought. By then, economists had finally found ways to describe the Pin Factory with the rigor needed to make it respectable.

Choices:

Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I did not carefully read and analyze the author's attitude towards the Pin Factory model. I may have misinterpreted the author's tone or failed to identify the relevant information in the text.

Error Keywords:

* Reading comprehension error
* Tone misinterpretation
* Failure to identify relevant information

Solution:
The author describes the struggle between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand in economic theory. The author explains that the Pin Factory model emphasizes the benefits of increased size and specialization, while the Invisible Hand model emphasizes the benefits of competition. The author notes that the Pin Factory model has been de-emphasized in economic theory because it is difficult to represent mathematically. However, the author also notes that many economists have tried to bring the Pin Factory model into the mainstream of economic thought because it obviously characterizes many enterprises. The author's attitude towards the Pin Factory model is one of receptivity, as indicated by the statement that "economists had finally found ways to describe the Pin Factory with the rigor needed to make it respectable."

Instructions:

1. Carefully read and analyze the author's attitude towards the Pin Factory model.
2. Identify the relevant information in the text that indicates the author's attitude.
3. Consider the author's tone and language when determining their attitude.
4. Eliminate answer choices that do not accurately reflect the author's attitude.
5. Choose the answer choice that most accurately reflects the author's attitude.

Advice:

* Always read the question carefully and identify what is being asked.
* Carefully analyze the author's tone and language to determine their attitude.
* Identify relevant information in the text that supports your answer choice.
* Eliminate answer choices that are clearly incorrect.
* Choose the answer choice that most accurately reflects the author's attitude based on the information provided in the text.
