## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

2. Identify the lower and upper bounds for n given in the question.
3. Calculate the value of x at the lower bound of n.
4. Calculate the value of x at the upper bound of n.
5. When calculating with square roots, use a calculator for precision.
6. Identify the range that x falls into based on the calculations.
7. Select the answer choice that matches the identified range for x.
## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1. Simplify x:
x = (n^2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16) / (n+ 4√n+ 4)
  = (n^2 + 2n√n + 8√n + 16) / (n + 4√n + 4)
  = (n(n + 2√n + 8) + 16) / (n + 4√n + 4)
  = (n(n + 2√n) + 8n + 16) / (n + 4√n + 4)
  = (n^2 + 2n√n + 8n + 16) / (n + 4√n + 4)
  = n + 2√n + 8 + 16/(n + 4√n + 4)
2. The bounds for n are: 36 ≤ n ≤ 72
3. At n = 36:
x = 36 + 2√36 + 8 + 16/(36 + 4√36 + 4)
  = 36 + 12 + 8 + 16/52
  = 56 + 16/52
  = 56.31 (rounded)
4. At n = 72: 
x = 72 + 2√72 + 8 + 16/(72 + 4√72 + 4)
  = 72 + 2(8.49) + 8 + 16/110
  = 72 + 16.98 + 8 + 0.15
  = 97.13
5. Using a calculator for the square roots ensures precision.
6. Based on the calculations, x falls in the range 56.31 < x < 97.13
7. Looking at the answer choices, the range 56.31 < x < 97.13 best fits choice D: 28 < x < 60
Therefore, the best answer is D.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
