Question: A car is being driven, in a straight line and at a uniform speed, towards the base of a vertical tower. The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower?
Choices:
  A: 5(√3 + 1)
  B: 6(√3 + √2)
  C: 7(√3 – 1)
  D: 8(√3 – 2)
  E: None of these

5. Calculate the additional time by dividing the remaining distance by the car's speed.
6. Simplify the expression for additional time step-by-step.
7. Rationalize the denominator if necessary during simplification.
8. Double-check your calculations and simplification.
9. Choose the answer that matches your simplified result.
## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's approach this step-by-step using the reflection as a guide:
1. Let the height of the tower be h, the car's speed be v, and the distance of the car from the base of the tower at 45° be x.
2. Using the tangent function:
   tan(45°) = h/x, so x = h
   tan(60°) = h/(x - 10v), so x - 10v = h/√3
3. From the first equation, x = h. Substituting into the second equation:
   h - 10v = h/√3
   h(1 - 1/√3) = 10v
   h(√3 - 1)/√3 = 10v
   h = 10v√3/(√3 - 1)
4. The remaining distance is h/√3 (since tan(60°) = h/(remaining distance)).
   Remaining distance = 10v√3/(√3 - 1) * 1/√3 = 10v/(√3 - 1)
5. Additional time = Remaining distance / Speed
                    = (10v/(√3 - 1)) / v
                    = 10/(√3 - 1)
6. Simplify:
   10/(√3 - 1) = 10/(√3 - 1) * (√3 + 1)/(√3 + 1)
                = 10(√3 + 1)/(3 - 1)
                = 10(√3 + 1)/2
                = 5(√3 + 1)
7. The expression is already rationalized.
8. Double-checking the calculations, the simplification appears correct.
9. The answer that matches the simplified result is A: 5(√3 + 1).
Action: Answer("A")
