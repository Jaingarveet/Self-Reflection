## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The key information is:
   - The grocer makes a 25% profit on the selling price of each bag of flour
   - Each bag is sold for $100
   - The total profit is $3,000
2. The relationship between selling price, cost price, and profit is:
   Selling Price = Cost Price + Profit
   
3. To calculate the profit per bag in dollars:
   - The selling price is $100 per bag
   - The profit is 25% of the selling price
   - 25% of $100 = 0.25 × $100 = $25
   So the profit per bag is $25
4. To calculate the number of bags sold:
   - Total profit = Profit per bag × Number of bags sold
   - $3,000 = $25 × Number of bags sold
   - Number of bags sold = $3,000 ÷ $25 = 120
5. Looking at the choices, the closest answer to 120 is:
   D: 120
Therefore, the grocer sold 120 bags of flour.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: C
