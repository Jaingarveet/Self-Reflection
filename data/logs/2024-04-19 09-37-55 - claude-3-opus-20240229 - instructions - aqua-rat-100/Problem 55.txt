## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's approach this step-by-step using the reflection as a guide:
1. Given information:
   - Man's rowing rate in still water is 4 kmph
   - Man's rate against the current is 2 kmph
   - Need to find the man's rate along the current
2. Assign variables:
   - Let the speed of the current be x kmph
3. Set up equations:
   - Rate downstream = Still water rate + Current rate
   - Rate upstream = Still water rate - Current rate
   - So: 4 + x = Rate downstream, and 4 - x = 2
4. Solve equations:
   - 4 - x = 2
   - -x = -2
   - x = 2
   - The current speed is 2 kmph
   - Rate downstream = 4 + 2 = 6 kmph
5. Calculate final answer:
   - The man's rate along the current is 6 kmph
6. Review answer choices:
   A: 15 kmph
   B: 6 kmph
   C: 12 kmph
   D: 14 kmph
   E: 6 kmph
7. Select matching answer(s):
   - The calculated answer 6 kmph matches choices B and E
Therefore, the man's rate along the current is 6 kmph.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: E
Score: 0
