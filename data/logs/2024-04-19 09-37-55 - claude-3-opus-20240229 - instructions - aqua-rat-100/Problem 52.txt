Question: X and Y are two alloys which were made by mixing zinc and copper in the ratio 6:9 and 7:11, respectively. If 40 grams of alloy X and 60 grams of alloy Y are melted and mixed to form alloy Z, what is the ratio of zinc and copper in the alloy Z ?
Choices:
  A: 69:91
  B: 59:91
  C: 59:90
  D: 59:91
  E: 69:101

Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Identify the ratio of components in each initial alloy.
2. Calculate the amount of each component in the given quantity of each alloy.
3. Sum the amounts of each component in the final alloy.
4. Express the composition of the final alloy as a ratio.
5. Simplify the ratio to whole numbers by multiplying both parts by a constant.
6. Reduce the ratio to lowest terms by dividing by the greatest common divisor.
7. Scale the ratio if needed to match the answer format.
8. Select the answer choice that matches the calculated ratio.
## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
1. The ratio of zinc to copper in alloy X is 6:9, which simplifies to 2:3. 
   The ratio in alloy Y is 7:11.
2. In 40g of alloy X, there are:
   Zinc: 40 * (2/5) = 16g
   Copper: 40 * (3/5) = 24g
   
   In 60g of alloy Y, there are: 
   Zinc: 60 * (7/18) = 23.33g
   Copper: 60 * (11/18) = 36.67g
3. In the final alloy Z, there are:
   Total Zinc: 16g + 23.33g = 39.33g
   Total Copper: 24g + 36.67g = 60.67g
4. The ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z is: 39.33 : 60.67
5. Multiply both parts by 100 to get whole numbers:
   3933 : 6067
6. The greatest common divisor of 3933 and 6067 is 1, so this is already in lowest terms.
7. To match the answer format, divide each part by their greatest common divisor, 1:
   3933/1 = 3933
   6067/1 = 6067
   
   Ratio is 3933:6067
8. The answer choice that matches this ratio is:
   B: 59:91
   
   To verify: 
   3933/59 = 66.66... 
   6067/91 = 66.67...
   These are approximately equal, confirming the answer.
Action: Answer("B")
