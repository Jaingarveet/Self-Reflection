Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Identify the relevant information: monthly production, production cost per unit, desired yearly profit.
2. Calculate the yearly production by multiplying monthly production by 12.
3. Calculate the yearly production cost by multiplying yearly production by the production cost per unit.
4. Calculate the total revenue needed by adding the desired yearly profit to the yearly production cost.
5. Calculate the minimum selling price per unit by dividing the total revenue needed by the yearly production.
6. Round up the calculated minimum selling price to the nearest whole number.
7. Select the answer choice that is the smallest value greater than or equal to the calculated minimum selling price.
## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1. Relevant information:
   - Monthly production: 420 units
   - Production cost per unit: $110
   - Desired yearly profit: $626,400
2. Yearly production:
   420 units/month * 12 months = 5,040 units/year
3. Yearly production cost: 
   5,040 units/year * $110/unit = $554,400/year
4. Total revenue needed:
   Desired yearly profit + Yearly production cost
   $626,400 + $554,400 = $1,180,800
5. Minimum selling price per unit:
   Total revenue needed / Yearly production
   $1,180,800 / 5,040 units = $234.29/unit
6. Rounding up the minimum selling price:
   $234.29 rounded up to the nearest whole number is $235
7. Selecting the answer:
   The smallest answer choice that is greater than or equal to $235 is $240
Therefore, the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee the desired yearly profit is $240.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
