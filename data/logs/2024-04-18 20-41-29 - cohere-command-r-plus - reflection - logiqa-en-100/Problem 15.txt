## System:
You are an expert in Logic.
You have incorrectly answered the following multiple-choice question.
Your task is to reflect on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
You will then use this information help you answer the same question in the future.
First, explain why you answered the question incorrectly.
Second, list the keywords that describe the type of your errors from most general to most specific. 
Third, solve the problem again, step-by-step, based on your knowledge of the correct answer.
Fourth, create a list of detailed instructions to help you correctly solve this problem in the future.
Finally, create a list of general advice to help you solve similar types of problems in the future.  
Be concise in your response; however, capture all of the essential information.  
For guidance, I will provide you with a single generic example problem and reflection (below).
## User 1:
Topic: Geography and Math
Question: What is the product of the number of letters contained in the name of the city where Iowa State University is located multiplied by the number of letters contained in the name of the state?
Choices:
    A: 16
    B: 20
    C: 24
    D: 32
Thought:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
ISU is located in the state of Iowa.
Action: Answer("D")
---
Correct Answer: A
## Assistant 1:
Explanation:
I miscalculated the product of the number of letters in the city and state names. 
The gap in my knowledge was not in geography but in basic arithmetic. 
I knew the correct city and state but made a calculation error.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Arithmetic error
 - Multiplication error
Solution:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
Iowa State University is located in the state of Iowa.
The city name "Ames" contains 4 letters.
The state name "Iowa" contains 4 letters.
The product of 4*4 is 16.
Instructions:
1. Identify the city where the university is located.
2. Identify the state where the university is located.
3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.
4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.
5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.
6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.
7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them.

Topic: Logic
Context: A microorganism in Weiming Lake usually breeds above freezing.It is winter now and the lake water has frozen.Therefore, if there is indeed the kind of microorganism we studied in Weiming Lake, they will not reproduce now.
Question: If the premises in the question stem are true, you can infer?
Choices:
  A: The conclusion cannot be untrue.
  B: It is highly likely that its conclusion is true, but it may also be false.
  C: The probability of its conclusion being false is high, but it may also be true.
  D: The conclusion cannot be true.

Thought: 
This is a deductive argument, so if the premises are true, the conclusion must be true.
Action: Answer("A")

 --- 
Correct Answer: B
## Assistant 2:
Response:
Explanation:
I misinterpreted the nature of the argument and the impact of the premises on the conclusion. 
I assumed that the truth of the premises guarantees the truth of the conclusion, which is not the case in this type of argument. 
Error Keywords:
 - Misinterpretation
 - Deductive reasoning error
 - Premise-conclusion error
Solution:
The argument is not purely deductive, as the premises provide probabilistic, not absolute, support for the conclusion. 
The truth of the premises ("if the premises in the question stem are true") makes the conclusion likely to be true, but it does not guarantee it. 
It is possible for the microorganism to still reproduce in certain conditions, even if the lake water is frozen. 
Therefore, the correct answer is B: "It is highly likely that its conclusion is true, but it may also be false."
Instructions:
1. Identify the type of argument presented (deductive, inductive, or abductive).
2. Recognize that the argument is not purely deductive, as it involves probabilistic reasoning.
3. Understand that the truth of the premises increases the likelihood of the conclusion being true but does not guarantee it.
4. Consider alternative scenarios or conditions that could affect the conclusion.
5. Choose the answer that reflects the probabilistic nature of the argument.
Advice:
 - Be cautious when dealing with arguments and their conclusions. 
 - Recognize the difference between deductive, inductive, and abductive arguments, and their implications for the relationship between premises and conclusions. 
 - Understand that in probabilistic arguments, the truth of the premises increases the likelihood of the conclusion being true but does not guarantee it. 
 - Always consider alternative explanations or conditions that could impact the conclusion. 
 - Practice analyzing arguments to improve your critical thinking and reasoning skills.
