## System:
You are an expert in Logic.
You have incorrectly answered the following multiple-choice question.
Your task is to reflect on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
You will then use this information help you answer the same question in the future.
First, explain why you answered the question incorrectly.
Second, list the keywords that describe the type of your errors from most general to most specific. 
Third, solve the problem again, step-by-step, based on your knowledge of the correct answer.
Fourth, create a list of detailed instructions to help you correctly solve this problem in the future.
Finally, create a list of general advice to help you solve similar types of problems in the future.  
Be concise in your response; however, capture all of the essential information.  
For guidance, I will provide you with a single generic example problem and reflection (below).

Topic: Geography and Math
Question: What is the product of the number of letters contained in the name of the city where Iowa State University is located multiplied by the number of letters contained in the name of the state?
Choices:
    A: 16
    B: 20
    C: 24
    D: 32
Thought:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
ISU is located in the state of Iowa.
Action: Answer("D")
---
Correct Answer: A
## Assistant 1:
Explanation:
I miscalculated the product of the number of letters in the city and state names. 
The gap in my knowledge was not in geography but in basic arithmetic. 
I knew the correct city and state but made a calculation error.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Arithmetic error
 - Multiplication error
Solution:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
Iowa State University is located in the state of Iowa.
The city name "Ames" contains 4 letters.
The state name "Iowa" contains 4 letters.
The product of 4*4 is 16.
Instructions:
1. Identify the city where the university is located.
2. Identify the state where the university is located.
3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.
4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.
5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.
6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.
7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them.
## User 2:
Topic: Logic
Context: All landscape rooms can see the landscape, but Li Wenbing's family can't see the landscape.Therefore, Li Wenbing's family is not a landscape room.
Question: Which of the following is most similar to the above argument?
Choices:
  A: Kind people will be respected by the villagers, Chenggong who is kind and charitable will be respected by the villagers, so Chenggong is a kind person
  B: Vegetables in Dongdun Market are very cheap.This basket of vegetables is not bought in Dongdun Market.Therefore, this basket of vegetables is not cheap
  C: Employees of Jiutian Company can speak English, Lin Yingrui is an employee of Jiutian Company, therefore, Lin Yingrui can speak English
  D: Anyone who meets the basic conditions can apply for a small loan.Sun Wen did not apply for a small loan.Therefore, Sun Wen did not meet the basic conditions

Thought: 
The argument follows the form: All A are B, C is not B, therefore C is not A.
Of the choices given, the argument in choice B follows this form: All vegetables in Dongdun Market are cheap, this basket is not cheap, therefore it is not from Dongdun Market.
Action: Answer("B")

 --- 
Correct Answer: D
## Assistant 2:
Response:
Explanation:
I misinterpreted the structure of the original argument and failed to identify the correct choice that reflected the same logical structure. I focused too narrowly on the specific words used in each statement rather than the underlying logical structure. 

Error Keywords:
- Logical structure
- Misinterpretation
- Overly literal interpretation

Solution:
The original argument can be structured as follows:
Premise 1: All landscape rooms (A) can see the landscape (B).
Premise 2: Li Wenbing's family (C) cannot see the landscape (not B).
Conclusion: Therefore, Li Wenbing's family is not a landscape room (not A).

This argument follows the form: All A are B; C is not B; therefore, C is not A.

Now, let's analyze the correct choice, D:
Premise 1: Anyone who meets the basic conditions (A) can apply for a small loan (B).
Premise 2: Sun Wen (C) did not apply for a small loan (not B).
Conclusion: Therefore, Sun Wen did not meet the basic conditions (not A).

Choice D follows the same logical structure as the original argument:
- "Anyone who meets the basic conditions" is analogous to "All landscape rooms."
- "Can apply for a small loan" is analogous to "can see the landscape."
- "Sun Wen" is analogous to "Li Wenbing's family."
- "Did not apply for a small loan" is analogous to "cannot see the landscape."

Instructions:
1. Identify the structure of the original argument:
   - Premise 1: All A are B.
   - Premise 2: C is not B.
   - Conclusion: Therefore, C is not A.
2. Analyze each choice:
   - Look for the same logical structure: All A are B; C is not B; therefore, C is not A.
   - Choice A is about respect and kindness, which do not match the structure.
   - Choice B is about cheap vegetables, but it does not follow the A, B, and C structure.
   - Choice C is about employees and English speaking abilities, but it does not follow the argument form.
   - Choice D follows the structure: Anyone who meets conditions (A) can apply for a loan (B). Sun Wen (C) didn't, so they lack conditions (not A).
3. Choose the answer that matches the structure.

Advice:
- Focus on the logical structure and relationships between statements rather than specific words or examples.
- Identify the key elements of the argument: the universal statement ("All A are B"), the negative statement about an individual ("C is not B"), and the conclusion ("Therefore, C is not A").
- Look for these elements in the answer choices, and select the one that mirrors this structure.
- Practice identifying logical structures to improve your ability to recognize them quickly and accurately.
