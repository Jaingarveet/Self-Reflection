## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Julio and Kevin both lead morning sessions.
Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
Action:

If Nessa leads an afternoon session, then she cannot be paired with Lan or Olivia.

A: Lan's session meets Wednesday morning. Possible.
B: Lan's session meets Thursday afternoon. Possible.
C: Nessa's session meets Friday afternoon. Possible.
D: Olivia's session meets Thursday morning. Not possible because Olivia's session cannot be on Wednesday, and she cannot be paired with Lan or Nessa.
E: Olivia's session meets Friday morning. Possible.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
