## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let's consider all possible combinations of candidates that could be unassigned:
- Jaramillo and Novetzke
- Jaramillo and Ong
- Kayne and Landon
- Kayne and Novetzke
- Landon and Ong
From the constraints:
- Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships. This means that Kayne and Novetzke cannot both be unassigned.
- If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne. This means that if Jaramillo is unassigned, then Kayne must also be unassigned.
- If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen. This means that if Ong is assigned to Venezuela, then Kayne cannot be unassigned.
- If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia. This means that if Landon is assigned, then he cannot be unassigned.
After applying the constraints, the only possible combination of unassigned candidates is Jaramillo and Novetzke.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
