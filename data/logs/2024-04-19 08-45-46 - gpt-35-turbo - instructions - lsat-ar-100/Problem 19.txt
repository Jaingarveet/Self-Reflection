Context: Of the eight students—George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert—in a seminar, exactly six will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.

Choices:
  A: Helen gives a report on Monday.
  B: Irving gives a report on Monday.

## Assistant 2:
Thought:
If Helen, Kyle, and Lenore give the three morning reports, then George, Irving, Nina, Olivia, and Robert must give the afternoon reports.
George can only give a report on Tuesday, so he must give an afternoon report.
If Nina gives a report, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on the next day, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday.
If Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Wednesday.
If Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving do not need to give reports.
Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports, so they must give morning reports.
