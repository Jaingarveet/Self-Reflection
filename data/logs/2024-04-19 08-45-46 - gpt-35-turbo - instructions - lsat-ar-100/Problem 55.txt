Self-reflection:
The correct answer is B.
To solve this problem, I created a table with the days of the week as columns and the witnesses as rows. I then used the given conditions to eliminate choices that did not meet the requirements. For example, I eliminated choices that had Franco and Garcia testifying on the same day. I also eliminated choices that did not have Iturbe testifying on Wednesday. After eliminating the choices that did not meet the conditions, I checked the remaining choices to ensure that they met all the conditions. Choice B was the only one that satisfied all the conditions.
Action: Answer("B")
