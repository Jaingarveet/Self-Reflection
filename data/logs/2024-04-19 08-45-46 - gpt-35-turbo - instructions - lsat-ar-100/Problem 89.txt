## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The first batch of sugar cookies is made on Monday, so there must be at least two batches made on Monday. 
The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, so there must be at least two batches made on Thursday. 
If the number of batches made on Friday is exactly one, then there must be at least two batches made on Wednesday. 
The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies, so the first batch of peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Wednesday. 
The first batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Wednesday or Thursday.
