Context: A maintenance company that takes service requests from three clients—Image, Solide, and Truvest—plans to set targets for its average service response times. Service targets will be set at 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day. Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail. The six targets are set according to the following conditions: None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.

## Assistant 2:
Thought:
If none of the clients has a website target of 2 days, then the website targets must be either 1 day or 3 days. 
Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target. Therefore, Truvest's website target must be 3 days, and Solide's website target must be 1 day. 
Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Therefore, Image's voicemail target must be 1 day, and the other clients' voicemail targets must be 2 or 3 days. 
Since none of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target, Image's website target must be 1 day, and the other clients' website targets must be 2 or 3 days. 
Therefore, Image's website target is shorter than Solide's website target.
Action: Answer("A")
