If Robertson is assigned parking space #1, #2, or #3, then Young must be assigned parking space #4. 
If Young is assigned parking space #4, then Togowa must be assigned parking space #1 and Xu must be assigned parking space #6. 
If Young is assigned parking space #5, then Togowa must be assigned parking space #1, Xu must be assigned parking space #6, and Robertson must be assigned parking space #4. 
If Young is assigned parking space #6, then Togowa must be assigned parking space #1, Xu must be assigned parking space #5, and Robertson must be assigned parking space #4.
