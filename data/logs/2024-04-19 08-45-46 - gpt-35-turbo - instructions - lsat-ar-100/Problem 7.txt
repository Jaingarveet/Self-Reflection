3. Use the constraints to eliminate possibilities and narrow down the options.
4. Double-check your reasoning to ensure that it is valid.
5. Choose the answer that must be true based on your valid reasoning.
## Assistant 2:
Self-reflection:
To solve this problem, I need to create a schedule that meets all the conditions. I can start by using a table to keep track of which witnesses can testify on which days. From the given conditions, I know that Iturbe testifies on Wednesday, and Jackson testifies on Monday. Hong does not testify on Monday, so Hong must testify on Tuesday or Wednesday. Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday, so Franco and Garcia must testify on Monday and Wednesday. Using this information, I can eliminate options A, D, and E. The only option left is C, which states that Garcia is scheduled to testify on Tuesday. This must be true because Franco cannot testify on Tuesday, and Iturbe, Hong, and Jackson are already scheduled to testify on the other days. Therefore, the answer is C: Garcia is scheduled to testify on Tuesday. 
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
