Topic: Law
Context: A maintenance company that takes service requests from three clients—Image, Solide, and Truvest—plans to set targets for its average service response times. Service targets will be set at 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day. Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail. The six targets are set according to the following conditions: None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
Question: Which one of the following targets CANNOT be set for more than one of the clients?
Choices:
  A: a 1-day website target
  B: a 2-day voicemail target
  C: a 2-day website target
  D: a 3-day voicemail target
  E: a 3-day website target

## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The conditions are:
- None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
- Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
- Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
Using these conditions, we can eliminate some of the targets:
- A 1-day website target cannot be set for Solide or Truvest because their website targets must be longer than their voicemail targets.
- A 3-day voicemail target cannot be set for Image because its voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
This leaves us with the following targets:
- A 2-day voicemail target
- A 2-day website target
- A 3-day website target
Any of these targets can be set for more than one client, except for:
Action: Answer("A") a 1-day website target
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: E
Score: 0
