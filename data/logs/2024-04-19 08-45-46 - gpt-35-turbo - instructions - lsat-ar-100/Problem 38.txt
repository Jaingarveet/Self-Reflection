Context: Exactly eight books—F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O—are placed on a bookcase with exactly three shelves—the top shelf, the middle shelf, and the bottom shelf. At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.
Question: If G is placed on the top shelf, then which one of the following could be a complete and accurate list of the books placed on the middle shelf?
Choices:
  A: H, I
  B: I, L
  C: H, I, L
  D: I, K, L
  E: F, I, M
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Read the problem carefully and understand the constraints.
2. Identify the books that must be placed on the bottom shelf based on the constraints.
3. Identify the book that must be placed on the middle shelf based on the constraints.
4. Use the remaining books to determine the possible combinations for the top shelf.
5. For each possible combination of books on the top shelf, use the constraints to determine the books on the middle and bottom shelves.
6. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Based on the constraints, we know that I is placed on the middle shelf, and F and M are placed on the same shelf. If G is placed on the top shelf, then the remaining books (H, K, L, and O) must be placed on the bottom shelf. 
We also know that K is placed on a higher shelf than F, so K cannot be on the bottom shelf. 
O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so O cannot be on the bottom shelf either. 
Therefore, both K and O must be on the top or middle shelf. 
If K is on the top shelf, then O must be on the middle shelf, which means L and H must be on the bottom shelf. 
If K is on the middle shelf, then O must be on the top shelf, which means L and H must be on the bottom shelf. 
Either way, I is on the middle shelf. 
So the possible combinations for the middle shelf are I and L, or I and H, or I, K, and L.
