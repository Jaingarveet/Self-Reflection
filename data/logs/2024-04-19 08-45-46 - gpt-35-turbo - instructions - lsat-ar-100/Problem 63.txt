Topic: Law
Context: A chemistry class has six lab sessions scheduled over three days—Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday—one session heing held each morning and one each afternoon. Each session will be led by a different lab assistant—Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, or Rebecca. The assignment of lab assistants to sessions is constrained as follows: Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day. Nessa must lead an afternoon session. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
Question: If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, then for how many of the other lab assistants can one determine which sessions they lead?
Choices:
  A: one
  B: two
  C: three
  D: four
  E: five
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and understand the constraints.
2. Make a list of all the constraints and use them to deduce the schedule of the lab assistants.
3. Double-check your reasoning to ensure that it is consistent with the constraints.
4. Identify the lab assistants for whom you can determine the schedule.
5. Count the number of lab assistants for whom you can determine the schedule.
6. Choose the answer that matches your count.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, then Olivia's session must be on Friday afternoon. 
Nessa must lead an afternoon session, so Nessa's session must be on Friday. 
Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day, so Lan's session must be on Wednesday. 
Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day, so Kevin's session must be on Wednesday morning and Rebecca's session must be on Wednesday afternoon. 
That leaves only one session for Nessa, which is Friday afternoon. 
So, the schedule is:
Wednesday morning: Kevin
Wednesday afternoon: Rebecca
Thursday morning: [REDACTED]
Thursday afternoon: Julio
Friday morning: [REDACTED]
Friday afternoon: Nessa, Olivia
For Kevin, Rebecca, Nessa, and Olivia, we know exactly which session they lead. For Julio, we know the day and time of his session, but not the specific lab. For Lan, we do not know which session she leads.
Action: Answer("4")
