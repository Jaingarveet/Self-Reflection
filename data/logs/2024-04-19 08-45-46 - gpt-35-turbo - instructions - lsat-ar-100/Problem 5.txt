## Assistant 2:
Thought:
From the given conditions, we know that:
- More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
- I is placed on the middle shelf.
- K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
- O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
- F is placed on the same shelf as M.
Option A: O is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf M is placed on.
We cannot determine the relative positions of O and M from the given conditions. This option is not necessarily true.
Option B: K is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf G is placed on.
We cannot determine the relative positions of K and G from the given conditions. This option is not necessarily true.
Option C: I is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf F is placed on.
This option is not possible because F and M are on the same shelf, and K is on a higher shelf than F. Therefore, I cannot be on a higher shelf than F.
Option D: G is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf O is placed on.
We cannot determine the relative positions of G and O from the given conditions. This option is not necessarily true.
Option E: F is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf L is placed on.
From the given conditions, we know that O is placed on a higher shelf than L, and F is placed on the same shelf as M. Therefore, F must be on a higher shelf than L. This option must be true.
Action: Answer("E")
