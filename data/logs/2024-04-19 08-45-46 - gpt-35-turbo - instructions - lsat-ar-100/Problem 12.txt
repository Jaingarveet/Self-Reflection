## Assistant 2:
Thought:
To determine which pair of houses cannot be shown consecutively, we need to consider the rules given. 
J must be shown in the evening, so it cannot be shown consecutively with any other house. 
K cannot be shown in the morning, so it cannot be shown consecutively with any of the first two houses. 
L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown, so it cannot be shown consecutively with either K or M. 
O is not mentioned in any of the rules, so it can be shown consecutively with any other house. 
P is the last house to be shown, so it can be shown consecutively with M or O. 
Action: Answer("B")

Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
