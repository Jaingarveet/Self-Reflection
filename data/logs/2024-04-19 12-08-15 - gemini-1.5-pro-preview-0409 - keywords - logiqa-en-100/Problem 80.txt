While I don't have access to the specific details of my previous error, I can analyze the problem and choices to ensure a correct answer this time.
**Key Points to Consider:**
*   **Department Adjacency:** Human Resources and Sales are not adjacent.
*   **Finance & Planning:** Finance is directly above Planning.
*   **Administration Placement:** Administration is above Planning but below Human Resources.
**Eliminating Options:**
*   **Option C & D:** Both place Finance below Planning, contradicting the given information. So, they are incorrect.
**Choosing Between A & B:**
*   Both options respect the Finance-Planning and Administration placement rules.
*   The deciding factor is the relative position of Sales and R&D concerning Human Resources.
**Solution:**
*   Since Human Resources and Sales cannot be adjacent, **Option A** is the correct answer as it places R&D between them.
**Action: Answer("A")**
