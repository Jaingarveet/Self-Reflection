## Assistant 2:
## Reflection on Previous Error:
My previous attempt at this question was incorrect due to a misinterpretation of the given information. I focused on identifying the professor who made both correct judgments instead of analyzing the statements to deduce the actual winner. 
## Solving the Problem:
1. **Analyze Professor Zhao's statement:** He eliminates Tsinghua and Zhejiang University, leaving the possibility of the University of Science and Technology of China being the winner.
2. **Analyze Professor Qian's statement:** He eliminates Tsinghua University but suggests the University of Science and Technology of China as the winner.
3. **Analyze Professor Sun's statement:** He eliminates the University of Science and Technology of China but suggests Tsinghua University as the winner.
Now, we know only one professor had both judgments correct. This means:
* **If Professor Zhao is correct:** Both Tsinghua and Zhejiang University are not winners, leaving the University of Science and Technology of China as the potential winner. This would contradict Professor Sun's statement.
* **If Professor Qian is correct:** Tsinghua University is not the winner, and the University of Science and Technology of China is the winner. This aligns with Professor Zhao's statement and contradicts Professor Sun's statement.
* **If Professor Sun is correct:** The University of Science and Technology of China is not the winner, and Tsinghua University is the winner. This contradicts both Professor Zhao and Professor Qian's statements.
Therefore, only Professor Qian's statement aligns with the condition of one professor having both judgments correct.
Action: Answer("B")
