## Assistant 2:
Thought:
I recall this question and my previous incorrect response. 
My mistake was assuming complex family relationships when the solution was simpler.
Let's analyze each invitee:
* Father's brother-in-law: This is Mr. Chen's uncle (mother's brother).
* Brother-in-law's father: This is Mr. Chen's father.
* Brother's mother-in-law: This is Mr. Chen's mother.
* Brother-in-law's brother: This could be another brother-in-law or a person unrelated to Mr. Chen depending on if his spouse has brothers or sisters.
Therefore, Mr. Chen invited his uncle, his father, and his mother, for a total of 3 guests.
Action: Answer("D")
