## Assistant 2:
## Reflection on Previous Error:
While I don't have access to the specifics of my previous error, I can analyze the problem and potential pitfalls to ensure a correct answer this time.
**Potential Errors:**
* **Misinterpreting adjacency:**  I might have assumed adjacency implied a specific order (e.g., A adjacent to B means A is always to the left of B), leading to an incorrect conclusion.
* **Ignoring information:**  I might have overlooked the clue about Fuyi station's position relative to Haoyun and Huyao stations.
* **Incorrectly applying transitivity:**  I might have incorrectly chained the "east of" relationships to reach a wrong conclusion.
**Improved Approach:**
1. **Map the information:** I will create a diagram or list to represent the relative positions of the stations based on the given clues.
2. **Analyze adjacency:** I will carefully consider the meaning of "adjacent" and avoid assuming a specific order unless explicitly stated.
3. **Use all clues:** I will ensure I consider all the given information about the stations' positions before drawing a conclusion.
4. **Validate conclusions:** I will double-check my reasoning and ensure it logically follows from the given information.
**Applying the improved approach to the current problem:**
1. **Mapping:**
    * Fuyi is east of Haoyun and west of Huyao (adjacent to Huyao).
    * Jiushang is adjacent to Yinling.
    * Jiushang is adjacent to Haoyun and east of Haoyun.
2. **Analysis:**
    * From the information, we can deduce the order: Haoyun - Jiushang - (Yinling or Fuyi) - Huyao.
    * We know Fuyi is adjacent to Huyao, so the order is: Haoyun - Jiushang - Fuyi - Huyao.
    * Yinling must be at the westernmost end as it's the only remaining station.
3. **Conclusion:**
    * Yinling is standing on the west side.
**Action: Answer("D")** 
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: A
