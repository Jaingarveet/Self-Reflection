## User 2:
Topic: Logic
Context: There must be an outside world, because if there is something outside me that can shine or reflect, shining the light into my eyes, which gives me a visual experience, I ca nâ€™t see the buildings, the crowds and the stars these things.And, not only have visual experience like me, but others also have such visual experience; book knowledge also tells us repeatedly that there is an outside world outside of us.
Question: Which of the following does not constitute doubt or rebuttal to the above argument?
Choices:
  A: To use sensory evidence to explain the existence of the external world requires presupposing the existence of the external world in the mind.
  B: How do you prove that others have similar visual experience to you?
  C: Since the visual experience is reliable, Mirage is not a so-called illusion, but a real existence.
  D: If there is no external world and natural science knowledge is not a true reflection of it, then why does natural science achieve such great success in practice?

## Assistant 2:
## Reflection on Previous Error:
My previous error likely stemmed from misinterpreting the core argument and the nature of the counter-arguments. The key point is that the argument attempts to justify the existence of the external world based on personal visual experiences and shared knowledge. Therefore, effective rebuttals should challenge the reliability of these justifications or present alternative explanations.
## Analysis of Choices:
* **A:** This directly challenges the premise by pointing out circular reasoning. It questions the assumption that sensory experiences automatically validate the external world's existence. 
* **B:** This casts doubt on the claim of shared visual experiences, a supporting point in the argument. 
* **C:** This statement reinforces the argument by asserting the reliability of visual experiences. It does not offer a counter-argument.
* **D:** This challenges the argument by highlighting the practical success of natural science, which relies on the assumption of an external world.  
## Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, option C strengthens the argument instead of refuting it. 
**Action: Answer("C")** 
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: D
