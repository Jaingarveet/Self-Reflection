Question: In Spondylolisthesis, which of the following is NOT useful investigation?
Choices:
  A: Anteroposterior X-ray
  B: Lateral view X-ray
  C: CT
  D: MRI
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I assumed that all the investigations listed are useful for diagnosing Spondylolisthesis. However, the Anteroposterior X-ray is not as useful as the other investigations because it does not provide as much detail about the condition of the vertebrae and surrounding structures.
Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation
- Assumption
- Diagnostic methods
Solution:
In Spondylolisthesis, the most useful investigations are those that provide detailed images of the spine and surrounding structures. These include:
B: Lateral view X-ray - This can show if any vertebrae have slipped forward.
C: CT - This can provide a more detailed look at the spine and can show if there are any fractures or other problems.
D: MRI - This can provide detailed images of the soft tissues and nerves around the spine.
A: Anteroposterior X-ray - While this can show the alignment of the vertebrae, it does not provide as much detail as the other investigations and is therefore not as useful.
Instructions:
1. Understand the condition in question - Spondylolisthesis.
2. Review each investigation method and understand what it reveals.
3. Compare the usefulness of each investigation in diagnosing Spondylolisthesis.
4. Identify the least useful investigation for this specific condition.
5. Choose the answer that matches your conclusion.
Advice:
- Always read the question carefully and understand what is being asked.
- Do not make assumptions about the usefulness of different investigations without considering the specific condition in question.
- Understand the strengths and limitations of different diagnostic methods.
- Remember that not all investigations are equally useful for all conditions.
