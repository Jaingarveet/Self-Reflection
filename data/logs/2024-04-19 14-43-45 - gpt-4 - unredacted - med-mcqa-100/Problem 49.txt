# Model: gpt-4 | Agent: unredacted | Exam: med-mcqa-100 | Problem 49 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Medicine.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: In blood buffers Bicarbonates buffers is ideal why?
Choices:
  A: Pka is equal to Ph
  B: High concentration
  C: Weak acid and weak base combination
  D: easy to measure
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I focused on the pKa value of bicarbonate buffers and their proximity to the physiological pH of blood. However, the correct answer is that bicarbonate buffers are ideal in blood due to their high concentration. 
Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation
- Buffer systems
- Bicarbonate buffers
- Biochemistry
Solution:
Bicarbonate buffers are ideal in blood because they are present in high concentrations. This allows them to effectively neutralize both acids and bases and maintain the blood pH within the narrow range necessary for proper physiological function. Therefore, the correct answer is B: High concentration.
Instructions:
1. Understand the question and what it is asking.
2. Recall the properties of bicarbonate buffers in blood.
3. Remember that bicarbonate buffers are present in high concentrations in blood.
4. Understand that this high concentration allows them to effectively neutralize both acids and bases.
5. Choose the answer that matches this understanding.
Advice:
- Always read the question carefully and understand what it is asking.
- Remember that while pKa values are important in buffer systems, other factors such as concentration can also be crucial.
- Always consider all possible answers before making a choice.
- In biochemistry, concentration often plays a significant role in the effectiveness of a system.
- Always review and understand the basic principles of biochemistry, including buffer systems and their properties.
