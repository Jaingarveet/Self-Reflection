Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I focused on the final destination of the islet cells (the liver) rather than the method of transplantation (injection into the portal vein). 
Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation
- Focus on destination rather than method
- Transplantation procedure
Solution:
Islet cell transplantation for Diabetes mellitus involves transplanting islet cells into the liver of the patient. However, the method of transplantation is through injection into the portal vein, which carries blood to the liver. Therefore, the correct answer is "Injected into the portal vein".
Instructions:
1. Understand the question, focusing on the specific aspect being asked (in this case, the site of transplantation).
2. Recall the procedure for Islet cell transplantation for Diabetes mellitus.
3. Remember that the cells are injected into the portal vein, which carries blood to the liver.
4. Choose the answer that correctly identifies the method of transplantation, not just the final destination of the cells.

- Remember that in medical procedures, the method of delivery can be as important as the final destination.
- In questions about procedures, focus on the process rather than just the end result.
- Always double-check your answer to ensure it matches the specific question being asked.
