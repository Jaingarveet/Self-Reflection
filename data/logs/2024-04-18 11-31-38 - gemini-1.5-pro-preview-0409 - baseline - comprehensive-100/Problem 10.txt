Question: A man divides Rs 8600 among 5 sons, 4 daughters and 2 nephews. If each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, and each son receives five as much as each nephew. How much does each daughter receive ?
Choices:
  A: Rs 400
  B: Rs 500
  C: Rs 600
  D: Rs 700
  E: Rs 800
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let the share of each nephew be $x.
Then, share of each daughter = $4x, and share of each son = $5x.
So, $5 * 5x + 4 * 4x + 2 * x = 8600$
$41x = 8600$
$x = 210$
Therefore, each daughter receives $4 * 210 = 840$.
Action: Answer("E") 
## Result:
Agent Answer: E
Correct Answer: E
