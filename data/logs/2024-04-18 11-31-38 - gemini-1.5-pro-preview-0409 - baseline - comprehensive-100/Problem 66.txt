## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Question: $$m=\frac{\left(\frac{r}{1,200}\right)\left(1+\frac{r}{1,200}\right)^{N}}{\left(1+\frac{r}{1,200}\right)^{N}-1} P$$The formula above gives the monthly payment $m$ needed to pay off a loan of $P$ dollars at $r$ percent annual interest over $N$ months. Which of the following gives $P$ in terms of $m, r$, and $N$ ?
Choices:
  A: $P=\frac{\left(\frac{r}{1,200}\right)\left(1+\frac{r}{1,200}\right)^{N}}{\left(1+\frac{r}{1,200}\right)^{N}-1} m$
  B: $P=\frac{\left(1+\frac{r}{1,200}\right)^{N}-1}{\left(\frac{r}{1,200}\right)\left(1+\frac{r}{1,200}\right)^{N}} m$
  C: $P=\left(\frac{r}{1,200}\right) m$
  D: $P=\left(\frac{1,200}{r}\right) m$
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
We need to isolate P in the given equation. 
Multiply both sides by the denominator of the fraction on the right side and then divide both sides by the numerator of the fraction on the right side to isolate P.
Action: Answer("B") 
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
