## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: A club consists of members whose ages are in A.P. The common difference being 3 months. If the youngest member of the club is just 7 years old and the sum of the ages of all the members is 250, then number of members in the club are :
Choices:
  A: 18
  B: 20
  C: 25
  D: 26
  E: 27
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let the number of members in the club be n.
Then, sum of the ages of n members = n/2 [2a + (n - 1)d]
Given that, a = 7 years = 84 months, d = 3 months and sum of ages = 250 years = 3000 months.
n/2 [2 * 84 + (n - 1) * 3] = 3000
n [168 + 3n - 3] = 6000
3n^2 + 165n - 6000 = 0
n^2 + 55n - 2000 = 0
(n + 80)(n - 25) = 0
n = 25.
Action: Answer("C") 
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
