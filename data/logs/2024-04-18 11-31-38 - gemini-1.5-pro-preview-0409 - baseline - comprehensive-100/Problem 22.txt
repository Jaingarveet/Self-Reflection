## User 2:
Topic: Law
Context: Of the eight students—George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert—in a seminar, exactly six will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
Question: If George, Nina, and Robert give reports and they do so on different days from one another, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Helen gives a report on Wednesday.
  B: Nina gives a report on Monday.
  C: Nina gives a report on Tuesday.
  D: Olivia gives a report on Monday.
  E: Robert gives a report on Wednesday.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
*   George must present on Tuesday, leaving Monday and Wednesday for Nina and Robert.
*   Nina cannot present on Wednesday (due to the Helen and Irving condition).
*   Therefore, Nina must present on Monday, leaving Wednesday for Robert.
*   Since Nina presents on Monday, Helen and Irving must present on Tuesday alongside George. 
*   This leaves Wednesday with Robert and potentially Olivia or Kyle or Lenore. 
Action: Answer("E") 
## Result:
Agent Answer: E
Correct Answer: A
