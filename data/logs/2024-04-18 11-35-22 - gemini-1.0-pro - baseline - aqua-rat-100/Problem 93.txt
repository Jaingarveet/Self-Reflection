Question: [5 + ? × 19 - 15 - 7]/[13 × 13 - 156] = 6
Choices:
  A: 4
  B: 4.5
  C: 5
  D: 5.5
  E: 6.5
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
First, we need to solve the equation:
5 + ? × 19 - 15 - 7 = 6 × (13 × 13 - 156)
5 + ? × 19 - 15 - 7 = 6 × 139
5 + ? × 19 - 15 - 7 = 834
? × 19 = 834 + 15 + 7 - 5 = 851
? = 851 / 19 = 44.78947368
Action: Answer("E")
## Result:
Agent Answer: E
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
