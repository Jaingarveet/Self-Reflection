## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let's set up an equation to represent the given information.
The monthly salary S is the sum of a fixed salary of $500 plus 5% of all monthly sales, which can be written as:
S = 500 + 0.05 * monthly sales
We are given that the monthly salary reaches $1500, so we can plug that in for S:
1500 = 500 + 0.05 * monthly sales
Now, we can solve for the monthly sales:
1500 - 500 = 0.05 * monthly sales
1000 = 0.05 * monthly sales
monthly sales = 1000 / 0.05
monthly sales = 20000
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
