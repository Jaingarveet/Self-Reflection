Question: Jack buys 18 sharpeners (white and brown) for rs. 100. If he pays 1 rupee more for each white than brown sharpeners. How many of white and how many brown sharpeners did he buy?
Choices:
  A: 10,8
  B: 9,8
  C: 7,8
  D: 5,6
  E: 11,12
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let the number of white sharpeners be x.
Then the number of brown sharpeners is 18 - x.
The cost of each white sharpener is 1 rupee more than the cost of each brown sharpener.
So, the cost of each white sharpener is 1 + (cost of each brown sharpener).
The total cost of the white sharpeners is x * (1 + (cost of each brown sharpener)).
The total cost of the brown sharpeners is (18 - x) * (cost of each brown sharpener).
The total cost of the sharpeners is rs. 100.
So, x * (1 + (cost of each brown sharpener)) + (18 - x) * (cost of each brown sharpener) = 100.
Simplifying the equation, we get x + 18 = 100.
Solving for x, we get x = 82.
So, the number of white sharpeners is 82.
The number of brown sharpeners is 18 - 82 = -64.
Since the number of sharpeners cannot be negative, there is no solution to this problem.
