Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Question: Amy is organizing her bookshelves and finds that she has 10 different types of books. She then codes each book with either a single letter or a pair of two different letters. If each type of book is uniquely represented by either a single letter or pair of letters, what is the smallest number of letters Amy will need to create the codes for all 10 types of books? (Assume the order of letters in a pair does not matter.)
Choices:
  A: 3
  B: 4
  C: 5
  D: 10
  E: 20
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
If Amy uses only single letters, she can represent a maximum of 26 different types of books.
Since she has 10 different types of books, using only single letters is not enough.
If Amy uses pairs of letters, she can represent a maximum of 26 * 26 = 676 different types of books.
Since she has 10 different types of books, using pairs of letters is enough.
To minimize the number of letters used, Amy should use single letters for the first 9 types of books and a pair of letters for the 10th type of book.
This requires a total of 9 + 2 = 11 letters.
Action: Answer("B")
