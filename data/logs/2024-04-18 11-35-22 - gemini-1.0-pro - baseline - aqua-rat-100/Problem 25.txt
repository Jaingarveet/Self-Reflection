You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: A car is being driven, in a straight line and at a uniform speed, towards the base of a vertical tower. The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower?
Choices:
  A: 5(√3 + 1)
  B: 6(√3 + √2)
  C: 7(√3 – 1)
  D: 8(√3 – 2)
  E: None of these
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let's denote the height of the tower as H and the distance between the car and the base of the tower at the initial observation as D.
Using the tangent function, we can write:
tan(45°) = H / (D + 10V)
tan(60°) = H / D
where V is the speed of the car.
Solving for H in both equations, we get:
H = (D + 10V) * tan(45°)
H = D * tan(60°)
Setting both equations equal to each other, we get:
(D + 10V) * tan(45°) = D * tan(60°)
Since tan(45°) = 1 and tan(60°) = √3, we can simplify the equation to:
D + 10V = D√3
Solving for V, we get:
V = (D(√3 - 1)) / 10
The time it takes for the car to reach the base of the tower is:
T = D / V = D / ((D(√3 - 1)) / 10) = 10 / (√3 - 1)
Therefore, the answer is 10 / (√3 - 1), which is approximately 17.32 minutes.
