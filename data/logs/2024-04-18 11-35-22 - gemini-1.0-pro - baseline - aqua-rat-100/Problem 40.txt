Question: Mark told John "If you give me half your money I will have Rs.75. John said, "if you give me one third of your money, I will have Rs.75/-. How much money did John have ?
Choices:
  A: 22
  B: 60
  C: 28
  D: 26
  E: 18
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let's assume John has x rupees.
According to the first statement, if John gives half his money to Mark, Mark will have Rs.75. This means Mark initially had 75-x/2 rupees.
According to the second statement, if Mark gives John one-third of his money, John will have Rs.75. This means John initially had 75-x/3 rupees.
Equating both expressions for John's initial money:
75-x/2 = 75-x/3
Solving for x:
3(75-x/2) = 2(75-x/3)
225 - 3x/2 = 150 - 2x/3
3x/2 - 2x/3 = 225 - 150
7x/6 = 75
x = 60
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
