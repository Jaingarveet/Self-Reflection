## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: there are more than 501 students in a school such that 20% of them exactly took physics and 28% of them exactly took math. What could be the least possible no of students in the school?
Choices:
  A: 550
  B: 570
  C: 600
  D: 700
  E: none of these
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let x be the number of students in the school.
0.2x is the number of students who took physics.
0.28x is the number of students who took math.
The least possible number of students who took both physics and math is 0.
The least possible number of students who took neither physics nor math is x - 0.2x - 0.28x = 0.52x.
The least possible number of students who took either physics or math is 0.2x + 0.28x = 0.48x.
The least possible number of students in the school is x = 0.52x / (1 - 0.48) = 1000.
Action: Answer("E")
## Result:
Agent Answer: E
Correct Answer: E
