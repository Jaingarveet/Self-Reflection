Question: At what price should the Karan mark a sewing machine that costs him Rs. 1200/- so that even after offering a 20% discount, he makes 20% profit?
Choices:
  A: 1,879
  B: 1,875
  C: 1,876
  D: 1,872
  E: 1,800
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let the marked price be Rs. x.
After offering a 20% discount, the selling price = 80% of x = 80x/100
The profit earned = 20% of 1200 = 20*1200/100 = 240
So, 80x/100 = 1200 + 240 = 1440
x = 1440 * 100 / 80 = 1800
Action: Answer("E")
## Result:
Agent Answer: E
Correct Answer: E
