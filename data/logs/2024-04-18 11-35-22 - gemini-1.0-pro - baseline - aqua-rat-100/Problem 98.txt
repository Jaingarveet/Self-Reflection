Question: At 6% per annum simple interest, Rahul borrowed Rs. 500. What amount will he pay to clear the debt after 4 years
Choices:
  A: 750
  B: 700

where P is the principal amount, R is the rate of interest and T is the time period.
Simple Interest = (500*6*4)/100 = 120
Total amount = Principal + Interest = 500 + 120 = 620
