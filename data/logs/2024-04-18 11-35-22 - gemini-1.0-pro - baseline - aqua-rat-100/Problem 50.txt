Question: A ship went on a voyage. After it had traveled 180 miles a plane started with 10 times the speed of the ship. Find the distance when they meet from starting point.
Choices:
  A: 238
  B: 289
  C: 200
  D: 287
  E: 187
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let's assume the speed of the ship is x miles per hour.
Then the speed of the plane is 10x miles per hour.
The time it takes for the plane to catch up to the ship is 180 miles / (10x - x) miles per hour = 180 / 9x hours.
In that time, the ship will have traveled an additional 180 miles / 9x hours * x miles per hour = 20 miles.
Therefore, the total distance from the starting point when they meet is 180 miles + 20 miles = 200 miles.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
