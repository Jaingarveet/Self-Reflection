Question: 20 marbles were pulled out of a bag of only white marbles, painted black, and then put back in. Then, another 20 marbles were pulled out, of which 1 was black, after which they were all returned to the bag. If the percentage of black marbles pulled out the second time represents their percentage in the bag, how many marbles in total Q does the bag currently hold?
Choices:
  A: 40
  B: 200
  C: 380
  D: 400
  E: 3200
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let X be the total number of marbles in the bag.
The percentage of black marbles after the first round is 20/X.
The percentage of black marbles after the second round is 1/(20+X).
Since these percentages are equal, we have:
20/X = 1/(20+X)
Solving for X, we get:
X = 380
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
