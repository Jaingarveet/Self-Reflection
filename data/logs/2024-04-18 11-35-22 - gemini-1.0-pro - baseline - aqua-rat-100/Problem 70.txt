Question: In a railway station, there are two trains going. One in the harbor line and one in the main line, each having a frequency of 10 minutes. The main line service starts at 5 o'clock and the harbor line starts at 5.02 A.M. A man goes to the station every day to catch the first train that comes. What is the probability of the man catching the first train?
Choices:
  A: 0.9
  B: 0.8
  C: 0.6
  D: 0.65
  E: 1.5
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The main line train starts at 5:00 AM and the harbor line train starts at 5:02 AM.
The man will catch the first train if it is the main line train.
The probability of the man catching the first train is the probability that the main line train arrives before the harbor line train.
The probability of the main line train arriving before the harbor line train is the ratio of the time interval between the arrival of the main line train and the arrival of the harbor line train to the time interval between the arrival of two consecutive trains.
The time interval between the arrival of the main line train and the arrival of the harbor line train is 2 minutes.
The time interval between the arrival of two consecutive trains is 10 minutes.
The probability of the man catching the first train is 2/10 = 0.2.
