Question: A sales person gets a 10% commission on each sale he makes. How many sales of $250 each must he make in order to reach a salary of at least $1000?
Choices:
  A: 15
  B: 24
  C: 25
  D: 40
  E: 52
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
To solve this, we can set up an equation. Let x be the number of sales the salesperson needs to make.
The commission earned per sale is $250 * 10% = $25.
To reach a salary of $1000, the salesperson needs to make x * $25 >= $1000.
Dividing both sides by $25, we get x >= 40.
Action: Answer("D")
