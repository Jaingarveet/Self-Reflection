# Model: gemini-1.0-pro | Agent: baseline | Exam: aqua-rat-100 | Problem 76 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: If n is such that 36 ≤ n ≤ 72, then x = (n2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16) / (n+ 4√n+ 4) satisfies
Choices:
  A: 20 < x < 54
  B: 23 < x < 58
  C: 25 < x < 64
  D: 28 < x < 60
  E: None of these
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
First, we need to find the range of n^2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16.
Since 36 ≤ n ≤ 72, we have:
36^2 ≤ n^2 ≤ 72^2
2(36)√(36 + 4) ≤ 2√n(n + 4) ≤ 2(72)√(72 + 4)
16^2 ≤ 2√n(n + 4) ≤ 16^2
Therefore, the range of n^2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16 is:
36^2 + 2(36)√(36 + 4) + 16^2 ≤ n^2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16 ≤ 72^2 + 2(72)√(72 + 4) + 16^2
Next, we need to find the range of n + 4√n + 4.
Since 36 ≤ n ≤ 72, we have:
36 + 4√36 + 4 ≤ n + 4√n + 4 ≤ 72 + 4√72 + 4
Therefore, the range of x = (n^2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16) / (n + 4√n + 4) is:
(36^2 + 2(36)√(36 + 4) + 16^2) / (36 + 4√36 + 4) ≤ x ≤ (72^2 + 2(72)√(72 + 4) + 16^2) / (72 + 4√72 + 4)
Simplifying these expressions, we get:
20.25 ≤ x ≤ 53.75
Therefore, the answer is:
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
