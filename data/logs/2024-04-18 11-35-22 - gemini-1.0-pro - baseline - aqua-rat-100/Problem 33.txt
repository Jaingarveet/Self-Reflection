Question: A paper is in a square form whose one side is 20 cm. Two semi circles are drawn on its opposites as diameters. If these semi circles are cut down what is the area of the remaining paper?
Choices:
  A: 8.75
  B: 8.79
  C: 8.75
  D: 8.71
  E: 8.72
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The area of the square paper is 20 * 20 = 400 cm^2.
The area of each semi-circle is (1/2) * pi * (20/2)^2 = 78.54 cm^2.
The total area of the two semi-circles is 78.54 * 2 = 157.08 cm^2.
The area of the remaining paper is 400 - 157.08 = 242.92 cm^2.
Action: Answer("E")
