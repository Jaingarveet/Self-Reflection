Question: A club consists of members whose ages are in A.P. The common difference being 3 months. If the youngest member of the club is just 7 years old and the sum of the ages of all the members is 250, then number of members in the club are :
Choices:
  A: 18
  B: 20
  C: 25
  D: 26
  E: 27
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let the number of members in the club be n.
Then, the sum of the ages of all the members = 7 + (7 + 3) + (7 + 6) + ... + (7 + 3(n - 1))
= n(7 + 3(n - 1))/2
= 250
=> n(7 + 3n - 3) = 500
=> n(3n + 4) = 500
=> 3n^2 + 4n - 500 = 0
=> 3n^2 + 30n - 26n - 500 = 0
=> 3n(n + 10) - 26(n + 10) = 0
=> (n + 10)(3n - 26) = 0
=> n = 26
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: C
