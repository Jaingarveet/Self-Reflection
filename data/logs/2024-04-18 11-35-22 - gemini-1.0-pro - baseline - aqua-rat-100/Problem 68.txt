## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: The greatest common factor of two positive integers is 11. The least common multiple of these two integers is 7700. If one of the integers is 350, what is the other?
Choices:
  A: 242
  B: 308
  C: 352
  D: 412
  E: 456
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The greatest common factor (GCF) of two integers is the largest positive integer that is a factor of both integers.
The least common multiple (LCM) of two integers is the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of both integers.
If the GCF of two integers is 11, then the two integers are multiples of 11.
If one of the integers is 350, then the other integer must be a multiple of 11 that is also a factor of 7700.
The prime factorization of 7700 is 2^2 * 5^2 * 7 * 11.
The only multiple of 11 that is also a factor of 7700 is 11 * 7 * 5^2 = 1925.
Therefore, the other integer is 1925.
Action: Answer("E")
## Result:
Agent Answer: E
Correct Answer: A
