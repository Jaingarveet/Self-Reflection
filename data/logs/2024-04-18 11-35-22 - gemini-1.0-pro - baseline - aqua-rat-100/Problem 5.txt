Question: Suppose you can travel from a place M to a place N by 3 buses, from place N to place O by 4 buses, from place O to place P by 1 buses and from place P to place Q by 3 buses. In how many ways can you travel from M to Q ?

## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The number of ways to travel from M to Q is the product of the number of ways to travel between each pair of consecutive places.
There are 3 ways to travel from M to N, 4 ways to travel from N to O, 1 way to travel from O to P, and 3 ways to travel from P to Q.
Therefore, the total number of ways to travel from M to Q is 3 * 4 * 1 * 3 = 36.
