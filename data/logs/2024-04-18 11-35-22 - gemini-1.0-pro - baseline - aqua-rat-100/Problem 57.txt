## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: A point on the edge of a fan blade that is rotating in a plane 10 centimeters from the center of the fan. What is the distance traveled, in centimeters, by this point after 30 seconds when the fan runs at the rate of 300 revolutions per minutes?
Choices:
  A: 750pi
  B: 1500pi
  C: 1875pi
  D: 3000pi
  E: 7500pi
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The distance traveled by the point is the circumference of the circle traced by the point.
The radius of the circle is 10 centimeters.
The circumference of the circle is 2 * pi * radius = 20pi centimeters.
The fan runs at the rate of 300 revolutions per minute, so it makes 300/60 = 5 revolutions per second.
In 30 seconds, the fan makes 5 * 30 = 150 revolutions.
The distance traveled by the point is 150 * 20pi = 3000pi centimeters.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
