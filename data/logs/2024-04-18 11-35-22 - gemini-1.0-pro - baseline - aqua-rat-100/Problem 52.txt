Question: X and Y are two alloys which were made by mixing zinc and copper in the ratio 6:9 and 7:11, respectively. If 40 grams of alloy X and 60 grams of alloy Y are melted and mixed to form alloy Z, what is the ratio of zinc and copper in the alloy Z ?
Choices:
  A: 69:91
  B: 59:91
  C: 59:90
  D: 59:91
  E: 69:101

Alloy X has 6/15 zinc and 9/15 copper.
Alloy Y has 7/18 zinc and 11/18 copper.
In alloy Z, the ratio of zinc to copper is (40*6/15 + 60*7/18) : (40*9/15 + 60*11/18) = 59:91
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
