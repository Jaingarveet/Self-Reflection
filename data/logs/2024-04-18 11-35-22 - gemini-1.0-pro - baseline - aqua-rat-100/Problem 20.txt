Question: 64 boys and 40 girls form a group for social work. During their membership drive, the same number of boys and girls joined the group. How many members does the group have now, if the ratio of boys to girls is 4:3?
Choices:
  A: 277
  B: 288
  C: 200
  D: 277
  E: 168
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let x be the number of boys and girls who joined the group.
The new ratio of boys to girls is (64 + x) : (40 + x) = 4 : 3.
Cross-multiplying, we get 3(64 + x) = 4(40 + x).
Expanding, we get 192 + 3x = 160 + 4x.
Subtracting 3x from both sides, we get 192 = 160 + x.
Subtracting 160 from both sides, we get x = 32.
The total number of members is now 64 + 40 + 32 + 32 = 168.
Action: Answer("E")
## Result:
Agent Answer: E
Correct Answer: E
