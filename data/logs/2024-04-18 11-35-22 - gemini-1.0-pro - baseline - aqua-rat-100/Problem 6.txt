Question: A company contracts to paint 3 houses. Mr.Brown can paint a house in 6 days while Mr.Black would take 8 days and Mr.Blue 12 days. After 8 days Mr.Brown goes on vacation and Mr. Black begins to work for a period of 6 days. How many days will it take Mr.Blue to complete the contract?
Choices:
  A: 7
  B: 8
  C: 10
  D: 11
  E: 12
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Mr.Brown can paint a house in 6 days, so in 8 days he can paint 8/6 = 4/3 houses.
Mr.Black can paint a house in 8 days, so in 6 days he can paint 6/8 = 3/4 houses.
Together, Mr.Brown and Mr.Black can paint 4/3 + 3/4 = 25/12 houses in 8 days.
This means that 1 - 25/12 = 7/12 houses are left to be painted.
Mr.Blue can paint a house in 12 days, so he can paint 7/12 houses in 7 days.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
