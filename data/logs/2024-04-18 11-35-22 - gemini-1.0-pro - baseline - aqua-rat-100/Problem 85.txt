## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: Consider there is an staircase elevator and you are coming down. If you walk 20 steps and stop, then you reach bottom in 10 minutes. If you walk 10 steps and stop, you reach to the ground in 20 minutes. What is the speed of the elevator?
Choices:
  A: 1 step/minute
  B: 2 step/minute
  C: 3 step/minute
  D: 4 step/minute
  E: None of the above
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let's analyze the given information:
- Walking 20 steps takes 10 minutes, which means the speed is 20 steps / 10 minutes = 2 steps/minute.
- Walking 10 steps takes 20 minutes, which also translates to a speed of 10 steps / 20 minutes = 0.5 steps/minute.
This seems contradictory. How can walking fewer steps take longer? 
There might be a mistake in the question or the answer choices. 
It's important to note that the speed should be consistent regardless of the number of steps taken. 
Therefore, the correct answer should be the speed calculated from the first scenario:
Action: Answer("B") 
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
