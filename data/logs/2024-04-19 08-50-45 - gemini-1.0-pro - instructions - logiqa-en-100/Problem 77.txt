## System:
You are an expert in Logic.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Context: The members of the printing group and the binding group are mainly from the following seven employees-F, G, H, J, K, L and M.The members of each group must meet the following conditions? (1) Each group has at least 3 employees .(2) F and K cannot be in the same group.(3) If K is in a certain group, J must also be in this group.(4) M is at least one of the members of these two groups.(5) At least one of the same employees in both groups.
Question: If the printing group has only three members, G, H, and L, and under sufficient conditions, the two groups have as many common members as possible, then which of the following statements must be true?
Choices:
  A: The binding group and the printing group happen to have a common member.

2. Identify the key information and constraints.
3. Consider all possible scenarios and combinations that satisfy the conditions.
4. Choose the solution that minimizes or maximizes the required value (e.g., number of members) while satisfying all constraints.
5. Double-check your reasoning and calculations to ensure logical consistency.
## Assistant 2:
## Self-Reflection on Previous Incorrect Answer:
**My previous answer:** The binding group and the printing group have exactly two members in common.
**Reasoning for the incorrect answer:** I focused on maximizing the number of common members while satisfying the conditions. However, I overlooked the condition that the binding group must have at least 3 members.
**Correct answer:** The number of members of the bookbinding group is at least one more than that of the printing group.
**Reasoning for the correct answer:**
* The printing group has 3 members: G, H, and L.
* To satisfy condition (4), M must be in the binding group.
* To satisfy condition (5), at least one more member from the remaining employees (F, J, K) must be in the binding group.
* Therefore, the binding group has at least 4 members, which is one more than the printing group.
**Action: Answer("D")** 
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
