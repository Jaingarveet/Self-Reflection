## System:
You are an expert in Logic.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Topic: Logic
Context: A provincial Go team coach selects 4 of the 7 players from E, F, G, H, J, K and M to participate in the professional league.The selection must meet the following conditions? E or F has one person to participate, but not both .One of J or K will participate, but not both.If J participates, then G participates.Unless F participates, M does not participate.
Question: Which two of the following players will be selected by the coach to make the four-person team the only choice?
Choices:
  A: F and H
  C: G and M
  B: G and J
  D: H and M
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Carefully read and understand all conditions, including any negations or implications.
2. Break down complex conditions into simpler components.
3. Analyze each choice systematically against all conditions.
4. Double-check your reasoning and interpretation of the conditions.
5. Choose the answer that satisfies all conditions without violating any.
## Assistant 2:
Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly because I did not carefully consider all the conditions. I focused on the first two conditions and did not realize that the third condition implied that G must participate if J participates. This led me to choose the wrong answer.
To avoid making the same mistake again, I will carefully read and understand all conditions, including any negations or implications. I will also break down complex conditions into simpler components and analyze each choice systematically against all conditions. Finally, I will double-check my reasoning and interpretation of the conditions before choosing an answer.
Now, let's analyze the choices:
A: F and H: This choice violates the first condition because both F and H are selected.
B: G and J: This choice satisfies all conditions. If J participates, then G must participate according to the third condition. Also, the first and second conditions are satisfied because only one of J or K participates and only one of E or F participates (in this case, J).
C: G and M: This choice violates the fourth condition because F does not participate and M participates.
D: H and M: This choice violates the first condition because both E and M are selected.
Therefore, the only choice that satisfies all conditions is B: G and J.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
