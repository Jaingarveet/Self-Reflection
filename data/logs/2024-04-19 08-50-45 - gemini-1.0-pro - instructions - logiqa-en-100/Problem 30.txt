## System:
You are an expert in Logic.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Carefully read and understand the rules and their scope of application.
2. Identify the key information and constraints.
3. Analyze the choices systematically, considering all rules and constraints.
4. Eliminate choices that violate any rule or constraint.
5. Choose the answer that satisfies all rules and constraints.
## Assistant 2:
Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly because I did not consider all the rules and constraints. I only considered the first two rules, but I did not consider the third rule that a maximum of 2 people are selected. This led me to choose the wrong answer.
To answer this question correctly, I need to consider all the rules and constraints. The first rule states that at least one person of Bingding is selected. The second rule states that if E is selected, then A and B are also selected. The third rule states that a maximum of 2 people are selected.
Considering all the rules and constraints, I can eliminate choices A, B, and C. Choice A is not possible because it violates the third rule. Choice B is not possible because it violates the second rule. Choice C is not possible because it violates the first rule.
Therefore, the only possible answer is D: Ding.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
