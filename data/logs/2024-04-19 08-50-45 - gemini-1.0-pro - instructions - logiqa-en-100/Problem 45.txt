Topic: Logic
Context: The Amendment (Draft) of China's Personal Income Tax Law raises the deduction standard for salary income from the original 800 yuan / month to 1500 yuan / month; when the person's monthly income is less than 1500 yuan, no tax is required; After taxing the income after 1,500 yuan, an official commented that the starting point for personal income tax should not be too high, because taxation is also a citizen's right.If the starting point is too high, it will deprive low-income earners the honor of being the most taxpayers.
Question: Which of the following is true and can raise the most doubts about this official â€™s argument?
Choices:
  A: All countries in the world levy pre-tax deductions on residents' basic living expenses when collecting personal income tax to ensure the reproduction of social labor.

  D: China's tax system is dominated by commodity taxes.As long as a person buys and consumes commodities, he pays taxes to the state.

## Self-Reflection
**Previous Incorrect Answer:** C
**Reasoning for Incorrect Answer:** I incorrectly focused on the function of personal income tax to regulate social distribution and narrow the gap between rich and poor, without considering the broader context of the official's argument.
**Correct Answer:** A
**Reasoning for Correct Answer:** The official argues that raising the tax-free threshold deprives low-income earners of the "honor" of being taxpayers. Option A directly challenges this argument by highlighting the global practice of pre-tax deductions for basic living expenses, which ensures social labor reproduction and implicitly acknowledges the right of low-income earners to not contribute directly to tax revenue.
**Key Takeaways:**
* Pay close attention to the specific context and arguments presented in the question.
* Consider broader implications and global practices relevant to the topic.
* Avoid focusing on isolated aspects without considering the overall picture.
**Action:** Answer("A")
