Self-reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly because I did not pay enough attention to the keyword "adjacent to". I assumed that Fuyi Station was not adjacent to Haoyun Station, which led me to the wrong conclusion.
Thought:
1. Jiushang Station is adjacent to Haoyun Station and east of Haoyun Station.
2. Fuyi Station is east of Haoyun Station and West of Huyao Station, and is adjacent to Huyao Station.
3. Jiushang Station is not adjacent to Fuyi Station.
4. Therefore, Jiushang Station must be east of Fuyi Station.
