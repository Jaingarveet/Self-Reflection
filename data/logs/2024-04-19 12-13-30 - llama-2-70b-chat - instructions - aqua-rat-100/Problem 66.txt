## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Topic: Math
Question: A club consists of members whose ages are in A.P. The common difference being 3 months. If the youngest member of the club is just 7 years old and the sum of the ages of all the members is 250, then the number of members in the club is:

Choices:
  A: 18
  B: 20
  C: 25
  D: 26
  E: 27

Reflection:
In my previous response, I made a mistake by not paying attention to the fact that the ages were in arithmetic progression. I incorrectly chose answer C.

To solve this problem, we know that the youngest member is 7 years old, so the next member's age would be 7 + 3 = 10. The common difference between consecutive terms in an arithmetic progression is 3 months, so the next member's age would be 10 + 3 = 13. We can continue this pattern to find the ages of the remaining members:

10, 13, 16, 19, 22, 25, 28, 31, 34, 37, 40, 43, 46, 49, 52, 55, 58, 61, 64, 67, 70

The sum of these ages is 250, so we can find the number of members by dividing the sum by the common difference:

250 / 3 = 83

Therefore, the number of members in the club is 83.

Action: Answer("E")
## Result:
Agent Answer: E
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
