## Assistant 2:
  Sure, I'll do my best to answer the question.

Step 1: Calculate the numerator correctly.
[5 + ? × 19 - 15 - 7] = 5 + 19 × 4 - 15 - 7 = 5 + 76 - 15 - 7 = 69 - 7 = 62

Step 2: Calculate the denominator correctly.
13 × 13 - 156 = 169 - 156 = 13

Step 3: Simplify the fraction.
62/13 = 5

Comparing the result to the given choices, the correct answer is (C) 5.

Action: Answer("C")
