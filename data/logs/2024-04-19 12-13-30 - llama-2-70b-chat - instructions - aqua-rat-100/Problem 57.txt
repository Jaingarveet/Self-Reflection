Self-Reflection:
Previously, I answered this question incorrectly by [REDACTED].
I realized that I made a mistake in my calculation by [REDACTED].
To solve this problem, I need to use the formula for the distance traveled by a rotating object:
Distance = (2 x pi x radius x revolutions) / 100

In this case, the radius of the fan blade is 10 centimeters, and the fan makes 300 revolutions per minute.
So, the distance traveled by the point on the edge of the fan blade after 30 seconds is:
Distance = (2 x pi x 10 x 300) / 100
Distance = 600pi

Therefore, the correct answer is choice B: 1500pi.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
