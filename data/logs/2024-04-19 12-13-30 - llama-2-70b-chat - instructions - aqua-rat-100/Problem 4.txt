## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:

1. Identify the time interval at which Train [REDACTED] leaves the station.
2. Identify the time interval at which Train [REDACTED] leaves the station.
3. Determine the least common multiple (LCM) of the two time intervals.
4. Calculate the time at which both trains will leave simultaneously again by multiplying the LCM by the number of minutes past the hour.
5. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
## Assistant 2:
  Sure, I'll be happy to help. Here's how I'd approach the problem:

1. The time interval at which Train A leaves the station is 16 minutes.
2. The time interval at which Train B leaves the station is 17 minutes.
3. The least common multiple (LCM) of 16 and 17 is 35.
4. To calculate the time at which both trains will leave simultaneously again, we multiply the LCM by the number of minutes past the hour. Let's assume that the hour starts at 0 minutes. Therefore, the time at which both trains will leave simultaneously again is 35 x 1 = 35 minutes past the hour.
5. The answer that matches our calculated result is E: 35 minutes.

Therefore, the correct answer is E: 35 minutes.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or concerns.
