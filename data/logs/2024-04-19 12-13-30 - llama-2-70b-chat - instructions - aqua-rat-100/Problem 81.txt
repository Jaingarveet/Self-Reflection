Question: One gram of a certain health food contains 9 percent of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E and 8 percent of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A. If vitamins E and A are to be obtained from no other source, how many grams of the health food must be eaten daily to provide at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins?
Choices:
  A: 8.5
  B: 10.5
  C: 12.5
  D: 14.5
  E: 16.5

## Assistant 2:
  My previous answer was incorrect because I made a mistake in my calculations. I misunderstood the problem and solved for the wrong variables.

To solve this problem, we need to let X represent the number of grams of health food that must be eaten daily.

We know that 1 gram of health food contains 9% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E, so we can say that 0.09X represents the amount of vitamin E in grams that is obtained from the health food.

Similarly, we know that 1 gram of health food contains 8% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A, so we can say that 0.08X represents the amount of vitamin A in grams that is obtained from the health food.

The minimum daily requirement of vitamin E is 15 milligrams, so we can say that 0.09X = 15.

The minimum daily requirement of vitamin A is 900 micrograms, so we can say that 0.08X = 900.

Now we have two equations:

0.09X = 15
0.08X = 900

We can solve these equations simultaneously by first dividing both sides of the first equation by 0.09 and then multiplying both sides of the second equation by 0.09:

X = 15/0.09 = 166.67
X = 900/0.09 = 10000

We can see that X = 166.67 and X = 10000 are not compatible solutions, so we have a contradiction.

Therefore, the answer is E: 16.5, which means that 16.5 grams of the health food must be eaten daily to provide at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins E and A.

Action: Answer("E")
