# Model: llama-2-70b-chat | Agent: instructions | Exam: aqua-rat-100 | Problem 73 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:

Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: there are more than 501 students in a school such that 20% of them exactly took physics and 28% of them exactly took math. What could be the least possible no of students in the school?
Choices:
  A: 550
  B: 570
  C: 600
  D: 700
  E: none of these
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:

1. Assumptions should be carefully considered and challenged.
2. Proportions should be treated as such, and not necessarily as integers.
3. Calculations should be performed carefully and accurately.
4. The least common multiple (LCM) should be used to find the least possible value of x.
## Assistant 2:
  My apologies for my previous mistake. Let's analyze the problem again carefully.
We know that 20% of the students took physics, which means that 0.2x = 501, where x is the total number of students in the school.
Similarly, 28% of the students took math, which means that 0.28x = 501.
We can set up a system of linear equations:
0.2x = 501 ... (1)
0.28x = 501 ... (2)
We can solve this system of equations by multiplying (1) by 4 and (2) by 7:
0.8x = 2004 ... (3)
1.4x = 3507 ... (4)
Now, we can solve for x:
x = 2004/0.8 = 2505 ... (5)
x = 3507/1.4 = 2505 ... (6)
From (5) and (6), we can see that x = 2505 is a solution to the system of equations.
Therefore, the least possible number of students in the school is 2505.
Action: Answer("E") None of the above.

The correct answer is 2505, which is not among the given choices. Therefore, the answer is "E: None of the above."
## Result:
Agent Answer: E
Correct Answer: E
Score: 1
