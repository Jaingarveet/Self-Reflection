## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Topic: Geography
Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: Kevin drove from A to B at a constant speed of 70 mph. Once he reached B, he turned right around with pause, and returned to A at a constant speed of 90 mph. Exactly 3 hours before the end of his trip, he was still approaching B, only 70 miles away from it. What is the distance between A and B?
Choices:
  A: 180
  B: 90
  C: 270
  D: 360
  E: None of the above
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Identify the formula for distance traveled:
Distance = Time x Speed
2. Use the formula to calculate the distance traveled to [REDACTED]:
Distance = [REDACTED] - [REDACTED] / 70 x 70
3. Use the formula to calculate the distance traveled back to [REDACTED]:
Distance = [REDACTED] - [REDACTED] / [REDACTED] x [REDACTED]
4. Calculate the total distance traveled:
Total distance = Distance to [REDACTED] + Distance back to A
5. Check your answer against the given choices.

Reflection:
Previously, I answered this question incorrectly by selecting choice A, 180 miles.
Upon reflection, I realized that I made a mistake in my calculations.
I misunderstood the information given in the question and calculated the distance incorrectly.

For the distance traveled to B, I calculated:
Distance = [REDACTED] - [REDACTED] / 70 x 70
Distance = 300 - 70 / 70 x 70
Distance = 300 - 1
Distance = 299

For the distance traveled back to A, I calculated:
Distance = [REDACTED] - [REDACTED] / [REDACTED] x [REDACTED]
Distance = 300 - 70 / 90 x 90
Distance = 300 - 1
Distance = 299

The total distance traveled is:
Total distance = Distance to B + Distance back to A
Total distance = 299 + 299
Total distance = 598

Therefore, the correct answer is choice C, 270 miles.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
