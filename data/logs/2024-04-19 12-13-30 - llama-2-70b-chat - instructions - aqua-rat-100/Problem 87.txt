## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:

1. Identify the total number of items (10 oranges).
2. Identify the number of items to be chosen (2 oranges).
3. Recognize that the order of the items does not matter.
4. Apply the combination formula: C(n, k) = n! / (k! \* (n-k)!)
5. Plug in the values: C(10, 2) = 10! / (2! \* (10-2)!)
6. Simplify the expression: C(10, 2) = [REDACTED]
7. Choose the answer that matches the calculated result: Answer("[REDACTED]")

Reflection:
Previously, I answered this question incorrectly by selecting choice A: 45.
Upon reflection, I realized that I misunderstood the question and applied the wrong formula.
The correct formula for this problem is C(n, k) = n! / (k! \* (n-k)!)
By plugging in the values, we get C(10, 2) = 10! / (2! \* (10-2)!) = [REDACTED].
The correct answer is choice C: 120.

Action: Answer("C")
