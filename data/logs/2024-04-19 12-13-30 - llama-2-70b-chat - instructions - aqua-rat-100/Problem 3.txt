Question: A square piece of cloth is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge to form a rectangular piece, which is then cut diagonally in half to create two triangles. If the area of each of triangle is 70 square feet, what was the perimeter (in feet) of the original piece of square cloth?

  D: 62
  E: 64
Reflection:
Previously, I answered this question incorrectly.
After reflecting on the problem, I realized that I made a mistake in my calculations.
The correct answer is choice B: 58.

Here's my solution:

1. Read the problem carefully and understand the given information:
The problem states that a square piece of cloth is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge to form a rectangular piece. The rectangular piece is then cut diagonally in half to create two triangles. The area of each triangle is given as 70 square feet.
2. Identify the variables involved in the problem:
Let x be the length of the side of the original square cloth.
The perimeter of the original square cloth is 4x.
The area of each triangle is (1/2)x^2.
3. Write down the equations that relate the variables:
The area of each triangle is equal to the area of the original square cloth minus the area of the trimmed rectangle.
The area of the trimmed rectangle is (4 feet) x (x - 4 feet) = 4x - 16 square feet.
Therefore, the equation is:
(1/2)x^2 = 70 + 4x - 16
4. Solve the equations to find the desired answer:
Simplifying the equation, we get:
x^2 = 140
x = ±√140
x = ±12
Since the length of the side of the square cloth is a positive value, we take x = 12.
The perimeter of the original square cloth is 4x = 48 feet.
5. Check your answer to ensure it is reasonable and makes sense in the context of the problem:
The perimeter of the original square cloth is 48 feet, which is a reasonable answer.

Action: Answer("B")
