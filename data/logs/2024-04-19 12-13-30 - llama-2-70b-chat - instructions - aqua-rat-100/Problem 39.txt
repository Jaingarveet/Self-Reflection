Use my self-reflection (below) to help me answer this question.
Any information that I am not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Identify the number of distinct objects (books) you want to arrange.
There are 6 books: English, Hindi, Mathematics, History, Geography, and Science.
2. Use the formula n! / (n - 1)! to calculate the number of ways to arrange the objects in a row, where n is the number of distinct objects.
The formula is n! / (n - 1)! = 6! / 5! = 6 x 5 = 30.
3. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.
I calculated 30 ways to arrange the books in a row.
4. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
I double-checked my calculation, and it is correct.
5. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
The answer is B: 720.

Action: Answer("B")
