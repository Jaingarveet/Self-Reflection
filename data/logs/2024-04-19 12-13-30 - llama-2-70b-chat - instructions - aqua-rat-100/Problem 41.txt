## Assistant 2:
  My previous answer was incorrect because I made a mistake in my calculation. I misunderstood the question and calculated the number of friends who attended the picnic instead of the number of friends who were supposed to attend.

Let's break down the problem:

* The total amount spent on eatables was Rs. 96.
* Four friends did not turn up, so the remaining friends had to contribute Rs. 4 extra each.
* The total number of friends who were supposed to attend the picnic = 4 x 4 = 16 (Let's call this variable "S").
* The number of friends who actually attended the picnic = S - 4 (Since four friends did not turn up).

Now, let's calculate the number of friends who were supposed to attend the picnic:

S = 16

Now, let's calculate the number of friends who actually attended the picnic:

Actual attendance = S - 4
= 16 - 4
= 12

The answer is B: 12.

Action: Answer("B")
