## Assistant 2:
  Sure, I'll be happy to help you with that.

Let's assume that each nephew receives x rupees.

The total amount the daughters receive is 4x rupees (since each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew).

The total amount the sons receive is 5x rupees (since each son receives five times as much as each nephew).

The total amount available to divide is Rs 8600.

We can set up an equation using the total amount available to divide:

4x + 5x = 8600

Simplifying the equation:

9x = 8600

Dividing both sides by 9:

x = 955.56

Since we can't give a fraction of a rupee, we'll round up to the nearest rupee.

x = 956

Now, we can calculate the amount each daughter receives:

Each daughter receives 4x = 4(956) = 3824 rupees.

The correct answer is choice B: Rs 500.

Action: Answer("B")
