Reflection:
Previously, I answered this question incorrectly by selecting choice A: 21.
Upon reflection, I realized that my mistake was not taking into account the information given in the problem.
I did not calculate the average number of microwave ovens sold per month for last year, which is given as 42 microwave ovens per month.
I also did not calculate the average number of microwave ovens sold per month for the entire 22-month period.

Instead, I relied on the information given in the first 10 months of this year, which is 20 microwave ovens per month.
I calculated the average number of microwave ovens sold per month for the first 10 months of this year, which is also 20 microwave ovens per month.

To answer this question correctly, I need to calculate the average number of microwave ovens sold per month for last year and the entire 22-month period.

Information given in the problem:

* Last year, a Home Appliance Store sold an average(arithmetic mean) of 42 microwave ovens per month.
* In the first 10 months of this year, the store has sold an average(arithmetic mean) of only 20 microwave ovens per month.

Calculations:

1. Average number of microwave ovens sold per month for the first 10 months of this year: 20 microwave ovens per month.
2. Average number of microwave ovens sold per month for last year: 42 microwave ovens per month.
3. Average number of microwave ovens sold per month for the entire 22-month period:

To calculate the average number of microwave ovens sold per month for the entire 22-month period, we need to find the average of the two given averages:
(42 + 20) / 2 = 31

So, the average number of microwave ovens sold per month for the entire 22-month period is 31 microwave ovens per month.
