## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Reflection:
Previously, I answered this question incorrectly by choosing choice A, 80°.
Upon reflection, I realized that I misunderstood the problem and made a calculation error.
The correct answer is choice C, 140°.

To solve this problem, we can start by identifying the fact that B bisects minor arc AC.
This means that the measure of minor arc BD is half of the measure of minor arc AC.
We are given that minor arc AC is 160°, so the measure of minor arc BD is 160°/2 = 80°.

Next, we can calculate the measure of minor arc AD by subtracting the measure of minor arc BD from the measure of minor arc AC.
160° - 80° = 80°.

Therefore, the measure of minor arc AD is 80°, which matches choice C.

Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
