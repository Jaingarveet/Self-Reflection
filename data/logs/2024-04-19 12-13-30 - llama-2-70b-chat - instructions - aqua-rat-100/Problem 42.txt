Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:

1. Identify the total width of all the pickets.
2. Calculate the total width with spaces.
3. Calculate the length of the fence.
4. Convert the result from inches to feet.
## Assistant 2:
  My previous answer was choice C: 13x/24.
Upon reflection, I realized that I made a mistake in my calculation.
The total width of all the pickets is 13x/2 inches.
The total width with spaces is 13x/2 - 6 inches.
The length of the fence is 13x/2 - 6 inches / 12 inches per foot = (13x/2 - 6) / 12 feet.
Therefore, the correct answer is choice B: 13x/2 - 6.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: E
