## Assistant 2:
  Thought: 
Let's start by analyzing the given information:
There are 64 boys and 40 girls in the group initially.
The same number of boys and girls join the group during the membership drive.
The ratio of boys to girls in the group is 4:3.
We need to find the total number of members in the group after the membership drive.

Equation:
Let's say the number of boys who joined the group during the membership drive is 4x and the number of girls who joined is 3x.
The total number of boys in the group now is 64 + 4x, and the total number of girls is 40 + 3x.
The ratio of boys to girls in the group remains the same, so we can set up the equation:
(64 + 4x) / (40 + 3x) = 4/3

Simplification:
We can simplify the equation by cross-multiplying:
256 + 4x^2 + 12x - 120 = 0

Solution:
We can factor the quadratic equation:
(4x + 30)(4x - 4) = 0

The solutions are x = -30/4 and x = 4/4.
Since x cannot be negative, the only solution is x = 4/4 = 1.

Value of the variable:
The number of boys who joined the group is 4x = 4(1) = 4.
The number of girls who joined is 3x = 3(1) = 3.

Total number of members:
The total number of members in the group now is 64 + 4 + 40 + 3 = 288.

Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: E
Score: 0
