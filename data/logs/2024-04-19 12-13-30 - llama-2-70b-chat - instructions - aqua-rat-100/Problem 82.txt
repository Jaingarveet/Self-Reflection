## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Reflection:
Previously, I answered this question incorrectly by calculating the time it would take the cow to graze a circular field. However, the question states that the field is rectangular.
Therefore, I need to recalculate the time it will take the cow to graze a rectangular field.

Instructions:
1. Assume you know the field's side length.
The field's side length is not given in the question.
However, we can assume the field's side length to be x feet.
2. Calculate the field's area.
The area of a rectangular field is given by the product of its length and width.
Area = length x width
Area = x feet x x feet
Area = x^2 square feet
3. Calculate the time it will take the cow to graze the whole field.
The cow grazes 10 sq.ft. per day, so it will take approximately:
Time = Area / 10 sq.ft.
Time = x^2 / 10
4. Simplify your calculation by recognizing patterns.
We can simplify the calculation by recognizing that x^2 can be expressed as x times x.
Time = x times x / 10
Time = x^2 / 10
5. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
We can double-check our calculation by plugging in a value for x.
Let's assume x = 100.
Time = 100^2 / 10
Time = 10,000 / 10
Time = 1,000
This means it will take the cow approximately 1,000 days to graze the whole field if it grazes 10 sq.ft. per day.
6. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
The answer that matches our calculated result is:
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
