## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:

1. Identify the formula for finding the average speed for two activities.
2. Apply the formula to the given information.
3. Simplify the result, if possible.
4. Choose the answer that matches the simplified result.
5. Double-check the work to ensure accuracy.
## Assistant 2:
  My previous answer was incorrect because I made a mistake in applying the formula.
The formula for finding the average speed for two activities is:
(distance traveled by the first activity + distance traveled by the second activity) / total time taken

Let's apply the formula to the given information:
Miles run = M
Time taken to run = 4 hours
Miles cycled = N
Time taken to cycle = 4 hours

Total distance traveled = M + N
Total time taken = 4 + 4 = 8 hours

Now, let's simplify the result:
Average speed = (M + N) / 8

I made a mistake in my previous answer by adding 3N instead of just N.
The correct answer is:
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
