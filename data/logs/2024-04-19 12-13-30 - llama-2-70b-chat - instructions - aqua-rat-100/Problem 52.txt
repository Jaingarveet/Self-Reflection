4. Solve for x and y.
5. Find the ratio of zinc and copper in alloy Z.
## Assistant 2:
  My apologies for my previous mistake. Let's try to solve this question again.

Step 1: Identify the amount of zinc and copper in alloys X and Y.
Alloy X: Zinc = 6/15, Copper = 9/15
Alloy Y: Zinc = 7/18, Copper = 11/18

Step 2: Set up a proportion to find the ratio of zinc and copper in alloy Z.
Let x be the ratio of zinc in alloy Z, and y be the ratio of copper in alloy Z.
We know that the total amount of zinc in alloy Z is 40 grams, and the total amount of copper in alloy Z is 60 grams.
So, we can set up the following proportion:

6/15 = (40/100) * x
9/15 = (40/100) * y
7/18 = (60/100) * x
11/18 = (60/100) * y

Step 3: Simplify the proportion by cross-multiplying.
We get the following system of equations:

40x = 60y
40y = 60x

Step 4: Solve for x and y.
We can solve this system of equations by substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution.

We know that 40x = 60y, so we can write:

x = 60y/40

Now, substitute this expression for x into the second equation:

40y = 60(60y/40)

Expand and simplify:

40y = 3600y/40

Now, divide both sides by 3600:

y/40 = 1/9

y = 40/9

Now, substitute this expression for y into the first equation:

40x = 60(40/9)

Expand and simplify:

40x = 2400/9

x = 2400/9

Step 5: Find the ratio of zinc and copper in alloy Z.
We have found that x = 2400/9 and y = 40/9.
So, the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z is:

2400/9 : 40/9

Simplify:

266 : 44

So, the ratio of zinc and copper in alloy Z is 266:44.
