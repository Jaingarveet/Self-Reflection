## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

  D: 22.35%
  E: 32.51%

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly. I misunderstood the problem and calculated the concentration of milk instead of tea. I also made a mistake in my calculations.

Solution:
Let's break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. First, John replaces 15% of the 50% strong milk tea with milk. This reduces the concentration of tea to 50 - 15 = 35%.
2. He replaces 15% of the resultant solution with milk again. Now, the concentration of tea is 35 - 15 = 20%.
3. Finally, he replaces 10% of the resultant solution with more milk. The concentration of tea is now 20 - 10 = 10%.

Therefore, the final concentration of tea John drinks is 10%.
