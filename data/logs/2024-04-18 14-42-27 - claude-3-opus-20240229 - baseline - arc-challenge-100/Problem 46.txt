Question: Which behavior of a dog is the best example of a learned behavior?
Choices:
  A: barking
  B: tail-wagging
  C: digging a hole
  D: coming when called
## Assistant 2:
Thought process:
1. Barking is an innate behavior that dogs do naturally, not a learned behavior.
2. Tail-wagging is also an innate behavior used for communication and expressing emotions.
3. Digging a hole is an instinctive behavior that dogs do for various reasons, such as hiding food or creating a cool resting place.
4. Coming when called is a behavior that dogs learn through training and positive reinforcement. It is not an innate or instinctive behavior.
Therefore, the best example of a learned behavior among the given choices is coming when called.
