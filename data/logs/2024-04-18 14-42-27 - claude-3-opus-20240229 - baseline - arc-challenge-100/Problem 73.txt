## System:
You are an expert in Science.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:

  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Science
Question: Biologists are studying the white-tailed deer population in Ohio. Which question could the biologists most likely answer?
Choices:
  A: How fast does this deer population grow?
  B: What percentage of people enjoy watching deer?
  C: Does this deer population like warmer states?
  D: Should people raise deer as pets?
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. Biologists study living organisms, their behavior, and their interactions with the environment.
2. Population studies in biology typically involve investigating factors like population size, growth rate, distribution, and how the population interacts with its ecosystem.
3. Looking at the choices:
   A. Population growth rate is a key aspect that biologists study in animal populations.
   B. People's opinions on deer watching is not a biological question.
   C. Deer habitat preferences could be studied by biologists, but the question is not well-framed for a population study in a specific state.
   D. Whether deer should be pets is not a question biologists would typically study, as it's more of an opinion or ethics question.
4. Among the given choices, the question that biologists could most likely answer by studying the white-tailed deer population in Ohio is about the population's growth rate.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
