## System:
You are an expert in Science.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")

Topic: Science
Question: Many fertilizers contain organic materials that are helpful to an orchard but have a different effect when rain causes them to run off into a freshwater ecosystem. How does the addition of organic waste from fertilizers most commonly affect freshwater ecosystems?
Choices:
  A: increasing biodiversity
  B: increasing water clarity
  C: decreasing algae blooms
  D: decreasing oxygen levels
## Assistant 2:
To determine how organic waste from fertilizers commonly affects freshwater ecosystems, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. Fertilizers contain nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus, which help plants grow.
2. When it rains, these nutrients can run off into nearby freshwater ecosystems like lakes and rivers.
3. In freshwater, excess nutrients (especially phosphorus) can cause a rapid growth of algae, known as an algal bloom.
4. Large algal blooms can cover the water surface, blocking sunlight from reaching aquatic plants below.
5. When the algae die, they are decomposed by bacteria which consume oxygen in the process.
6. This leads to a depletion of dissolved oxygen in the water, a condition known as hypoxia.
7. Low oxygen levels can stress or kill fish and other aquatic life.
Therefore, the addition of organic waste from fertilizers most commonly decreases oxygen levels in freshwater ecosystems due to the process of eutrophication and subsequent algal blooms.
Action: Answer("D")
