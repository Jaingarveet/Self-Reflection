## System:
You are an expert in Science.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Question: Which of these is true when a piece of wood is completely burned in a fire?
Choices:
  A: The change in the wood is reversible.
  B: The energy in the wood is destroyed.
  C: The change in the wood is physical.
  D: The energy in the wood is transformed.
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. When wood is burned, it undergoes a chemical change. The wood is converted into ash, smoke, and gases like carbon dioxide and water vapor. This change cannot be reversed - you can't turn the ash and gases back into wood.
2. According to the law of conservation of energy, energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed from one form to another. 
3. Burning is a chemical change, not a physical change. A physical change does not alter the chemical composition of a substance, but burning wood does change its chemical composition.
4. The chemical energy stored in the wood is converted to heat and light energy during the burning process. The energy is not destroyed, but transformed.
Therefore, the correct answer is:
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
