## System:
You are an expert in Science.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")

## User 1:
Topic: Geography
Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Science
Question: Which of these has the greatest capacity for storing thermal energy from the Sun?
Choices:
  A: air
  B: land
  C: oceans
  D: plants
## Assistant 2:
To determine which has the greatest capacity for storing thermal energy from the Sun, let's consider each option:
A. Air: Air has a low heat capacity, meaning it does not store much thermal energy.
B. Land: Land (soil and rocks) has a higher heat capacity than air, but not as high as water. It can store some thermal energy, but not as much as oceans.
C. Oceans: Water has a very high heat capacity, which means it can store a large amount of thermal energy. Oceans cover about 71% of the Earth's surface and have a vast volume, giving them an enormous capacity to store heat from the Sun.
D. Plants: While plants absorb sunlight for photosynthesis, they do not have a significant capacity for storing thermal energy compared to oceans, land, or air.
Therefore, the oceans have the greatest capacity for storing thermal energy from the Sun.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
