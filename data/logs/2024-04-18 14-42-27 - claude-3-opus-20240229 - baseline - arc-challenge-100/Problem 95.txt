## System:
You are an expert in Science.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")

The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Science
Question: Many scientists think that burning fossil fuels has increased the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. What effect would the increase of carbon dioxide most likely have on the planet?
Choices:
  A: a cooler climate
  B: a warmer climate
  C: lower relative humidity
  D: more ozone in the atmosphere
## Assistant 2:
To determine the effect of increased carbon dioxide on the planet, let's consider the following:
1. Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, meaning it traps heat in the Earth's atmosphere.
2. As the concentration of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide increases, more heat is trapped in the atmosphere.
3. This trapped heat leads to an overall increase in the Earth's average temperature.
4. A higher average temperature results in a warmer global climate.
Therefore, an increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide due to burning fossil fuels would most likely lead to a warmer climate on Earth.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
