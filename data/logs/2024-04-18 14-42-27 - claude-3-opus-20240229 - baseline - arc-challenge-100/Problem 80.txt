## System:
You are an expert in Science.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: A pan of soup is being heated on an electric stove. A metal spoon is used to occasionally stir the soup. Which of the following is an example of heat being transferred by convection?
Choices:
  A: heating the pan
  B: heating the soup
  C: heating the spoon
  D: heating the stove burner
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. Convection is the transfer of heat by the movement of a fluid (liquid or gas).
2. The pan is being heated by conduction from direct contact with the hot stove burner. This is not convection.
3. The metal spoon is also being heated by conduction when it comes into contact with the hot soup. This is not convection either.
4. The stove burner is heating up due to electrical resistance. This is not convection.
5. The soup, however, is a liquid. As it heats, the hotter, less dense portions of the soup rise, while the cooler, denser portions sink. This creates a circulatory motion that transfers heat throughout the soup. This is convection.
Therefore, the heating of the soup is the example of heat transfer by convection.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
