## System:
You are an expert in Science.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:
Topic: Geography
Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Science
Question: A conducting wire wrapped in plastic protects the user because the plastic
Choices:
  A: keeps the wire cool.
  B: allows heat to move freely.
  C: is a good electrical insulator.
  D: has magnetic properties.
## Assistant 2:
To determine why a conducting wire wrapped in plastic protects the user, let's consider the properties of plastic:
1. Plastic is a poor conductor of heat, so it does not keep the wire cool or allow heat to move freely. This eliminates choices A and B.
2. Plastic does not have inherent magnetic properties, so choice D is incorrect.
3. Plastic is an excellent electrical insulator. It does not allow electric current to pass through it easily. By wrapping the conducting wire in plastic, the user is protected from electric shock because the plastic prevents the user from coming into direct contact with the live wire.
Therefore, the correct answer is C: the plastic is a good electrical insulator, which protects the user from electric shock.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
