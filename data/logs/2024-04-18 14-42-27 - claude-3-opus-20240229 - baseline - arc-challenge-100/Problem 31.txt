## System:
You are an expert in Science.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Science
Question: Which of these statements is most accurate about the Sun?
Choices:
  A: It has an infinite energy supply.
  B: It is near the end of its life cycle.
  C: It is in its infancy in terms of energy consumption.
  D: It has consumed approximately one-half of its expendable energy.
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The Sun is a main-sequence star, which means it is in the stable phase of its life cycle, fusing hydrogen into helium in its core.
2. The Sun has been in this main-sequence phase for about 4.6 billion years.
3. Based on our understanding of stellar evolution, a star with the mass of the Sun will spend approximately 10 billion years in the main sequence phase.
4. Since the Sun is about 4.6 billion years old, it has spent roughly half of its time in the main sequence phase.
5. When the Sun exhausts its hydrogen fuel, it will exit the main sequence and enter later stages of its life cycle.
Therefore, the most accurate statement about the Sun is that it has consumed approximately one-half of its expendable energy.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
