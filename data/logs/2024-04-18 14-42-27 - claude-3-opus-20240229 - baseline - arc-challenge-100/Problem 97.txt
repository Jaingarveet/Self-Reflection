## System:
You are an expert in Science.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: What is the first step of the process in the formation of sedimentary rocks?
Choices:
  A: erosion
  B: deposition
  C: compaction
  D: cementation
## Assistant 2:
To determine the first step in the formation of sedimentary rocks, let's think through the process:
1. Sedimentary rocks are formed from pre-existing rocks or pieces of once-living organisms.
2. These rocks or organic materials are broken down into smaller particles through weathering and erosion.
3. The small particles (sediments) are then transported by water, wind, or ice and deposited in a new location.
4. Over time, the accumulated sediments are compacted by the weight of the overlying materials.
5. Finally, the compacted sediments are cemented together by minerals that precipitate from water passing through the spaces between the sediment grains.
The first step in this process is the breaking down of rocks or organic materials into smaller particles, which is erosion.
Action: Answer("A")
