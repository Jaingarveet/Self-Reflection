Question: What precaution must be taken by students when making observations of the Sun?
Choices:
  A: Use only new equipment.
  B: Use a very strong telescope.
  C: Project image onto a piece of cardboard.
  D: Look at the Sun only in the morning.
## Assistant 2:
To safely observe the Sun, it is essential to avoid looking at it directly, as this can cause serious eye damage. The safest method is to project the Sun's image onto a screen or piece of cardboard.
When using a telescope or binoculars to observe the Sun, a special solar filter must be placed over the front of the instrument to protect the eyes. Never look through a telescope or binoculars at the Sun without a proper solar filter, as the concentrated light can instantly cause permanent blindness.
Projecting the Sun's image onto a piece of cardboard allows for safe, indirect observation. The Sun's light is passed through the telescope or binoculars and onto the cardboard screen, where details such as sunspots can be seen without risk to the eyes.
Therefore, the correct precaution when making observations of the Sun is:
Action: Answer("C")
