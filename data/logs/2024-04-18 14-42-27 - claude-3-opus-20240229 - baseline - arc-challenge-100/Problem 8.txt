Topic: Science
Question: Which type of water reservoir contains the largest volume of fresh water?
Choices:
  A: lakes
  B: rivers
  C: ice sheets
  D: aquifers
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. Lakes contain a significant amount of fresh water, but they are not the largest reservoir.
2. Rivers contain flowing fresh water, but their total volume is relatively small compared to other reservoirs.
3. Ice sheets, including glaciers, store a huge amount of fresh water in the form of ice. The Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets are the largest, holding about 99% of the world's freshwater ice.
4. Aquifers are underground layers of water-bearing permeable rock, rock fractures or unconsolidated materials. While they hold a large volume of water, it is not as much as the ice sheets.
Therefore, the largest volume of fresh water is stored in ice sheets.
Action: Answer("C")
