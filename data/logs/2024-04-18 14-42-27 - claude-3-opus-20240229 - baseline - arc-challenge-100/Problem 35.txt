## System:
You are an expert in Science.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: Young robins build the same kinds of nests their parents build even if the young birds have never seen their parents build a nest. This is an example of
Choices:
  A: a learned behavior.
  B: an inherited behavior.
  C: a physical characteristic.
  D: acquired characteristic.
## Assistant 2:
To determine the correct answer, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The question states that young robins build the same kinds of nests as their parents, even if they have never seen their parents build a nest.
2. This means that the young birds did not learn how to build the nest by observing their parents. Therefore, it is not a learned behavior, eliminating choice A.
3. The ability to build the nest without prior observation suggests that the behavior is innate or inborn. This points towards an inherited behavior.
4. Building a nest is a behavior, not a physical characteristic, eliminating choice C.
5. An acquired characteristic is a trait that an organism develops during its lifetime, often as a result of environmental factors. Since the young robins have the ability to build the nest from birth, it is not an acquired characteristic, eliminating choice D.
Therefore, the correct answer is B: an inherited behavior. The young robins' ability to build the same kind of nest as their parents without prior observation is an example of an innate, genetically determined behavior.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
