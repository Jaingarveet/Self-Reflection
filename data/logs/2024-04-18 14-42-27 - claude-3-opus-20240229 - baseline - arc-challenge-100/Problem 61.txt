## System:
You are an expert in Science.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Science
Question: What would be the best evidence that two substances are made of different types of matter?
Choices:
  A: Two substances have different reactions to light.
  B: Two substances have different temperatures.
  C: Two substances have different volumes.
  D: Two substances have different shapes.
## Assistant 2:
To determine if two substances are made of different types of matter, we need to look at their intrinsic properties. Intrinsic properties are characteristics that do not depend on the amount or shape of the substance.
Analyzing the choices:
A. Reaction to light could be an intrinsic property related to the substance's chemical composition and structure. Different types of matter may interact differently with light.
B. Temperature is an extrinsic property that depends on the environment and the amount of the substance. It does not provide definitive evidence of different types of matter.
C. Volume is an extrinsic property that depends on the amount of the substance. It does not necessarily indicate different types of matter.
D. Shape is an extrinsic property that can be altered without changing the type of matter. Different shapes do not provide evidence of different types of matter.
Among the given choices, the best evidence that two substances are made of different types of matter is their different reactions to light.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
