## System:
You are an expert in Science.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:
Topic: Geography
Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")

Topic: Science
Question: The gravitational force exerted by an object depends on its
Choices:
  A: volume.
  B: weight.
  C: mass.
  D: size.
## Assistant 2:
To determine what the gravitational force exerted by an object depends on, let's think through the choices:
A: Volume - The volume of an object does not directly affect its gravitational force. Objects with the same volume can have different masses and thus exert different gravitational forces.
B: Weight - Weight is a measure of the force of gravity acting on an object. It depends on the object's mass and the strength of the gravitational field it is in. However, the gravitational force an object exerts on other objects depends on its own intrinsic property, not the force acting on it.
C: Mass - According to Newton's law of universal gravitation, the gravitational force between two objects is directly proportional to the product of their masses. The more mass an object has, the greater the gravitational force it exerts.
D: Size - The size or shape of an object does not directly determine its gravitational force. Objects of the same size can have different masses and thus exert different gravitational forces.
Therefore, the gravitational force exerted by an object depends on its mass.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
