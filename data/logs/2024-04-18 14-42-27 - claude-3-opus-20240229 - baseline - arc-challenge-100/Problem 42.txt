## System:
You are an expert in Science.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: When two unequal forces act in opposite directions on a moving object, the object will
Choices:
  A: absorb the forces.
  B: come to an immediate stop.
  C: continue to move in the same direction.
  D: move in the same direction as the larger force.
## Assistant 2:
To determine how an object will move when two unequal forces act on it in opposite directions, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The object is already moving, so it has some initial velocity.
2. Two forces are acting on the object:
   - The forces are unequal in magnitude.
   - The forces are acting in opposite directions.
3. The net force on the object will be the sum of these two forces.
   - Since the forces are in opposite directions, the net force will be in the direction of the larger force.
   - The magnitude of the net force will be the difference between the two forces.
4. According to Newton's First Law, an object will continue moving at a constant velocity unless acted upon by an unbalanced force.
   - In this case, there is an unbalanced force (the net force) acting on the object.
5. According to Newton's Second Law, the acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass.
   - The object will accelerate in the direction of the net force.
Therefore, the object will move in the same direction as the larger force.
