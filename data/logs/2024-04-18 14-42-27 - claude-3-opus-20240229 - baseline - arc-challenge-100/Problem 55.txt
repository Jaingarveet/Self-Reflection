## System:
You are an expert in Science.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: Which statement best describes the motion of water molecules as the water changes state from steam to liquid?
Choices:
  A: The molecules move faster and occupy more space.
  B: The molecules move slower and occupy more space.
  C: The molecules move faster and occupy less space.
  D: The molecules move slower and occupy less space.
## Assistant 2:
To determine how the motion of water molecules changes as steam condenses to liquid water, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. In the gas state (steam), water molecules have high kinetic energy. They move rapidly and are spaced far apart.
2. As steam cools and condenses into liquid water, the molecules lose kinetic energy. This means they move more slowly.
3. When the molecules move more slowly, the attractive forces between them become stronger relative to their motion. This causes the molecules to move closer together.
4. So in the liquid state, the water molecules are closer together, occupying less space than in the gas state.
Therefore, as water changes from steam to liquid, the molecules move slower and occupy less space.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
