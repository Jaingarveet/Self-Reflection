## System:
You are an expert in Science.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Science
Question: Michelle performed an investigation but the results did not match her hypothesis. What should Michelle do next?
Choices:
  A: perform the investigation in a different way
  B: change the hypothesis to match the results
  C: choose a different investigation
  D: repeat the investigation
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. In the scientific method, a hypothesis is a proposed explanation for a phenomenon that can be tested.
2. If the results of an investigation do not match the hypothesis, it means the hypothesis was not supported by the data. This is a normal and important part of the scientific process.
3. When this happens, the scientist should not change the hypothesis to match the results, as that would be dishonest and goes against the principles of scientific inquiry.
4. Similarly, choosing a different investigation altogether would be avoiding the issue rather than addressing it.
5. The best course of action is to repeat the investigation. This allows the scientist to check if the original results were accurate or if there were any errors or anomalies.
6. If repeated investigations continue to produce results that do not match the hypothesis, then the scientist should consider modifying or rejecting the original hypothesis.
Therefore, the best answer is to repeat the investigation.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
