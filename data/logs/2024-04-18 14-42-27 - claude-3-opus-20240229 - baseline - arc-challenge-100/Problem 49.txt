## System:
You are an expert in Science.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:
Topic: Geography
Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Science
Question: The students observed a large crack found in a boulder with a tree growing out of it. Which process were the students observing?
Choices:
  A: oxidizing
  B: deposition
  C: weathering
  D: decomposition
## Assistant 2:
To determine the process the students were observing, let's consider each choice:
A. Oxidizing: This is a chemical reaction where a substance combines with oxygen. It doesn't directly cause cracks in rocks or allow trees to grow out of them.
B. Deposition: This is the process by which sediments, soil, or rocks are added to a landform. It doesn't cause cracks in rocks or enable tree growth in those cracks.
C. Weathering: This is the process where rocks are broken down by the action of physical, chemical, or biological forces. Over time, weathering can cause cracks in rocks. If soil accumulates in these cracks, it can support the growth of vegetation like trees.
D. Decomposition: This is the process by which organic matter is broken down into simpler forms of matter. It doesn't typically involve inorganic materials like rocks.
The best answer is C, weathering. The crack in the boulder was likely caused by physical weathering processes like freeze-thaw cycles or biological weathering from plant roots. The tree growing out of the crack suggests that soil has accumulated there due to the weathering, allowing the tree to take root.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
