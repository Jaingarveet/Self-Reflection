## System:
You are an expert in Science.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.

The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Science
Question: When moist air comes in contact with a cold surface in the winter, one result can be frost. What has happened to the water vapor in the air to cause frost?
Choices:
  A: It has melted.
  B: It has sublimated.
  C: It has evaporated.
  D: It has condensed.
## Assistant 2:
To determine what has happened to the water vapor to cause frost, let's think through the process step-by-step:
1. Frost forms when moist air comes in contact with a cold surface.
2. The cold surface cools the air near it, causing the water vapor in the air to change state.
3. The water vapor changes directly from a gas to a solid state, skipping the liquid state.
4. This process is called deposition or sublimation.
5. Sublimation is the transition of a substance directly from the solid to the gas state, without passing through the liquid state. In this case, it's the reverse process, from gas to solid.
Therefore, the water vapor has sublimated to cause frost.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
