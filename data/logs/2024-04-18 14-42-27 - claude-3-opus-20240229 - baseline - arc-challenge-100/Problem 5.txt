Question: Ten grams of sugar is dissolved in 100 grams (g) of water. How many grams is the sugar-and-water solution?
Choices:
  A: 90 g
  B: 100 g
  C: 110 g
  D: 1000 g
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. We have 10 grams of sugar.
2. This sugar is dissolved in 100 grams of water.
3. When the sugar is dissolved, it becomes part of the solution. It doesn't disappear or evaporate.
4. So, the total mass of the solution is the sum of the mass of sugar and the mass of water.
5. Total mass = Mass of sugar + Mass of water
              = 10 g + 100 g
              = 110 g
Therefore, the sugar-and-water solution has a mass of 110 grams.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
