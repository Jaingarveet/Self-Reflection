Question: Sheep Challenge Evolution A species of sheep lives on the Scottish island of Hirta. Hirta has plenty of grass for the sheep to eat, and no natural predators of the sheep live on the island. Some sheep have dark wool, and some have light wool. The sheep with dark wool tend to be much larger and stronger than the sheep with light wool. However, researchers have found that in the last 20 years, the sheep with light wool have increased in number. Usually, strength and size help animals survive and breed. A new sheep predator is introduced to the island. Which change to the sheep population will most likely occur first?
Choices:
  A: a decrease in the population of sheep with dark wool
  B: a decrease in the population of sheep with light wool
  C: an increase in the population of sheep with dark wool
  D: an increase in the population of sheep with light wool
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The sheep with dark wool are larger and stronger than the sheep with light wool. In most cases, these traits would give the dark-wooled sheep a survival advantage.
2. However, over the past 20 years, the light-wooled sheep population has increased, even though there were no predators on the island. This suggests that some other factor is favoring the light-wooled sheep.
3. Now, a new predator has been introduced to the island. Predators typically prey on the weaker, more vulnerable members of a population.
4. Since the light-wooled sheep are smaller and weaker, they are more likely to be targeted by the new predator.
5. Therefore, the first change we would expect to see in the sheep population is a decrease in the number of light-wooled sheep, as they fall prey to the new predator.
Action: Answer("B")
