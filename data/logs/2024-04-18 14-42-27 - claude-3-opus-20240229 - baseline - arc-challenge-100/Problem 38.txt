## System:
You are an expert in Science.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: Red-clay bricks have a density of approximately 2000 kg/m^3. Air has a density of 1 kg/m^3. Which of the following has the lowest mass?
Choices:
  A: 2 m^3 of bricks
  B: 4 m^3 of bricks
  C: 6000 m^3 of air
  D: 10,000 m^3 of air
## Assistant 2:
To find the lowest mass, we need to calculate the mass for each choice using the formula:
mass = density × volume
A: 2 m^3 of bricks
density = 2000 kg/m^3, volume = 2 m^3
mass = 2000 kg/m^3 × 2 m^3 = 4000 kg
B: 4 m^3 of bricks
density = 2000 kg/m^3, volume = 4 m^3
mass = 2000 kg/m^3 × 4 m^3 = 8000 kg
C: 6000 m^3 of air
density = 1 kg/m^3, volume = 6000 m^3
mass = 1 kg/m^3 × 6000 m^3 = 6000 kg
D: 10,000 m^3 of air
density = 1 kg/m^3, volume = 10,000 m^3
mass = 1 kg/m^3 × 10,000 m^3 = 10,000 kg
The lowest mass is 6000 kg, which corresponds to choice C: 6000 m^3 of air.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
