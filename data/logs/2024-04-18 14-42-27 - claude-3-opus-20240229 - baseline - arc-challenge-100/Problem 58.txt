Question: A son can inherit traits
Choices:
  A: only from his father
  B: only from his mother
  C: from both his father and his mother
  D: from either his father or his mother, but not from both
## Assistant 2:
To determine the correct answer, let's consider how genetic inheritance works:
1. A person inherits genetic traits from both their biological parents.
2. The father contributes genetic material through sperm cells, while the mother contributes genetic material through egg cells.
3. During fertilization, the sperm and egg combine, resulting in a unique combination of genetic material from both parents.
4. This means that a child, regardless of their sex, inherits traits from both their father and mother.
Therefore, the correct answer is that a son can inherit traits from both his father and his mother.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
