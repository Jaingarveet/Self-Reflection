Question: Which results in a chemical change?
Choices:
  A: A student smells a flower.
  B: A teacher lights a candle.
  C: A student colors a paper blue.
  D: A teacher feels a rough cloth.
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. A chemical change involves a substance changing into a new substance with different properties. It's usually irreversible.
2. Smelling a flower does not change the flower into a new substance. This is not a chemical change.
3. Lighting a candle involves burning the wax, which changes it into new substances (carbon dioxide and water vapor). This is a chemical change.
4. Coloring a paper blue is just adding a layer of color on top. The paper itself doesn't change into a new substance. This is not a chemical change.
5. Feeling a rough cloth does not change the cloth into a new substance. This is not a chemical change.
Therefore, the answer that results in a chemical change is lighting a candle.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
