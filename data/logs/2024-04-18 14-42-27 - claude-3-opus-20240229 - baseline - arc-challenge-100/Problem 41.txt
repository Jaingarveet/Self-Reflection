## System:
You are an expert in Science.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:

## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Science
Question: A signal from the brain to a muscle in the arm is transmitted by which structures?
Choices:
  A: sensory neurons
  B: interneurons
  C: motor neurons
  D: mechanoreceptor neurons
## Assistant 2:
To determine which structures transmit a signal from the brain to a muscle in the arm, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The signal originates in the brain, which is part of the central nervous system.
2. To reach the arm muscle, the signal needs to be transmitted through the peripheral nervous system.
3. Sensory neurons carry signals from sensory receptors to the central nervous system, so they are not involved in transmitting signals from the brain to muscles.
4. Interneurons are found within the central nervous system and relay signals between sensory neurons and motor neurons. They are not directly involved in transmitting signals to muscles.
5. Motor neurons carry signals from the central nervous system to muscles and glands. They are the key structures that transmit signals from the brain to the arm muscle.
6. Mechanoreceptor neurons are sensory neurons that respond to mechanical stimuli like touch, pressure, and stretching. They are not involved in transmitting signals from the brain to muscles.
Therefore, the structures that transmit a signal from the brain to a muscle in the arm are motor neurons.
Action: Answer("C")
