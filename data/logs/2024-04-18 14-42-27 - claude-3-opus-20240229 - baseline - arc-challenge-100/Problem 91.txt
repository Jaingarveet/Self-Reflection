## System:
You are an expert in Science.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: Sea-floor spreading occurs at divergent boundaries. Which statement best identifies the geologic process taking place at the point where sea-floor spreading occurs?
Choices:
  A: a trench is forming
  B: new crust is forming
  C: oceanic crust is subducting
  D: a continental plate is subducting
## Assistant 2:
To determine the geologic process occurring at the point of sea-floor spreading, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. Sea-floor spreading occurs at divergent boundaries, where tectonic plates are moving away from each other.
2. As the plates move apart, it creates a gap or a rift in the oceanic crust.
3. Magma from the Earth's mantle rises up to fill this gap.
4. As the magma cools and solidifies, it forms new oceanic crust.
5. Trenches form at convergent boundaries, not at divergent boundaries where sea-floor spreading occurs.
6. Subduction of oceanic crust or continental plates also occurs at convergent boundaries, not at divergent boundaries.
Therefore, the correct answer is that at the point where sea-floor spreading occurs, new crust is forming.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
