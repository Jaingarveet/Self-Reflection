## System:
You are an expert in Science.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

## User 2:
Topic: Science
Question: A ship leaks a large amount of oil near a coastal area. Which statement describes how the oil most likely will affect the coastal habitat?
Choices:
  A: Fish reproduction rates will increase.
  B: Water birds will be unable to use their wings.
  C: Water plants will be exposed to more sunlight.
  D: Coastal plants will have access to more nutrients.
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. Oil spills can have severe effects on coastal habitats.
2. When oil coats the feathers of water birds, it disrupts their insulation and waterproofing properties. This makes it difficult for them to fly, swim, and maintain their body temperature, often leading to hypothermia and drowning.
3. Oil can block sunlight from reaching underwater plants, hindering photosynthesis and growth.
4. Oil is toxic and can kill fish, plants, and other marine life. It does not provide nutrients to coastal plants.
5. Oil spills do not increase fish reproduction rates; in fact, they can harm fish populations.
Therefore, the statement that best describes how the oil will most likely affect the coastal habitat is:
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
