## System:
You are an expert in Science.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: As part of an experiment, an astronaut takes a scale to the Moon and weighs himself. The scale reads 31 pounds. If the astronaut has a mass of about 84 kilograms, which are the approximate weight and mass of the astronaut when standing on the Earth?
Choices:
  A: 31 pounds and 14 kilograms
  B: 31 pounds and 84 kilograms
  C: 186 pounds and 14 kilograms
  D: 186 pounds and 84 kilograms
## Assistant 2:
To determine the astronaut's weight and mass on Earth, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The astronaut's mass is about 84 kilograms. Mass remains constant regardless of location, so the astronaut's mass on Earth is also 84 kilograms.
2. The astronaut's weight on the Moon is 31 pounds. The Moon's gravity is about 1/6 that of Earth's.
3. To find the astronaut's weight on Earth, we can set up a proportion:
   - Moon weight / Moon gravity = Earth weight / Earth gravity
   - 31 lbs / (1/6) = Earth weight / 1
   - 31 lbs Ã— 6 = Earth weight
   - Earth weight = 186 lbs
Therefore, the astronaut's approximate weight and mass on Earth are 186 pounds and 84 kilograms, respectively.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
