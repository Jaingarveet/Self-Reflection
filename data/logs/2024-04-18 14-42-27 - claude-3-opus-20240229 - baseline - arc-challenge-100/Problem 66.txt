## System:
You are an expert in Science.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:
Topic: Geography
Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Science
Question: Which of these is a composite material?
Choices:
  A: a glass window
  B: a bronze statue
  C: an aluminum can
  D: a fiberglass bumper
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. A composite material is made from two or more constituent materials with significantly different physical or chemical properties that, when combined, produce a material with characteristics different from the individual components.
2. Glass is made from sand, soda ash, and limestone, but these ingredients chemically react to form a single substance (glass). So a glass window is not a composite.
3. Bronze is an alloy of copper and tin. Alloys are homogeneous mixtures, not composites. So a bronze statue is not a composite.
4. Aluminum cans are made from a single material, aluminum. So an aluminum can is not a composite.
5. Fiberglass is made by reinforcing a plastic matrix with glass fibers. The plastic and glass fibers are distinct components that together provide properties different from either material alone. This is the definition of a composite material.
Therefore, the answer is:
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
