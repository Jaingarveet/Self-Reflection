Choices:
  A: They were once fossils.
  B: They were formed in prehistoric times.
  C: They are used to heat our homes and businesses.
  D: They formed from the remains of prehistoric plants and animals.
## Assistant 2:
To determine why coal, oil, and natural gas are called fossil fuels, let's consider each choice:
A: They were once fossils. - This is not accurate. Fossil fuels are not actual fossils.
B: They were formed in prehistoric times. - While this is true, it doesn't fully explain why they are called "fossil" fuels.
C: They are used to heat our homes and businesses. - This describes a use for fossil fuels but doesn't explain their name.
D: They formed from the remains of prehistoric plants and animals. - This is the most accurate answer. Coal, oil, and natural gas are called fossil fuels because they were formed from the buried remains of plants and animals that lived millions of years ago. Over time, heat and pressure transformed these remains into the combustible materials we now use as fuel.
