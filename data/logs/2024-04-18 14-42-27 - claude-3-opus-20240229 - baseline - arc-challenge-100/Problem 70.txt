## System:
You are an expert in Science.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:
Topic: Geography
Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Science
Question: Which statement best describes a liquid sample?
Choices:
  A: It will retain its volume if transferred to a larger container.
  B: It keeps its shape when transferred to a larger container.
  C: Its volume can be greatly reduced by adding pressure.
  D: Its shape can be changed by increasing its temperature.
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1) A liquid will flow and take the shape of its container. This eliminates choices B and D, as a liquid's shape will change when transferred to a different container or when heated.
2) A liquid is not easily compressible - its volume does not change much under pressure. This eliminates choice C.
3) The remaining choice, A, correctly describes a key property of liquids - they maintain a constant volume regardless of the shape or size of their container. The molecules in a liquid are close together but can move around each other, allowing the liquid to flow while maintaining its volume.
Therefore, the statement that best describes a liquid sample is:
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
