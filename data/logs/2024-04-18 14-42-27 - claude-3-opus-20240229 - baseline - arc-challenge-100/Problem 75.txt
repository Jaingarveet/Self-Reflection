## User 2:
Topic: Science
Question: A fox gave birth to an offspring that had a better sense of hearing than most foxes. How could this small change most likely result in descendants that are different from the original fox?
Choices:
  A: Foxes that have a better sense of hearing may mutate more frequently than other foxes.
  B: Foxes that have a better sense of hearing may be hunted more frequently.
  C: Over time, descendants of this fox may hear and hunt prey better than other foxes.
  D: Over time, descendants of this fox may become extinct.
## Assistant 2:
Thought process:
1. The offspring fox has a better sense of hearing than most foxes. This is a beneficial trait.
2. Foxes with better hearing may be more successful at hunting prey and avoiding predators.
3. Successful foxes are more likely to survive and reproduce, passing on their genes to the next generation.
4. Over many generations, the beneficial trait (better hearing) may become more common in the population due to natural selection.
5. As a result, descendants of the original fox with better hearing may have an advantage over other foxes in hearing and hunting prey.
Action: Answer("C")
