## System:
You are an expert in Science.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:
Topic: Geography
Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Science
Question: Which of these is never found in prokaryotic cells?
Choices:
  A: cell membrane
  B: ribosome
  C: cell wall
  D: nucleus
## Assistant 2:
To determine which structure is never found in prokaryotic cells, let's consider each choice:
A: Cell membrane - Prokaryotic cells do have a cell membrane that surrounds the cell. It is not the correct answer.
B: Ribosome - Prokaryotic cells contain ribosomes for protein synthesis. It is not the correct answer.
C: Cell wall - Many prokaryotic cells have a cell wall outside the cell membrane for protection and structural support. It is not the correct answer.
D: Nucleus - Prokaryotic cells do not have a membrane-bound nucleus. Their genetic material (DNA) is located in the cytoplasm in a region called the nucleoid. The absence of a true nucleus is a defining characteristic of prokaryotic cells.
Therefore, the structure that is never found in prokaryotic cells is the nucleus.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
