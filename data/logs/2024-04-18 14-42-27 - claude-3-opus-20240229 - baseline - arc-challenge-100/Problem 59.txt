## System:
You are an expert in Science.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Science
Question: Which process in plants is most similar to sexual reproduction in vertebrates?
Choices:
  A: cell division
  B: self-pollination
  C: cross-pollination
  D: seed development
## Assistant 2:
To determine which process in plants is most similar to sexual reproduction in vertebrates, let's consider each choice:
A: Cell division occurs in both plants and animals, but it is not specific to sexual reproduction. It is a more general process.
B: Self-pollination involves the transfer of pollen from the anther to the stigma of the same flower or another flower on the same plant. This is more similar to asexual reproduction, as it does not involve the combination of genetic material from two different individuals.
C: Cross-pollination is the transfer of pollen from the anther of one plant to the stigma of a flower on another plant. This process involves the combination of genetic material from two different individuals, which is the key characteristic of sexual reproduction in vertebrates.
D: Seed development occurs after fertilization, which is a result of sexual reproduction in plants. However, the process itself is not directly comparable to sexual reproduction in vertebrates.
Therefore, the process in plants that is most similar to sexual reproduction in vertebrates is cross-pollination.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
