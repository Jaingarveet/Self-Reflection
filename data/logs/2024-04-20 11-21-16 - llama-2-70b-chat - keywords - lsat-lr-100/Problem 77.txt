Context: Counselor: Many people assume that personal conflicts are inevitable, but that assumption is just not so. Personal conflicts arise primarily because people are being irrational. For instance, people often find it easier to ascribe bad qualities to a person than good ones-even when there is more evidence of the latter. If someone suspects that a friend is unreliable, for example, a single instance may turn this suspicion into a feeling of certainty, whereas a belief that someone is reliable is normally built up only after many years of personal interaction.

  D: Personal conflicts are not inevitable.
  E: Unlike a suspicion that a friend is unreliable, a belief that someone is reliable is normally built up only after many years of personal interaction.

## Assistant 2:
  I apologize for my mistake in the previous response. I'll make sure to follow the instructions correctly this time.

Action: Answer("D")

The main conclusion drawn in the argument is that personal conflicts are not inevitable, as stated in choice D. The counselor argues that people often assume that personal conflicts are inevitable, but that assumption is not necessarily true. The counselor also explains that people tend to ascribe bad qualities to others more easily than good qualities, which can lead to personal conflicts. Therefore, choice D accurately expresses the main conclusion of the argument.

In choice A, the statement "Many people assume that personal conflicts are inevitable" is mentioned, but it is not the main conclusion of the argument.

In choice B, the statement "Even when there is more evidence of good qualities than of bad ones, people find it easier to ascribe bad qualities than good ones" is a supporting detail for the argument, but it is not the main conclusion.

In choice C, the statement "It is irrational to allow a single instance to turn one's suspicion that a friend is unreliable into a feeling of certainty" is a specific example used to support the argument, but it is not the main conclusion.

In choice E, the statement "Unlike a suspicion that a friend is unreliable, a belief that someone is reliable is normally built up only after many years of personal interaction" is a supporting detail for the argument, but it is not the main conclusion.

Therefore, the correct answer is choice D, "Personal conflicts are not inevitable."
