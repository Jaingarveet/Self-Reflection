Context: City dog licensing records show that more cocker spaniels are registered to addresses in the Flynn Heights neighborhood than to addresses in all other neighborhoods combined. So if an animal control officer finds a stray cocker spaniel anywhere near Flynn Heights, it is likely that the dog belongs to someone in Flynn Heights.

  B: whether there are more cocker spaniels registered to addresses in Flynn Heights than any other breed of dog
  C: whether the city's animal control officers find more stray dogs in and around Flynn Heights than in any other part of the city

  Sure, I'd be happy to help!

After reflecting on the problem, I realize that my previous answer was incorrect because I misunderstood the question. I thought the question was asking about the likelihood of a stray cocker spaniel belonging to someone in Flynn Heights, but the question is actually asking about what would be most useful to know in order to evaluate the argument.

The correct answer is (B) whether there are more cocker spaniels registered to addresses in Flynn Heights than any other breed of dog. This information would be useful in evaluating the argument because it would help to establish whether the high number of cocker spaniels in Flynn Heights is due to a general popularity of the breed in that neighborhood or due to some other factor. If there are indeed more cocker spaniels registered to addresses in Flynn Heights than any other breed, it would support the argument that the stray cocker spaniel is likely to belong to someone in Flynn Heights.

The other options are not as useful in evaluating the argument. Option (A) is not relevant because it does not address the specific situation in Flynn Heights. Option (C) is also not relevant because it does not provide information about the breed of dog that the stray dog is likely to be. Option (D) is not useful because it does not provide information about the number of dogs owned by residents of Flynn Heights. Option (E) is also not useful because it does not provide information about the likelihood of residents of Flynn Heights licensing their dogs.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) whether there are more cocker spaniels registered to addresses in Flynn Heights than any other breed of dog.
