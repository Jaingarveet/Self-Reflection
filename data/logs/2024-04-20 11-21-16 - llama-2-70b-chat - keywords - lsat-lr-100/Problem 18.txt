Context: Game show winners choosing between two equally desirable prizes will choose either the one that is more expensive or the one with which they are more familiar. Today's winner, Ed, is choosing between two equally desirable and equally unfamiliar prizes, A and B. He will thus choose A, which is more expensive.
Question: The reasoning in which one of the following is most similar to the reasoning above?
Choices:
  A: With a book contract, an academic writer receives either an advance or a guarantee of royalties. Professor al-Sofi received an advance for a book contract, so al-Sofi did not receive a guarantee of royalties.
  B: When entering this amusement park, children always choose to take their first ride on either the Rocket or the Mouse. Janine insisted on the Rocket for her first ride. Thus, Janine would not have been standing near the Mouse during her first half hour in the amusement park.
  C: The elliptical orbit of an asteroid is only slightly eccentric unless it is affected by the gravitational pull of a planet. Asteroid Y is affected by Jupiter's gravitational pull and asteroid X is not. Thus, the orbit of asteroid Y is the more eccentric of the two.
  D: New students in this program must choose either a physics class or an art class. Miyoko has no desire to take a class in either of those fields, so Miyoko will probably not enter this program.
  E: To avoid predators, rabbits will either double back on their pursuers or flee for nearby cover. The rabbit being pursued by a fox in this wildlife film is in a field that offers no opportunity for nearby cover, so it will try to double back on the fox.

## Assistant 2:
  My previous answer was incorrect because I mistakenly chose option A, which is not similar to the reasoning in the passage.

The passage describes a situation where a winner, Ed, chooses between two equally desirable and equally unfamiliar prizes, A and B. He chooses A, which is more expensive. The reasoning is that when faced with two equally desirable options, people tend to choose the one that is more expensive or the one with which they are more familiar.

Option A does not follow this reasoning. It states that Professor al-Sofi received an advance for a book contract, so al-Sofi did not receive a guarantee of royalties. This does not involve choosing between two equally desirable options, and the choice made does not depend on the cost or familiarity of the options.

Option B is the best answer. It describes a situation where children choose between two rides, the Rocket or the Mouse, and states that Janine chose the Rocket. From this, we can infer that Janine did not choose the Mouse. This follows the same reasoning as the passage, where Ed chooses A because it is more expensive than B. In option B, Janine chooses the Rocket because it is more desirable or familiar to her than the Mouse.

Therefore, the correct answer is B.
