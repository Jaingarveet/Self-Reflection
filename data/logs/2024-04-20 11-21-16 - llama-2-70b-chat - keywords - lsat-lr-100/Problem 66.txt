Topic: Law
Context: Lawyer: Juries are traditionally given their instructions in convoluted, legalistic language. The verbiage is intended to make the instructions more precise, but greater precision is of little use if most jurors have difficulty understanding the instructions. Since it is more important for jurors to have a basic but adequate understanding of their role than it is for the details of that role to be precisely specified, jury instructions should be formulated in simple, easily comprehensible language.
Question: Each of the following, if true, strengthens the lawyer's argumoot EXCEPT:
Choices:
  A: Most jurors are less likely to understand instructions given in convoluted, legalistic language than instructions given in simple, easily comprehensible language.
  B: Most jurors do not have an adequate understanding of their role after being given jury instructions in convoluted, legalistic language.
  C: Jury instructions formulated in simple, easily comprehensible language can adequately descrthe the role of the jurors.
  D: The details of the role of the jurors cannot be specified with complete precision in simple, easily comprehensible language.
  E: Jurors do not need to know the precise details of their role in order to have an adequate understanding of that role.

## Assistant 2:
  Action: Answer("E")

I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I realize now that my mistake was due to a misunderstanding of the question. I was focusing on the importance of precision in jury instructions, but the question actually asks which answer choice strengthens the lawyer's argument.

The correct answer is E: Jurors do not need to know the precise details of their role in order to have an adequate understanding of that role. This answer choice strengthens the lawyer's argument by acknowledging that the main goal of jury instructions is to provide jurors with a basic but adequate understanding of their role, rather than to specify every detail of that role with complete precision.

The other answer choices do not strengthen the lawyer's argument. Choice A states that jurors are less likely to understand instructions given in convoluted language, which supports the lawyer's argument, but it does not directly address the issue of whether jurors need to know the precise details of their role. Choice B states that most jurors do not have an adequate understanding of their role after being given jury instructions in convoluted language, which also supports the lawyer's argument, but it does not address the issue of whether jurors need to know the precise details of their role. Choice C states that jury instructions formulated in simple language can adequately describe the role of the jurors, which is true, but it does not address the issue of whether jurors need to know the precise details of their role. Choice D states that the details of the role of the jurors cannot be specified with complete precision in simple language, which is true, but it does not directly address the issue of whether jurors need to know the precise details of their role.

Therefore, the correct answer is E: Jurors do not need to know the precise details of their role in order to have an adequate understanding of that role.
