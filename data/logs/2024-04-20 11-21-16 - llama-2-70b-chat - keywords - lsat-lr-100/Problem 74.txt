Context: Traditional "talk" therapy, in which a patient with a psychological disorder discusses it with a trained therapist, produces chemical changes in the brain. These changes seem to correspond to improvements in certain aspects of the patient's behavior. Thus, physicians will eventually be able to treat such patients as effectively through pharmacological intervention in the brain's neurochemistry as through the lengthy intermediary of traditional "talk" methods.
Question: Which one of the following is an assumption on which the argumoot depends?
Choices:
  A: All neurochemical changes produce corresponding psychological changes.
  B: improvements in a patient's behavior produced by "talk" therapy occur only through chemical changes in the brain's neurochemistry.
  C: Talk therapy has not been effective at bringing about psychological change.
  D: If chemical changes in the brain's neurochemistry correspond to improvemeots in patient behavior, then psychology and neuroscience will eventually be indistinguishable.
  E: Direct intervention in the brain's neurochemistry is likely to become a less expensive way of treating psychological disorders than is "talk" therapy.

## Assistant 2:
  Sure, I'll do my best to answer the question based on the given information and my previous reflection.

The correct answer is (B) improvements in a patient's behavior produced by "talk" therapy occur only through chemical changes in the brain's neurochemistry.

My previous reflection on this question was:

"I incorrectly answered this question because I misunderstood the scope of the argument. I thought the argument was claiming that talk therapy was ineffective, when in fact it is saying that talk therapy produces chemical changes in the brain that correspond to improvements in behavior. I also misunderstood the assumption being made, which is that improvements in behavior produced by talk therapy occur only through chemical changes in the brain's neurochemistry. I mistakenly thought the assumption was that all neurochemical changes produce corresponding psychological changes."

Based on my previous reflection, I realize that I need to focus on the specific assumption being made in the argument, which is that improvements in behavior produced by talk therapy occur only through chemical changes in the brain's neurochemistry. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) improvements in a patient's behavior produced by "talk" therapy occur only through chemical changes in the brain's neurochemistry.

I hope this answer is correct. Please let me know if there is any further information or clarification needed.
