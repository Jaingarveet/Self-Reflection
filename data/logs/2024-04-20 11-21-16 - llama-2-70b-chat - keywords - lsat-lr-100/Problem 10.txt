## Assistant 2:
  I apologize for my previous mistake. Upon reflection, I realize that my initial answer was incorrect because I misunderstood the context of the question. I mistakenly thought that Tom's use of Mary's bicycle was relevant to the question, when in fact, it was not.

The correct answer is C: If people have used your property without your permission, it is not wrong for you to use their property without their permission.

This answer choice aligns with Mike's reasoning that it would not be wrong for him to use Tom's computer even though Tom did not give him permission, because Tom had used Mary's bicycle without her permission. Mike is attempting to justify his actions by claiming that he is simply following the principle of treating others as they have treated him.

Therefore, option C is the best answer.
