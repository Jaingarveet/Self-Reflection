Reflection:
In my previous answer, I incorrectly chose option A. I realized that my mistake was focusing too much on the cost of developing the copy protection feature and not enough on the effectiveness of the feature in combating piracy.

Revised Answer:
Action: Answer("C")

Explanation:
Option C provides the most support for the president's prediction because it suggests that the copy protection feature will be effective in preventing piracy. If the feature causes a copied game to be playable just long enough for most people to come to enjoy it so much that they decide they have to have it, then it will likely increase sales of Ditalgame's games. This is because people who would have otherwise copied the game will now be motivated to purchase it instead.

The other options do not provide as much support for the president's prediction. Option A focuses on the cost of developing the copy protection feature, which is not directly related to its effectiveness in combating piracy. Option B mentions the market for computer games growing, but it does not address the effectiveness of the copy protection feature. Option D mentions favorable reviews from Game Review Monthly, but it does not necessarily follow that people who frequently copy games will be influenced by these reviews. Option E mentions that Ditalgame games are copied more frequently than other games, but it does not provide any information about the effectiveness of the copy protection feature.
