Context: Museum curakor: Our ancient Egyptian collection includes an earthenware hippopotamus that resembles a child's roy. It was discovered in a tomb, upside down, with its legs broken off. We know that the ancient Egyptians believed the dead had to wage eternal war with beasts. Breaking the legs off a representation of an animal was thought to help a deceased person in this war. We conclude that, far from being a roy, this hippopotamus was a religious object.
Question: Which one of the following is an assumption required by the curator's argument?
Choices:
  A: The tomb in which the hippopotamus was found was not the tomb of a child.
  B: Earthenware figures were never used as children's roys in ancient Egypt.
  C: The tomb in which the hippopotamus was found was not reentered from the time of burial until archaeologists opened it.
  D: The hippopotamus' legs were not broken 1hrough some natural occurrence after it was placed in the tomb.
  E: The hippopotamus was originally placed upside down in the tomb.

  Sure, I'll do my best to answer the question.

After reflecting on my previous answer and the correct solution, I realize that I made a mistake in my initial assumption. I incorrectly assumed that the hippopotamus was originally placed upside down in the tomb, which is not supported by the given information.

The correct assumption required by the curator's argument is (C) The tomb in which the hippopotamus was found was not reentered from the time of burial until archaeologists opened it.

This assumption is necessary to support the curator's conclusion that the hippopotamus was a religious object, as it suggests that the object was not disturbed or altered after its placement in the tomb. If the tomb had been reentered, it's possible that the hippopotamus' legs were broken or damaged during that process, which would undermine the curator's argument.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) The tomb in which the hippopotamus was found was not reentered from the time of burial until archaeologists opened it.
