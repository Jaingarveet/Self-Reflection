Topic: Law
Context: A smoker trying to quit is more likely to succeed if his or her doctor greatly exaggerates the dangers of smoking. Similar strategies can be used to break other habits. But since such strategies involve deception, individuals cannot easily adopt them unless a doctor or some other third party provides the warning.
Question: Which one of the following is an assumption on which the argument depends?
Choices:
  A: People tend to believe whatever doctors tell them.
  B: Most of the techniques that help people quit smoking can also help people break other habits.
  C: The more the relevant danger is exaggerated, the more likely one is to break one's habit.
  D: People generally do not find it easy to deceive themselves.
  E: A doctor is justified in deceiving a patient whenever doing so is likely to make the patient healthier.

## Assistant 2:
  My apologize for my previous response. After reflecting on the problem, I realize that my answer was incorrect. The correct answer is C: The more the relevant danger is exaggerated, the more likely one is to break one's habit.

The argument depends on the assumption that exaggerating the dangers of smoking will motivate individuals to quit. The argument states that "a doctor or some other third party provides the warning" is necessary for individuals to adopt the strategy of exaggerating the dangers of smoking. This implies that individuals are more likely to break their habit if they believe the danger is greater than it actually is. Therefore, option C is the best answer.

My previous answer, option A: People tend to believe whatever doctors tell them, was incorrect because it does not directly relate to the argument's assumption. While it may be true that people tend to trust their doctors, the argument does not rely on this assumption. Instead, it relies on the assumption that exaggerating the dangers of smoking will motivate individuals to quit.

I hope this corrected answer and explanation help clarify the correct response to the question.
