Choices:

## Assistant 2:
  Sure, I'll do my best to answer the question based on the information provided and my previous reflection.

The correct answer is E: Community officials have shown that a relatively small number of repeat offenders commit the majority of violent crimes in the town.

My previous reflection on this question was that I incorrectly chose answer A: The town's overall crime rate appears to have risen slightly this year compared to the same period last year. I realized that this choice does not directly address the argument that the average citizen is more likely to become a victim of a violent crime.

Upon further review, I see that choice E provides a different perspective on the issue. If a small number of repeat offenders are responsible for the majority of violent crimes, then it's possible that the increase in calls involving violent crimes is due to a few individuals rather than a widespread increase in violent crime. This would weaken the argument that the average citizen is more likely to become a victim of a violent crime.

Therefore, I believe the correct answer is E: Community officials have shown that a relatively small number of repeat offenders commit the majority of violent crimes in the town.
