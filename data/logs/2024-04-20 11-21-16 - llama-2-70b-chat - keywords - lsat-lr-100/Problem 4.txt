Context: A film makes a profit if the number of people who see it is sufficient to generate revenues from ticket sales greater than the amount spent to make it. Hence, the primary goal of movie executives is to maximize the number of people who see a film. However, it is not the primary goal of television executives to maximize the number of viewers for their shows.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain the difference between the goals of movie executives and those of television executives?
Choices:
  A: More people are willing to see a film more than once than are willing to watch a television show more than once.
  B: There is no analog in television to the large profits that owners of movie theaters make by selling refreshments to their customers.
  C: The average cost of producing an hour of film is much greater than the average cost of producing an hour of television.
  D: Television shows make their profits from sponsors, who are chiefly concerned with the purchasing power of the people who watch a television show.
  E: Over half of the most popular television shows are shows that viewers do not have to pay to watch.

Error Keywords:

* Misunderstanding of industry economics
* Failure to consider the role of advertising in television profitability
## Assistant 2:
  I apologize for my previous mistake. I misunderstood the industry economics and failed to consider the role of advertising in television profitability.

The correct answer is D: Television shows make their profits from sponsors, who are chiefly concerned with the purchasing power of the people who watch a television show.

Television shows generate revenue primarily through advertising, and advertisers are interested in reaching a large audience with purchasing power. Therefore, the primary goal of television executives is to maximize the number of viewers for their shows, but not necessarily to maximize the number of repeat viewers. In contrast, movie executives rely on ticket sales for revenue, so they aim to attract a large audience and encourage repeat viewings to maximize profits.

The other options do not explain the difference between the goals of movie and television executives:

A: More people are willing to see a film more than once than are willing to watch a television show more than once. This statement does not address the different revenue models for films and television shows.

B: There is no analog in television to the large profits that owners of movie theaters make by selling refreshments to their customers. This statement is irrelevant to the question.

C: The average cost of producing an hour of film is much greater than the average cost of producing an hour of television. This statement is true, but it does not explain the difference in goals between movie and television executives.

E: Over half of the most popular television shows are shows that viewers do not have to pay to watch. This statement is irrelevant to the question.

Therefore, the correct answer is D: Television shows make their profits from sponsors, who are chiefly concerned with the purchasing power of the people who watch a television show.
