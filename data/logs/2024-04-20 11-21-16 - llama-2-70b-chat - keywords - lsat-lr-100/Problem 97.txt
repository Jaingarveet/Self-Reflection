Topic: Law
Context: Editorial: Cell-phone usage on buses and trains is annoying to other passengers. This suggests that recent proposals to allow use of cell phones on airplanes are ill-advised. Cell-phone use would be far more upsetting on airplanes than it is on buses and trains. Airline passengers are usually packed in tightly. And if airline passengers are offended by the cell-phone excesses of their seatmates, they often cannot move to another seat.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes the role played in the editorial's argument by the statement that cell-phone use would be far more upsetting on airplanes than it is on buses and trains?
Choices:
  A: It is the main conclusion of the argument.
  B: It is a claim that the argument tries to rebut.
  C: It is a premise that indirectly supports the main conclusion of the argument by supporting a premise for that conclusion.
  D: It is a conclusion for which support is provided and that itself is used in turn to directly support the argument's main conclusion.
  E: It provides background information that plays no role in the reasoning in the argument.

## Assistant 2:
  I apologize for my mistake in the previous response. I'll make sure to follow the instructions correctly this time.

Action: Answer(C)

The statement that cell-phone use would be far more upsetting on airplanes than it is on buses and trains is a premise that indirectly supports the main conclusion of the argument. The argument's main conclusion is that recent proposals to allow the use of cell phones on airplanes are ill-advised. The statement about cell-phone use being more upsetting on airplanes than on buses and trains supports this conclusion by providing a reason why cell-phone use on airplanes would be particularly problematic. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.
