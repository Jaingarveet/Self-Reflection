## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: $$\begin{aligned}& k x-3 y=4 \\& 4 x-5 y=7\end{aligned}$$In the system of equations above, $k$ is a constant and $x$ and $y$ are variables. For what value of $k$ will the system of equations have no solution?
Choices:
  A: $\frac{12}{5}$
  B: $\frac{16}{7}$
  C: $-\frac{16}{7}$
  D: $-\frac{12}{5}$

## Assistant 2:
  Thought: I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I need to reflect on my solution and the correct answer.

Action: I will use my self-reflection to help me answer the question.

Reflection: I realized that I made a mistake in my previous answer. I misunderstood the problem and solved it incorrectly. Upon reviewing the problem, I see that the correct solution is:

$$k = -\frac{16}{7}$$

When $k = -\frac{16}{7}$, the system of equations has no solution.

Action: I will answer the question using the correct solution.

Answer: C: $-\frac{16}{7}$
## Result:
Agent Answer: None
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
