## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

## Assistant 2:
  Thought: I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I need to reflect on my solution and the correct answer.

Action: I will re-evaluate the equation $\sqrt{4x} = x - 3$.

Reflection:

The equation can be simplified by squaring both sides:

$$4x = x^2 - 12$$

Now, we can factor the left-hand side:

$$4x = (x + 3)(x - 4)$$

So, the values of $x$ that satisfy the equation are $x = 3$ and $x = 4$.

Action: Answer("C")

Explanation: The correct answer is (C) Both I and II. The equation has two solutions, $x = 3$ and $x = 4$.
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
