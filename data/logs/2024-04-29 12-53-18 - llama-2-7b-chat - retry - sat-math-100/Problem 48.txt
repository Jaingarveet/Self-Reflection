## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Assistant 2:
  Thought: I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I need to reflect on my solution and the correct answer.

Action: I will use my self-reflection to help me answer the question.

Reflection:

I previously answered the question by solving for $x$ in the first equation and then substituting that solution into the second equation. However, I made a mistake in my calculation and ended up with $x = y - \frac{1}{4}$, which is not the correct answer.

To solve the problem correctly, I need to solve for $x$ in the first equation and then solve for $y$ in the second equation. Once I have the values of $x$ and $y$, I can substitute them into the second equation to find the value of $c$.

Solving for $x$ in the first equation, I get $x = 3$. Substituting this value into the second equation, I get $y = 3 - \frac{1}{2} = \frac{3}{2}$.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) $x$ is $y$ minus $\frac{1}{2}$.
