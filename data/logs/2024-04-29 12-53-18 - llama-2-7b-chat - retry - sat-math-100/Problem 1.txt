## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Question: $$h=-16 t^{2}+v t+k$$The equation above gives the height $h$, in feet, of a ball $t$ seconds after it is thrown straight up with an initial speed of $v$ feet per second from a height of $k$ feet. Which of the following gives $v$ in terms of $h, t$, and $k$ ?
Choices:
  A: $v=h+k-16 t$
  B: $v=\frac{h-k+16}{t}$
  C: $v=\frac{h+k}{t}-16 t$
  D: $v=\frac{h-k}{t}+16 t$
Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly. My solution was:
$$v = \frac{h-k}{t} + 16 t$$
However, upon further reflection, I realize that this answer is incorrect. The correct answer is:
$$v = \frac{h-k}{t} - 16 t$$
Explanation:
The equation $h=-16 t^{2}+v t+k$ can be rearranged as $t=- \frac{h}{v} + \frac{k}{v}$. Substituting this into the equation $h=-16 t^{2}+v t+k$, we get $t=- \frac{h}{v} + \frac{k}{v} = - \frac{h}{v} + \frac{k}{v} + k$. Simplifying, we get $t = -\frac{h}{v} + k$. Now, we can find $v$ in terms of $h, t$, and $k$ as follows: $v = \frac{h}{t} - k$. Therefore, the correct answer is (B): $v = \frac{h-k}{t}$.
