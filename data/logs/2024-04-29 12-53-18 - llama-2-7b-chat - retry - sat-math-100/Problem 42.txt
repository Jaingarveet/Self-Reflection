## Assistant 2:
  Thought: I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand that the correct solution involves factoring the expression inside the parentheses.

Action: Let's factor the expression inside the parentheses: $(a x+2)(b x+7) = (ax+2)(bx+7) = abx^2 + (a+2)bx + (7+b)x + 14$.

Now, we are given that this expression is equal to $15x^2 + cx + 14$ for all values of $x$.

So, we can equate the two expressions: $abx^2 + (a+2)bx + (7+b)x + 14 = 15x^2 + cx + 14$.

Rearranging the terms, we get: $a(bx^2 + 7bx + 7x) + (a+2)(bx + 7) + (7+b)(x + 14) = 0$.

Now, we can solve for $c$ by substituting $b = 2$: $a(2x^2 + 14x + 14) + (a+2)(2x + 14) + (7+2)(x + 14) = 0$.

Solving for $c$, we get: $c = -2$.

Therefore, the two possible values for $c$ are $c = -2$ and $c = 0$.

Action: Answer("B")
