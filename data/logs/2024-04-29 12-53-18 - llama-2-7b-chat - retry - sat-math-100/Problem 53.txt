## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Assistant 2:
  Thought: 
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand that the line passes through the origin with a slope of $\frac{1}{7}$. To find a point on the line, I can use the point-slope form of a linear equation: $y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$, where $(x_1, y_1)$ is a point on the line and $m$ is the slope.

Action: Answer("B")

Explanation:
The line passes through the origin, so $x_1 = 0$ and $y_1 = \frac{1}{7}$. The slope of the line is $\frac{1}{7}$, so the equation of the line is $y - \frac{1}{7} = m(x - 0)$.

Now, I can plug in $x = 1$ to find the value of $y$: $y - \frac{1}{7} = m(1 - 0) = m$. Since $m = \frac{1}{7}$, the point on the line is $(1, \frac{7}{7}) = (1, 1)$. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) $(1,7)$.
