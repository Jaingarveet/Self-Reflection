Question: $$0.10 x+0.20 y=0.18(x+y)$$Clayton will mix $x$ milliliters of a $10 \%$ by mass saline solution with $y$ milliliters of a $20 \%$ by mass saline solution in order to create an $18 \%$ by mass saline solution. The equation above represents this situation. If Clayton uses 100 milliliters of the $20 \%$ by mass saline solution, how many milliliters of the $10 \%$ by mass saline solution must he use?
Choices:
  A: 5
  B: 25
  C: 50
  D: 100

## Assistant 2:
  Thought: I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I need to use the equation to find the correct solution.

Action: Let x be the number of milliliters of the $10\%$ by mass saline solution used, and y be the number of milliliters of the $20\%$ by mass saline solution used.

From the equation, we have:

0.10x + 0.20y = 0.18(x+y)

Rearranging the equation to isolate x:

0.10x = 0.18y - 0.20y

0.08x = -0.02y

x = -2y

Now, we need to find the number of milliliters of the $10\%$ by mass saline solution that Clayton must use.

Given that Clayton uses 100 milliliters of the $20\%$ by mass saline solution, we can set up the equation:

x = 100

Substituting the value of x into the equation we derived earlier:

-2y = 100

y = 50

Therefore, Clayton must use 50 milliliters of the $10\%$ by mass saline solution.

Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
