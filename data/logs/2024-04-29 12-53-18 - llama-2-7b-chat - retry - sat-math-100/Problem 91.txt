## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Question: \begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|c||c|c|c|c|}\hline$n$ & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\\hline$f(n)$ & -2 & 1 & 4 & 7 \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}The table above shows some values of the linear function $f$. Which of the following defines $f$ ?
Choices:
  A: $f(n)=n-3$
  B: $f(n)=2 n-4$
  C: $f(n)=3 n-5$
  D: $f(n)=4 n-6$

## Assistant 2:
  Thought: I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I need to reflect on my solution and the correct answer.

Action: I will analyze the table provided and compare it to the options given.

Reflection:

The table shows the values of $f(n)$ for $n = 1, 2, 3, 4$. From the table, we can see that $f(n)$ increases by 1 for each increase in $n$.

Option A, $f(n) = n - 3$, does not match the values in the table. For example, $f(2) = 1$, but according to Option A, $f(2) = 2 - 3 = -1$.

Option B, $f(n) = 2n - 4$, matches the values in the table. For example, $f(2) = 2 \times 2 - 4 = 4$, which is the value shown in the table.

Therefore, the correct answer is Option B: $f(n) = 2n - 4$.

Action: I will answer the question using the correct option.

Answer: $f(n) = 2n - 4$.
