## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:

## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: $$\begin{aligned}& y<-x+a \\& y>x+b\end{aligned}$$In the $x y$-plane, if $(0,0)$ is a solution to the system of inequalities above, which of the following relationships between $a$ and $b$ must be true?
Choices:
  A: $a>b$
  B: $b>a$
  C: $|a|>|b|$
  D: $a=-b$

## Assistant 2:
  Thought: I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I need to reflect on my solution and the correct answer.

Action: I will analyze the system of inequalities again and use my reflection to determine the correct answer.

Reflection:

The system of inequalities is:

$$\begin{aligned} y < x + a \ \\ y > x + b \end{aligned}$$

If $(0,0)$ is a solution to the system, then we can set $y = 0$ and $x = 0$.

For the first inequality, we have:

$$0 < 0 + a$$

This is true since $a$ can be any real number.

For the second inequality, we have:

$$0 > 0 + b$$

This is also true since $b$ can be any real number.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) $a > b$.

Action: I will select option (A) $a > b$ as the correct answer.
## Result:
Agent Answer: None
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
