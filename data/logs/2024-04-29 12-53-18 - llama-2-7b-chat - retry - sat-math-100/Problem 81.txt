## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Assistant 2:
  Thought: I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I am now reflecting on my solution and the correct answer.

Action: I will use my self-reflection to help me answer the question.

The given equation is: $a^2 + b^2 = z$ and $ab = y$.

To find the equivalent of $4z + 8y$, I can start by expanding the left-hand side of the equation:

$a^2 + b^2 = z$

$a^2 = z - b^2$

$a = \pm \sqrt{z - b^2}$

Now, I can substitute the expression for $a$ into the second equation:

$ab = y$

$(\pm \sqrt{z - b^2})b = y$

$z - b^2 = y^2$

Now, I can see that the correct answer is (C): $(4a + 4b)^2$.

Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
