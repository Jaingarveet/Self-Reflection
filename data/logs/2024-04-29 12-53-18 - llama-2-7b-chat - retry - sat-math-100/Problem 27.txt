  Thought: I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I am now reflecting on my solution and the correct answer.

Action: I will use my self-reflection to help me answer the question.

The problem states that $16+4x$ is 10 more than $14$. So, we can start by solving for $4x$.

$16+4x = 14 + 10$
$4x = 6$

Now, we can find the value of $8x$ by multiplying $8$ by $4x$.

$8x = 8 \times 4x$
$8x = 32$

Therefore, the value of $8x$ is $32$.

Action: Answer("B")
