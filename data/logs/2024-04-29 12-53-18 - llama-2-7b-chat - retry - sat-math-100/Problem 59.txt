## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Question: Keith modeled the growth over several hundred years of a tree population by estimating the number of the trees' pollen grains per square centimeter that were deposited each year within layers of a lake's sediment. He estimated there were 310 pollen grains per square centimeter the first year the grains were deposited, with a $1 \%$ annual increase in the number of grains per square centimeter thereafter. Which of the following functions models $P(t)$, the number of pollen grains per square centimeter $t$ years after the first year the grains were deposited?
Choices:
  A: $P(t)=310^{t}$
  B: $P(t)=310^{1.01 t}$
  C: $P(t)=310(0.99)^{t}$
  D: $P(t)=310(1.01)^{t}$

## Assistant 2:
  Thought: 
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and upon reflection, I realized that the correct answer is B: $P(t)=310^{1.01 t}$.

Explanation:
The problem states that the number of pollen grains per square centimeter increases by $1 \%$ annually, which means that the growth rate is $1.01$% per year.

Using the formula for exponential growth, we can write:

P(t) = P(0) \* 1.01^t

where P(0) is the initial value of $310$ pollen grains per square centimeter.

Therefore, the correct answer is B: $P(t)=310^{1.01 t}$.

Action: Answer("B")
