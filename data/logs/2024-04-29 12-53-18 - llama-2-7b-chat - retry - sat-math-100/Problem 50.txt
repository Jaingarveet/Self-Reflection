## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Question: \begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}\cline { 2 - 3 }\multicolumn{1}{c|}{} & \multicolumn{2}{c|}{Handedness} \\\hlineGender & Left & Right \\\hline\hlineFemale &  &  \\\hlineMale &  &  \\\hline\hlineTotal & 18 & 122 \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}The incomplete table above summarizes the number of left-handed students and right-handed students by gender for the eighth-grade students atKeisel Middle School. There are 5 times as many right-handed female students as there are left-handed female students, and there are 9 times as many right-handed male students as there are left-handed male students. If there is a total of 18 left-handed students and 122 right-handed students in the school, which of the following is closest to the probability that a right-handed student selected at random is female? (Note: Assume that none of the eighth-grade students are both right-handed and left-handed.)
Choices:
  A: 0.410
  B: 0.357
  C: 0.333
  D: 0.250

Question: What is the probability that a right-handed student selected at random is female?

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly. Upon reviewing my solution and the correct answer, I realized that I made a mistake in my calculation.

To find the probability that a right-handed student selected at random is female, we need to use the information provided in the table:

* There are 18 left-handed students in the school.
* There are 122 right-handed students in the school.
* There are 5 times as many right-handed female students as there are left-handed female students.
* There are 9 times as many right-handed male students as there are left-handed male students.

Using these facts, we can calculate the probability of a right-handed student being female as follows:

Probability of a right-handed student being female = (Number of right-handed female students) / (Total number of right-handed students)
= (5 x 18) / (122)
= 0.357

Therefore, the closest answer to the probability that a right-handed student selected at random is female is (B): 0.357.
