Question: A hollow cube of size 5cm is taken, with the thickness of 1cm. It is made of smaller cubes of size 1cm .If the outer surface of the cube is painted how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted?
Choices:
  A: 438
  B: 550
  C: 500
  D: 450
  E: 498
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The total number of smaller cubes is 5*5*5 = 125.
The number of smaller cubes that make up the outer layer is 3*3*3 = 27.
So, the number of smaller cubes that are inside and not painted is 125 - 27 = 98.
Each of these unpainted smaller cubes has 6 faces, so the total number of unpainted faces is 98*6 = 588.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
