Question: I know a 5 digit number having a property that with a 1 after it, it is three times as large as it would be with a 1 before it.
What is that number?
Choices:
  A: 42857
  B: 32456
  C: 76523
  D: 24567
  E: 43566
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Let's denote the 5-digit number as x. According to the problem, if we put a 1 after x, it becomes 10x + 1, and if we put a 1 before x, it becomes 100000 + x. The problem states that 10x + 1 is three times as large as 100000 + x. So, we can write the equation as follows: 10x + 1 = 3(100000 + x). Solving this equation will give us the value of x.
10x + 1 = 300000 + 3x
7x = 299999
x = 42857
Action: Answer("A")
