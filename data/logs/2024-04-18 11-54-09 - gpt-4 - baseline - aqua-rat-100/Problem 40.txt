Topic: Math
Question: Mark told John "If you give me half your money I will have Rs.75. John said, "if you give me one third of your money, I will have Rs.75/-. How much money did John have ?
Choices:
  A: 22
  B: 60
  C: 28
  D: 26
  E: 18
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let's denote the amount of money Mark has as M and the amount of money John has as J.
From the first statement, we can write the equation: M + J/2 = 75.
From the second statement, we can write the equation: J + M/3 = 75.
We can solve these two equations simultaneously to find the values of M and J.
First, multiply the first equation by 2 and the second equation by 3 to eliminate the fractions:
2M + J = 150,
3J + M = 225.
Subtract the first equation from the second to get:
J = 75.
Substitute J = 75 into the first equation to get:
2M + 75 = 150,
2M = 75,
M = 37.5.
So, John had Rs. 75.
Action: Answer("B")
