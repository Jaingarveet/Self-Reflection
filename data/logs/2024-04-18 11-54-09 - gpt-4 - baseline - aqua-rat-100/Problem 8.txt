Question: The bus fare for two persons for travelling between Agra and Aligarh id four-thirds the train fare between the same places for one person. The total fare paid by 6 persons travelling by bus and 8 persons travelling by train between the two places is Rs.1512. Find the train fare between the two places for one person?
Choices:
  A: 126
  B: 77
  C: 88
  D: 66
  E: 54
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let's denote the train fare for one person as T. According to the problem, the bus fare for two persons is 4/3*T. Therefore, the bus fare for one person is (4/3*T)/2 = 2/3*T.
The total fare paid by 6 persons travelling by bus and 8 persons travelling by train is Rs.1512. So, we can set up the following equation:
6*(2/3*T) + 8*T = 1512
4T + 8T = 1512
12T = 1512
T = 1512 / 12
T = 126
Action: Answer("A")
