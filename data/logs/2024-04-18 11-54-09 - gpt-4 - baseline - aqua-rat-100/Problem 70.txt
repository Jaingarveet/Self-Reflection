Question: In a railway station, there are two trains going. One in the harbor line and one in the main line, each having a frequency of 10 minutes. The main line service starts at 5 o'clock and the harbor line starts at 5.02 A.M. A man goes to the station every day to catch the first train that comes. What is the probability of the man catching the first train?
Choices:
  A: 0.9
  B: 0.8
  C: 0.6
  D: 0.65
  E: 1.5
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The man arrives at the station at a random time. The main line train comes every 10 minutes and the harbor line train comes every 10 minutes but starts 2 minutes after the main line train. So, in any given 10-minute interval, there are 2 minutes when the harbor line train will arrive first (from minute 2 to minute 4), and 8 minutes when the main line train will arrive first (from minute 0 to minute 2 and from minute 4 to minute 10). Therefore, the probability of the man catching the first train (which is the main line train) is 8 out of 10, or 0.8.
