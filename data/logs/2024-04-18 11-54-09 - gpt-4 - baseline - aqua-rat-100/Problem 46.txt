Question: A man spends Rs. 3500 per month and saves 12 1/2% of his income. His monthly income is ?
Choices:
  A: Rs. 4400
  B: Rs. 4270
  C: Rs. 4000
  D: Rs. 3937.50
  E: None of these
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
If the man saves 12 1/2% of his income, it means he spends 87 1/2% of his income. 
So, Rs. 3500 is 87 1/2% of his income. 
To find his total income, we can set up the equation: 
3500 = 87.5/100 * income
Solving for income gives: income = 3500 / (87.5/100) = Rs. 4000
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
