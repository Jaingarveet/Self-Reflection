Question: At its maximum speed, a space shuttle can travel 700m high in 40 seconds. It will also take 5 seconds to pass a point. What then is the length of the space shuttle?
Choices:
  A: 50 m
  B: 75 m
  C: 100 m
  D: 125 m
  E: 150 m
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The space shuttle's maximum speed is 700m/40s = 17.5 m/s. 
If it takes 5 seconds to pass a point, then the length of the shuttle is 17.5 m/s * 5s = 87.5 m. 
However, this option is not available in the choices. The closest option is 75 m or 100 m. 
Since 87.5 is closer to 100, I will choose that.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
