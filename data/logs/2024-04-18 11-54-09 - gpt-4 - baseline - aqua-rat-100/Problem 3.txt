## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Question: A square piece of cloth is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge to form a rectangular piece, which is then cut diagonally in half to create two triangles. If the area of each of triangle is 70 square feet, what was the perimeter (in feet) of the original piece of square cloth?
Choices:
  A: 56
  B: 58
  C: 60
  D: 62
  E: 64
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The area of a triangle is given by 1/2 * base * height. Since the area of each triangle is 70 square feet, the area of the rectangle (which is made up of two of these triangles) is 2*70 = 140 square feet.
Let's denote the side of the square as x. After trimming, the rectangle has dimensions x (the untrimmed side) and x-4 (the trimmed side). So, the area of the rectangle is x*(x-4) = 140.
Solving this quadratic equation, we get x = 14 (ignoring the negative root as it doesn't make sense in this context).
So, the perimeter of the original square cloth is 4*x = 4*14 = 56 feet.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
