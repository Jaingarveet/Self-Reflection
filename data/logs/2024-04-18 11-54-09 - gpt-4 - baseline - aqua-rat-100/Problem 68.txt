## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Question: The greatest common factor of two positive integers is 11. The least common multiple of these two integers is 7700. If one of the integers is 350, what is the other?
Choices:
  A: 242
  B: 308
  C: 352
  D: 412
  E: 456
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The greatest common factor (GCF) of two numbers is the largest number that divides both of them without leaving a remainder. The least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of both of them. 
Given that the GCF of the two numbers is 11 and one of the numbers is 350, the other number must also be a multiple of 11. 
The LCM of two numbers is equal to the product of the two numbers divided by their GCF. 
So, we can set up the equation: (350 * x) / 11 = 7700, where x is the other number. 
Solving for x gives us x = (7700 * 11) / 350 = 242.
Action: Answer("A")
