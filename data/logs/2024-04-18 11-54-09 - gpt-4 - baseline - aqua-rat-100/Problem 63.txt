Question: During one season, a tennis team won 20 matches and lost 30% of their matches. What was the number of matches that the team lost?
Choices:
  A: 70
  B: 30
  C: 3
  D: 7
  E: 5
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
If the team won 20 matches and lost 30% of their matches, then the total number of matches they played is 100%. 
Let's denote the total number of matches as X. 
So, 70% of X equals 20 (because if they lost 30% then they won 70%). 
We can write this as 0.7X = 20. 
Solving for X gives X = 20 / 0.7 = approximately 28.57. 
Since the number of matches must be a whole number, we round this up to 29 matches. 
So, the team lost 30% of 29 matches, which is approximately 8.7 matches. 
Again, since the number of matches must be a whole number, we round this up to 9 matches. 
Action: None of the choices are correct. The team lost approximately 9 matches.
## Result:
Agent Answer: None
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
