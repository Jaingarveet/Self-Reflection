Question: If Raj was one-third as old as Rahim 5 years back and Raj is 17 years old now, How old is Rahim now?
Choices:
  A: 37
  B: 41
  C: 40
  D: 42
  E: 43
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Raj was 17 - 5 = 12 years old 5 years ago.
Since Raj was one-third as old as Rahim 5 years ago, Rahim was 12 * 3 = 36 years old 5 years ago.
So, Rahim is now 36 + 5 = 41 years old.
