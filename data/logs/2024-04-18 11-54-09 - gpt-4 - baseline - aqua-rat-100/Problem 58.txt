## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")

Question: Two balls A and B rotate along a circular track. Ball A makes 2 full rotations in 26 minutes. Ball B makes 5 full rotation in 35 minutes. If they start rotating now from the same point, when will they be at the same starting point again?
Choices:
  A: 1 hour and 31 minutes
  B: 2 hour and 31 minutes
  C: 3 hour and 31 minutes
  D: 4 hour and 31 minutes
  E: 5 hour and 31 minutes
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The time it takes for each ball to make a full rotation can be calculated. 
For ball A, it takes 26 minutes/2 rotations = 13 minutes per rotation.
For ball B, it takes 35 minutes/5 rotations = 7 minutes per rotation.
We need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 13 and 7 to find when they will be at the same starting point again. 
The LCM of 13 and 7 is 91 minutes. 
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
