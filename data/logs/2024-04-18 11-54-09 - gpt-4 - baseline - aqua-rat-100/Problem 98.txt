Question: At 6% per annum simple interest, Rahul borrowed Rs. 500. What amount will he pay to clear the debt after 4 years
Choices:
  A: 750
  B: 700
  C: 620
  D: 600
  E: None of these
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Simple interest is calculated using the formula I = PRT/100, where P is the principal amount, R is the rate of interest, and T is the time in years. 
In this case, P = Rs. 500, R = 6%, and T = 4 years. 
So, I = (500 * 6 * 4) / 100 = Rs. 120
The total amount to clear the debt will be the principal amount plus the interest, which is Rs. 500 + Rs. 120 = Rs. 620.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
