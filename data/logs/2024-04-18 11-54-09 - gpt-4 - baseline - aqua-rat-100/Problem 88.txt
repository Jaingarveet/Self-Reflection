Question: A train running at a speed of 100 miles/hour, takes 10 hours to reach its destination. After covering quarter of the distance, it starts raining and the train has to be slowed to speed of 75 miles/hour. What is the total journey duration?
Choices:
  A: 10
  B: 11.5
  C: 12.5
  D: 13.5
  E: 15
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The total distance of the journey is 100 miles/hour * 10 hours = 1000 miles.
The first quarter of the journey is 1000 miles * 1/4 = 250 miles, which is covered at a speed of 100 miles/hour, so it takes 250 miles / 100 miles/hour = 2.5 hours.
The remaining distance is 1000 miles - 250 miles = 750 miles, which is covered at a speed of 75 miles/hour, so it takes 750 miles / 75 miles/hour = 10 hours.
The total journey duration is 2.5 hours + 10 hours = 12.5 hours.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
