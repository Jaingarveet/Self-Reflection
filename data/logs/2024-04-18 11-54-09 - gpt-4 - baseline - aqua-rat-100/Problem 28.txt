# Model: gpt-4 | Agent: baseline | Exam: aqua-rat-100 | Problem 28 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: If the probability that Stock A will increase in value during the next month is 0.56, and the probability that Stock B will increase in value during the next month is 0.74. What is the greatest value for the probability that neither of these two events will occur?
Choices:
  A: 0.22
  B: 0.26
  C: 0.37
  D: 0.46
  E: 0.63
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The probability that an event will not occur is 1 minus the probability that the event will occur. 
The probability that Stock A will not increase in value is 1 - 0.56 = 0.44.
The probability that Stock B will not increase in value is 1 - 0.74 = 0.26.
The probability that neither of these two events will occur is the product of their individual probabilities, which is 0.44 * 0.26 = 0.1144.
However, the question asks for the greatest value for the probability that neither of these two events will occur. The greatest value would be if we consider the events independently, so we take the maximum of the two probabilities, which is 0.44.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: B
