## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: [5 + ? × 19 - 15 - 7]/[13 × 13 - 156] = 6
Choices:
  A: 4
  B: 4.5
  C: 5
  D: 5.5
  E: 6.5
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
First, simplify the denominator: 13 × 13 - 156 = 169 - 156 = 13.
So, the equation becomes: [5 + ? × 19 - 15 - 7]/13 = 6.
Multiply both sides by 13 to get rid of the denominator: 5 + ? × 19 - 15 - 7 = 78.
Simplify the left side: ? × 19 - 17 = 78.
Add 17 to both sides: ? × 19 = 95.
Finally, divide both sides by 19 to solve for ?: ? = 95/19 = 5.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
