Question: 64 boys and 40 girls form a group for social work. During their membership drive, the same number of boys and girls joined the group. How many members does the group have now, if the ratio of boys to girls is 4:3?
Choices:
  A: 277
  B: 288
  C: 200
  D: 277
  E: 168
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The initial ratio of boys to girls is 64:40, which simplifies to 8:5. 
The final ratio is 4:3. 
Since the same number of boys and girls joined, the difference in the ratios should be equal. 
The difference in the ratio of boys is 4 - 8 = -4, and the difference in the ratio of girls is 3 - 5 = -2. 
This means that for every 4 boys that joined, 2 girls joined. 
Since the number of boys and girls that joined is the same, the number of boys and girls that joined is 2 * 2 = 4. 
So, the total number of members now is 64 + 40 + 4 = 108. 
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: E
