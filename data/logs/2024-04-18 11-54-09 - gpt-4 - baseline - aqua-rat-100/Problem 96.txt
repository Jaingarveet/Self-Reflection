Question: A starts a business with Rs.40,000. After 2 months, B joined him with Rs.60,000. C joined them after some more time with Rs.120,000. At the end of the year, out of a total profit of Rs.375,000, C gets Rs.150,000 as his share. How many months after B joined the business, did C join?
Choices:
  A: 2 months
  B: 4 months
  C: 23 months
  D: 24 months
  E: 84 months
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The profit share is proportional to the capital invested and the time period for which the capital was invested. 
Let's denote the time period for which C's capital was invested as x months. 
A's capital was invested for 12 months, B's capital was invested for 10 months, and C's capital was invested for x months. 
The ratio of their capital investments is 40,000:60,000:120,000, which simplifies to 2:3:6.
The ratio of their time investments is 12:10:x.
Therefore, the ratio of their total investments (capital * time) is 24:30:6x.
Given that C's share of the profit is Rs.150,000 out of a total profit of Rs.375,000, the ratio of C's investment to the total investment is 150,000/375,000 = 2/5.
Setting this equal to the ratio of C's total investment to the total investment gives us the equation 6x/(24+30+6x) = 2/5.
Solving this equation for x gives us x = 4 months.
Therefore, C joined the business 4 months after B.
Action: Answer("B")
