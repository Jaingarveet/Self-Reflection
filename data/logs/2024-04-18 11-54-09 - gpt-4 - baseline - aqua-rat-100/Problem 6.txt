Question: A company contracts to paint 3 houses. Mr.Brown can paint a house in 6 days while Mr.Black would take 8 days and Mr.Blue 12 days. After 8 days Mr.Brown goes on vacation and Mr. Black begins to work for a period of 6 days. How many days will it take Mr.Blue to complete the contract?
Choices:
  A: 7
  B: 8
  C: 10
  D: 11
  E: 12
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Mr. Brown can paint a house in 6 days, so in 8 days he can paint 8/6 = 1.33 houses.
Mr. Black can paint a house in 8 days, so in 6 days he can paint 6/8 = 0.75 houses.
So far, they have painted 1.33 + 0.75 = 2.08 houses.
There is still 3 - 2.08 = 0.92 houses left to paint.
Mr. Blue can paint a house in 12 days, so to paint 0.92 houses, it will take him 0.92 * 12 = 11.04 days.
Since we can't have a fraction of a day, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 11 days.
Action: Answer("D")
