You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Question: A ship went on a voyage. After it had traveled 180 miles a plane started with 10 times the speed of the ship. Find the distance when they meet from starting point.
Choices:
  A: 238
  B: 289
  C: 200
  D: 287
  E: 187
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Let's denote the speed of the ship as 's' (in miles per hour), and the time it takes for the plane to catch up to the ship as 't' (in hours). 
The ship has a head start of 180 miles, and travels at speed 's'. So, the distance covered by the ship is 's*t + 180'. 
The plane travels at 10 times the speed of the ship, so its speed is '10s'. The distance covered by the plane is '10s*t'. 
Since they meet at the same point, the distances they cover are equal. So, we have the equation 's*t + 180 = 10s*t'. 
Solving this equation for 't', we get 't = 180 / 9 = 20 hours'. 
Substituting 't' back into the equation for the distance covered by the ship, we get 's*20 + 180 = 200s'. 
Since the speed of the ship 's' is irrelevant to the question, we can ignore it. The distance from the starting point when they meet is '200s', which is 200 miles. 
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
