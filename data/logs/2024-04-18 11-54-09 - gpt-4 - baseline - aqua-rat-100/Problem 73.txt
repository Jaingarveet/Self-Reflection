## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: there are more than 501 students in a school such that 20% of them exactly took physics and 28% of them exactly took math. What could be the least possible no of students in the school?
Choices:
  A: 550
  B: 570
  C: 600
  D: 700
  E: none of these
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The number of students in the school should be a multiple of both 20% and 28% to get an exact number of students. The least common multiple of 20 and 28 is 140. Therefore, the least possible number of students in the school should be a multiple of 140 that is more than 501. The smallest multiple of 140 that is more than 501 is 560. However, this option is not available in the choices. Therefore, the answer is none of these.
Action: Answer("E")
## Result:
Agent Answer: E
Correct Answer: E
Score: 1
