Question: A company produces 420 units of a particular computer component every month, at a production cost to the company of $110 per component, and sells all of the components by the end of each month. What is the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee that the yearly profit (revenue from sales minus production costs) will be at least $626,400 ?
Choices:
  A: 226
  B: 230
  C: 240
  D: 260
  E: 280
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
First, calculate the total production cost for a year: 420 units/month * 12 months/year * $110/unit = $554,400/year.
Then, calculate the total revenue needed to achieve a profit of $626,400: $554,400 (cost) + $626,400 (profit) = $1,180,800.
Finally, divide the total revenue by the total number of units produced in a year to find the minimum selling price per unit: $1,180,800 / (420 units/month * 12 months/year) = $235/unit.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
