Question: A trader sold an article at a profit of 20% for Rs.360. What is the cost price of the article?
Choices:
  A: 270
  B: 300
  C: 280
  D: 320
  E: 315
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The selling price of the article is Rs. 360, and this is 120% of the cost price (because it includes a 20% profit). 
So, to find the cost price, we need to calculate what 100% (the original cost) would be. 
Mathematically, if 120% is Rs. 360, then 1% is Rs. 360/120 = Rs. 3. 
Therefore, 100% (the cost price) is Rs. 3 * 100 = Rs. 300.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
