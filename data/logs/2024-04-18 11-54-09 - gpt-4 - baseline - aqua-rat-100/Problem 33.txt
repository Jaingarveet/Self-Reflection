## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: A paper is in a square form whose one side is 20 cm. Two semi circles are drawn on its opposites as diameters. If these semi circles are cut down what is the area of the remaining paper?
Choices:
  A: 8.75
  B: 8.79
  C: 8.75
  D: 8.71
  E: 8.72
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The area of the square is side^2 = 20^2 = 400 cm^2.
The diameter of each semicircle is 20 cm, so the radius is 20/2 = 10 cm.
The area of a circle is πr^2, so the area of each semicircle is (π(10)^2)/2 = 50π cm^2.
The area of both semicircles is 2*50π = 100π cm^2.
The area of the remaining paper is the area of the square minus the area of the semicircles = 400 - 100π cm^2.
Action: None of the choices match the correct answer. The question might be incorrect or the choices provided might be wrong.
## Result:
Agent Answer: None
Correct Answer: C
