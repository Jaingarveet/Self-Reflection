Question: A grocer makes a 25% profit on the selling price for each bag of flour it sells. If he sells each bag for $100 and makes $3,000 in profit, how many bags did he sell?
Choices:
  A: 12
  B: 16
  C: 24
  D: 30
  E: 40
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The profit per bag is 25% of the selling price, which is $100. So, the profit per bag is $100 * 25% = $25. 
If the total profit is $3000, then the number of bags sold is $3000 / $25 = 120 bags.
Action: Answer("E")
