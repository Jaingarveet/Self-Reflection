Question: John likes to have lightly flavored tea every evening. In a 50% strong milk tea, he replaces 15% of it with milk twice. Then, he replaces 10 percent of the resultant solution with more milk.
What is the final concentration of tea John drinks?
Choices:
  A: 15.38%
  B: 42%
  C: 39.86%
  D: 22.35%
  E: 32.51%
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
First, John replaces 15% of the 50% strong milk tea with milk, so the concentration of tea becomes 85% of the original 50%, which is 0.85 * 50% = 42.5%.
Then, he replaces 15% of the 42.5% tea with milk, so the concentration of tea becomes 85% of the 42.5%, which is 0.85 * 42.5% = 36.125%.
Finally, he replaces 10% of the 36.125% tea with milk, so the concentration of tea becomes 90% of the 36.125%, which is 0.9 * 36.125% = 32.5125%.
Action: Answer("E")
