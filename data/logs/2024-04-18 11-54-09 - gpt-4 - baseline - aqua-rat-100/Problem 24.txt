Question: An exam is given in a certain class. The average (arithmetic mean) of the highest score and the lowest score is equal to x. If the average score for the entire class is equal to y and there are z students in the class, where z > 5, then in terms of x, y, and z, what is the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers?
Choices:
  A: (zy – 2x)/z
  B: (zy – 2)/z
  C: (zx – y)/(z – 2)
  D: (zy – 2x)/(z -2)
  E: (zy – x)/(z + 2)
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The total score for the entire class is zy (average score times the number of students). 
The sum of the highest and lowest scores is 2x (since the average of the two is x). 
So, the total score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers is zy - 2x. 
The number of students excluding the highest and lowest scorers is z - 2. 
Therefore, the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers is (zy - 2x) / (z - 2).
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
