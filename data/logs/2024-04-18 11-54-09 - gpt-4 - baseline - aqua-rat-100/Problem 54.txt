Question: Silu and Meenu were walking on the road.
Silu said, "I weigh 51 Kgs. How much do you weigh?"
Meenu replied that she wouldn't reveal her weight directly as she is overweight.
But she said, "I weigh 29 Kgs plus half of my weight. "How much does Meenu weigh?
Choices:
  A: 12
  B: 28
  C: 27
  D: 58
  E: 91
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Let's denote Meenu's weight as x. According to her statement, her weight is 29 Kgs plus half of her weight. So, we can write the equation as follows: x = 29 + 0.5x. To solve for x, we can subtract 0.5x from both sides to get 0.5x = 29. Then, we can multiply both sides by 2 to solve for x, which gives us x = 58. So, Meenu weighs 58 Kgs.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
