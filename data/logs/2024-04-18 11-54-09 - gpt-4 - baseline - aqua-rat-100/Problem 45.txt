Question: At what price should the Karan mark a sewing machine that costs him Rs. 1200/- so that even after offering a 20% discount, he makes 20% profit?
Choices:
  A: 1,879
  B: 1,875
  C: 1,876
  D: 1,872
  E: 1,800
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
First, we need to calculate the price after 20% profit. The cost price is Rs. 1200, so the price after 20% profit would be 120% of Rs. 1200, which is Rs. 1440.
Then, we need to find the marked price. If the selling price after a 20% discount is Rs. 1440, then the marked price should be Rs. 1440 / (1 - 0.20) = Rs. 1800.
Action: Answer("E")
## Result:
Agent Answer: E
Correct Answer: E
Score: 1
