Question: Jack buys 18 sharpeners (white and brown) for rs. 100. If he pays 1 rupee more for each white than brown sharpeners. How many of white and how many brown sharpeners did he buy?
Choices:
  A: 10,8
  B: 9,8
  C: 7,8
  D: 5,6
  E: 11,12
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let's denote the number of white sharpeners as W and the number of brown sharpeners as B. We know that W + B = 18 (from the total number of sharpeners) and that the cost of the white sharpeners is 1 rupee more than the brown ones. If we denote the cost of a brown sharpener as x rupees, then the cost of a white sharpener is x + 1 rupees. The total cost is 100 rupees, so we have the equation W*(x+1) + B*x = 100. 
We can solve this system of equations. Let's start with the first equation. We can express B as 18 - W. 
Substitute B in the second equation: W*(x+1) + (18 - W)*x = 100. 
Simplify: W*x + W + 18*x - W*x = 100. 
This simplifies to: W + 18*x = 100. 
Since W and x must be integers (you can't buy a fraction of a sharpener), we can try different values for W until we find a solution where x is also an integer. 
If we try W = 10, we get: 10 + 18*x = 100, which simplifies to 18*x = 90, and x = 5. 
So, Jack bought 10 white sharpeners and 8 brown sharpeners.
Action: Answer("A")
