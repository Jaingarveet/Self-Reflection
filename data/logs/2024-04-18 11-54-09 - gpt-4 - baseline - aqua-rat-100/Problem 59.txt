Question: 20 marbles were pulled out of a bag of only white marbles, painted black, and then put back in. Then, another 20 marbles were pulled out, of which 1 was black, after which they were all returned to the bag. If the percentage of black marbles pulled out the second time represents their percentage in the bag, how many marbles in total Q does the bag currently hold?
Choices:
  A: 40
  B: 200
  C: 380
  D: 400
  E: 3200
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The second time, 1 out of 20 marbles pulled out was black. This means that 1/20 or 5% of the marbles in the bag are black. We know that there are 20 black marbles in the bag (those painted in the first step). So, if 20 marbles represent 5% of the total number of marbles, we can find the total number of marbles by dividing 20 by 0.05.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
