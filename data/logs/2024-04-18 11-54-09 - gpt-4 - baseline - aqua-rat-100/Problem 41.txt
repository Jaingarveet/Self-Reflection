Question: A number of friends decided to go on a picnic and planned to spend Rs. 96 on eatables. Four of them, however, did not turn up. As a consequence, the remaining ones had to contribute Rs. 4 extra, each. The number of those who attended the picnic was
Choices:
  A: 8
  B: 12
  C: 16
  D: 24
  E: 25
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Let's denote the number of friends who were supposed to go to the picnic as x. The total cost of the eatables is Rs. 96, so each friend was supposed to contribute Rs. 96/x. However, 4 friends did not show up, so the remaining x-4 friends had to contribute Rs. 96/(x-4). According to the problem, this amount is Rs. 4 more than the original contribution, so we have the equation 96/(x-4) = 96/x + 4. Solving this equation will give us the number of friends who attended the picnic.
Action: 
First, we need to solve the equation for x. We can start by multiplying all terms by x(x-4) to get rid of the fractions:
96x = 96(x-4) + 4x(x-4)
Simplifying this gives:
96x = 96x - 384 + 4x^2 - 16x
Rearranging terms and simplifying further gives:
4x^2 - 16x - 384 = 0
Dividing all terms by 4 gives:
x^2 - 4x - 96 = 0
This is a quadratic equation in the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0. We can solve it using the quadratic formula x = [-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / (2a):
x = [4 ± sqrt((4)^2 - 4*1*(-96))] / (2*1)
x = [4 ± sqrt(16 + 384)] / 2
x = [4 ± sqrt(400)] / 2
x = [4 ± 20] / 2
x = 24/2 or -16/2
We discard the negative solution because the number of friends cannot be negative. So, x = 12. This is the total number of friends who were supposed to go to the picnic. Since 4 friends did not show up, the number of friends who attended the picnic is 12 - 4 = 8.
Action: Answer("A")
