## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: A car is being driven, in a straight line and at a uniform speed, towards the base of a vertical tower. The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower?
Choices:
  A: 5(√3 + 1)
  B: 6(√3 + √2)
  C: 7(√3 – 1)
  D: 8(√3 – 2)
  E: None of these
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The car is moving at a uniform speed, and the angle of elevation changes from 45° to 60° in 10 minutes. 
In a right triangle, the tangent of an angle is the ratio of the opposite side to the adjacent side. 
When the angle of elevation is 45°, the distance of the car from the base of the tower is equal to the height of the tower (since tan(45°) = 1). 
When the angle of elevation is 60°, the distance of the car from the base of the tower is the height of the tower divided by √3 (since tan(60°) = √3). 
The difference in these distances is the distance the car travels in 10 minutes. 
So, the car travels a distance equal to the height of the tower (1 - 1/√3) in 10 minutes. 
To reach the base of the tower (a distance equal to the height of the tower), the car will need to travel for a time proportional to the inverse of the distance it has already traveled. 
So, the time it will take is 10 minutes * (1 / (1 - 1/√3)) = 10 * (√3 + 1) minutes.
Action: Answer("A")
