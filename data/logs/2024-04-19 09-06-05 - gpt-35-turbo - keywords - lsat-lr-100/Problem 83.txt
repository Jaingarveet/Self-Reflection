Context: Although Pluto has an atmosphere and is much larger than any asteroid, Pluto is not a true planet. Pluto formed in orbit around the planet Neptune and was then ejected from orbit around Neptune when Triton, Neptune's largest moon, was captured by Neptune's gravity.
Question: The conclusion of the argument follows logically if which one of the following is assumed?
Choices:
  A: No celestial body can simultaneously be a moon and a planet.
  B: Not all celestial bodies that have an atmosphere and orbit the sun are true planets.
  C: If Pluto had not been ejected from its orbit around Neptune, Pluto would not have its current orbit around the sun and would still be a moon.
  D: The size of a celestial body in orbit around the sun is not relevant to determining whether or not it is a true planet.
  E: For a celestial body to be a true planet it must have formed in orbit around the sun exclusively.

## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The argument states that Pluto is not a true planet because it was ejected from orbit around Neptune when Triton was captured by Neptune's gravity. Therefore, the assumption that must be made is related to this fact.
Choice A is incorrect because there are celestial bodies that can be both moons and planets, such as Mars' moons Phobos and Deimos.
Choice B is correct because it directly relates to the argument's conclusion that Pluto is not a true planet.
Choice C is incorrect because it is not relevant to the argument's conclusion.
Choice D is incorrect because the size of a celestial body is relevant to determining whether or not it is a true planet.
Choice E is incorrect because it is not true; dwarf planets, such as Pluto, are considered planets even though they did not form exclusively in orbit around the sun.
Action: Answer("B")
