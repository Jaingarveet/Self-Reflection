## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Explanation:
## Assistant 2:
Reflection: I made a mistake in my previous answer. The correct answer is 140°.

Here's the correct reasoning:
Since B bisects minor arc AC, the angle subtended by arc AC at the center of the circle is half of 160°, which is 80°. Similarly, the angle subtented by arc BD at the center is half of 150°, which is 75°.

The sum of angles in any quadrilateral is 360°, and this also applies to the quadrilateral formed by the lines connecting the center of the circle to points A, B, C, and D. 

Therefore, 
80° + 75° + angle subtended by arc AD + angle subtended by arc DA = 360°

angle subtended by arc AD + 155° = 360° 

angle subtended by arc AD = 205° 

The angle at the center is twice the angle at the circumference, so the measure of minor arc AD is half of 205°, which is **140°**.
Action: Answer("C")
