Explanation:
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Let's say X people attended the picnic.
Each person was supposed to contribute Rs. 96/X, but due to the absence of four people, they had to contribute Rs. (96+16)/X = Rs. 112/X.
Therefore, we can set up the equation: 
96/X = 112/(X+4)
Multiplying both sides by X(X+4) gives:
96(X+4) = 112X
96X + 384 = 112X
-16X = -384
X = 24
Action: Answer("D")
