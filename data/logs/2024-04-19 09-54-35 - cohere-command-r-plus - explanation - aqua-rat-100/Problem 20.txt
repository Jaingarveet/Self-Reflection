Explanation:
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Let's assume an equal number of boys and girls joined the group.

Original group: 64 boys and 40 girls
Ratio of boys to girls before new members: 64:40 or 4:3

To maintain the ratio of 4:3, the number of boys must always be $\frac{4}{7}$ of the total group, and the number of girls must be $\frac{3}{7}$.

Let's represent the number of new members as $x$.

Equation: 
$(64 + x) + (40 + x) = \text{total members}$
$4x + 104 = \text{total members}$

Now, we can solve for $x$:
$x = \frac{(\text{total members}) - 104}{4}$

We are given that the ratio of boys to girls is now 4:3, which means the total members must be a multiple of 7.

The choices given result in the following values for $x$:
- A: $x = 168$, which implies the group now has 272 members.
- B: $x = 176$, which implies the group now has 280 members.
- C: $x = \text{[REDACTED]}$.
- D: $x = \text{[REDACTED]}$.
- E: $x = 168$, which implies the group now has 272 members.

So, the final answer is $\boxed{272}$, which is choice A.

Action: Answer("A")
