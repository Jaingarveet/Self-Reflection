Explanation:
## Assistant 2:
Reflection: I made a mistake in calculating the percentage of savings. The correct calculation is:
Let X be the income.
The savings are 12.5% of X, which can be written as 0.125X.
The expenses are Rs. 3500.
So, we can set up the equation: X - 0.125X = Rs. 3500.
Combining the like terms, we have 0.875X = Rs. 3500.
To find X, we divide both sides by 0.875: X = Rs. 4000.

Thought: 
The man's savings are 12.5% of his income, and his expenses are Rs. 3500. 
To find his monthly income, we subtract his savings from his total expenses: 
0.125X = 12.5/100 * X = 0.125 * X
X - 0.125X = Rs. 3500
0.875X = Rs. 3500
X = Rs. 4000

Therefore, his monthly income is Rs. 4000.
Action: Answer("C")
