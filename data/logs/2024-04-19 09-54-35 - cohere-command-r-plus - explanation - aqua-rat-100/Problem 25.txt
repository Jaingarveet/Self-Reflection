## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Question: A car is being driven, in a straight line and at a uniform speed, towards the base of a vertical tower. The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower?
Choices:
  A: 5(√3 + 1)
  B: 6(√3 + √2)
  C: 7(√3 – 1)
  D: 8(√3 – 2)
  E: None of these

Explanation:
I incorrectly applied the trigonometric identities and made a mistake in simplifying the final expression. I should have paid closer attention to the identities and been more careful in my algebraic manipulations.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Let $d$ be the distance from the car to the base of the tower when the angle of elevation is $45^\circ$. Then, the distance from the car to the top of the tower is $d\tan45^\circ=d$.

After $10$ minutes, the angle of elevation becomes $60^\circ$, so the distance from the car to the top of the tower becomes $d\tan60^\circ=\sqrt3d$. Therefore, the car has moved a distance of $(\sqrt3-1)d$ in $10$ minutes.

Let $s$ be the speed of the car. Then, $s=d/10$ meters per minute.

The car will reach the base of the tower when it has moved a total distance of $d$ from the time the angle of elevation was $45^\circ$. Setting up an equation, we have:
\[d = (\sqrt3 - 1)d/s + d,\]
which simplifies to $\sqrt3 - 2 = 10/s$. Multiplying by $s$, we get $s = 10/(\sqrt3 - 2)$.

Finally, we can find the time $t$ it will take for the car to reach the base of the tower:
\[t = d/s = \frac{10/(\sqrt3 - 2)}{10} = \frac{1}{\sqrt3 - 2} = \boxed{5(\sqrt3 + 1)}\]

So, the answer is $A$.
Action: Answer("A")
