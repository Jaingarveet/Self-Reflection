Explanation:
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Let the distance be $x$ miles.
The time taken for the first trip from A to B is $\frac{x}{70}$ hours.
The total time for the round trip is $\frac{x}{70} + \frac{x}{90} = \frac{3x}{63}$ hours.
At 3 hours before the end of his trip, Kevin was still $70$ miles away from B, so the distance between them at that time was $70$ miles.
The distance between A and B is $3\times70 = 210$ miles.
$210$ miles $= \frac{63}{x} \times 3$ hours
$x = 270$ miles

Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: A
