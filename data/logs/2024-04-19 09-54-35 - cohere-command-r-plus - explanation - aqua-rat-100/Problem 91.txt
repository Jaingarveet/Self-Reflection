## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.

Explanation:
I incorrectly applied Pythagoras' theorem to find the distance. The east-west and south-north displacements are not perpendicular, and the former is not the hypotenuse of a right triangle. The correct approach is to consider the net displacement in each direction.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The person travels 3 km south, 5 km east, 3 km north, and 2 km west.

South: 3 km - 3 km = 0 net displacement
East: 5 km - 2 km = 3 km net displacement to the east
North: 0 km net displacement
West: 0 km net displacement

So, the person is 3 km east of the starting point.
Action: Answer("C")

Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: A
