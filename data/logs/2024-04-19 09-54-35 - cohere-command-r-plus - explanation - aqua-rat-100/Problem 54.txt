Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I made an error in solving the equation for Meenu's weight. 
I incorrectly assumed that "29 + x/2" meant "29 kg plus half of x kg." 
However, the correct interpretation is "29 kg plus half of her weight, which is also x kg."
## Assistant 2:
Reflection: I misinterpreted the question. '29 kg plus half of her weight' means '29 + x/2 = weight in kg', where 'x' is the weight. So, 29+x/2=x 
29 + x/2 = 2x 
29 = x/2 
58 = x
Answer: Meenu weighs 58 kg.

Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
