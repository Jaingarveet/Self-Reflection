Explanation:
## Assistant 2:
Reflection: First, I calculated the profit as 20% of Rs. 1200, which is Rs. 240. Then, I added this profit to the cost price, getting Rs. 1440. To find the sale price after a 20% discount, I multiplied the original price by 0.8, which equals Rs. 1152. Subtracting this discount price from the cost price, I found the profit to be Rs. 288. This amount is 20% of Rs. 1440, confirming the markup. Finally, I divided Rs. 1440 by 0.8 to get the sale price, expecting to find a value among the choices that was close to my calculated sale price of Rs. 1800. However, I made a mistake in my calculation, as the sale price should be Rs. 1800 * 1.2, which equals Rs. 2160. The correct answer is indeed E: Rs. 1,800, as this is the price at which the sewing machine should be marked to achieve the desired profit after discounting.

Thought: 
To make a 20% profit on the Rs. 1200 cost of the sewing machine, Karan should first calculate 20% of Rs. 1200, which is Rs. 240. He then adds this profit to the cost, giving him a new price of Rs. 1440. 

Next, he considers the 20% discount that he plans to offer. Multiplying the original price by 0.8, he gets Rs. 1152 as the discounted price. 

Finally, to find the price at which he should mark the machine, he needs to set this discounted price such that it is 80% of the final price. In other words, he wants 0.8 times the final price to equal Rs. 1152. So, the final price should be Rs. 1152 divided by 0.8, which equals Rs. 1440. 

Now, checking his work, he can see that if he sells the machine for Rs. 1440, he will make a 20% profit on his original investment of Rs. 1200 because 20% of Rs. 1440 is Rs. 288 (Rs. 1440 - Rs. 1200). 

Therefore, the correct answer is E: Rs. 1,800.
