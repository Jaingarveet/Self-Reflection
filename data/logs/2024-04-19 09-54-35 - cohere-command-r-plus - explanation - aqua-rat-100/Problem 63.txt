Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I misinterpreted the question and calculated the answer incorrectly. 
I calculated [REDACTED]% of 20, but the correct approach was to calculate the total number of matches and then find [REDACTED]% of that number.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
30% of the total number of matches is the number lost. 
30% of the total number of matches = 0.30 * (20 + x) = 6 + 0.3x
We know that the total number of matches is the sum of the matches won and lost, so: 
20 + x = 60
x = 40
Therefore, the number of matches lost is 40 matches, and the correct answer is B.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
