Explanation:
I incorrectly calculated the cost price per bag and, consequently, the total number of bags sold. I forgot that the given profit is already a percentage of the selling price.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Profit per bag = 25% of $100 = $25
Total profit = Selling price per bag x Number of bags = $3000
Number of bags = $3000 / $25 = 120
Therefore, the grocer sold 120 bags of flour.

This question trips you up because the profit is given as a percentage of the selling price, not the cost price. This detail must be considered when calculating the profit per bag and, subsequently, the total number of bags sold.
