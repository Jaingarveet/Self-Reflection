## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Explanation:
I incorrectly set up and solved a system of equations. I made a simple arithmetic error in adding the equations and determining the value of "x." This led to an incorrect final answer.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Let the rate of the current be x kmph
Then, the rate of the man along the current = (4 + x) kmph
Given that the rate of the man against the current = 2 kmph
We can write the equation as:
4 - x = 2
=> x = 4 - 2 = 2 kmph
Therefore, the man's rate along the current = 4 + 2 = 6 kmph
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: E
Score: 0
