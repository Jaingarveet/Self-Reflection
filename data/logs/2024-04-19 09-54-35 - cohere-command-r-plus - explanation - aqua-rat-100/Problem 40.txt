Explanation:
## Assistant 2:
Reflection: I made a mistake in calculating the amount of money John had. The correct answer is Rs. 24, which is not an option here. This question may have an incorrect set of choices.

Thought: 
Let's assume John has 'x' amount of money.
According to the question:
x/2 + x/2 = 75
x/3 + 2x/3 = 150

Solving for x we get x = 24.

Action: The correct answer is not listed.
## Result:
Agent Answer: None
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
