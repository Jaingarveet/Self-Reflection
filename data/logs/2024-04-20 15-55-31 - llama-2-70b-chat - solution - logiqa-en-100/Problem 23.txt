1. Identify the contradiction between the psychological theory and the fact that great painters often spend most of their time in loneliness.
2. Recognize that the argument suggests that loneliness may not be a necessary condition for artistic success.
3. Eliminate answer choices that are not related to the contradiction between the psychological theory and the fact that great painters often spend most of their time in loneliness.
4. Choose the answer choice that best summarizes the contradiction between the psychological theory and the fact that great painters often spend most of their time in loneliness.

Action: Answer("B") 

Reflection:

1. The contradiction between the psychological theory and the fact that great painters often spend most of their time in loneliness is identified correctly.
2. The argument suggests that loneliness may not be a necessary condition for artistic success, which is a correct interpretation.
3. Answer choices not related to the contradiction between the psychological theory and the fact that great painters often spend most of their time in loneliness are eliminated correctly.
4. The answer choice that best summarizes the contradiction between the psychological theory and the fact that great painters often spend most of their time in loneliness is selected correctly.

However, the previous answer was incorrect, and the correct answer is "C: Loneliness is necessary for great painting artists." The argument suggests that loneliness may not be a necessary condition for artistic success, which contradicts the psychological theory that maintaining an intimate relationship is necessary for happiness. Therefore, option C best summarizes the contradiction between the psychological theory and the fact that great painters often spend most of their time in loneliness.
