  My previous answer was incorrect, and upon reflection, I realized that I made a mistake in my analysis of the given options.
Here's my revised solution:

1. Read the passage carefully and understand the problem.
The passage states that a returnee with a master's degree from the UK has not yet found a job, despite the authoritative person's statement that with real knowledge and basic social skills, one cannot become a "sea waiter."
2. Identify the authoritative person's statement and its implications.
The authoritative person implies that if a job seeker with an overseas degree has real knowledge and basic social skills, they should be able to accurately position themselves in the career selection process and avoid becoming a "sea waiter."
3. Analyze the given options and determine which one aligns with the passage's information.
Option A states that Datian has real talent and basic social skills, but the positioning is not accurate. This option aligns with the passage's information, as it suggests that Datian possesses the necessary qualities but has not yet found a job, which may be due to incorrect positioning.
4. State the answer in the correct format: "Action: Answer("A")".
