This means that people in developed countries value a clean environment more than people in developing countries, who may be more concerned with economic growth and employment opportunities.
## Assistant 2:
  My apologize for my previous response, where I selected option B: Both developed and developing countries have polluting enterprises.
Upon reflection, I realize that the economist's hypothesis is actually option A: A good natural environment is more important for people in developed countries than people in developing countries.
This hypothesis suggests that people in developed countries place a higher value on a clean environment than people in developing countries, who may prioritize economic growth and employment opportunities over environmental concerns.
Therefore, the economist's hypothesis is option A.
