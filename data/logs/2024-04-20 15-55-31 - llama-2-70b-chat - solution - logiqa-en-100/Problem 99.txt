## System:
You are an expert in Logic.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Logic
Context: Conne Levi with a "moe" look looks like other newborns.But because it is the world's first test-tube baby screened by next-generation gene sequencing technology, his advent has attracted the attention of experts and scholars.Not long ago, this news detonated the audience at the "European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology Annual Meeting" held in London, England.And ordinary people also believe that humans may usher in the era of "customized babies".
Question: Which of the following, if true, would best refute the views of ordinary people?
Choices:
  A: "Artificial" genetic screening does not rule out that there will be loopholes; in natural conception, the guidelines for survival of the fittest in nature seem to be more subtle and effective
  B: It can be seen from the development history of modern science and technology that technological development is often faster than human cognition, and sometimes technology will go further and deviate from the track of human cognition
  C: Gene screening is mainly to avoid reproductive defects, this technology brings opportunities for human eugenics and eugenics; as for "customized babies", the concept of cloning is more involved, the two should not be confused
  D: "Customized babies" have not been tried globally, this concept also challenges the most controversial human reproductive ethics

## Assistant 2:
  My apologize for my previous response, and thank you for the opportunity to reflect on my answer. After reevaluating the question and choices, I realize that my initial answer was incorrect.

The correct answer is (C) Gene screening is mainly to avoid reproductive defects, this technology brings opportunities for human eugenics and eugenics; as for "customized babies", the concept of cloning is more involved, the two should not be confused.

My reasoning is as follows:

The question asks which option, if true, would best refute the views of ordinary people who believe that humans may usher in the era of "customized babies" due to the advent of gene sequencing technology.

Option (C) clarifies that gene screening technology is primarily aimed at avoiding reproductive defects, and it also highlights the potential for human eugenics and eugenics. This statement addresses the misconception that "customized babies" are a direct result of gene sequencing technology. Instead, it emphasizes that the concept of "customized babies" is more closely related to cloning, which is a separate and distinct technology.

Therefore, option (C) provides a more accurate understanding of the relationship between gene sequencing technology and the concept of "customized babies." It refutes the ordinary people's view by clarifying the distinction between the two technologies and their respective applications.

I hope this revised answer better addresses the question, and I appreciate the opportunity to reflect on my previous response.
