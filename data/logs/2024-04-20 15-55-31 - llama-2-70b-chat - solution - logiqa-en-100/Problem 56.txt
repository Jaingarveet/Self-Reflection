## User 2:
Topic: Logic
Context: The Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge, built in 1968, has a clear height of 24 meters in the Fengshui area.Theoretically, it can pass a maximum of 3,000 tons of ships.Today, with the rapid economic development, it has become a building that “cuts the waist” of the Yangtze River waterway and hinders the passage of giant ships.A bridge expert asserted that the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge must be demolished and rebuilt in order to dredge the golden waterways of the Yangtze River completely.
Question: If any of the following is true, can you raise the most doubts about this expert's point of view?
Choices:
  A: Due to the inability of large ships to pass through the Nanjing Bridge, a large number of exported goods in the middle and upper reaches of the Yangtze River can only be taken by road or railway.
  B: 99% of international ships entering the Yangtze River are moored at ports below the Nanjing Bridge, and dozens of foreign trade terminals above Nanjing rarely have large external ships berthed.
  C: It is not enough to dismantle only the Nanjing Bridge.The Yangtze River Bridge, which was built in Wuhu, Tongling, Anqing and other places, has a clear height of 24 meters.
  D: Shipbuilding technology is highly developed, and 8000-ton ships designed for adapting to the passage of the Yangtze River abroad have passed through Nanjing to Wuhan.

## Assistant 2:
  My apologize for my previous response, where I incorrectly answered the question. After reflecting on the problem, I realized that my previous answer was based on incomplete information and misunderstanding of the question.

The correct answer is choice C: "It is not enough to dismantle only the Nanjing Bridge. The Yangtze River Bridge, which was built in Wuhu, Tongling, Anqing and other places, has a clear height of 24 meters."

This answer raises the most doubts about the expert's point of view because it highlights that the issue of ship passage is not limited to the Nanjing Bridge, but rather a common problem in multiple locations along the Yangtze River. Therefore, simply demolishing and rebuilding the Nanjing Bridge would not completely solve the problem of ship passage.

The other choices do not directly address the issue of the Nanjing Bridge's clear height and its impact on ship passage. Choice A mentions the impact of the Nanjing Bridge on exported goods, but it does not directly relate to the expert's argument. Choice B mentions the mooring of international ships at ports below the Nanjing Bridge, but it does not address the issue of ship passage. Choice D mentions the development of shipbuilding technology, but it does not directly relate to the clear height of the Nanjing Bridge or the other bridges mentioned in choice C.

Therefore, the correct answer is choice C, which highlights the limitation of the expert's proposal to address the issue of ship passage in the Yangtze River waterway.
