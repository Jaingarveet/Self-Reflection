## Assistant 2:
  My apologize for my previous response. After reevaluating the question, I realize that my initial answer was incorrect.

The correct answer is (C) The chairman of Huayuan Real Estate believes that as land development costs increase, house prices will definitely increase.

This statement is the most doubtful of the assertions given because it implies a direct causal relationship between land development costs and housing prices. However, there could be other factors that contribute to the increase in housing prices, such as demand and supply, location, and economic conditions. The statement does not consider these factors, making it the most doubtful.

Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
