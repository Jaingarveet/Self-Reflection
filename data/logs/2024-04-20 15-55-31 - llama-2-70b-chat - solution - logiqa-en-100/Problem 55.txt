  I apologize for my previous mistake. Let's analyze the given choices again:

A: Before? H Middle? P After? K
This arrangement violates condition (4), as P and K are in the same team.

B: Before? H Middle? L After? N
This arrangement satisfies all the conditions. H is in team 2, and Q is in the middle of team 1.

C: Before? G Middle? Q After? P
This arrangement violates condition (5), as P and Q are in the same team.

D: Before? G Middle? Q After? N
This arrangement also violates condition (5), as P and Q are in the same team.

Therefore, the only acceptable arrangement for the second team's performance is:

B: Before? H Middle? L After? N

Action: Answer("B")
