# Model: cohere-command-r-plus | Agent: keywords | Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Problem 94 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Law.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:
Topic: Geography
Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Law
Context: Most auto mechanics have extensive experience. Furthermore, most mechanics with extensive experience understand electronic circuits. Thus, most auto mechanics understand electronic circuits.
Question: The pattern of flawed reasoning in which one of the following arguments is most similar to that in the argument above?
Choices:
  A: During times of the year when automobile traffic increases, gas prices also increase. Increases in gas prices lead to increases in consumer complaints. Thus, increased automobile traffic causes increased consumer complaints.
  B: The most common species of birds in this region are migratory. Moreover, most migratory birds have left this region by the end of November. Hence, few birds remain in this region during the winter.
  C: It is not surprising that most speeding tickets in this region are issued to drivers of sports cars. After all, most drivers who are not interested in driving fast do not buy sports cars.
  D: Most nature photographers find portrait photography boring. Moreover, most portrait photographers especially enjoy photographing dignitaries. Thus, most nature photographers find photographing dignitaries especially boring.
  E: Most snow-removal companies run lawn-care services during the summer. Also, most companies that run lawn-care services during the summer hire additional workers in the summer. Thus, most snow-removal companies hire additional workers in the summer.

Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Error Keywords:
- Logical fallacy misinterpretation
- Fallacy identification error
- Syllogism error

Solution: The argument presents a faulty generalization, suggesting that because most auto mechanics with extensive experience understand electronic circuits, all auto mechanics with extensive experience must understand them. This is a fallacy of faulty generalization, or "leaping to conclusions."

Choice "[REDACTED]" presents a similar logical fallacy:
"[REDACTED]"

This argument makes a similar leap in logic, assuming that because most snow-removal companies run lawn-care services, and most of those companies hire additional workers, then most snow-removal companies must hire additional workers. This is a generalization that does not necessarily follow from the premises.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: The argument presents a flawed pattern of reasoning by making a generalization that does not necessarily follow from the premises. It suggests that a relationship between two factors (extensive experience and understanding of electronic circuits) applies to all auto mechanics.

Choice E presents a similar logical fallacy. It assumes that because most snow removal companies share a specific characteristic (running lawn-care services), and most of those companies exhibit another trait (hiring additional workers), then we can conclude that most snow-removal companies demonstrate the second trait. This is a generalization that doesn't necessarily hold true.

Both arguments exhibit a fallacy of faulty generalization, or "leaping to conclusions," by extending a pattern observed within a group to apply to all members of that group without sufficient evidence.
Action: Answer("E")
## Result:
Agent Answer: E
Correct Answer: E
