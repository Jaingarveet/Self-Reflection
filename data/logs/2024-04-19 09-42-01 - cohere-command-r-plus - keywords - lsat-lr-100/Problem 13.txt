Context: Economics professor: Marty's Pizza and Checkers Pizza are the two major pizza parlors in our town. Marty's sold coupon books including coupons good for one large plain pizza at any local pizza parlor, at Marty's expense. But Checkers refused to accept these coupons, even though they were redeemed by all other local pizza parlors. Accepting them would have cost Checkers nothing and would have satisfied those of its potential customers who had purchased the coupon books. This shows that Checkers's motive in refusing to accept the coupons was simply to hurt Marty's Pizza.
Question: Which one of the following, if assumed, enables the economics professor's conclusion to be properly drawn?
Choices:
  A: Any company that refuses to accept coupons issued by a competitor when doing so would satisfy some of the company's potential customers is motivated solely by the desire to hurt that competitor.
  B: Any company that wishes to hurt a competitor by refusing to accept coupons issued by that competitor will refuse to accept them even when accepting them would cost nothing and would satisfy its potential customers.
  C: At least one company has refused to accept coupons issued by its major local competitor simply in order to hurt that competitor, even though those coupons were accepted by all other local competitors.
  D: Any company that accepts its major competitor's coupons helps its competitor by doing so, even if it also satisfies its own actual or potential customers.
  E: If accepting coupons issued by a competitor would not enable a company to satisfy its actual or potential customers, then that company's refusal to accept the coupons is motivated by the desire to satisfy customers.

## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The economics professor concludes that Checkers's motive in refusing to accept Marty's coupons was to hurt Marty's Pizza. This conclusion is based on the assumption that Checkers's refusal, despite having no apparent cost or negative impact on its own business, must have been intended to damage Marty's.

Choice A is the correct answer. It states a general rule that any company refusing to accept a competitor's coupons with no apparent downside is motivated solely by a desire to harm the competitor. This assumption directly supports the professor's conclusion.

Choice B is incorrect because it reverses the causality. It suggests that a company wishes to hurt a competitor and, as a result, refuses to accept coupons. However, the conclusion is based on interpreting Checkers's actions as motivated by a desire to harm Marty's, not the other way around.

Choice C is incorrect as it merely restates the actions of Checkers without providing an assumption that links the actions to the conclusion. It does not explain why Checkers's actions indicate a motive to harm Marty's.

Choice D is incorrect because it focuses on the potential benefit to Marty's rather than the motive behind Checkers's actions. The conclusion is about Checkers's intention, not the indirect benefit to a competitor.

Choice E is incorrect because it introduces an alternative motive (the desire to satisfy customers) that is not relevant to the conclusion. The professor's argument is specifically about Checkers's intention to harm Marty's, regardless of customer satisfaction.

By reflecting on the incorrect choices and the correct answer, I can identify the key distinction between them. The correct answer (Choice A) provides a general rule that directly links a company's actions (refusing competitor's coupons) to a specific motive (desire to harm), which aligns with the professor's conclusion. The incorrect choices either reverse the causality, lack a clear link to the conclusion, or introduce irrelevant motives.
