Topic: Law
Context: Most people who shop for groceries no more than three times a month buy prepared frozen dinners regularly. In Hallstown most people shop for groceries no more than three times a month. Therefore, in Hallstown most people buy prepared frozen dinners regularly.
Question: Which one of the following arguments has a flawed pattern of reasoning most like the flawed reasoning in the argument above?
Choices:
  A: It is clear that most drivers in West Ansland are safe drivers since there are very few driving accidents in West Ansland and most accidents there are not serious.
  B: It is clear that John cannot drive, since he does not own a car and no one in his family who does not own a car can drive.
  C: It is clear that Fernando's friends usually drive to school, since all of his friends can drive and all of his friends go to school.
  D: It is clear that most people in Highland County drive sedans, since most people who commute to work drive sedans and most people in Highland County commute to work.
  E: It is clear that most of Janine's friends are good drivers, since she accepts rides only from good drivers and she accepts rides from most of her friends.

## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The argument in the question makes a generalization about the residents of Hallstown based on insufficient evidence. It assumes that because most people in Hallstown shop for groceries a certain way, they must also buy frozen dinners regularly. This is a false cause fallacy, as it incorrectly assumes that one factor (shopping frequency) directly causes or leads to another (buying frozen dinners).

Of the given choices, option D also presents a similar flawed pattern of reasoning. It generalizes that most people in Highland County drive sedans based on the commuting habits of "most people who commute to work." This argument fails to consider that not all residents of Highland County may commute to work, and even among those who do, there could be a significant number who drive other types of vehicles. Therefore, the argument concludes something about a group (Highland County residents) based on incomplete or insufficient evidence.
