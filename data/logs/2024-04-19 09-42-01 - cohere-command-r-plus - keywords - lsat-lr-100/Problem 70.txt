Topic: Law
Context: Newspaper subscriber: Arnot's editorial argues that by making certain fundamental changes in government we would virtually eliminate our most vexing social ills. But clearly this conclusion is false. After all, the argument Arnot makes for this claim depends on the dubious assumption that government can be trusted to act in the interest of the public.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses a flaw in the argument's reasoning?
Choices:
  A: it repudiates a claim merely on the grounds that an inadequate argument has been given for it
  B: it treats a change that is required for virtual elimination of society's most vexing social ills as a change that will guarantee the virtual elimination of those ills
  C: it fails to consider that, even if an argument's conclusion is false, some of the assumptions used to justify that conclusion may nonetheless be true
  D: it distorts the opponent's argument and then attacks this distorted argument
  E: it uses the key term "government" in one sense in a premise and in another sense in the conclusion

## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The argument assumes that because the government may not always act in the public interest, fundamental changes must be made to address social issues. However, this ignores the possibility that even if the government's ability to act in the public interest is questionable, the proposed changes may not be the best solution, or they may have unintended consequences. Therefore, the flaw in the reasoning is that it fails to consider that some of the assumptions used to justify a conclusion may still be true, even if the conclusion itself is false.
