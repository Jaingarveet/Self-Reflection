Context: Until 1985 all commercial airlines completely replenished the cabin air in planes in flight once every 30 minutes. Since then the rate has been once every hour. The less frequently cabin air is replenished in a plane in flight, the higher the level of carbon dioxide in that plane and the easier it is for airborne illnesses to be spread.
Question: Which one of the following is most strongly supported by the information above?
Choices:
  A: In 1985 there was a loosening of regulations concerning cabin air in commercial airline flights.
  B: People who fly today are more likely to contract airborne illnesses than were people who flew prior to 1985.
  C: Low levels of carbon dioxide in cabin air make it impossible for airborne illnesses to spread.
  D: In 1980 the rate at which the cabin air was replenished in commercial airliners was sufficient to protect passengers from the effects of carbon dioxide buildup.
  E: In 1980 the level of carbon dioxide in the cabin air on a two-hour commercial airline flight was lower than it is today on a similar flight.

## Assistant 2:
Reflection: I overlooked the detail that the question asks for the statement that is "most strongly supported" by the information. While my previous reasoning was sound in identifying the potential health risks of reduced ventilation, it did not sufficiently consider the impact of carbon dioxide levels and their relationship to the spread of illnesses.

Thought: 
The information provided indicates that higher levels of carbon dioxide make it easier for airborne illnesses to spread. Therefore, statement B is the most strongly supported conclusion: people flying today are more likely to contract airborne illnesses due to the reduced ventilation rate, which leads to higher carbon dioxide levels.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: E
Score: 0
