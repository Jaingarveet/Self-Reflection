Question: Sheep Challenge Evolution A species of sheep lives on the Scottish island of Hirta. Hirta has plenty of grass for the sheep to eat, and no natural predators of the sheep live on the island. Some sheep have dark wool, and some have light wool. The sheep with dark wool tend to be much larger and stronger than the sheep with light wool. However, researchers have found that in the last 20 years, the sheep with light wool have increased in number. Usually, strength and size help animals survive and breed. A new sheep predator is introduced to the island. Which change to the sheep population will most likely occur first?
Choices:
  A: a decrease in the population of sheep with dark wool
  B: a decrease in the population of sheep with light wool
  C: an increase in the population of sheep with dark wool
  D: an increase in the population of sheep with light wool
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Understand the current conditions on Hirta: an abundance of grass and no natural sheep predators. 
2. Recognize the key fact: the increase in light-wool sheep over the last 20 years, indicating their dominance in the population. 
3. Interpret the impact of the new predator: it will make sheep easier prey, leading to a decrease in their overall population. 
4. Identify the initial change: a decline in the number of light-wool sheep, as they are now the majority and more available to the predator. 
5. Choose the answer reflecting this initial decrease in light-wool sheep.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Prior to the introduction of a predator, the sheep population on Hirta experienced an increase in light-wool sheep over the last two decades, indicating their advantage in the environment. Typically, size and strength offer survival and breeding benefits. However, in this case, the absence of predators and ample food resources favor the lighter, smaller sheep for unknown reasons.

Upon the introduction of a predator, the dynamic shifts. Overall, sheep become more vulnerable, and their population will initially decrease. Specifically, the light-wool sheep, being the current dominant type, will be more exposed and susceptible, leading to a reduction in their numbers. This initial decrease in light-wool sheep is the reverse of the trend observed in the predator-free environment.
