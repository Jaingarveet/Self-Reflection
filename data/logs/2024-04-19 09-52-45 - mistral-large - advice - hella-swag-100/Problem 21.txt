Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to survive a sexless marriage [title] Accept that you and your spouse have different needs and desires. [step] Whether your sexual needs aren't being met or you're not interested in having sex, acknowledge that your partner's needs are just as valid. If rekindling your sex life isn't an option, having empathy for each other will help you deepen your bond in nonsexual ways.
Choices:
  A: [substeps] Consider the status of your sexual wants and needs within your marriage. If you see that your spouse has a sexual desire that he's suppressing, respect this fact.
  B: [title] Recognize that your needs are their own. [step] While it's fine to have needs, it's important that you are clear that you do and are ready to follow through on them.
  C: [substeps] You're each entitled to your individual physical and emotional needs. Try to put yourself in your partner's shoes and find ways to compromise with each other.
  D: [title] Accept your biological parents' incompatibility. [step] If you recognize your biological parent doesn't like sex between you and your child, accept that your parents' opinions aren't valid.
