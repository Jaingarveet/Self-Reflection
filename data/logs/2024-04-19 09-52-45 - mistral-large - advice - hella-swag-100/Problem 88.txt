Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to decide to take testosterone [title] Ask yourself if you want to improve your sexual function. [step] If you have a low sex drive, or if your sex drive has declined with age, you might want to give it a boost with some extra testosterone. In addition to increased libido, testosterone supplements can help you avoid unwanted erections and maintain erections when aroused.
Choices:
  A: A healthy body needs more testosterone in order to maintain erections. Some women who are female or older do not maintain regular erections until all their testosterone has been expended, so other people may need testosterone anyway.
  B: [substeps] Be honest with yourself if you want to lower your testosterone. Taking testosterone supplements can lead to a reduction in your sex drive.
  C: [title] Distinguish between testosterone and regular erections. [step] Studies have shown that women with low testosterone are able to have slightly lower levels of sexual function after sex, which is because the hormone changes are carried out through pleasure.
  D: [title] Ask yourself if you want a healthier body. [step] Men who suffer from low testosterone may experience increased body fat and larger breasts.

## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The original text is about deciding to take testosterone to improve sexual function, specifically for men who have a low sex drive or whose sex drive has declined with age. The text also mentions that testosterone supplements can help avoid unwanted erections and maintain erections when aroused.

Choice A is incorrect because it mentions women and older people, which is not relevant to the context of the original text.
Choice B is incorrect because it contradicts the information in the original text, which states that testosterone supplements can increase libido, not decrease it.
Choice C is incorrect because it mentions women and low testosterone, which is not relevant to the context of the original text.
Choice D is the most relevant to the topic and context of the original text, as it mentions men who suffer from low testosterone and the potential physical effects of low testosterone.
