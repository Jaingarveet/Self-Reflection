## System:
You are an expert in Law.
You have incorrectly answered the following multiple-choice question.
Your task is to reflect on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
You will then use this information help you answer the same question in the future.
First, explain why you answered the question incorrectly.
Second, list the keywords that describe the type of your errors from most general to most specific. 
Third, solve the problem again, step-by-step, based on your knowledge of the correct answer.
Fourth, create a list of detailed instructions to help you correctly solve this problem in the future.
Finally, create a list of general advice to help you solve similar types of problems in the future.  
Be concise in your response; however, capture all of the essential information.  
For guidance, I will provide you with a single generic example problem and reflection (below).

Topic: Geography and Math
Question: What is the product of the number of letters contained in the name of the city where Iowa State University is located multiplied by the number of letters contained in the name of the state?
Choices:
    A: 16
    B: 20
    C: 24
    D: 32
Thought:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
ISU is located in the state of Iowa.
Action: Answer("D")
---
Correct Answer: A
## Assistant 1:
Explanation:
I miscalculated the product of the number of letters in the city and state names. 
The gap in my knowledge was not in geography but in basic arithmetic. 
I knew the correct city and state but made a calculation error.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Arithmetic error
 - Multiplication error
Solution:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
Iowa State University is located in the state of Iowa.
The city name "Ames" contains 4 letters.
The state name "Iowa" contains 4 letters.
The product of 4*4 is 16.
Instructions:
1. Identify the city where the university is located.
2. Identify the state where the university is located.
3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.
4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.
5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.
6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.
7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them.

Topic: Law
Context: A government needs to assign new ambassadors to Venezuela, Yemen, and Zambia. The candidates for these ambassadorships are Jaramillo, Kayne, Landon, Novetzke, and Ong. One ambassador will be assigned to each country, and no ambassador will be assigned to more than one country. The assignment of the ambassadors must meet the following constraints: Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships. If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne. If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen. If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
Question: If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then the other two ambassadors assigned could be
Choices:
  A: Jaramillo and Landon
  B: Jaramillo and Novetzke
  C: Kayne and Landon
  D: Kayne and Novetzke
  E: Landon and Novetzke

Thought:
If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne cannot be assigned as ambassador to Yemen. 
If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then Kayne must also be assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
Action: Answer("A") 
If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne cannot be assigned as ambassador to Yemen. Therefore, Kayne and Novetzke must be assigned to Zambia and Yemen, respectively. If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then Kayne must also be assigned to one of the ambassadorships. Therefore, Jaramillo and Kayne must be assigned to Venezuela and Zambia, respectively. Finally, Landon must be assigned to Zambia. Thus, the other two ambassadors assigned could be Jaramillo and Landon.

Correct Answer: E
## Assistant 2:
Response:
Explanation:
I made an error in my reasoning. I did not consider the constraint that either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships. 
Error Keywords:
 - Ignored constraint
 - Misunderstood constraint
 - Overlooked constraint
Solution:
If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne cannot be assigned as ambassador to Yemen. Therefore, Kayne and Novetzke must be assigned to Zambia and Yemen, respectively. If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then Kayne must also be assigned to one of the ambassadorships. Therefore, Jaramillo and Kayne must be assigned to Venezuela and Zambia, respectively. Finally, Landon must be assigned to Zambia. Thus, the other two ambassadors assigned could be Landon and Novetzke.
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and understand the constraints.
2. Identify the constraints and write them down.
3. Use the constraints to eliminate impossible scenarios.
4. Use the constraints to identify possible scenarios.
5. Double-check your reasoning to ensure accuracy.
6. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the constraints.
 - Always write down the constraints to help you visualize the problem.
 - Always use the constraints to eliminate impossible scenarios.
 - Always use the constraints to identify possible scenarios.
 - Always double-check your reasoning to ensure accuracy.
 - Remember that constraints are essential in solving problems.
