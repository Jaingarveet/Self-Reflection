You are an expert in Law.
You have incorrectly answered the following multiple-choice question.
Your task is to reflect on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
You will then use this information help you answer the same question in the future.
First, explain why you answered the question incorrectly.
Second, list the keywords that describe the type of your errors from most general to most specific. 
Third, solve the problem again, step-by-step, based on your knowledge of the correct answer.
Fourth, create a list of detailed instructions to help you correctly solve this problem in the future.
Finally, create a list of general advice to help you solve similar types of problems in the future.  
Be concise in your response; however, capture all of the essential information.  
For guidance, I will provide you with a single generic example problem and reflection (below).

Topic: Geography and Math
Question: What is the product of the number of letters contained in the name of the city where Iowa State University is located multiplied by the number of letters contained in the name of the state?
Choices:
    A: 16
    B: 20
    C: 24
    D: 32
Thought:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
ISU is located in the state of Iowa.
Action: Answer("D")
---
Correct Answer: A
## Assistant 1:
Explanation:
I miscalculated the product of the number of letters in the city and state names. 
The gap in my knowledge was not in geography but in basic arithmetic. 
I knew the correct city and state but made a calculation error.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Arithmetic error
 - Multiplication error
Solution:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
Iowa State University is located in the state of Iowa.
The city name "Ames" contains 4 letters.
The state name "Iowa" contains 4 letters.
The product of 4*4 is 16.
Instructions:
1. Identify the city where the university is located.
2. Identify the state where the university is located.
3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.
4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.
5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.
6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.
7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them.

Topic: Law
Context: A chemistry class has six lab sessions scheduled over three days—Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday—one session heing held each morning and one each afternoon. Each session will be led by a different lab assistant—Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, or Rebecca. The assignment of lab assistants to sessions is constrained as follows: Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day. Nessa must lead an afternoon session. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
Question: If Julio and Kevin both lead morning sessions, then any of the following could be true EXCEPT:
Choices:
  A: Lan's session meets Wednesday morning.
  B: Lan's session meets Thursday afternoon.
  C: Nessa's session meets Friday afternoon.
  D: Olivia's session meets Thursday morning.
  E: Olivia's session meets Friday morning.

Thought:
If Julio and Kevin both lead morning sessions, then Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day. Nessa must lead an afternoon session. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's. 
Action: Answer("B") because if Julio and Kevin both lead morning sessions, then Lan's session cannot meet on Thursday afternoon.

 --- 
Correct Answer: A
## Assistant 2:
Response:
Reflection:
I answered the question incorrectly because I did not consider all the constraints in the problem. I only focused on the constraint that Julio and Kevin must lead morning sessions. I did not consider the other constraints that would limit the possible combinations of lab assistants and lab sessions. 
Error Keywords:
 - Ignored constraints
 - Incomplete analysis
 - Overlooked details
Solution:
To solve the problem, I need to consider all the constraints in the problem. 
If Julio and Kevin both lead morning sessions, then Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day. Nessa must lead an afternoon session. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's. 
If Julio and Kevin both lead morning sessions, then the possible combinations of lab assistants and lab sessions are:
- Wednesday morning: Julio, Kevin, (Lan, Olivia, Nessa, Rebecca)
- Thursday morning: Julio, Kevin, (Lan, Olivia, Nessa, Rebecca)
- Friday morning: (Lan, Olivia, Nessa, Rebecca), Julio, Kevin
Now, I need to check each answer choice to see which one is not possible:
A: Lan's session meets Wednesday morning. Possible.
B: Lan's session meets Thursday afternoon. Not possible because Lan cannot lead a session that meets on the same day as Olivia, and Olivia's session must be on a later day than Julio's.
C: Nessa's session meets Friday afternoon. Possible.
D: Olivia's session meets Thursday morning. Possible.
E: Olivia's session meets Friday morning. Possible.
Therefore, the answer is B.
Instructions:
1. Read the problem carefully and identify all the constraints.
2. Consider all the possible combinations of lab assistants and lab sessions based on the constraints.
3. Check each answer choice to see if it is possible or not based on the possible combinations.
4. Eliminate the answer choices that are possible.
5. Choose the answer choice that is not possible.
6. Double-check your reasoning and answer.
Advice:
 - Always read the problem carefully and identify all the constraints.
 - Consider all the possible combinations of variables based on the constraints.
 - Check each answer choice to see if it is possible or not based on the possible combinations.
 - Eliminate the answer choices that are possible.
 - Choose the answer choice that is not possible.
 - Double-check your reasoning and answer.
