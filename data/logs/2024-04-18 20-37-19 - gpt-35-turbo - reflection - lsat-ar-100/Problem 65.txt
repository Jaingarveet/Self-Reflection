## System:
You are an expert in Law.
You have incorrectly answered the following multiple-choice question.
Your task is to reflect on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
You will then use this information help you answer the same question in the future.
First, explain why you answered the question incorrectly.
Second, list the keywords that describe the type of your errors from most general to most specific. 
Third, solve the problem again, step-by-step, based on your knowledge of the correct answer.
Fourth, create a list of detailed instructions to help you correctly solve this problem in the future.
Finally, create a list of general advice to help you solve similar types of problems in the future.  
Be concise in your response; however, capture all of the essential information.  
For guidance, I will provide you with a single generic example problem and reflection (below).

Topic: Geography and Math
Question: What is the product of the number of letters contained in the name of the city where Iowa State University is located multiplied by the number of letters contained in the name of the state?
Choices:
    A: 16
    B: 20
    C: 24
    D: 32
Thought:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
ISU is located in the state of Iowa.
Action: Answer("D")
---
Correct Answer: A
## Assistant 1:
Explanation:
I miscalculated the product of the number of letters in the city and state names. 
The gap in my knowledge was not in geography but in basic arithmetic. 
I knew the correct city and state but made a calculation error.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Arithmetic error
 - Multiplication error
Solution:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
Iowa State University is located in the state of Iowa.
The city name "Ames" contains 4 letters.
The state name "Iowa" contains 4 letters.
The product of 4*4 is 16.
Instructions:
1. Identify the city where the university is located.
2. Identify the state where the university is located.
3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.
4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.
5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.
6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.
7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them.

Topic: Law
Context: A panel of five scientists will be formed. The panelists will be selected from among three botanists—F, G, and H—three chemists—K, L, and M—and three zoologists—P, Q, and R. Selection is governed by the following conditions: The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types. If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. F and K cannot both be selected. K and M cannot both be selected. If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
Question: If M is the only chemist selected for the panel, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: F and G are both selected.
  B: G and H are both selected.
  C: H and P are both selected.
  D: F, G, and H are all selected.
  E: P, Q, and R are all selected.

Thought:
If M is the only chemist selected, then both F and K are not selected. 
If M is selected, then both P and R must be selected.
At most one zoologist is selected if more than one botanist is selected.
Action: Answer("B") 
If M is the only chemist selected, then P and R must be selected. If F or G is selected, then at most one zoologist can be selected. Therefore, H must be selected to fulfill the requirement of having at least one scientist of each type. This means that G and H are both selected. Thus, the correct answer is B.

Correct Answer: E
## Assistant 2:
Response:
Explanation:
I made an error in my reasoning. 
If M is the only chemist selected, then P and R must be selected. 
If F or G is selected, then at most one zoologist can be selected. 
However, H cannot be selected because it would violate the condition that at most one zoologist can be selected if more than one botanist is selected. 
Therefore, both F and G must be selected, and no zoologist can be selected. 
Thus, the correct answer is E.
Error Keywords:
 - Misinterpretation of the condition
 - Logical error
 - Misreading of the question
Solution:
If M is the only chemist selected, then P and R must be selected. 
If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist can be selected. 
H cannot be selected because it would violate the condition that at most one zoologist can be selected if more than one botanist is selected. 
Therefore, both F and G must be selected, and no zoologist can be selected. 
Thus, the correct answer is E.
