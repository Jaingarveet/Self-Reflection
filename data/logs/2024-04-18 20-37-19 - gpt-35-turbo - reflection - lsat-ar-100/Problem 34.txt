## System:
You are an expert in Law.
You have incorrectly answered the following multiple-choice question.
Your task is to reflect on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
You will then use this information help you answer the same question in the future.
First, explain why you answered the question incorrectly.
Second, list the keywords that describe the type of your errors from most general to most specific. 
Third, solve the problem again, step-by-step, based on your knowledge of the correct answer.
Fourth, create a list of detailed instructions to help you correctly solve this problem in the future.
Finally, create a list of general advice to help you solve similar types of problems in the future.  
Be concise in your response; however, capture all of the essential information.  
For guidance, I will provide you with a single generic example problem and reflection (below).

Topic: Geography and Math
Question: What is the product of the number of letters contained in the name of the city where Iowa State University is located multiplied by the number of letters contained in the name of the state?
Choices:
    A: 16
    B: 20
    C: 24
    D: 32
Thought:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
ISU is located in the state of Iowa.
Action: Answer("D")
---
Correct Answer: A
## Assistant 1:
Explanation:
I miscalculated the product of the number of letters in the city and state names. 
The gap in my knowledge was not in geography but in basic arithmetic. 
I knew the correct city and state but made a calculation error.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Arithmetic error
 - Multiplication error
Solution:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
Iowa State University is located in the state of Iowa.
The city name "Ames" contains 4 letters.
The state name "Iowa" contains 4 letters.
The product of 4*4 is 16.
Instructions:
1. Identify the city where the university is located.
2. Identify the state where the university is located.
3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.
4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.
5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.
6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.
7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them.

Topic: Law
Context: A panel of five scientists will be formed. The panelists will be selected from among three botanists—F, G, and H—three chemists—K, L, and M—and three zoologists—P, Q, and R. Selection is governed by the following conditions: The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types. If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. F and K cannot both be selected. K and M cannot both be selected. If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
Question: If P is the only zoologist selected, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: If K is selected, G cannot be selected.
  B: If L is selected, F cannot be selected.
  C: If exactly one chemist is selected, it must be K.
  D: If exactly two chemists are selected, F cannot be selected.
  E: If exactly two chemists are selected, G cannot be selected.

Thought:
If P is the only zoologist selected, then either F, G, or H must be selected as a botanist and either K, L, or M must be selected as a chemist. 
If M is selected, then both P and R must be selected. 
If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. 
F and K cannot both be selected. 
K and M cannot both be selected. 
Action: Answer("B") 
If L is selected as a chemist, then either F or H must be selected as a botanist. If F is selected, then K cannot be selected. Therefore, if L is selected, F cannot be selected.

Correct Answer: D
## Assistant 2:
Response:
Explanation:
My mistake was in not considering all possible scenarios. 
I only considered the scenario where P is the only zoologist selected, but I did not consider the other conditions. 
I also misinterpreted the question stem. 
The question asks which statement must be true, not which statement could be true. 
Error Keywords:
 - Incomplete analysis
 - Misinterpretation
 - Insufficient consideration of conditions
Solution:
If P is the only zoologist selected, then either F, G, or H must be selected as a botanist and either K, L, or M must be selected as a chemist. 
If M is selected, then both P and R must be selected. 
If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. 
F and K cannot both be selected. 
K and M cannot both be selected. 
Statement A is not necessarily true because if G is selected, then K can still be selected. 
Statement B is not necessarily true because if H is selected, then L can still be selected. 
Statement C is not necessarily true because if L or M is selected, then K does not have to be selected. 
Statement D must be true because if two chemists are selected, and F is not one of them, then K and L or K and M must be selected. If K and M cannot both be selected, then F cannot be selected. 
Statement E is not necessarily true because if H is selected, then both K and L can still be selected. 
Instructions:
1. Read the question stem carefully and understand what is being asked.
2. Consider all possible scenarios and conditions.
3. Eliminate answer choices that are not necessarily true.
4. Determine which answer choice must be true based on the given conditions.
5. Double-check your reasoning and answer choice before submitting.
Advice:
 - Always read the question stem carefully and understand what is being asked.
 - Consider all possible scenarios and conditions before answering.
 - Eliminate answer choices that are not necessarily true.
 - Determine which answer choice must be true based on the given conditions.
 - Double-check your reasoning and answer choice before submitting.
