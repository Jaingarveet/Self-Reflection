You are an expert in Law.
You have incorrectly answered the following multiple-choice question.
Your task is to reflect on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
You will then use this information help you answer the same question in the future.
First, explain why you answered the question incorrectly.
Second, list the keywords that describe the type of your errors from most general to most specific. 
Third, solve the problem again, step-by-step, based on your knowledge of the correct answer.
Fourth, create a list of detailed instructions to help you correctly solve this problem in the future.
Finally, create a list of general advice to help you solve similar types of problems in the future.  
Be concise in your response; however, capture all of the essential information.  
For guidance, I will provide you with a single generic example problem and reflection (below).

Topic: Geography and Math
Question: What is the product of the number of letters contained in the name of the city where Iowa State University is located multiplied by the number of letters contained in the name of the state?
Choices:
    A: 16
    B: 20
    C: 24
    D: 32
Thought:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
ISU is located in the state of Iowa.
Action: Answer("D")
---
Correct Answer: A
## Assistant 1:
Explanation:
I miscalculated the product of the number of letters in the city and state names. 
The gap in my knowledge was not in geography but in basic arithmetic. 
I knew the correct city and state but made a calculation error.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Arithmetic error
 - Multiplication error
Solution:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
Iowa State University is located in the state of Iowa.
The city name "Ames" contains 4 letters.
The state name "Iowa" contains 4 letters.
The product of 4*4 is 16.
Instructions:
1. Identify the city where the university is located.
2. Identify the state where the university is located.
3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.
4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.
5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.
6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.
7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them.

Topic: Law
Context: An administrator must assign parking spaces to six new employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young. Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
Question: If Young is assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Togowa is assigned parking space #1.
  B: Young is assigned parking space #2.
  C: Robertson is assigned parking space #3.
  D: Souza is assigned parking space #3.
  E: Vaughn is assigned parking space #4.

Thought:
Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
If Young is assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, then Souza must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
Action: Answer("D")

 --- 
Correct Answer: A
## Assistant 2:
Response:
Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that Souza must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. However, the question stem only states that if Young is assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, then which one of the following could be true. Therefore, Souza could be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. 
Error Keywords:
 - Misreading the question stem
 - Incorrect assumption
 - Misinterpretation of the rules
Solution:
Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
If Young is assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, then Souza must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
If Togowa is assigned parking space #1, then Young must be assigned parking space #2, Robertson must be assigned parking space #3, and Xu must be assigned parking space #4. Therefore, A could be true.
Instructions:
1. Read the question stem carefully and understand the problem.
2. Identify the rules that govern the assignment of parking spaces.
3. Identify any constraints or limitations on the assignment of parking spaces.
4. Consider all possible scenarios based on the given rules and constraints.
5. Eliminate any answer choices that violate the rules or constraints.
6. Choose the answer choice that could be true based on the given rules and constraints.
Advice:
 - Always read the question stem carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always identify the rules that govern the problem.
 - Always consider all possible scenarios based on the given rules and constraints.
 - Never make assumptions that are not explicitly stated in the question stem.
 - Always eliminate any answer choices that violate the rules or constraints.
 - Remember that the correct answer is not always the most obvious one.
