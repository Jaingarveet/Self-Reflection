## System:
You are an expert in Law.
You have incorrectly answered the following multiple-choice question.
Your task is to reflect on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
You will then use this information help you answer the same question in the future.
First, explain why you answered the question incorrectly.
Second, list the keywords that describe the type of your errors from most general to most specific. 
Third, solve the problem again, step-by-step, based on your knowledge of the correct answer.
Fourth, create a list of detailed instructions to help you correctly solve this problem in the future.
Finally, create a list of general advice to help you solve similar types of problems in the future.  
Be concise in your response; however, capture all of the essential information.  
For guidance, I will provide you with a single generic example problem and reflection (below).

Topic: Geography and Math
Question: What is the product of the number of letters contained in the name of the city where Iowa State University is located multiplied by the number of letters contained in the name of the state?
Choices:
    A: 16
    B: 20
    C: 24
    D: 32
Thought:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
ISU is located in the state of Iowa.
Action: Answer("D")
---
Correct Answer: A
## Assistant 1:
Explanation:
I miscalculated the product of the number of letters in the city and state names. 
The gap in my knowledge was not in geography but in basic arithmetic. 
I knew the correct city and state but made a calculation error.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Arithmetic error
 - Multiplication error
Solution:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
Iowa State University is located in the state of Iowa.
The city name "Ames" contains 4 letters.
The state name "Iowa" contains 4 letters.
The product of 4*4 is 16.
Instructions:
1. Identify the city where the university is located.
2. Identify the state where the university is located.
3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.
4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.
5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.
6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.
7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them.

Topic: Law
Context: A loading dock consists of exactly six bays numbered 1 through 6 consecutively from one side of the dock to the other. Each bay is holding a different one of exactly six types of cargoâ€”fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles. The following apply: The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock. The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles. The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel. The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
Question: If the bay holding produce is next to the bay holding livestock, then each of the following could be true EXCEPT:
Choices:
  A: Bay 2 is holding fuel.
  B: Bay 4 is holding produce.
  C: Bay 4 is holding textiles.
  D: Bay 5 is holding grain.
  E: Bay 5 is holding machinery.

Thought:
If the bay holding produce is next to the bay holding livestock, then the bay holding livestock must be either bay 3 or bay 4. 
If the bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce, then the bay holding textiles must be either bay 3 or bay 5.
If the bay holding livestock is in bay 3, then the bay holding produce must be in bay 4. 
If the bay holding livestock is in bay 4, then the bay holding produce must be in bay 3. 
If the bay holding produce is in bay 4, then bay 5 must hold textiles and bay 3 must hold livestock. 
If the bay holding produce is in bay 3, then bay 5 must hold textiles and bay 4 must hold livestock. 
Therefore, bay 4 cannot hold produce if the bay holding produce is next to the bay holding livestock.
Action: Answer("B")

 --- 
Correct Answer: C
## Assistant 2:
Response:
Explanation:
I incorrectly identified the bay that could not hold a particular type of cargo. 
The correct answer is C because if the bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce, then the bay holding textiles must be either bay 3 or bay 5. Therefore, bay 4 cannot hold textiles. 
Error Keywords:
 - Misreading the question
 - Misinterpreting the problem
 - Logical error
Solution:
If the bay holding produce is next to the bay holding livestock, then the bay holding livestock must be either bay 3 or bay 4. 
If the bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce, then the bay holding textiles must be either bay 3 or bay 5.
If the bay holding livestock is in bay 3, then the bay holding produce must be in bay 4. 
If the bay holding livestock is in bay 4, then the bay holding produce must be in bay 3. 
If the bay holding produce is in bay 4, then bay 5 must hold textiles and bay 3 must hold livestock. 
If the bay holding produce is in bay 3, then bay 5 must hold textiles and bay 4 must hold livestock. 
Therefore, bay 4 cannot hold textiles if the bay holding produce is next to the bay holding livestock.
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and understand the problem.
2. Identify the constraints and relationships between the bays and the cargo types.
3. Use logical reasoning to eliminate the possible options.
4. Double-check your reasoning to ensure accuracy.
5. Choose the answer that does not fit the constraints.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always identify the constraints and relationships between the variables.
 - Always use logical reasoning to eliminate the possible options.
 - Never rush through the problem-solving process.
 - Always double-check your reasoning to ensure accuracy.
 - Remember that logical reasoning is a powerful tool in problem-solving.
