## System:
You are an expert in Law.
You have incorrectly answered the following multiple-choice question.
Your task is to reflect on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
You will then use this information help you answer the same question in the future.
First, explain why you answered the question incorrectly.
Second, list the keywords that describe the type of your errors from most general to most specific. 
Third, solve the problem again, step-by-step, based on your knowledge of the correct answer.
Fourth, create a list of detailed instructions to help you correctly solve this problem in the future.
Finally, create a list of general advice to help you solve similar types of problems in the future.  
Be concise in your response; however, capture all of the essential information.  
For guidance, I will provide you with a single generic example problem and reflection (below).

Topic: Geography and Math
Question: What is the product of the number of letters contained in the name of the city where Iowa State University is located multiplied by the number of letters contained in the name of the state?
Choices:
    A: 16
    B: 20
    C: 24
    D: 32
Thought:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
ISU is located in the state of Iowa.
Action: Answer("D")
---
Correct Answer: A
## Assistant 1:
Explanation:
I miscalculated the product of the number of letters in the city and state names. 
The gap in my knowledge was not in geography but in basic arithmetic. 
I knew the correct city and state but made a calculation error.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Arithmetic error
 - Multiplication error
Solution:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
Iowa State University is located in the state of Iowa.
The city name "Ames" contains 4 letters.
The state name "Iowa" contains 4 letters.
The product of 4*4 is 16.
Instructions:
1. Identify the city where the university is located.
2. Identify the state where the university is located.
3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.
4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.
5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.
6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.
7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them.

Topic: Law
Context: At a concert, exactly eight compositions—F, H, L, O, P, R, S, and T—are to be performed exactly once each, consecutively and one composition at a time. The order of their performance must satisfy the following conditions: T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R. At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F. O is performed either first or fifth. The eighth composition performed is either L or H. P is performed at some time before S. At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
Question: If O is performed immediately after T, then F must be performed either
Choices:
  A: first or second
  B: second or third
  C: fourth or sixth
  D: fourth or seventh
  E: sixth or seventh

Thought:
If O is performed immediately after T, then the order of the compositions must be T, O, and then the remaining six compositions. 
T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R. 
If T is performed immediately after R, then F must be performed immediately before T. 
If T is performed immediately before F, then at least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F. 
Therefore, F must be performed either fourth or seventh.
Action: Answer("D")

Correct Answer: E
## Assistant 2:
Response:
Explanation:
My reasoning was correct up to a point, but I made an error in identifying the possible positions for the composition F. 
If O is performed immediately after T, then the order of the compositions must be T, O, and then the remaining six compositions. 
T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R. 
If T is performed immediately after R, then F must be performed immediately before T. 
If T is performed immediately before F, then at least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F. 
Therefore, F must be performed either fourth or seventh.
However, I missed the fact that the eighth composition performed is either L or H, which means that F cannot be performed seventh. 
Error Keywords:
 - Missed information
 - Logical error
 - Positioning error
Solution:
If O is performed immediately after T, then the order of the compositions must be T, O, and then the remaining six compositions. 
T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R. 
If T is performed immediately after R, then F must be performed immediately before T. 
If T is performed immediately before F, then at least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F. 
The eighth composition performed is either L or H. 
P is performed at some time before S. 
At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
If F is performed fourth, then R must be performed immediately before T, and S must be performed immediately after O. 
If F is performed sixth, then R must be performed immediately after T, and P must be performed before S. 
Therefore, F must be performed either sixth or seventh.
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and understand the problem.
