## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
All the materials listed can be recycled, but not all can be reused many times. Paper and plastic degrade each time they are recycled, reducing their quality and limiting the number of times they can be reused. Steel cans and glass bottles, on the other hand, can be recycled indefinitely without losing their quality.

Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
