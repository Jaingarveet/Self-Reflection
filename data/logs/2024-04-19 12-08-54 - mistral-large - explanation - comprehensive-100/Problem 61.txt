## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Explanation:
I made an error in expanding the equation and solving for the variables.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
To solve this problem, I need to expand the equation $(a x+2)(b x+7)$ and compare it to $15 x^{2}+c x+14$.
Expanding the equation gives $a b x^{2}+7 a x+2 b x+14$.
Since $a+b=8$, I can rewrite $a$ as $8-b$.
Substituting this into the expanded equation gives $8 b x^{2}-b^{2} x^{2}+56 x-7 b x+2 b x+14$.
Combining like terms gives $-b^{2} x^{2}+8 b x^{2}+49 x+14$.
Comparing this to $15 x^{2}+c x+14$, I can see that $-b^{2}+8 b=15$ and $49=c$.
Solving for $b$ gives $b=3$ or $b=5$.
Substituting these values back into $a+b=8$ gives $a=5$ or $a=3$, respectively.
Therefore, the two possible values for $c$ are $3 \times 5+7 \times 3=31$ and $5 \times 7+7 \times 5=70$.
However, none of the answer choices match these values.

Action: Answer("None of the Above")

Reflection:
I made an error in calculating the possible values for $c$.
I should have calculated $c$ as $7a + 2b$ instead of $ab + 7a + 2b$.
The correct values for $c$ are $3 \times 5+2 \times 3=21$ and $5 \times 7+2 \times 5=45$.
Therefore, the correct answer is "C: 10 and 21".

Action: Answer("C")
