Explanation:
I miscalculated the product of the number of letters in the city and state names. The gap in my knowledge was not in geography but in basic arithmetic. I knew the correct city and state but made a calculation error.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The ages of the members are in an arithmetic progression with a common difference of 3 months (or 1/4 year).
The youngest member is 7 years old, so the first term (a) is 7.
The sum of the ages of all the members is 250 years.
We can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic progression: S = n/2 \* (2a + (n-1)d), where n is the number of terms, a is the first term, and d is the common difference.
Substituting the given values, we get: 250 = n/2 \* (2 \* 7 + (n-1) \* 1/4).
Solving for n, we get: n = 20.
Action: Answer("B")

Correct Answer: C
