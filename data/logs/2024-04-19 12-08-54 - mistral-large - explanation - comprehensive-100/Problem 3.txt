## Assistant 2:
Thought:
To reach a salary of at least $1000, the sales person must make a total commission of $1000.
The commission on each sale is 10% of $250, which is $25.
The number of sales required is the total commission divided by the commission per sale.

Action: Answer("D")

Explanation:
The correct calculation is $1000 / $25 = 40.
I previously made a calculation error, but now I have corrected it.
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
