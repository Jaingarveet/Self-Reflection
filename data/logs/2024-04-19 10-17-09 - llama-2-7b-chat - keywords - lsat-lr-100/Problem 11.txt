Context: To accommodate the personal automobile, houses are built on widely scattered lots far from places of work and shopping malls are equipped with immense parking lots that leave little room for wooded areas. Hence, had people generally not used personal automobiles, the result would have to have been a geography of modern cities quite different from the one we have now.
Question: The argument's reasoning is questionable because the argument
Choices:
  A: infers from the idea that the current geography of modern cities resulted from a particular cause that it could only have resulted from that cause
  B: infers from the idea that the current geography of modern cities resulted from a particular cause that other facets of modern life resulted from that cause
  C: overlooks the fact that many technological innovations other than the personal automobile have had some effect on the way people live
  D: takes for granted that shopping malls do not need large parking lots even given the use of the personal automobile
  E: takes for granted that people ultimately want to live without personal automobiles

  Topic: Law
Question: The argument's reasoning is questionable because the argument

Reflection:

I previously answered this question incorrectly, and upon reflection, I realized that I made a mistake in my reasoning. Here is my self-reflection:

* I incorrectly inferred that the argument infers that the current geography of modern cities resulted from the use of personal automobiles, when in fact, the argument only suggests that the use of personal automobiles has contributed to the current geography of modern cities.
* I overlooked the fact that other technological innovations, such as public transportation, have also had an impact on the way people live and the geography of modern cities.
* I took for granted that shopping malls do not need large parking lots, even given the use of personal automobiles, when in fact, the size of parking lots in shopping malls may be influenced by a variety of factors, including the number of shoppers and the availability of alternative transportation options.
