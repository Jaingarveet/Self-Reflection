  Topic: Law
Question: Which one of the following most closely conforms to the principle above?

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and then I reflected on the problem, my solution, and the correct answer.

The correct answer is (B) A salesperson should understand that the commission earned is not the only reward of making a sale. Salespeople should also take satisfaction from the fact that successful sales reflect well on their personalities.

Explanation:
The principle above states that challenge can be an important source of self-knowledge, since those who pay attention to how they react, both emotionally and physically, to challenge can gain useful insights into their own weaknesses. This principle is closely related to the idea that the reward of a challenge is not just the outcome, but also the personal growth and self-awareness that comes from facing and overcoming challenges.

In the given options, (B) A salesperson should understand that the commission earned is not the only reward of making a sale. Salespeople should also take satisfaction from the fact that successful sales reflect well on their personalities. best conforms to this principle. The salesperson should not only be motivated by the financial reward of a sale, but also by the personal satisfaction of doing a good job and representing themselves well.

(A) A concert pianist should not have an entirely negative view of a memory lapse during a difficult performance. By understanding why the memory lapse occurred, the pianist can better prepare for future performances. does not conform to the principle as it does not focus on the personal growth and self-awareness that comes from facing and overcoming challenges.

(C) Compassion is valuable not only for the wonderful feelings it brings, but also for the opportunities it affords to enrich the lives of other people. is not directly related to the principle, as it does not involve personal growth or self-awareness.

(D) While some of the value of competition comes from the pleasure of winning, the primary reward of competition is competition itself. is partially related to the principle, as the value of competition can come from the personal growth and self-awareness that comes from facing and overcoming challenges. However, the principle focuses specifically on the personal satisfaction that comes from successful sales, rather than the pleasure of winning.

(E) Even people who dread public speaking should accept invitations to speak before large groups. People will admire their courage and they will experience the fulfillment of having attempted something that is difficult for them. is not directly related to the principle, as it does not involve personal growth or self-awareness. While it may provide a sense of accomplishment and self-confidence, it does not specifically focus on the personal satisfaction that comes from successful sales.
