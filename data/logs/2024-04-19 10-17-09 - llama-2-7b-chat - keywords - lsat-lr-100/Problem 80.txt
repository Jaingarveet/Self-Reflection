## User 2:
Topic: Law
Context: Journalist: A manufacturers' trade group that has long kept its membership list secret inadvertently sent me a document listing hundreds of manufacturing companies. A representative of the trade group later confirmed that every company listed in the document does indeed belong to the trade group. Because Bruch Industries is not listed on the document, it is evidently not a member of the trade group.
Question: The journalist's reasoning in the argument is flawed in that the journalist
Choices:
  A: gives no reason to think that Bruch Industries would want to belong to the trade group
  B: does not present any evidence that the document names every member of the trade group
  C: does not explain how it is that the trade group could have inadvertently sent out a secret document
  D: presents no reason why Bruch Industries would not want its membership in the trade group to be known

Question: The journalist's reasoning in the argument is flawed in that the journalist

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I realize now that I made a mistake in my reasoning. Here is my self-reflection:

* I incorrectly assumed that the journalist's conclusion that Bruch Industries is not a member of the trade group because it was not listed on the document. However, the representative of the trade group confirmed that every company listed in the document does indeed belong to the trade group, which means that Bruch Industries may still be a member of the trade group, even if it was not listed on the document.
* I did not consider the possibility that the trade group may have a larger membership list than what was listed on the document, and that Bruch Industries may be a member of the trade group but not listed on the document for some reason.
* I also did not consider the possibility that the trade group may have a different criteria for membership than what was listed on the document, and that Bruch Industries may meet the criteria for membership but not be listed on the document.
