Context: Museum curakor: Our ancient Egyptian collection includes an earthenware hippopotamus that resembles a child's roy. It was discovered in a tomb, upside down, with its legs broken off. We know that the ancient Egyptians believed the dead had to wage eternal war with beasts. Breaking the legs off a representation of an animal was thought to help a deceased person in this war. We conclude that, far from being a roy, this hippopotamus was a religious object.
Question: Which one of the following is an assumption required by the curator's argument?
Choices:
  A: The tomb in which the hippopotamus was found was not the tomb of a child.
  B: Earthenware figures were never used as children's roys in ancient Egypt.
  C: The tomb in which the hippopotamus was found was not reentered from the time of burial until archaeologists opened it.
  D: The hippopotamus' legs were not broken 1hrough some natural occurrence after it was placed in the tomb.
  E: The hippopotamus was originally placed upside down in the tomb.

Question: Which one of the following is an assumption required by the curator's argument?

Reflection:

I previously answered this question incorrectly, and upon reflection, I realized that I made an assumption that was not supported by the information provided. The correct answer is (C) The tomb in which the hippopotamus was found was not reentered from the time of burial until archaeologists opened it.

Explanation:
The curator's argument relies on the idea that the hippopotamus was placed in the tomb upside down, which suggests that it was a religious object rather than a child's toy. The argument also implies that the tomb was not reentered until archaeologists opened it, which means that the hippopotamus remained in the tomb undisturbed for a significant period of time. Therefore, assumption (C) is the one that is required by the curator's argument.

Error Keywords:

* REDACTED (information not provided in the passage)
* B (Earthenware figures were never used as children's toys in ancient Egypt) (this is not true, as the passage states that the hippopotamus was found in a tomb with other earthenware figures)
* D (The hippopotamus' legs were not broken through some natural occurrence after it was placed in the tomb) (this is not relevant to the argument, as the curator is arguing that the hippopotamus was a religious object, not that it was broken naturally)
* E (The hippopotamus was originally placed upside down in the tomb) (this is not stated in the passage, and the curator's argument does not rely on this assumption)
## Result:
Agent Answer: None
Correct Answer: D
