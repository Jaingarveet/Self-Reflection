Question: The conclusion drawn above follows logically if which one of the following is assumed?

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and after reflecting on my solution and the correct answer, I realized that I made a mistake. Here is my self-reflection:

I assumed that the answer was (A) Everyone suspects self-righteous people of being, in actuality, unethical. However, upon further reflection, I realize that this assumption is not necessarily true. While it is possible that some people may hold this belief, it is not necessarily a universal assumption.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) Ellsworth has been accused of unethical business practices before. This conclusion follows logically from the information provided in the passage, as Ellsworth is described as being self-righteous and touting the idealism of his generation over the greed of the previous generation. It is reasonable to assume that if he has been accused of unethical business practices before, he would be offended by suggestions that he has engaged in such practices.

Action: Answer("B")

Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: E
