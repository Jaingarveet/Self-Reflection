Question: Which one of the following arguments has a flawed pattern of reasoning most like the flawed reasoning in the argument above?

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and upon reflection, I realized that I made a mistake in my reasoning. Here is my self-reflection:

* I mistakenly assumed that the argument was trying to prove that most people in Hallstown buy prepared frozen dinners regularly, when in fact, the argument is trying to prove that most people in Hallstown shop for groceries no more than three times a month.
* I failed to notice that the argument is using a different criteria to make its conclusion, which is the number of times people shop for groceries, rather than the purchase of prepared frozen dinners.

Now, let me analyze the given options and determine which one has a flawed pattern of reasoning most like the flawed reasoning in the argument above:

A) It is clear that most drivers in West Ansland are safe drivers since there are very few driving accidents in West Ansland and most accidents there are not serious.

* This argument is similar to the original argument in that it makes a conclusion based on a specific criteria (the number of accidents in West Ansland). However, it is different in that it is using a different criteria (the number of accidents) and making a different conclusion (that most drivers in West Ansland are safe drivers).

B) It is clear that John cannot drive, since he does not own a car and no one in his family who does not own a car can drive.

* This argument is different from the original argument in that it is making a conclusion based on a specific condition (whether or not John owns a car) rather than a specific criteria (the number of times people shop for groceries).

C) It is clear that Fernando's friends usually drive to school, since all of his friends can drive and all of his friends go to school.

* This argument is similar to the original argument in that it makes a conclusion based on a specific criteria (the ability of Fernando's friends to drive). However, it is different in that it is using a different criteria (the ability of Fernando's friends to drive) and making a different conclusion (that Fernando's friends usually drive to school).

D) It is clear that most people in Highland County drive sedans, since most people who commute to work drive sedans and most people in Highland County commute to work.

* This argument is similar to the original argument in that it makes a conclusion based on a specific criteria (the type of car people in Highland County drive). However, it is different in that it is using a different criteria (the type of car people in Highland County commute to work) and making a different conclusion (that most people in Highland County drive sedans).

E) It is clear that most of Janine's friends are good drivers, since she accepts rides only from good drivers and she accepts rides from most of her friends.

* This argument is different from the original argument in that it is making a conclusion based on a specific condition (whether or not Janine's friends are good drivers) rather than a specific criteria (the number of times people shop for groceries).

Therefore, the answer is (B) It is clear that John cannot drive, since he does not own a car and no one in his family who does not own a car can drive. The argument has a flawed pattern of reasoning most like the flawed reasoning in the argument above.
