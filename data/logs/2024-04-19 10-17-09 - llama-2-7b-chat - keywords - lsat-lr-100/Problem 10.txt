## Assistant 2:
  Thought:
Mike's reasoning is that it would not be wrong for him to use Tom's computer even though Tom did not give permission. This is similar to the situation where Tom used Mary's bicycle without permission.

Action: Answer("C")

Explanation:
The principle that would most help justify Mike's reasoning is option C: If people have used your property without your permission, it is not wrong for you to use their property without their permission. This principle suggests that if someone has used Mike's property without permission, then it is not wrong for Mike to use their property without permission in return. However, this principle only applies if the person who is using the property without permission has been wronged in some way, such as if they have been harmed by the use of their property (option E). In this case, Mike has not been wronged, as he has not been harmed by Tom's use of his computer. Therefore, option C is the best answer.
