Context: There are 70 to 100 Florida panthers alive today. This represents a very large increase over their numbers in the 1970s, but their population must reach at least 250 if it is to be self-sustaining. Their current habitat is not large enough to support any more of these animals, however.
Question: If the statements above are true, which one of the following must also be true?
Choices:
  A: Some part of the panthers' current habitat is only of marginal quality.
  B: If the population of Florida panthers ever exceeds 250, it will be self-sustaining.
  C: Unless Florida panthers acquire a larger habitat, their population will not be self-sustaining.
  D: The population of Florida panthers will never increase much beyond its current level.
  E: Today, Florida panthers occupy a larger habitat than they did in the 1970s.

## Assistant 2:
  Thought:
I previously answered Choice B, "If the population of Florida panthers ever exceeds 250, it will be self-sustaining," as the correct answer. However, upon reflection, I realize that this answer is not correct. The statement "If the population of Florida panthers ever exceeds 250, it will be self-sustaining" does not necessarily follow from the given information.

Reflection:
I reflected on the problem and my previous answer. I realized that the statement "Unless Florida panthers acquire a larger habitat, their population will not be self-sustaining" is the correct answer. This statement is supported by the information provided in the question, which states that the current habitat is not large enough to support any more of these animals, and that their population must reach at least 250 if it is to be self-sustaining.

Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
