Context: Many people say that the press should not pry into the personal lives of private individuals. But the press has the right to publish any story of interest to the public unless that story is libelous. So, if a story about a private individual is not libelous, the press has an obligation to publish it, for such information is clearly of interest to the public.

Question: The argument's reasoning is vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that the argument presumes, without giving warrant, that

Reflection:

I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I realize now that I made a mistake in my reasoning. Here is my self-reflection:

* I mistakenly assumed that the argument was saying that the press has an obligation to publish nonlibelous stories about private individuals without prying into their personal lives. However, the argument does not make this claim.
* I also misunderstood the argument's reasoning, assuming that it was based on the idea that one's having a right to do something entails one's having an obligation to do it. However, the argument does not rely on this idea.
* I should have realized that the argument is actually saying that if a story about a private individual is not libelous, then the press has an obligation to publish it, regardless of whether it prys into their personal lives.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) the publishing of information about the personal lives of private individuals cannot be libelous.

Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: B
