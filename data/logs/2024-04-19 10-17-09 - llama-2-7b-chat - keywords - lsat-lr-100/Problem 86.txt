Context: Until 1985 all commercial airlines completely replenished the cabin air in planes in flight once every 30 minutes. Since then the rate has been once every hour. The less frequently cabin air is replenished in a plane in flight, the higher the level of carbon dioxide in that plane and the easier it is for airborne illnesses to be spread.
Question: Which one of the following is most strongly supported by the information above?
Choices:
  A: In 1985 there was a loosening of regulations concerning cabin air in commercial airline flights.
  B: People who fly today are more likely to contract airborne illnesses than were people who flew prior to 1985.
  C: Low levels of carbon dioxide in cabin air make it impossible for airborne illnesses to spread.
  D: In 1980 the rate at which the cabin air was replenished in commercial airliners was sufficient to protect passengers from the effects of carbon dioxide buildup.
  E: In 1980 the level of carbon dioxide in the cabin air on a two-hour commercial airline flight was lower than it is today on a similar flight.

  Topic: Law
Question: Which one of the following is most strongly supported by the information above?

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and after reflecting on my solution and the correct answer, I realized that I made a mistake. Here is my self-reflection:

I incorrectly selected option A, "In 1985 there was a loosening of regulations concerning cabin air in commercial airline flights." However, upon further analysis, I realized that the information provided does not support this answer. The passage states that until 1985, commercial airlines completely replenished the cabin air in planes in flight once every 30 minutes, but since then, the rate has been once every hour. This suggests that there has been no change in regulations regarding cabin air in commercial airline flights.

Therefore, the most strongly supported answer is option B, "People who fly today are more likely to contract airborne illnesses than were people who flew prior to 1985." This is because the passage states that the level of carbon dioxide in the cabin air increases with the frequency of replenishment, which means that the longer a flight is, the higher the level of carbon dioxide will be. This makes it easier for airborne illnesses to spread.

Action: Answer("B")
