## User 2:
Topic: Law
Context: Rossi: It is undemocratic for people to live under a government in which their interests are not represented. So children should have the right to vote, since sometimes the interests of children are different from those of their parents. Smith: Granted, children's interests are not always the same as their parents'; governmental deficits incurred by their parents' generation will later affect their own generation's standard of living. But even if children are told about the issues affecting them, which is not generally the case, their conceptions of what can or should be done are too simple, and their time horizons are radically different from those of adults, so we cannot give them the responsibility of voting.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes Rossi's argument?
Choices:
  A: It makes an appeal to a general principle.
  B: It denies the good faith of an opponent.
  C: It relies on evaluating the predictable consequences of a proposal.
  D: It substitutes description for giving a rationale for a policy.
  E: It employs a term on two different occasions in different senses.

  B: It denies the good faith of an opponent.
  C: It relies on evaluating the predictable consequences of a proposal.
  D: It substitutes description for giving a rationale for a policy.
  E: It employs a term on two different occasions in different senses.

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly as choice D: It substitutes description for giving a rationale for a policy. However, upon further reflection, I realize that Rossi's argument is best described as choice A: It makes an appeal to a general principle. Rossi argues that children should have the right to vote because their interests are not always the same as those of their parents, and this is a general principle that should be considered in the democratic process.

Error Keywords:

* REDACTED

Explanation:
In my initial answer, I misunderstood the nature of Rossi's argument. I thought he was denying the good faith of an opponent (choice B), or relying on evaluating the predictable consequences of a proposal (choice C), rather than making an appeal to a general principle (choice A). My reflection on the problem and my previous answer helped me to recognize the error of my previous response and to arrive at the correct answer.
## Result:
Agent Answer: None
Correct Answer: A
