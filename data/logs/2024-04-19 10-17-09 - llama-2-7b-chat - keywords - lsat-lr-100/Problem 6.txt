Reflection:

I previously answered this question incorrectly, and after reflecting on the problem, my solution, and the correct answer, I realize that I made a mistake. The correct answer is (C): an explanation of the basics of composting must include an explanation of the difference between hot and cold composting.

Here's my reasoning:

The argument states that any gardening book that recommends adding compost is flawed if it does not explain at least the basics of composting. This implies that understanding the basics of composting is necessary to properly use compost in gardening. The difference between hot and cold composting is a fundamental aspect of composting, as it affects the speed and efficiency of the composting process. Therefore, an explanation of the basics of composting must include an explanation of the difference between hot and cold composting.
