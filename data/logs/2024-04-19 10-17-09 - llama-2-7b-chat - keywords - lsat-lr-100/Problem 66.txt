Context: Lawyer: Juries are traditionally given their instructions in convoluted, legalistic language. The verbiage is intended to make the instructions more precise, but greater precision is of little use if most jurors have difficulty understanding the instructions. Since it is more important for jurors to have a basic but adequate understanding of their role than it is for the details of that role to be precisely specified, jury instructions should be formulated in simple, easily comprehensible language.

Choices:
  A: Most jurors are less likely to understand instructions given in convoluted, legalistic language than instructions given in simple, easily comprehensible language.
  B: Most jurors do not have an adequate understanding of their role after being given jury instructions in convoluted, legalistic language.
  C: Jury instructions formulated in simple, easily comprehensible language can adequately descrthe the role of the jurors.
  D: The details of the role of the jurors cannot be specified with complete precision in simple, easily comprehensible language.

  Topic: Law
Context: Lawyer
Question: Each of the following, if true, strengthens the lawyer's argument EXCEPT:

Choices:
A: Most jurors are less likely to understand instructions given in convoluted, legalistic language than instructions given in simple, easily comprehensible language.

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and after reflecting on the problem, my solution, and the correct answer, I realized that I misunderstood the context of the question. The correct answer is (B) Most jurors do not have an adequate understanding of their role after being given jury instructions in convoluted, legalistic language.

Explanation:
The passage highlights the importance of jury instructions being formulated in simple, easily comprehensible language to ensure that jurors have a basic but adequate understanding of their role. The argument is that jurors do not need to know the precise details of their role in order to have an adequate understanding of that role. Therefore, option (E) Jurors do not need to know the precise details of their role in order to have an adequate understanding of that role is incorrect.

On the other hand, option (A) Most jurors are less likely to understand instructions given in convoluted, legalistic language than instructions given in simple, easily comprehensible language is supported by the passage, as it highlights the importance of simple language in ensuring that jurors have a basic but adequate understanding of their role.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) Most jurors do not have an adequate understanding of their role after being given jury instructions in convoluted, legalistic language.
