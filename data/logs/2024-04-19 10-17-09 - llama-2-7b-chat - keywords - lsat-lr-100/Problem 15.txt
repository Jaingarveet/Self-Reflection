Question: Morgenstern's argument is flawed in that it

Reflection:

I previously answered this question as (B) relies on an assumption that is tantamount to assuming that the conclusion is true. However, upon further reflection, I realize that my answer was incorrect. Morgenstern's argument is actually (E) reaches a generalization on the basis of a single case.

Morgenstern's argument is based on the assumption that quitting one's job will lead to unhappiness, which is a generalization based on Brooks' individual case. However, this assumption may not be true for everyone, and there may be other factors that could affect one's happiness in their job. Therefore, Morgenstern's argument is flawed because it oversimplifies the situation and fails to consider the complexity of the issue.
