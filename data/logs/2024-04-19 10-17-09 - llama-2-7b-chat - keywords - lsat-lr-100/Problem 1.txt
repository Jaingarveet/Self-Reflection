## Assistant 2:
  Thought: 
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand that the statements given are contradictory.
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland, which is a humid climate, and orange trees cannot grow in cold climates.
Action: Answer("D")
Explanation:
The statements given indicate that it is either easy to grow cacti or easy to raise orange trees in most parts of the country.
Therefore, the statement "Half of the country is both humid and cold" is false, as it would be mutually exclusive to have both humid and cold climates in the same area.
Option B is also false, as most of the country is not hot.
Option C is also false, as some parts of the country are neither cold nor humid.
Option E is false, as most parts of the country are not humid.
Therefore, the correct answer is (D) It is not possible to raise cacti in the country.
