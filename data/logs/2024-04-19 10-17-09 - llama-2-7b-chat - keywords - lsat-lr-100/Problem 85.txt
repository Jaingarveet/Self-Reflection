  Topic: Law
Question: Which one of the following, if true, provides the most support for the president's prediction?

Reflection:
Initial Answer:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I realize now that I overlooked an important factor. The correct answer is (A): Ditalgame has spent millions of dollars developing the new copy protection feature, and the company can recoup these costs only if its sales increase substantially.

Explanation:
The president of Ditalgame predicts a substantial increase in sales of the company's games once the new copy protection feature is implemented. This statement suggests that the success of the new copy protection feature depends on its ability to increase sales. If Ditalgame has spent millions of dollars developing this feature, it is crucial that it leads to a significant increase in sales to justify the investment.

(B) Over the last several years, the market for computer games has grown steadily, but Ditalgame's share of that market has shrunk considerably. This information does not directly support the president's prediction, as it only provides a general trend in the market without mentioning Ditalgame's specific situation.

(C) The copy protection feature causes a copied game to be playable just long enough for most people to come to enjoy it so much that they decide they have to have it. This statement is not relevant to the president's prediction, as it does not address the issue of copy protection directly.

(D) Game Review Monthly, the most commonly read magazine among people who frequently copy computer games, generally gives favorable reviews to Ditalgame games. While this information may indicate that Ditalgame's games are of high quality, it does not necessarily support the president's prediction, as it does not address the issue of copy protection.

(E) Computer games produced by Ditalgame are copied more frequently than computer games produced by other companies. This information is irrelevant to the president's prediction, as it does not provide any insight into the effectiveness of the new copy protection feature.

In conclusion, the correct answer is (A), as it directly addresses the issue of sales and the investment made in the new copy protection feature.
