## User 2:
Topic: Law
Context: Editorial: Cell-phone usage on buses and trains is annoying to other passengers. This suggests that recent proposals to allow use of cell phones on airplanes are ill-advised. Cell-phone use would be far more upsetting on airplanes than it is on buses and trains. Airline passengers are usually packed in tightly. And if airline passengers are offended by the cell-phone excesses of their seatmates, they often cannot move to another seat.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes the role played in the editorial's argument by the statement that cell-phone use would be far more upsetting on airplanes than it is on buses and trains?
Choices:
  A: It is the main conclusion of the argument.
  B: It is a claim that the argument tries to rebut.
  C: It is a premise that indirectly supports the main conclusion of the argument by supporting a premise for that conclusion.
  D: It is a conclusion for which support is provided and that itself is used in turn to directly support the argument's main conclusion.
  E: It provides background information that plays no role in the reasoning in the argument.

## Assistant 2:
  Reflection:

I previously answered this question as follows:

"I believe the correct answer is (B) It is a claim that the argument tries to rebut. The editorial argues that recent proposals to allow cell phone use on airplanes are ill-advised, suggesting that cell phone use would be more disruptive on airplanes than on buses and trains. This implies that the argument is trying to rebut the claim that cell phone use on airplanes would not be disruptive, which is the opposite of the argument's main conclusion."

However, upon further reflection, I realize that my answer was incorrect. The correct answer is (C) It is a premise that indirectly supports the main conclusion of the argument by supporting a premise for that conclusion. The editorial argues that cell phone use would be more disruptive on airplanes than on buses and trains, which is a premise that indirectly supports the argument's main conclusion that recent proposals to allow cell phone use on airplanes are ill-advised.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) It is a premise that indirectly supports the main conclusion of the argument by supporting a premise for that conclusion.
