Context: Political scientist: People become unenthusiastic about voting if they believe that important problems can be addressed only by large numbers of people drastically changing their attitudes and that such attitudinal changes generally do not result from government action. The decreasing voter turnout is thus entirely due to a growing conviction that politicians cannot solve the most important problems.
Question: The reasoning in the political scientist's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that the argument
Choices:
  A: presumes, without providing justification, that there is no cause of decreasing voter turnout other than the belief that few important problems can be solved by government action

  D: undermines its claim that people no longer believe there are political solutions to important problems by suggesting that people are dissatisfied with politicians

Question: The reasoning in the political scientist's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that the argument

Reflection:
After initially answering the question incorrectly, I reflected on the problem and my solution. I realized that the argument assumes without justification that the decreasing voter turnout is entirely due to a growing conviction that politicians cannot solve the most important problems. This assumption is flawed because there could be other factors contributing to decreasing voter turnout, such as voter apathy or dissatisfaction with politicians.

Therefore, the correct answer is (E) presumes, without providing justification, that voter apathy prevents the attitudinal changes that result in finding solutions to important problems.

Action: Answer("E")
## Result:
Agent Answer: E
Correct Answer: A
