## System:
You are an expert in Medicine.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## User 2:
Topic: Medicine
Subtopic: Gynaecology & Obstetrics
Question: At 34 weeks multigravida with previous 2 normal delivery has an unstable lie with the present pregnancy. It can be due to:
Choices:
  A: Oligohydramnios
  B: Placenta pre
  C: Pelvic tumor
  D: Uterine anomalies
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:** My reasoning was flawed. While oligohydramnios can restrict fetal movement, it's not the only factor influencing fetal lie. I failed to consider that placenta previa can also cause an unstable lie by physically obstructing the fetus from settling into a head-down position.
**Error Keywords:**
*   Incorrect reasoning
*   Incomplete knowledge 
*   Misinterpretation of clinical scenario
## Step-by-Step Solution
1. **Understand the problem:** The question asks for the cause of an unstable lie at 34 weeks in a multigravida with previous normal deliveries.
2. **Analyze the options:**
    *   **Oligohydramnios:** Can restrict fetal movement, but not the only cause of unstable lie.
    *   **Placenta previa:** Can physically obstruct the fetus from assuming a head-down position, leading to an unstable lie.
    *   **Pelvic tumor:**  Less likely at this gestation with previous normal deliveries.
    *   **Uterine anomalies:** Less likely with previous normal deliveries.
3. **Choose the most likely cause:** Based on the analysis, placenta previa (B) is the most likely cause of an unstable lie in this scenario. 
## Instructions for Future Problem Solving
1. **Consider all possible causes:** Don't focus on just one factor, even if it seems likely. 
2. **Analyze each option carefully:** Evaluate how each option could contribute to the presented scenario.
3. **Prioritize based on likelihood:** Consider the patient's history and the gestational age when assessing the likelihood of each option.
4. **Review knowledge gaps:** If unsure, research the topic further to improve understanding.
## General Advice for Similar Problems
*   **Think comprehensively:** Consider all aspects of the patient's presentation and history.
*   **Develop differential diagnoses:** List all possible causes and systematically evaluate each one.
*   **Stay updated:** Continuously update medical knowledge to ensure accurate diagnoses.
*   **Consult resources:** Utilize textbooks, medical journals, and colleagues for clarification and support.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Based on my previous reflection, placenta previa is the most likely cause of an unstable lie at this gestation, especially considering the patient's history of normal deliveries. 
Action: Answer("B") 
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
