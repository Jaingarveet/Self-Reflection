## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:**
My knowledge base incorrectly categorized Kojic acid. While it does have skin-lightening properties, it's primarily used in topical creams for hyperpigmentation and not as a chemical peeling agent. 
**Error Keywords:**
*   Factual error
*   Medicine (Dermatology)
*   Chemical peel agents 
**Step-by-Step Solution:**
1.  **Recall common chemical peel agents:** Glycolic acid, salicylic acid, trichloroacetic acid (TCA), and phenol are frequently used.
2.  **Analyze each option:**
    *   Glycolic acid, salicylic acid, and phenol are known chemical peel agents.
    *   Kojic acid, while used in dermatology, is not typically used for chemical peels.
3.  **Identify the option that is NOT a chemical peel agent:** Kojic acid.
**Instructions for Future:**
1.  Review and update knowledge base on dermatological agents and their uses.
2.  Pay close attention to the specific context of the question (chemical peeling).
3.  If unsure, use the process of elimination based on known facts about other options.
**General Advice for Similar Problems:**
*   Maintain and update knowledge base regularly.
*   Focus on understanding the core concepts and principles of each topic.
*   Develop a systematic approach to problem-solving, including elimination strategies.
*   Practice critical thinking and questioning assumptions.
