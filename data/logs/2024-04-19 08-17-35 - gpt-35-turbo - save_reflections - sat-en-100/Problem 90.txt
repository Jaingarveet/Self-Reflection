## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I misread the question and did not pay close attention to the specific pathogen mentioned in the passage. 
The question asks about the relationship between Varroa mites and secondary infections, but I chose an answer that referred to colony collapse disorder caused by pathogens in general. 
Error Keywords:
 - Misreading

 - Answering a different question
Solution:
The data in the table do not provide support for the authors' claim that infection with Varroa mites increases a honeybee's susceptibility to secondary infections.
