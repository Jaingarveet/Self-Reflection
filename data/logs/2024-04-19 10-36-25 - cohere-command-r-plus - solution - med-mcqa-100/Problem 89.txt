Question: In Spondylolisthesis, which of the following is NOT useful investigation?
Choices:
  A: Anteroposterior X-ray
  B: Lateral view X-ray
  C: CT
  D: MRI
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
Spondylolisthesis is a condition where one vertebra slips forward onto another.
Standard diagnostic imaging includes:
 - Anteroposterior (AP) X-rays to view vertebral alignment and any slip or displacement.
 - Lateral X-rays to assess spinal stability and identify potential nerve compression.
[REDACTED] and [REDACTED] scans provide detailed information and are often used for surgical planning but are not routinely required for initial diagnosis.
The AP X-ray is the primary tool for diagnosis and is therefore the correct answer.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: Anteroposterior (AP) X-rays are essential for the diagnosis of Spondylolisthesis as they allow for the assessment of vertebral alignment and any slip or displacement. Lateral X-rays are also commonly used to assess spinal stability and nerve compression. While CT and MRI scans provide detailed additional information, they are not always necessary for initial diagnosis. Therefore, the correct answer is "A: Anteroposterior X-ray" as it is the only investigation that is routinely used.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
