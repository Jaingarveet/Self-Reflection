Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
Chemical peels are cosmetic procedures that use chemical agents to exfoliate and improve skin texture and appearance. 

[REDACTED] is an alpha-hydroxy acid that penetrates the skin and promotes exfoliation, improving skin tone and reducing fine lines. 

[REDACTED] is a strong, deep-penetrating agent used for more aggressive peels, targeting deep wrinkles and skin discoloration. 

[REDACTED], classified as a beta-hydroxy acid, is oil-soluble and particularly effective for treating acne and oily skin. 

[REDACTED], while used in skin care, primarily functions as a tyrosinase inhibitor, targeting pigment production rather than exfoliation. Thus, it is not a common agent for chemical peeling, which focuses on exfoliation and surface skin renewal.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Kojic acid is an inhibitor of tyrosinase and is used to target pigment production rather than exfoliation. Therefore, it is not a common agent used in chemical peeling.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
