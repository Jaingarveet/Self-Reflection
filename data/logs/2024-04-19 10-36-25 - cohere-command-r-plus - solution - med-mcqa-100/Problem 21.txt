Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
Senescent RBCs, or older red blood cells, are typically targeted by certain strains of *Plasmodium*, the parasite that causes malaria. *P. vivax*, *P. ovale*, and *P. falciparum* prefer young RBCs, while *P. malariae*, the parasite that causes quartan malaria, has an affinity for senescent RBCs. This is because *P. malariae* can persist in the body for extended periods, and as RBCs age, they become more susceptible to invasion.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: Senescent RBCs are older red blood cells. While *P. vivax*, *P. ovale*, and *P. falciparum* prefer to infect younger RBCs, *P. malariae*, the parasite responsible for quartan malaria, has an affinity for senescent RBCs.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
