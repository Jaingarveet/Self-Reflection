## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Topic: Math
Question: Alan drives an average of 100 miles each week. His car can travel an average of 25 miles per gallon of gasoline. Alan would like to reduce his weekly expenditure on gasoline by $\$ 5$. Assuming gasoline costs $\$ 4$ per gallon, which equation can Alan use to determine how many fewer average miles, $m$, he should drive each week?
Choices:
  A: $\frac{25}{4} m=95$
  B: $\frac{25}{4} m=5$
  C: $\frac{4}{25} m=95$
  D: $\frac{4}{25} m=5$
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I made an error in my reasoning when setting up the equation. I tried to calculate the new number of miles Alan should drive each week to reduce his expenditure by $5, but I set up the equation incorrectly. Instead of equating the cost of the reduced miles to the desired reduction of $5, I equated it to the new total expenditure of $11.
Error Keywords:
 - Incorrect equation setup
 - Misinterpretation of the problem
 - Logical error in problem-solving
Solution:
1) Alan drives an average of 100 miles per week.
2) His car travels an average of 25 miles per gallon of gasoline.
3) Gasoline costs $4 per gallon.
4) Alan wants to reduce his weekly expenditure on gasoline by $5.
5) Let $m$ be the number of fewer miles Alan should drive each week.
6) The cost of driving these $m$ miles should be equal to the desired reduction of $5:
   - (Miles reduced / Miles per gallon) * Price per gallon = Desired reduction
   - ($m$ / 25) * $4 = $5
7) Simplify:
   - $m$ / 25 = 5 / 4
   - $m$ = 125 / 4
   - $m$ = 31.25
8) This matches the equation in choice D: $\frac{4}{25} m = 5$
Therefore, the correct answer is D.
Instructions:
1. Read the problem carefully and identify the key information.
2. Identify the unknown variable and what it represents.
3. Set up an equation based on the relationship between the unknown variable and the desired outcome.
4. In the equation, the left side should represent the cost or effect of the unknown variable.
5. The right side of the equation should be the desired outcome or change.
6. Solve the equation for the unknown variable.
7. Check if your solution matches one of the given choices.
Advice:
 - Always read the problem carefully and identify what the question is asking for.
 - Clearly define your variables and what they represent.
 - Make sure your equation correctly represents the relationship between the variables and the desired outcome.
 - The desired outcome or change should be on one side of the equation by itself.
 - Double-check your equation setup before solving.
 - If your solution doesn't match any of the choices, revisit your equation setup.
