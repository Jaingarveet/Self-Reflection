Question: A club consists of members whose ages are in A.P. The common difference being 3 months. If the youngest member of the club is just 7 years old and the sum of the ages of all the members is 250, then number of members in the club are :
Choices:
  A: 18
  B: 20
  C: 25
  D: 26
  E: 27
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let the number of members in the club be n.
The age of the youngest member is 7 years.
The sum of the ages of all the members is 250.
The common difference is 3 months, which is 1/4 years.
The sum of the ages of all the members can be expressed as a function of n.
We can use these equations to solve for n.
Action: 
The sum of the ages of n members in an A.P. with first term a and common difference d is given by the formula: S = n/2[2a + (n-1)d]
Here, a = 7 years and d = 1/4 years.
The sum of the ages of all the members is 250, so we have:
250 = n/2[2(7) + (n-1)(1/4)]
Simplifying this equation, we get:
500 = n[14 + (n-1)/4]
Multiplying both sides by 4, we get:
2000 = 4n[14 + (n-1)/4]
Expanding the brackets, we get:
2000 = 56n + n^2 - n
Simplifying this quadratic equation, we get:
n^2 + 55n - 2000 = 0
Using the quadratic formula, we get:
n = (-55 ± sqrt(55^2 + 4(2000)))/2
n = (-55 ± 85)/2
n = 15 or n = -70
Since the number of members cannot be negative, the number of members in the club is 15.
Answer: Answer("None of the Above") [The correct answer is not in the given choices. The correct answer is 15.]
## Result:
Agent Answer: N
Correct Answer: C
