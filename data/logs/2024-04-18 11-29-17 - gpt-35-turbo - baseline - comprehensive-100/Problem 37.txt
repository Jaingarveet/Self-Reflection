Topic: Law
Context: People who are allergic to cats are actually allergic to certain proteins found in the animals' skin secretions and saliva; which particular proteins are responsible, however, varies from allergy sufferer to allergy sufferer. Since all cats shed skin and spread saliva around their environment, there is no such thing as a cat incapable of provoking allergic reactions, although it is common for a given cat to cause an allergic reaction in some-but not all-people who are allergic to cats.
Question: Which one of the following statements is most strongly supported by the information above?
Choices:
  A: Any particular individual will be allergic to some breeds of cat but not to others.
  B: No cat is capable of causing an allergic reaction in all types of allergy sufferers.
  C: Not all cats are identical with respect to the proteins contained in their skin secretions and saliva.
  D: The allergic reactions of some people who are allergic to cats are more intense than the allergic reactions of other allergy sufferers.
  E: There is no way to predict whether a given cat will produce an allergic reaction in a particular allergy sufferer.
## Assistant 2:
Action: Answer("C")
Explanation: 
The passage states that the proteins responsible for causing allergic reactions in people who are allergic to cats vary from person to person and that all cats shed skin and spread saliva, making it impossible for any cat to be incapable of provoking an allergic reaction. Therefore, it can be inferred that not all cats are identical with respect to the proteins contained in their skin secretions and saliva. Choice A is incorrect because the passage states that the proteins responsible for causing allergic reactions vary from person to person, not from breed to breed. Choice B is incorrect because the passage states that all cats are capable of causing an allergic reaction in some people who are allergic to cats. Choice D is incorrect because the passage does not provide any information about the intensity of allergic reactions. Choice E is incorrect because the passage states that all cats are capable of provoking an allergic reaction in some people who are allergic to cats.
