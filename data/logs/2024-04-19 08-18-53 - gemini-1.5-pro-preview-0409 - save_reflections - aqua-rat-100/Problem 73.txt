## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:** My approach was flawed because I assumed that the percentages of students taking physics and math must each represent whole numbers of students. This is not necessarily true, as there could be fractions of students when dealing with percentages.
**Error Keywords:**
*   Assumption error
*   Misinterpretation of percentages
*   Whole number bias
## Step-by-Step Solution
1.  **Recognize Overlap:** We know 20% took physics and 28% took math, but there might be an overlap (students taking both). So, the total percentage is not simply 20% + 28%.
2.  **Maximum Possible Overlap:** The maximum overlap would be the smaller percentage, which is 20%. This would mean 20% of students take both, and an additional 8% take only math.
3.  **Minimum Total Percentage:** In this case, the minimum total percentage of students taking either physics or math would be 28% (20% both + 8% only math).
4.  **Find the Number of Students:** We need a number greater than 501 that is at least 28%. We can set up the equation: 0.28 * x > 501.
5.  **Solve for x:** Divide both sides by 0.28 to get x > 1789.29.
6.  **Least Possible Number:** The least possible integer value for x that satisfies this inequality is 1790.
Therefore, the correct answer is **E: None of these**. 
## Instructions for Future
1.  **Consider Overlap:** Always consider the possibility of overlap when dealing with percentages in categories.
2.  **Calculate Minimum and Maximum:** Determine the minimum and maximum possible total percentages based on overlap scenarios.
3.  **Translate Percentages to Numbers:** Use inequalities to translate percentage requirements into numerical constraints.
4.  **Solve for the Variable:** Solve the inequality to find the possible range of values.
5.  **Choose the Correct Answer:** Select the answer choice that aligns with the solution to the inequality.
## General Advice
*   **Challenge Assumptions:** Don't make assumptions about whole numbers or mutually exclusive categories when dealing with percentages.
*   **Think Holistically:** Consider all possible scenarios and their implications on the problem.
*   **Use Inequalities:** Utilize inequalities to express constraints and solve for a range of possible values. 
*   **Be Flexible:** Adapt your problem-solving approach based on the specific context of the problem.
