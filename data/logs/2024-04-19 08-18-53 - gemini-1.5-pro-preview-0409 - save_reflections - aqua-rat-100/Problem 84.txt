## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:** My error stemmed from incorrectly accounting for the identical nature of the chairs. I considered the order of Susan and Tim but failed to recognize that the position of Zen relative to them wouldn't create unique arrangements due to the chairs being indistinguishable.
**Error Keywords:**
*   Permutation error
*   Identical objects error
*   Counting principle error
## Step-by-Step Solution
1.  **Susan and Tim's positions:** There are only two possible arrangements for Susan and Tim as Susan must be to Tim's left: (Susan, Tim) or (Tim, Susan). 
2.  **Zen's position:** Since the chairs are identical, Zen's position relative to Susan and Tim doesn't create a new arrangement. Whether Zen sits to the left, between, or to the right of Susan and Tim, the arrangement remains the same.
Therefore, there are only **2 possible arrangements**.
## Instructions for Future Similar Problems
1.  **Identify restrictions:** Carefully analyze the problem for any restrictions or conditions (like Susan being to the left of Tim).
2.  **Consider identical objects:** Determine if there are identical objects or positions involved and how they impact the number of unique arrangements.
3.  **Apply counting principles:** Use appropriate counting principles (permutations, combinations) while considering the restrictions and identical objects.
4.  **Account for symmetry:** If symmetry is present due to identical objects, adjust the count to avoid overcounting arrangements.
## General Advice for Similar Problems
*   **Read carefully:** Pay close attention to the wording of the problem, especially terms like "identical" or "distinct."
*   **Visualize:** Try to visualize the problem or draw diagrams to understand the arrangements better.
*   **Break it down:** Divide the problem into smaller, manageable steps to avoid confusion.
*   **Check for overcounting:** Always be mindful of potential overcounting due to symmetry or identical objects. 
*   **Practice:** Solve various permutation and combination problems to strengthen your understanding of counting principles.
