## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:**
My error stemmed from a misinterpretation of the information provided. I incorrectly assumed that 3 hours before the end of the trip, Kevin had already started his return journey from B to A. This led to a flawed equation and an incorrect solution.
**Error Keywords:**
*   Misinterpretation
*   Assumption error
*   Problem comprehension error
## Step-by-Step Solution
1.  **Define variables:** Let x be the distance between A and B.
2.  **Calculate time to B:** Time taken to travel from A to B is x/70 hours.
3.  **Analyze 3 hours before the end:** At this point, Kevin is still 70 miles away from B, meaning he has not yet reached B and started his return journey. He has been driving for (x-70) miles towards B.
4.  **Calculate time spent driving towards B:** Time spent driving towards B is (x-70)/70 hours.
5.  **Set up equation:** The total time spent driving is 3 hours less than the time it would take to complete the entire round trip. So, (x-70)/70 + x/70  =  x/90 + x/90 - 3.
6.  **Solve for x:** Simplifying the equation, we get 2x - 70 = 2x - 270. This leads to 200 = 0, which is not possible. 
7. **Re-evaluate the problem:** Since we reached a contradiction, we need to re-evaluate our understanding of the problem. The issue lies in assuming Kevin was on his way back from B. 
8. **Correct the approach:**  3 hours before the end, Kevin is 70 miles away from B, meaning he has been driving for x-70 miles and has 70 miles left to reach B. The time spent driving is (x-70)/70.
9. **Set up the correct equation:** The time spent driving plus the remaining time to reach B equals 3 hours. So, (x-70)/70 + 70/70 = 3.
10. **Solve for x:** Simplifying and solving for x, we get x = 180 miles.
