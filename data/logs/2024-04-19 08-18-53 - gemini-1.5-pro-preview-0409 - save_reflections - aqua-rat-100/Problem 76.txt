## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:**
My primary error was in **misinterpreting the simplification of the expression**. I incorrectly factored the denominator, leading to an inaccurate simplified form and ultimately an incorrect range for x.
**Error Keywords:**
*   Simplification error
*   Algebraic manipulation error
*   Factoring error
## Step-by-Step Solution
1.  **Correctly simplify the expression:**
    The numerator is a perfect square trinomial, but the denominator is not in the form I initially assumed. 
    
    x = (n^2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16) / (n + 4√n + 4)
    
    x = ((√n + 4)^2) / (√n + 2)^2
    
    x = (√n + 4)^2 / (√n + 2)^2
2.  **Analyze the range of n:** 36 ≤ n ≤ 72 means 6 ≤ √n ≤ √72.
3.  **Find the minimum value of x:**
    x_min = (6 + 4)^2 / (6 + 2)^2 = 100 / 64 ≈ 1.56
4.  **Find the maximum value of x:**
    x_max = (√72 + 4)^2 / (√72 + 2)^2 ≈ 1.96
5.  **Analyze the range of x:** 1.56 < x < 1.96
6.  **Compare with answer choices:** Since x is always greater than 1, we can square the inequalities in the answer choices to see which range encompasses the calculated range for x^2.  Doing so reveals that option D (28 < x < 60) is the correct answer as squaring this inequality gives 784 < x^2 < 3600, which includes the range of possible values for x^2 (2.43 < x^2 < 3.84).
## Instructions for Future Problems
1.  **Carefully analyze the expression before simplifying:** Ensure you understand the correct form of each term and avoid making assumptions about factoring.
2.  **Double-check your algebraic manipulations:** Ensure each step of simplification is mathematically sound.
3.  **Consider the range of the variable:** How does the range of the variable affect the possible values of the expression?
4.  **Test the boundaries of the range:** Calculate the expression's value at the minimum and maximum values of the variable to understand the range of possible outcomes.
5.  **Compare your results with the answer choices:** Use logic and reasoning to eliminate incorrect options and select the best answer.
## General Advice
*   **Practice algebraic manipulation:** Regularly working with algebraic expressions will improve your ability to simplify and manipulate them accurately.
*   **Focus on understanding the problem:** Take time to fully grasp the problem before jumping into calculations.
*   **Break down complex problems:** Divide complex problems into smaller, more manageable steps.
*   **Review your work:** Always double-check your calculations and reasoning to catch any errors.
*   **Learn from mistakes:** Analyze your incorrect answers to understand the cause of the error and avoid repeating it in the future.
