## Reflection on Previous Error:
While I don't have access to the specific details of my previous error ([REDACTED]), I can generally analyze potential pitfalls in this type of logic problem:
* **Misinterpreting Constraints:**  The complexity arises from the interplay of multiple constraints. It's crucial to consider all of them simultaneously and not overlook any. 
* **Overlooking Possibilities:**  The question asks for the option that is NOT possible, so it's essential to explore various combinations that satisfy the given conditions and not get fixated on a single line of reasoning.
* **Calculation Errors:**  Keeping track of the number of works from each category and ensuring they fall within the specified ranges is crucial. 
## Answering the Question:
Let's analyze each option:
* **A: No Russian novels and exactly one play:** This could be one French play and two or three French novels, satisfying all conditions.
* **B: Exactly one Russian novel and both French plays:** This violates the condition that if both French plays are selected, the Russian play is not.
* **C: Exactly two French novels and the Russian play:** This is possible with one Russian novel, satisfying all conditions.
* **D: Exactly two French novels and exactly two plays:** This could be one French play and one Russian play, satisfying all conditions.
* **E: Exactly two Russian novels and exactly one play:** This could be one French play and one French novel, satisfying all conditions.
Therefore, the option that is NOT possible is **B: Exactly one Russian novel and both French plays are selected.**
