## Assistant 2:
  Sure, I'll do my best to answer the question based on the information provided and my previous reflection.

After reflecting on the problem and the correct answer, I realized that I misunderstood the question. I thought the question was asking for the best reason why Ditalgame's president predicts a substantial increase in sales, but it's actually asking for the most supportive evidence for the president's prediction.

Based on the information provided, the best answer is (C) The copy protection feature causes a copied game to be playable just long enough for most people to come to enjoy it so much that they decide they have to have it.

This answer choice provides the most support for the president's prediction because it suggests that the copy protection feature will encourage people who have copied the game to purchase it legally. This will lead to an increase in sales for Ditalgame, which supports the president's prediction.

The other answer choices do not provide as much support for the president's prediction:

* (A) Ditalgame has spent millions of dollars developing the new copy protection feature, and the company can recoup these costs only if its sales increase substantially. This answer choice mentions the cost of developing the feature, but it doesn't directly support the president's prediction of increased sales.
* (B) Over the last several years, the market for computer games has grown steadily, but Ditalgame's share of that market has shrunk considerably. This answer choice mentions the market growth, but it doesn't explain why Ditalgame's sales will increase with the new copy protection feature.
* (D) Game Review Monthly, the most commonly read magazine among people who frequently copy computer games, generally gives favorable reviews to Ditalgame games. This answer choice mentions the positive reviews, but it doesn't explain how the copy protection feature will lead to increased sales.
* (E) Computer games produced by Ditalgame are copied more frequently than computer games produced by other companies. This answer choice mentions the frequency of copying, but it doesn't directly support the president's prediction of increased sales.

Therefore, the best answer is (C) The copy protection feature causes a copied game to be playable just long enough for most people to come to enjoy it so much that they decide they have to have it.
