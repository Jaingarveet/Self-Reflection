## System:
You are an expert in Law.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Context: Some scientists have expressed reservations about quantum theory because of its counterintuitive consequences. But despite rigorous attempts to show that quantum theory's predictions were inaccurate, they were shown to be accurate within the generally accepted statistical margin of error. These results, which have not been equaled by quantum theory's competitors, warrant acceptance of quantum theory.
Question: Which one of the following principles most helps to justify the reasoning above?
Choices:
  A: A scientific theory should be accepted if it has fewer counterintuitive consequences than do its competitors.
  B: A scientific theory should be accepted if it has been subjected to serious attempts to disprove it and has withstood all of them.
  C: The consequences of a scientific theory should not be considered counterintuitive if the theory's predictions have been found to be accurate.
  D: A theory should not be rejected until it has been subjected to serious attempts to disprove it.
  E: A theory should be accepted only if its predictions have not been disproved by experiment.

## Assistant 2:
  Action: Answer("B")

Reflection:
Previously, I incorrectly answered this question as choice A. However, upon reflection, I realized that the passage does not support the idea that a scientific theory should be accepted based on the number of counterintuitive consequences it has compared to its competitors. Instead, the passage suggests that a scientific theory should be accepted if it has been subjected to serious attempts to disprove it and has withstood all of them. Therefore, the correct answer is choice B.
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
