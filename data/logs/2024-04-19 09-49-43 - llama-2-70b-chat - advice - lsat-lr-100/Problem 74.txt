Topic: Law
Context: Traditional "talk" therapy, in which a patient with a psychological disorder discusses it with a trained therapist, produces chemical changes in the brain. These changes seem to correspond to improvements in certain aspects of the patient's behavior. Thus, physicians will eventually be able to treat such patients as effectively through pharmacological intervention in the brain's neurochemistry as through the lengthy intermediary of traditional "talk" methods.
Question: Which one of the following is an assumption on which the argumoot depends?
Choices:
  A: All neurochemical changes produce corresponding psychological changes.
  B: improvements in a patient's behavior produced by "talk" therapy occur only through chemical changes in the brain's neurochemistry.
  C: Talk therapy has not been effective at bringing about psychological change.
  D: If chemical changes in the brain's neurochemistry correspond to improvemeots in patient behavior, then psychology and neuroscience will eventually be indistinguishable.
  E: Direct intervention in the brain's neurochemistry is likely to become a less expensive way of treating psychological disorders than is "talk" therapy.

## Assistant 2:
  Sure, I'd be happy to help you answer this question.

After reflecting on the problem, my previous solution, and the correct answer, I realized that I made a mistake in my initial answer. The correct answer is indeed B: improvements in a patient's behavior produced by "talk" therapy occur only through chemical changes in the brain's neurochemistry.

The argument depends on the assumption that changes in brain chemistry are the only way to bring about improvements in behavior through "talk" therapy. This assumption is stated in choice B.

Therefore, the answer is B: improvements in a patient's behavior produced by "talk" therapy occur only through chemical changes in the brain's neurochemistry.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
