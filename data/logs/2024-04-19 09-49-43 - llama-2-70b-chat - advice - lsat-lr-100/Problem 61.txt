Topic: Law
Context: In a recent study, each member of two groups of people, Group A (composed of persons sixty-five to seventy-five years old) and Group B (composed of college students), was required to make a telephone call to a certain number at a specified time. The time when each call was initiated was recorded electronically. Group A proved far better at remembering to make a telephone call precisely at a specified time than did Group B. There were fourteen lapses in Group B but only one lapse in Group A. Clearly, at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages.
Question: Which one of the following, if all of them are true, is LEAST helpful in establishing that the conclusion above is properly drawn?
Choices:
  A: There was the same number of people in each group.
  B: The same group of researchers answered the calls made by the callers in both study groups.
  C: Among the college students there were no persons more than forty years old.
  D: Both groups had unrestricted access to telephones for making the required calls.
  E: The members of the two groups received their instructions approximately the same amount of time before they were to make their telephone calls.

## Assistant 2:
  Sure, I'll do my best to answer the question based on the information provided.

After reflecting on the problem, my previous solution, and the correct answer, I realize that I made a mistake by not carefully considering all the choices. I jumped to conclusion and selected choice A, which is not the best answer.

The correct answer is choice E: The members of the two groups received their instructions approximately the same amount of time before they were to make their telephone calls.

This choice is the least helpful in establishing that the conclusion is properly drawn because it does not address the issue of memory and aging. The fact that both groups had unrestricted access to telephones (choice D) and that the same group of researchers answered the calls (choice B) are more relevant to the conclusion, as they ensure that the groups were treated equally and that there was no bias in the evaluation of the calls.

Choice A, which states that there was the same number of people in each group, is also relevant, as it ensures that the sample sizes were equal and that the results are representative of the populations.

Choice C, which states that among the college students, there were no persons more than forty years old, is not relevant to the conclusion, as it only addresses the age range of one of the groups and does not address the issue of memory and aging.

Therefore, the least helpful choice in establishing that the conclusion is properly drawn is choice E.
