Context: Museum curakor: Our ancient Egyptian collection includes an earthenware hippopotamus that resembles a child's roy. It was discovered in a tomb, upside down, with its legs broken off. We know that the ancient Egyptians believed the dead had to wage eternal war with beasts. Breaking the legs off a representation of an animal was thought to help a deceased person in this war. We conclude that, far from being a roy, this hippopotamus was a religious object.
Question: Which one of the following is an assumption required by the curator's argument?
Choices:
  A: The tomb in which the hippopotamus was found was not the tomb of a child.
  B: Earthenware figures were never used as children's roys in ancient Egypt.
  C: The tomb in which the hippopotamus was found was not reentered from the time of burial until archaeologists opened it.
  D: The hippopotamus' legs were not broken 1hrough some natural occurrence after it was placed in the tomb.
  E: The hippopotamus was originally placed upside down in the tomb.

## Assistant 2:
  My apologize for my previous response. After reevaluating the question and the given choices, I realize that my initial answer was incorrect.

The correct answer is (D) The hippopotamus' legs were not broken through some natural occurrence after it was placed in the tomb.

The curator's argument relies on the assumption that the hippopotamus' broken legs were intentionally broken by the ancient Egyptians as part of their religious beliefs. If the legs were broken through natural occurrence, such as erosion or damage during transportation, then the curator's conclusion that the hippopotamus was a religious object would be invalid. Therefore, choice (D) is the required assumption for the curator's argument.

I mistakenly chose (E) The hippopotamus was originally placed upside down in the tomb, thinking that it was a necessary assumption for the curator's argument. However, the fact that the hippopotamus was found upside down does not necessarily mean that it was placed that way intentionally. It could have been placed upside down for other reasons, such as to fit in the tomb or due to the way it was buried.

I hope this answer is correct. Please let me know if there is any further information I can provide or if there are any additional questions I can help with.
