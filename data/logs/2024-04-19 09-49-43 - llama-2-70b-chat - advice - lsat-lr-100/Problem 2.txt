## Assistant 2:
  Sure, here's my revised answer:

Action: Answer("C")

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, selecting choice A. However, upon reflection, I realized that the statement "This year, most of the Canadian films that were shown at international film festivals won prizes at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival" is not necessarily true. Just because most of the films that won prizes at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival also won prizes at international film festivals, it does not mean that most of the Canadian films shown at international film festivals won prizes at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival.

The correct answer is choice C: "Some of the films that won prizes at international film festivals this year were Canadian films." This statement logically follows from the given information, as we know that some of the films that won prizes at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival also won prizes at international film festivals. Therefore, it is possible that some of the films that won prizes at international film festivals this year were Canadian films.

It's important to note that the other choices are not necessarily true based on the given information. Choice A is not necessarily true, as mentioned above. Choice B is also not necessarily true, as we don't know whether all Canadian films produced this year were shown at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival. Choice D is true, as we know that not every film that won a prize at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival was also shown at an international film festival. Choice E is also true, as we know that at least one film that won a prize at an international film festival was not shown at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival.
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
