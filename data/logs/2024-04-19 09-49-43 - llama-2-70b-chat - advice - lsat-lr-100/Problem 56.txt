Topic: Law
Context: In some countries, there is a free flow of information about infrastructure, agriculture, and industry, whereas in other countries, this information is controlled by a small elite. In the latter countries, the vast majority of the population is denied vital information about factors that determine their welfare. Thus, these countries are likely to experience more frequent economic crises than other countries do.
Question: The conclusion follows logically if which one of the following is assumed?
Choices:
  A: It is more likely that people without political power will suffer from economic crises than it is that people in power will.
  B: Economic crises become more frequent as the amount of information available to the population about factors determining its welfare decreases.
  C: In nations in which the government controls access to information about infrastructure, agriculture, and industry, economic crises are common.
  D: The higher the percentage of the population that participates in economic decisions, the better those decisions are.
  E: A small elite that controls information about infrastructure, agriculture, and industry is likely to manipulate that information for its own benefit.

## Assistant 2:
  Sure, I'll do my best to answer the question based on the given choices and the information provided.

After reflecting on the problem, I realize that the conclusion of the argument is that countries with controlled information are likely to experience more frequent economic crises. The argument assumes that the population's lack of access to information about factors determining their welfare leads to poor economic decisions, which in turn lead to economic crises.

Therefore, the best answer choice is B: Economic crises become more frequent as the amount of information available to the population about factors determining its welfare decreases. This choice accurately captures the idea that a lack of information leads to poor economic decisions, which in turn lead to economic crises.

Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
