Topic: Law
Context: Native speakers perceive sentences of their own language as sequences of separate words. But this perception is an illusion. This is shown by the fact that travelers who do not know a local language hear an unintelligible, uninterrupted stream of sound, not sentences with distinct words.
Question: Which one of the following is an assumption on which the argument depends?
Choices:
  A: It is impossible to understand sentences if they are in fact uninterrupted streams of sound.
  B: Those who do not know a language cannot hear the way speech in that language actually sounds.
  C: People pay less close attention to the way their own language sounds than they do to the way an unfamiliar language sounds.
  D: Accomplished non-native speakers of a language do not perceive sentences as streams of sound.
  E: Native speakers' perceptions of their own language are not more accurate than are the perceptions of persons who do not know that language.
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Advice:

* Always carefully read the argument and identify its conclusion and premises.
* Identify the assumption that is made in the argument and evaluate its validity.
* Consider alternative assumptions that could support the conclusion.
* Evaluate the strength of the argument with the alternative assumptions.
* Be aware of biases and assumptions that may influence your evaluation of the argument.
## Assistant 2:
  I apologize for my previous mistake. Let's evaluate the argument again, taking into account the given choices and the self-reflection provided.
The argument's conclusion is that native speakers' perceptions of their own language are illusions. The premise is that travelers who do not know a local language hear an unintelligible, uninterrupted stream of sound, not sentences with distinct words.
The assumption being made is choice C: People pay less close attention to the way their own language sounds than they do to the way an unfamiliar language sounds.
The argument suggests that because travelers who do not know a local language perceive an uninterrupted stream of sound, native speakers' perceptions of their own language are illusions. This assumption relies on the idea that people pay less attention to familiar things, including their own language.
However, this assumption may not be valid. Just because people may pay less attention to familiar things does not mean their perception of them is an illusion. For example, a person may be very familiar with their own face, but that does not mean they do not see it accurately.
Considering alternative assumptions, it is possible that native speakers' perceptions of their language are not an illusion. Perhaps their brains process language differently, allowing them to distinguish words within a stream of sound. This assumption would weaken the argument, as it provides an alternative explanation for why travelers may perceive an uninterrupted stream of sound.
In conclusion, the assumption made in the argument (choice C) may not be valid, and alternative assumptions could weaken the argument. Therefore, the strength of the argument is limited. It is essential to be aware of biases and assumptions that may influence the evaluation of arguments to ensure a fair and accurate assessment.
