Context: People often admonish us to learn the lessons of history, but, even if it were easy to discover what the past was really like, it is nearly impossible to discover its lessons. We are supposed, for example, to learn the lessons of World War I. But what are they? And were we ever to discover what they are, it is not clear that we could ever apply them, for we shall never again have a situation just like World War I.
Question: That we should learn the lessons of history figures in the argument in which one of the following ways?
Choices:
  A: It sets out a problem the argument as a whole is designed to resolve.
  B: It is compatible with accepting the argument's conclusion and with denying it.
  C: It is a position that the argument simply takes for granted is false.
  D: It expresses the position the argument as a whole is directed toward discrediting.
  E: It is an assumption that is required in order to establish the argument's conclusion.

## Assistant 2:
  My previous answer was incorrect, and after reflecting on the problem, my solution, and the correct answer, I realize that I misunderstood the question. The correct answer is (D) It expresses the position the argument as a whole is directed toward discrediting.

The argument states that learning the lessons of history is nearly impossible because we shall never again have a situation just like World War I. The author is arguing against the idea that we can learn useful lessons from history. Therefore, the assumption that the argument is directed toward discrediting is the idea that we can learn useful lessons from history.

Answer: (D) It expresses the position the argument as a whole is directed toward discrediting.
