Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:

Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Law
Context: Ethicist: Marital vows often contain the promise to love "until death do us part." If "love" here refers to a feeling, then this promise makes no sense, for feelings are not within one's control, and a promise to do something not within one's control makes no sense. Thus, no one—including those making marital vows—should take "love" in this context to be referring to feelings.
Question: The ethicist's conclusion follows logically if which one of the following is assumed?
Choices:
  A: None of our feelings are within our control.
  B: People should not make promises to do something that is not within their control.
  C: "Love" can legitimately be taken to refer to something other than feelings.
  D: Promises should not be interpreted in such a way that they make no sense.
  E: Promises that cannot be kept do not make any sense.

## Assistant 2:
  My apologize for my previous response, and I appreciate the opportunity to reflect on my mistake.
The correct answer is option C: "Love" can legitimately be taken to refer to something other than feelings.
The ethicist's argument relies on the assumption that "love" in the context of marital vows cannot refer to feelings because feelings are not within one's control. However, this assumption can be challenged by suggesting that "love" can refer to something else, such as a commitment or an action, that is within one's control.
Therefore, option C is the best answer, as it provides an alternative interpretation of "love" that is consistent with the ethicist's conclusion.
Action: Answer("C")
