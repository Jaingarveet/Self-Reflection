## Assistant 2:
  I apologize for my previous mistake. Let's analyze the question again, taking into account the given principles and the context of the situation.
Mike believes it is not wrong for him to use Tom's computer without permission because Tom used Mary's bicycle without permission last week. Mike is relying on the principle of treating people in a way that is similar to how they have treated others.
Which one of the following principles, if valid, would most help to justify Mike's reasoning?
The correct answer is D: It is permissible to treat people in a way that is similar to the way in which they have treated others.
This principle aligns with Mike's reasoning, as he is using Tom's computer without permission because Tom used Mary's bicycle without permission. Mike believes that Tom's actions have set a precedent for how others can treat him, and he is simply following that precedent.
Therefore, the answer is D: It is permissible to treat people in a way that is similar to the way in which they have treated others.

Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
