Context: A film makes a profit if the number of people who see it is sufficient to generate revenues from ticket sales greater than the amount spent to make it.

## Assistant 2:
  I apologize for my previous mistake. Let's try again.

The correct answer is D: Television shows make their profits from sponsors, who are chiefly concerned with the purchasing power of the people who watch a television show.

The primary goal of movie executives is to maximize the number of people who see a film because their profits come from ticket sales. In contrast, television executives' primary goal is not to maximize the number of viewers for their shows because their profits come from sponsors who are interested in the purchasing power of their audience. This means that television executives are more concerned with attracting a specific demographic that aligns with their sponsors' target audience than with maximizing overall viewership.

This explanation is supported by choice D, which states that television shows make their profits from sponsors who are concerned with the purchasing power of the people who watch a television show. This suggests that television executives are more focused on attracting a specific type of viewer that aligns with their sponsors' interests rather than maximizing overall viewership.

In contrast, choices A, B, and C do not explain the difference between the goals of movie and television executives. Choice A states that more people are willing to see a film more than once than are willing to watch a television show more than once, but this does not explain why television executives are not focused on maximizing viewership. Choice B states that there is no analog in television to the large profits that owners of movie theaters make by selling refreshments to their customers, but this does not explain why television executives are not focused on maximizing viewership. Choice C states that the average cost of producing an hour of film is much greater than the average cost of producing an hour of television, but this does not explain why television executives are not focused on maximizing viewership.

Therefore, the correct answer is D: Television shows make their profits from sponsors, who are chiefly concerned with the purchasing power of the people who watch a television show.
