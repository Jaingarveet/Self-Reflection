Topic: Law
Context: Professor: It has been argued that freedom of thought is a precondition for intellectual progress, because freedom of thought allows thinkers to pursue their ideas, regardless of whom these ideas offend, in whatever direction they lead. However, it is clear that one must mine the full implications of interrelated ideas to make intellectual progress, and for this, thinkers need intellectual discipline. Therefore, this argument for freedom of thought fails.
Question: The conclusion drawn by the professor follows logically if which one of the following is assumed?
Choices:
  A: Thinkers who limit their line of thought to a particular orthodoxy are hindered in their intellectual progress.
  B: Thinkers can mine the full implications of interrelated ideas only in the context of a society that values intellectual progress.
  C: In societies that protect freedom of thought, thinkers invariably lack intellectual discipline.
  D: Freedom of thought engenders creativity, which aids the discovery of truth.
  E: Without intellectual discipline, thinkers can have no freedom of thought.

* Remember that assumptions are not always explicitly stated in the argument.
## Assistant 2:
  I apologize for my previous mistake. Let's carefully analyze the argument and identify the assumption that supports the conclusion.
The professor argues that freedom of thought is not a sufficient condition for intellectual progress because thinkers need intellectual discipline to mine the full implications of interrelated ideas. The conclusion follows logically if we assume that without intellectual discipline, thinkers cannot effectively pursue their ideas, regardless of how much freedom of thought they have.
The correct answer is E: Without intellectual discipline, thinkers can have no freedom of thought.
This answer choice states the assumption that supports the conclusion. It implies that intellectual discipline is necessary for thinkers to fully explore their ideas, even if they have the freedom to do so.
Therefore, Action: Answer("E")
## Result:
Agent Answer: E
Correct Answer: C
