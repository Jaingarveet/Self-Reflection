The gap in my knowledge was not in geography but in basic arithmetic. 
I knew the correct city and state but made a calculation error.
Error Keywords:

Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to clean a dryer drum [title] Unplug the dryer. [step] Before you start, you should unplug the dryer to prevent accidents. The plug is usually located behind the machine.
Choices:
  A: [substeps] If there is an inside fitting you can remove it and dispose of it. [title] Run your dryer on high heat.
  B: If there is static behind the agitator coils, remove this and check for static. Some models may even have a switch to turn on or off.
  C: It will be located roughly 1 foot (50 cm) from the dryer. [title] Run the dryer on neutral mode.
  D: Test it to be sure that you have unplugged it correctly. [substeps] If you have a gas dryer, you will also want to shut off the gas.

  Answer: D [substeps] If you have a gas dryer, you will also want to shut off the gas.

Explanation:
The text is providing instructions on how to clean a dryer drum. The previous step mentioned unplugging the dryer to prevent accidents. Therefore, the next step would naturally be to ensure that the dryer is properly unplugged. Option D provides the necessary steps to ensure that the dryer is safely unplugged, which aligns with the context of the instructions.

Option A does not relate to unplugging the dryer and instead jumps to removing an inside fitting, which is not the next logical step.

Option B mentions static behind the agitator coils, but this is not relevant to unplugging the dryer.

Option C provides an incorrect location for the plug, which is not helpful in unplugging the dryer.

Therefore, the best answer is D.
