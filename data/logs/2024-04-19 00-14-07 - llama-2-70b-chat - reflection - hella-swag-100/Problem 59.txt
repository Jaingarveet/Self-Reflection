Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to play fight with your girlfriend [title] Initiate the fight. [step] Start by playfully pushing or bumping into your partner on purpose. Whether she's concentrating profusely on a task, or just simply standing idle, approach her and nudge her gently.
Choices:
  A: Lightly tap her shoulder or shoulder to gently gesture that you're interested. As soon as she notices, she has trouble fighting off the teasing.
  B: Carry on with this action until she responds with either pushing you away and telling her to leave her be, or she joins in on the fun. Either way, do this in a style that shows you're only clowning around and want her to participate-she'll hopefully get the gist and engage.
  C: Touch her shoulder and tell her that you desire to capture her attention. You could say, " i know you've been thinking we've been talking about this, but let's get your mind on the night ".
  D: Initiate the fight by turning on your lights. Walk up to her and strike her on the arm you want her to exit the room.

  Answer: B

Explanation:
The text suggests that the goal is to initiate a playful fight with your girlfriend. Option B best aligns with this goal, as it suggests continuing to playfully push or bump into your partner until they respond, either by pushing you away or joining in on the fun. This approach shows that you're only clowning around and want your partner to participate, which could help to create a lighthearted and playful atmosphere.

Option A, lightly tapping your partner's shoulder, may not be enough to initiate a playful fight, and could come across as awkward or uninteresting.

Option C, touching your partner's shoulder and telling them that you desire to capture their attention, could come across as too serious or confrontational, especially if your partner is not in the mood for playfulness.

Option D, initiating the fight by turning on your lights and striking your partner on the arm, is not a good idea. Physical violence, even in a playful context, is not appropriate or respectful. It's important to remember that everyone has different boundaries and comfort levels when it comes to physical contact, and it's always best to obtain consent before engaging in any kind of physical interaction.
