## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The sales person gets a 10% commission on each sale, so for each $250 sale, he makes $25 in commission.
To reach a salary of at least $1000, he needs to make at least $1000 in commission.
To find out how many sales he needs to make, we divide the desired salary by the commission on each sale: $1000 / $25 = 40 sales.
