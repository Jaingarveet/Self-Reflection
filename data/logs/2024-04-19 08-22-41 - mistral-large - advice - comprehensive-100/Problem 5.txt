## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The youngest member of the club is 7 years old, and the ages of the members are in arithmetic progression with a common difference of 3 months (or 1/4 of a year).
Let's assume there are n members in the club.
The sum of the ages of all the members is given as 250 years.

To find the number of members, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic progression:
Sum = (n/2) \* (first term + last term)

Since the ages are in arithmetic progression, we can find the age of the oldest member (last term) by adding the common difference multiplied by (n-1) to the age of the youngest member (first term):
Last term = First term + (n - 1) \* Common difference

We know that the first term is 7 years and the common difference is 1/4 of a year.
So, Last term = 7 + (n - 1) \* (1/4)

Now we can substitute this expression for the last term in the sum formula:
250 = (n/2) \* (7 + 7 + (n - 1) \* (1/4))

Simplifying the expression inside the parentheses:
250 = (n/2) \* (14 + (n - 1) \* (1/4))

Multiplying both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:
500 = n \* (14 + (n - 1) \* (1/4))

Now, let's distribute the n on the right side of the equation:
500 = 14n + n(n - 1) \* (1/4)

Simplifying further:
500 = 14n + (n^2 - n) \* (1/4)

Multiplying both sides by 4 to get rid of the fraction:
2000 = 56n + n^2 - n

Rearranging the equation to form a quadratic equation:
n^2 + 55n - 2000 = 0

Factoring the quadratic equation:
(n + 100) \* (n - 20) = 0

The possible values for n are -100 and 20. Since the number of members cannot be negative, the number of members in the club is 20.
