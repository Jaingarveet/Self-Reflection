## Assistant 2:
Thought:
I recall this question and my previous incorrect reasoning. 
The key is to focus on the ratio after the new members join, not the initial number of boys and girls. 
The ratio of boys to girls after joining is 4:3, meaning the total number of members must be a multiple of 7. 
Action: Answer("B") 
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: E
