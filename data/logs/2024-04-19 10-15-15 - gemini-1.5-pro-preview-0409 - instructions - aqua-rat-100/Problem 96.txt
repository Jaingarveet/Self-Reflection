Instructions:
1. Set up the equation based on the ratio of investments and profit shares.
2. Express each person's investment as the product of the amount and time invested.
3. Account for the different starting times of each investment.
4. Solve the equation to find the unknown time variable.

## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let x be the number of months C invested.
The ratio of investments is 40,000*12 : 60,000*12 : 120,000*x = 2:3:6x
The ratio of profit shares is 125,000 : 100,000 : 150,000 = 5:4:6
Equating the ratios for C: 6x/6 = 150,000/375,000
Solving for x: x = 4
Action: Answer("B") 
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
