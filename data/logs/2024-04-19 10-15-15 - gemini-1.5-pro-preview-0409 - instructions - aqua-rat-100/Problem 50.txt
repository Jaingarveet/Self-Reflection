## Assistant 2:
Thought:
I recall this question and my previous incorrect reasoning. 
The key is to focus on the relative speed and the time it takes for the plane to catch up to the ship. 
Let's analyze step-by-step:
1. **Relative Speed:** The plane is 10 times faster than the ship. So, if the ship's speed is 's', the plane's speed is '10s'. The relative speed between them is the difference, which is '10s - s = 9s'.
2. **Time to Meet:** When the plane starts, the ship has already covered 180 miles. The plane needs to cover this 180-mile gap to catch up. Time is distance divided by speed, so the time it takes for the plane to catch up is 180 miles / 9s = 20/s hours.
3. **Distance by Ship:** During this time, the ship also continues moving. The distance covered by the ship is its speed multiplied by time, which is s * (20/s) = 20 miles.
4. **Total Distance from Starting Point:** The total distance from the starting point when they meet is the distance the ship initially traveled plus the additional distance it covered while the plane was catching up. This is 180 miles + 20 miles = 200 miles.
