Thought:
I recall this question and my previous incorrect response. 
I made an error in setting up the equations based on the given information. 
Let's carefully analyze the problem again.
Let x be the amount Arjun has and y be the amount Sajal has initially.
The first condition states: If Arjun gives $30 to Sajal, Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun. 
This translates to: y + 30 = 2(x - 30).
The second condition states: If Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal.
This translates to: x + 10 = 3(y - 10).
Now we have a system of two equations with two variables:
1. y + 30 = 2(x - 30)
2. x + 10 = 3(y - 10)
Solving this system will give us the values of x and y, which represent the initial amounts Arjun and Sajal have, respectively. 
Action: Answer("E") 
## Result:
Agent Answer: E
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
