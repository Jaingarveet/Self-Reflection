4. Solve the equation to find the total number of matches.
[REDACTED]. Round the total number of matches down to the nearest whole number, if necessary.
6. Calculate the number of matches lost based on the percentage of matches lost and the total number of matches.
[REDACTED]. Round the number of matches lost down to the nearest whole number, if necessary.

## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The team won 20 matches, which is 70% of their matches (100% - 30% = 70%). 
Let x be the total number of matches. 
We can set up the equation: 0.7x = 20
Solving for x, we get x = 28.57
Rounding down, the team played 28 matches in total.
The number of losses is 30% of 28, which is 8.4
Rounding down, the team lost 8 matches.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
