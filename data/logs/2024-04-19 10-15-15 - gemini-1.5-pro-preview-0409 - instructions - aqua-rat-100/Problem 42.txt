## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: A straight picket fence is composed of x pickets each of which is 1/2 inch wide. If there are 6 inches of space between each pair of pickets, which of the following represents the length of fence in feet?
Choices:
  A: 13x/2
  B: 13x/2 - 6
  C: 13x/24
  D: (13x+1)/24
  E: (13x-12)/24
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Determine the width of each picket and the width of each space.
2. Calculate the combined width of a picket-space unit.
3. Identify the number of pickets (x).
4. Recognize that the number of spaces is one less than the number of pickets (x-1).
5. Calculate the total length of the fence in inches by multiplying the number of pickets by the picket width and adding the product of the number of spaces and the space width.
6. Convert the length from inches to feet by dividing by 12.
7. Simplify the expression for the length in feet.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Following the reflection steps:
1. Picket width = 1/2 inch, Space width = 6 inches.
2. Combined width = 1/2 + 6 = 13/2 inches.
3. Number of pickets = x.
4. Number of spaces = x-1.
5. Total length in inches = (x * 1/2) + ((x-1) * 6) = 13x/2 - 6.
6. Length in feet = (13x/2 - 6) / 12.
7. Simplified length = (13x - 12) / 24 feet.
Action: Answer("E")
