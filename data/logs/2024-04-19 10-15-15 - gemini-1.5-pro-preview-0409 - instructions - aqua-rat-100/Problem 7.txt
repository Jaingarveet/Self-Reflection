## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Topic: Math
Question: Amy is organizing her bookshelves and finds that she has 10 different types of books. She then codes each book with either a single letter or a pair of two different letters. If each type of book is uniquely represented by either a single letter or pair of letters, what is the smallest number of letters Amy will need to create the codes for all 10 types of books? (Assume the order of letters in a pair does not matter.)
Choices:
  A: 3
  B: 4
  C: 5
  D: 10
  E: 20

## Assistant 2:
## Reflection on Previous Attempt:
In my previous attempt, I incorrectly assumed that using pairs of letters would always be more efficient than single letters. This led me to a suboptimal solution.
## Improved Approach:
1. **Start with single letters:** We can assign a unique single letter to each of the first 9 types of books (A to I).
2. **Use a pair for the 10th type:** Since we've used up all single letters, we need a pair for the 10th type. We can use any remaining letter and pair it with one of the already used letters (e.g., AJ).
Therefore, we need a minimum of **9 single letters + 1 additional letter for the pair = 10 letters**.
