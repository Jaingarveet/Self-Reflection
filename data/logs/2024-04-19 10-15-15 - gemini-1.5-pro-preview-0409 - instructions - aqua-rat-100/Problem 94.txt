## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Read the problem carefully and identify if repetition is allowed or not.
2. Determine if order matters (permutation) or not (combination).
3. Calculate the number of ways to choose letters and numbers based on the correct counting method (permutation or combination).
4. Multiply the number of ways to choose letters by the number of ways to choose numbers to get the total number of distinct bike numbers.
5. Verify your answer against the available choices.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
1. The problem states "distinct bike no.'s," so repetition is NOT allowed.
2. Order matters as different arrangements of letters and numbers will create different bike numbers (e.g., AB12 is different from BA21). So, we need to use permutations.
3. We need to choose 2 distinct letters from 26, which can be done in 26P2 ways (permutation of 26 objects taken 2 at a time).
4. We also need to choose 2 distinct numbers from 10, which can be done in 10P2 ways.
5. The total number of distinct bike numbers is the product of these two: 26P2 * 10P2.
6. Calculating 26P2 * 10P2 = 65000, which matches option D.
Action: Answer("D") 
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
