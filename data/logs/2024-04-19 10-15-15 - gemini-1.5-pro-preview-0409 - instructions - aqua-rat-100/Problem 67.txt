## Assistant 2:
Thought:
I recall this question and my previous incorrect reasoning. 
I need to carefully set up the ratios and ensure I'm comparing the correct quantities.
Let's analyze the given information step-by-step:
*   6 pitas = 2 rolls
*   3 rolls = 5 baguettes
*   We need to find the equivalence between baguettes and pitas.
To connect baguettes to pitas, I can use the rolls as an intermediary. 
1.  From "6 pitas = 2 rolls", I get 1 roll = 3 pitas.
2.  Substituting this into "3 rolls = 5 baguettes", I get (3 * 3 pitas) = 5 baguettes, which simplifies to 9 pitas = 5 baguettes.
3.  Therefore, 1 baguette is equivalent to 9/5 pitas.
4.  Finally, 2 baguettes would be 2 * (9/5) pitas = 18/5 pitas.
