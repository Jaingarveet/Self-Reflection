Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Calculate the required monthly profit by dividing the annual profit target by 12.
2. Calculate the required profit per unit by dividing the monthly profit by the number of units produced per month.
3. Avoid rounding off the profit per unit prematurely; keep the full decimal value for accuracy.
4. Add the production cost per unit to the required profit per unit to find the minimum selling price.
5. If the minimum selling price is not an integer, round it UP to the nearest dollar to ensure the profit target is met.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Following the reflection instructions: 
1. Monthly profit = $626,400 / 12 = $52,200.
2. Profit per unit = $52,200 / 420 = $124.2857... (keeping the full decimal).
3. Minimum selling price = $124.2857... + $110 = $234.2857...
4. Rounding UP to the nearest dollar, the minimum selling price is $235.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
