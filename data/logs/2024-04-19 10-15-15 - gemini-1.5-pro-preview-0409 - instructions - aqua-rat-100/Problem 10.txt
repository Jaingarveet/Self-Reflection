## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")

Question: At its maximum speed, a space shuttle can travel 700m high in 40 seconds. It will also take 5 seconds to pass a point. What then is the length of the space shuttle?
Choices:
  A: 50 m
  B: 75 m
  C: 100 m
  D: 125 m
  E: 150 m
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Calculate the speed of the space shuttle.
2. Recognize that the distance traveled in 5 seconds includes the shuttle's length and the additional distance.
3. Set up an equation to represent the relationship between the total distance, the shuttle's length, and the additional distance.
4. Solve the equation to find the shuttle's length.
5. Calculate the distance traveled in 5 seconds due to the shuttle's length.
6. Divide this distance by the time to find the length of the space shuttle.
7. Choose the answer closest to the calculated length.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
1. Speed = Distance / Time = 700m / 40s = 17.5 m/s
2. Distance in 5s = Speed * Time = 17.5 m/s * 5s = 87.5m
3. This distance includes the shuttle's length (L) and the additional distance it travels in 5 seconds.
4.  Shuttle's length = Total distance - Additional distance 
5.  Shuttle's length = 87.5m - (17.5 m/s * 5s) = 0m 
6. This answer doesn't make sense, so there must be an error in the problem or the provided reflection.
