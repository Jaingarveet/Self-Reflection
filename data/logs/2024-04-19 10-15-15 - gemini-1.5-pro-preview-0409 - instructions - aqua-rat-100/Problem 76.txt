## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Reflection on Previous Attempt:
**Error Analysis:**
In my previous attempt, I made the mistake of assuming that the expression could be simplified directly by canceling out terms. This led to an incorrect simplification and ultimately the wrong answer choice. 
**Understanding the Correct Approach:**
The correct approach involves recognizing the given expression as a perfect square trinomial. This allows us to factor it and then simplify to find the range of possible values for x.
**Steps for Correct Solution:**
1. **Recognize the Perfect Square Trinomial:** The numerator of the expression is in the form of (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2, where a = n and b = 4√n.
2. **Factor the Numerator:** Rewrite the numerator as (n + 4√n)^2.
3. **Simplify the Expression:** Cancel out the common factor of (n + 4√n) in the numerator and denominator. This leaves us with x = n + 4√n.
4. **Find the Range of x:** Given that 36 ≤ n ≤ 72, we can find the minimum and maximum values of x by substituting these values into the simplified expression.
**Applying the Correct Approach:**
1. **Minimum Value of x:** When n = 36, x = 36 + 4√36 = 60.
2. **Maximum Value of x:** When n = 72, x = 72 + 4√72 ≈ 103.43.
Therefore, the correct range for x is 60 < x < 103.43.
