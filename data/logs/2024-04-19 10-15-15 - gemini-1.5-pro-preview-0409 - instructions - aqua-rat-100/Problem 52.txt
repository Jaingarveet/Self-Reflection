Choices:
  A: 69:91
  B: 59:91
  C: 59:90
  D: 59:91

## Reflection on Previous Attempt:
**Error Analysis:**
In my previous attempt, I incorrectly calculated the amount of zinc and copper in each alloy. I mistakenly used the ratio as the direct quantity of each metal, rather than calculating the proportion of each metal based on the given weights of the alloys.
**Corrected Approach:**
1. **Calculate the amount of zinc and copper in alloy X:**
    - Zinc in X: (6/15) * 40g = 16g
    - Copper in X: (9/15) * 40g = 24g
2. **Calculate the amount of zinc and copper in alloy Y:**
    - Zinc in Y: (7/18) * 60g = 23.33g
    - Copper in Y: (11/18) * 60g = 36.67g
3. **Calculate the total amount of zinc and copper in alloy Z:**
    - Total Zinc: 16g + 23.33g = 39.33g
    - Total Copper: 24g + 36.67g = 60.67g
4. **Find the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z:**
    - Zinc : Copper = 39.33g : 60.67g
    - Simplify the ratio by dividing both sides by the greatest common divisor (which appears to be close to 1):
    - Zinc : Copper â‰ˆ 39 : 61
**Answer Selection:**
Based on the corrected calculations, the closest ratio among the choices is 39:61. However, none of the provided options exactly match this ratio. 
Therefore, I would need to analyze the options further or request clarification on the available choices. 
## Result:
Agent Answer: None
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
