  B: whether there are more cocker spaniels registered to addresses in Flynn Heights than any other breed of dog
  C: whether the city's animal control officers find more stray dogs in and around Flynn Heights than in any other part of the city

## Reflection on Previous Attempt:
**My previous error:** I previously focused on the popularity of cocker spaniels within Flynn Heights, neglecting the crucial aspect of straying tendencies.
**Why it was wrong:** The argument's core is the likelihood of a stray cocker spaniel in the vicinity belonging to Flynn Heights. This hinges on the assumption that cocker spaniels from Flynn Heights are more prone to straying, not just their population.
**What I learned:** Evaluating arguments requires identifying the underlying assumptions and focusing on information that directly addresses those assumptions. 
## Applying the Learning:
The key assumption here is that cocker spaniels from Flynn Heights are more likely to stray. So, the most useful information would be:
