## System:
You are an expert in Law.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")

Context: Science journalist: Brown dwarfs are celestial objects with more mass than planets but less mass than stars. They are identified by their mass and whether or not lithium is present in their atmospheres. Stars at least as massive as the Sun have lithium remaining in their atmospheres because the mixing of elements in their internal nuclear furnaces is incomplete. Stars with less mass than the Sun have no lithium because the element has been fully mixed into their nuclear furnaces and consumed. A brown dwarf does not have a fully functional nuclear furnace and so its lithium cannot be consumed.
Question: Which one of the following is most strongly supported by the science journalist's statements?
Choices:
  A: Any celestial object without lithium in its atmosphere is a star with less mass than the Sun.
  B: Any celestial object with lithium in its atmosphere has a nuclear furnace that has incompletely mixed the object's elements.
  C: No celestial object that has no lithium in its atmosphere is a brown dwarf.
  D: No celestial object with lithium in its atmosphere has less mass than the Sun.
  E: No celestial object less massive than a brown dwarf has lithium in its atmosphere.

## Assistant 2:
## Reflection on Previous Attempt:
In my previous attempt, I likely focused too much on the presence of lithium as a defining characteristic and failed to consider the full context of mass and nuclear furnace functionality. This led to an inaccurate conclusion. 
## Analysis of the Current Question:
We need to identify the statement most strongly supported by the information provided. Let's analyze each option:
* **A:** This is too broad. It ignores brown dwarfs which also lack lithium.
* **B:** This is partially true, but it doesn't encompass brown dwarfs which have lithium but not fully functional nuclear furnaces.
* **C:** This contradicts the information about brown dwarfs having lithium.
* **D:** This is contradicted by the information about stars at least as massive as the Sun having lithium.
* **E:** This aligns with the information provided. Brown dwarfs are the least massive objects with lithium, and anything less massive (planets) wouldn't have lithium or a nuclear furnace.
Therefore, the most strongly supported statement is that no celestial object less massive than a brown dwarf has lithium in its atmosphere.
**Action: Answer("E")** 
## Result:
Agent Answer: E
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
