## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: $$h=-4.9 t^{2}+25 t$$The equation above expresses the approximate height $h$, in meters, of a ball $t$ seconds after it is launched vertically upward from the ground with an initial velocity of 25 meters per second. After approximately how many seconds will the ball hit the ground?
Choices:
  A: 3.5
  B: 4.0
  C: 4.5
  D: 5.0

## Assistant 2:
  The equation given is a quadratic equation, and it can be factored as:

$$h=-4.9(t^2)-25t+[REDACTED]$$

The vertex of the parabola is at $t=[\REDACTED]$, and the ball will hit the ground when $h=0$.

Therefore, we can set $h=0$ and solve for $t$:

$$0=-4.9t^2-25t+[REDACTED]$$

We can factor out a $4.9$ from the first two terms:

$$0=-4.9(t^2+5t+[REDACTED])$$

Now, we can see that $t^2+5t+[REDACTED]$ is a perfect square:

$$t^2+5t+[REDACTED]=(t+[REDACTED])^2$$

Thus, we have:

$$0=-4.9(t+[REDACTED])^2$$

Taking the square root of both sides, we get:

$$t+[REDACTED]=\pm\sqrt{4.9}$$

Since $t$ is a time in seconds, we know that $t\geq 0$. Therefore, we can discard the negative solution and choose the positive solution:

$$t+[REDACTED]=\sqrt{4.9}$$

Subtracting $[REDACTED]$ from both sides, we get:

$$t=\sqrt{4.9}-[REDACTED]$$

Now, we can calculate the value of $t$ using the given choices:

For choice A, $t=3.5$:

$$3.5=\sqrt{4.9}-[REDACTED]$$

This equation is not true, so we can eliminate choice A.

For choice B, $t=4.0$:

$$4.0=\sqrt{4.9}-[REDACTED]$$

This equation is not true, so we can eliminate choice B.

For choice C, $t=4.5$:

$$4.5=\sqrt{4.9}-[REDACTED]$$

This equation is true, so we can select choice C.

Therefore, the ball will hit the ground approximately $4.5$ seconds after it is launched.

Action: Answer("C")
