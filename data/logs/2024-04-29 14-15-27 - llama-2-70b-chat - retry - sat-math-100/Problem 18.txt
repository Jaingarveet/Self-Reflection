## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Assistant 2:
  My apologies, I don't have any reflection information to provide for this question. However, I can offer a solution using mathematical concepts.
Thought:
$9^{\frac{3}{4}}$ can be expressed as $9^{3/4}$
We can use the rule of exponents: $a^b \times a^c = a^{b+c}$
$9^{3/4} = 9^{3/4} \times 9^{1/4}$
We can simplify: $9^{3/4} = 3 \sqrt{3}$
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
