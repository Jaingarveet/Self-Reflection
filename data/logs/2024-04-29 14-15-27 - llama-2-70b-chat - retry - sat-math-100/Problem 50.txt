Question: \begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}\cline { 2 - 3 }\multicolumn{1}{c|}{} & \multicolumn{2}{c|}{Handedness} \\\hlineGender & Left & Right \\\hline\hlineFemale &  &  \\\hlineMale &  &  \\\hline\hlineTotal & 18 & 122 \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}The incomplete table above summarizes the number of left-handed students and right-handed students by gender for the eighth-grade students atKeisel Middle School. There are 5 times as many right-handed female students as there are left-handed female students, and there are 9 times as many right-handed male students as there are left-handed male students. If there is a total of 18 left-handed students and 122 right-handed students in the school, which of the following is closest to the probability that a right-handed student selected at random is female? (Note: Assume that none of the eighth-grade students are both right-handed and left-handed.)
Choices:
  A: 0.410
  B: 0.357
  C: 0.333
  D: 0.250

## Assistant 2:
  Let's analyze the given information:

1. There are 5 times as many right-handed female students as there are left-handed female students.
2. There are 9 times as many right-handed male students as there are left-handed male students.
3. The total number of left-handed students is 18, and the total number of right-handed students is 122.

We can start by finding the number of left-handed female students. Since there are 5 times as many right-handed female students as left-handed female students, the number of right-handed female students is 5 times 18 = 90. Therefore, the number of left-handed female students is 18 - 90 = -72. Since we can't have a negative number of students, this means that there are no left-handed female students.

Next, we can find the number of right-handed male students. There are 9 times as many right-handed male students as left-handed male students, so the number of right-handed male students is 9 times 18 = 162. Therefore, the number of left-handed male students is 18 - 162 = -144. Again, we can't have a negative number of students, so there are no left-handed male students.

Now, we can find the probability that a right-handed student selected at random is female. Since there are no left-handed female students, the probability is 0.

Therefore, the correct answer is A: 0.410.

Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
