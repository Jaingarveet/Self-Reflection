  My apologies, I don't have any information to provide for reflection as none was given in the prompt.

Let's evaluate the given equation:

$$\frac{2}{3}(9x - 6) - 4 = 9x - 6$$

We can start by simplifying the left-hand side:

$$\frac{2}{3}(9x - 6) = \frac{2}{3}(9x) - \frac{2}{3}(6)$$

Now, we can calculate:

$$\frac{2}{3}(9x) = 6x$$

$$\frac{2}{3}(6) = 4$$

So, the equation becomes:

$$6x - 4 - 4 = 9x - 6$$

We can simplify further:

$$6x - 8 = 9x - 6$$

Now, we can solve for $x$:

$$3x = 14$$

$$x = \frac{14}{3}$$

$$x = 4$$

Now, we need to find the value of $3x - 2$. We can substitute $x = 4$ into the expression:

$$3x - 2 = 3(4) - 2 = 12 - 2 = 10$$

So, the value of $3x - 2$ is $10$.
