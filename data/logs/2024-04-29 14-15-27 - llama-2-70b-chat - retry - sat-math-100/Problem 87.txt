## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Assistant 2:
  The reflection information is not provided, so I cannot use it to answer the question. Here's how I would solve the problem:
Let (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) be the coordinates of the two points where the parabola and the line intersect. We can substitute the values of y1 and y2 into the equation of the parabola to get:
(x1 - 11)^2 = 25
(x2 - 11)^2 = 25
We can simplify these equations by adding 11 to both sides:
x1^2 - 22x1 + 121 = 25
x2^2 - 22x2 + 121 = 25
We can factor the left-hand sides of the equations:
(x1 + 11)(x1 - 11) = 0
(x2 + 11)(x2 - 11) = 0
Therefore, x1 = -11 or x1 = 11, and x2 = -11 or x2 = 11.
Since the line and the parabola intersect at two points, we need to find the distance between these points. We can do this by using the distance formula:
AB = sqrt((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2)
We can substitute the values of x1, x2, y1, and y2 into the formula:
AB = sqrt((11 - (-11))^2 + (25 - (-11)^2))
AB = sqrt(121 + 16)
AB = sqrt(137)
AB â‰ˆ 11.7
The length of  AB is approximately 11.7, which is between 10 and 12. Therefore, the correct answer is B: 12.
Action: Answer("B")
