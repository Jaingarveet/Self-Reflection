## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

## Assistant 2:
  My apologies, I don't have any information to provide for reflection on this question. However, I can still answer the question using the given choices.

Action: Answer("B")

Explanation:
We can start by distributing the $2x$ factor to the two terms inside the parentheses:

$$2x(x^2 - 3x) = 2x^3 - 6x^2$$

Now, we can simplify the expression by combining like terms:

$$2x^3 - 6x^2 = 3x^3 - x^2$$

Therefore, the correct answer is choice B: $3x^3 - x^2$.
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
