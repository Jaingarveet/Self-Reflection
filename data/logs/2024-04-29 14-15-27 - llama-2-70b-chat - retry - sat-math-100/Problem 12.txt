## Assistant 2:
  Let's analyze the problem step by step:
In 2015, the population of City X and City Y were equal.
The population of City X increased by 20% from 2010 to 2015.
The population of City Y decreased by 10% from 2010 to 2015.
The population of City X in 2010 was 120,000.

We can let the population of City Y in 2010 be x.
Since the populations of City X and City Y were equal in 2015, we can set up the equation:
120,000 + (120,000 * 20% ) = x + (x * -10%)
120,000 + 24,000 = x - 10%x
144,000 = 90,000

Therefore, the population of City Y in 2010 was 90,000.
Action: Answer("B")
