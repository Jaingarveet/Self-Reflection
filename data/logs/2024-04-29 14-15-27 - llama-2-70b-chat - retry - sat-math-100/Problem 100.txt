## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Context: $$.a=1,052+1.08 t.$$.The speed of a sound wave in air depends on the air temperature. The formula above shows the relationship between $a$, the speed of a sound wave, in feet per second, and $t$, the air temperature, in degrees Fahrenheit $\left({ }^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\right)$.
Question: At which of the following air temperatures will the speed of a sound wave be closest to 1,000 feet per second?
Choices:
  A: $-46^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$
  B: $-48^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$
  C: $-49^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$
  D: $-50^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$

## Assistant 2:
  Let's analyze the given choices:

A: $-46^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$
B: $-48^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$
C: $-49^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$
D: $-50^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$

We can start by noticing that the formula $a=1,052+1.08 t$ shows a positive relationship between $a$ and $t$. This means that as $t$ increases, $a$ will also increase. Therefore, the speed of a sound wave will be closest to 1,000 feet per second when $t$ is closest to 0.

Now, let's calculate the value of $a$ for each choice:

A: $a=1,052+1.08 \times (-46)=946$
B: $a=1,052+1.08 \times (-48)=914$
C: $a=1,052+1.08 \times (-49)=882$
D: $a=1,052+1.08 \times (-50)=850$

We can see that the closest value to 1,000 is 914, which corresponds to choice B: $-48^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$.

Therefore, the answer is B: $-48^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$.

Action: Answer("B")
