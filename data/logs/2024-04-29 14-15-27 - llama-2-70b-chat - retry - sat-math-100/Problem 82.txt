## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

## Assistant 2:
  The question is asking for the value of $d$, which is the $y$-coordinate of the vertex of the parabola.
We can find the value of $d$ by first finding the vertex of the parabola.
The vertex of a quadratic function of the form $f(x)=a(x-h)^2+k$ is located at $(h, k)$.
In this case, we have $a\neq 0$, so we can rewrite the equation as:
$$y=a(x-2)(x+4)$$
Expanding the product, we get:
$$y=a(x^2-8x+16)$$
Comparing with the standard form of a quadratic function, we have:
$$h=-4$$
$$k=16$$
Therefore, the vertex of the parabola is located at $(-4, 16)$.
Now, we can find the value of $d$, which is the $y$-coordinate of the vertex:
$$d=16$$
So, the correct answer is:
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: A
