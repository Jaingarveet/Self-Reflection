Question: $$0.10 x+0.20 y=0.18(x+y)$$Clayton will mix $x$ milliliters of a $10 \%$ by mass saline solution with $y$ milliliters of a $20 \%$ by mass saline solution in order to create an $18 \%$ by mass saline solution. The equation above represents this situation. If Clayton uses 100 milliliters of the $20 \%$ by mass saline solution, how many milliliters of the $10 \%$ by mass saline solution must he use?
Choices:
  A: 5
  B: 25
  C: 50
  D: 100

## Assistant 2:
  Let's analyze the given equation:

$$0.10 x + 0.20 y = 0.18(x + y)$$

We know that $y = 100$ (milliliters) since Clayton uses 100 milliliters of the $20\%$ by mass saline solution.

Now, we can substitute $y = 100$ into the equation:

$$0.10 x + 0.20(100) = 0.18(x + 100)$$

Simplifying:

$$0.10 x + 20 = 0.18x + 180$$

Subtracting $0.10x$ from both sides:

$$10 = 0.08x + 180$$

Subtracting $180$ from both sides:

$$-70 = 0.08x$$

Dividing both sides by $0.08$:

$$-70/0.08 = x$$

$$x = 900$$

Therefore, Clayton must use $900$ milliliters of the $10\%$ by mass saline solution.

Action: Answer("C")
