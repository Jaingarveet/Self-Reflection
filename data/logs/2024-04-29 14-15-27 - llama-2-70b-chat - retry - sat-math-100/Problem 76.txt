## Assistant 2:
  My apologies, I don't have any information to provide for reflection on this question. However, I can still answer the question using the given information.

Given: $\frac{5}{x} = \frac{15}{x+20}$

We can start by cross-multiplying and simplifying:

$\frac{5}{x} = \frac{15}{x+20}$

$5x = 15(x+20)$

$5x = 15x + 300$

$10x = 300$

$x = 30$

Now, we need to find $\frac{x}{5}$.

$\frac{x}{5} = \frac{30}{5}$

= 6

So, the correct answer is:

Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
