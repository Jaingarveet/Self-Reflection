## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Question: Alan drives an average of 100 miles each week. His car can travel an average of 25 miles per gallon of gasoline. Alan would like to reduce his weekly expenditure on gasoline by $\$ 5$. Assuming gasoline costs $\$ 4$ per gallon, which equation can Alan use to determine how many fewer average miles, $m$, he should drive each week?
Choices:
  A: $\frac{25}{4} m=95$
  B: $\frac{25}{4} m=5$
  C: $\frac{4}{25} m=95$
  D: $\frac{4}{25} m=5$

## Assistant 2:
  My apologies, I don't have any information to provide for reflection as I don't have a previous attempt at this question. However, I can solve the question using the given information.

Let's analyze the choices:

A: $\frac{25}{4} m=95$
This equation is not correct. The left-hand side is the number of miles per gallon, and the right-hand side is the total number of miles driven.

B: $\frac{25}{4} m=5$
This equation is also not correct for the same reason as choice A.

C: $\frac{4}{25} m=95$
This equation is correct. The left-hand side is the cost per gallon, and the right-hand side is the total weekly expenditure on gasoline that Alan wants to reduce.

D: $\frac{4}{25} m=5$
This equation is not correct. The left-hand side is the cost per gallon, and the right-hand side is a random number that does not relate to the problem.

Action: Answer("C")

Alan can use the equation $\frac{4}{25} m=95$ to determine how many fewer average miles he should drive each week.
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
