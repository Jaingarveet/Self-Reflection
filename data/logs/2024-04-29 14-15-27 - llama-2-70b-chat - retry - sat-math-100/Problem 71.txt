## Assistant 2:
  The question asks for the closest probability that a tablet user answered "Always," given that the tablet user did not answer "Never." We can calculate the probability using the information provided in the table.

The total percentage of users who did not answer "Never" is 65.7% (24.3% + 13.5% + 30.9%). Since we want to find the probability of a user answering "Always," we can subtract the percentage of users who answered "Rarely" and "Often" from the total percentage of users who did not answer "Never."

65.7% - 24.3% - 13.5% = 38.9%

Therefore, the closest answer is B: 0.38.

Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
