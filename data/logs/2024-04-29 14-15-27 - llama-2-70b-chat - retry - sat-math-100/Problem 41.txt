## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

## Assistant 2:
  The correct answer is B: $x-3$.

The function $f(x)$ is defined by a polynomial, and the given table shows some values of $x$ and $f(x)$. To find a factor of $f(x)$, we need to find a common factor of the given values of $f(x)$.

We can observe that $f(0) = 3$, $f(2) = 1$, $f(4) = 0$, and $f(5) = -2$.

We can factor out $x-3$ from all the values of $f(x)$:

$f(0) = 3 = (x-3)(1)$
$f(2) = 1 = (x-3)(1/2)$
$f(4) = 0 = (x-3)(0)$
$f(5) = -2 = (x-3)(-2/3)$

Therefore, $x-3$ must be a factor of $f(x)$.

Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: C
