  My apologies, I don't have any information to provide for reflection as none was given in the prompt.

Let's evaluate the given equation:

$$\frac{x^{2}-1}{x-1}=-2$$

We can factor the numerator and denominator:

$$\frac{(x-1)(x+1)}{x-1}=-2$$

Now, we can equate the factors:

$$(x-1)(x+1)=-2(x-1)$$

Expanding the left-hand side, we get:

$$x^2 - 1 = -2x + 2$$

Moving all terms to the left-hand side and factoring, we get:

$$x^2 - 3x + 2 = 0$$

Comparing with the quadratic formula, we have:

$$(x - 1)(x - 2) = 0$$

Therefore, we have two possible solutions:

$$x - 1 = 0 \lor x - 2 = 0$$

Solving for x, we get:

$$x = 1 \lor x = 2$$

So, the values of x that satisfy the equation are 1 and 2.

Action: Answer("C")
