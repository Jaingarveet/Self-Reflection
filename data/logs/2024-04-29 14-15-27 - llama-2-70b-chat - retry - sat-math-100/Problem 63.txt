## Assistant 2:
  My apologies, I don't have any reflection information to provide. Let's evaluate the choices:

A: $300 = 30w - 60$
The left-hand side is equal to $300$, and the right-hand side is negative, which means this equation is not true for any value of $w$. Therefore, this is not the correct equation.

B: $300 = 30w$
This equation is true, since $300 = 30 \times 10$. This means that the number of weekly payments required to complete the purchase is $10$.

C: $300 = 30w + 60$
This equation is not true for any value of $w$, since the left-hand side is always greater than the right-hand side.

D: $300 = 60w - 30$
This equation is not true for any value of $w$, since the left-hand side is always less than the right-hand side.

Therefore, the correct answer is B: $300 = 30w$.

Action: Answer("B")
