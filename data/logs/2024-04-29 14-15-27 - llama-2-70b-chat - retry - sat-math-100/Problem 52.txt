## Assistant 2:
  I'm sorry, but since there is no reflection information provided, I cannot use my self-reflection to help me answer this question. However, I can try to solve the problem using the information given.

Let's say the number of pears produced by Type B trees is x.
We know that Type A trees produced 20% more pears than Type B trees, so Type A trees produced 144 + (20% of 144) = 144 + 28.8 = 172.8 pears.
We can set up a proportion to relate the number of pears produced by Type A and Type B trees:

144/x = 172.8/144

Simplifying the proportion, we get:

1/x = 172.8/144

x = 172.8/144

x = 1.2

Since the number of pears produced by Type B trees is a whole number, we can round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the number of pears produced by Type B trees is 12.

Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
