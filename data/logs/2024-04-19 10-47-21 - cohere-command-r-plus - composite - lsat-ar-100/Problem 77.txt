Context: An administrator must assign parking spaces to six new employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young. Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
Question: For how many of the six new employees is the assignment of a parking space limited to one of only two possible spaces?
Choices:
  A: none
  B: two
  C: three
  D: four
  E: five
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation
- Overly restrictive interpretation
- Rule misunderstanding

Solution:
Let's re-examine the rules and the options for each employee: 
- Robertson must be assigned one of the first [REDACTED] spaces (#1 to #4). This means that [REDACTED] of these [REDACTED] spaces will be taken, leaving the remaining [REDACTED] employees with more flexibility. 
- Young must have a higher number than Togowa. If Togowa is assigned #1, it doesn't restrict Young's options; Young could still be assigned any of the remaining [REDACTED] spaces (#2 to #6). 
- Xu must have a higher number than Souza, but this rule doesn't limit their options significantly. 

Now, let's consider Young, Xu, and Souza: 
- Young has [REDACTED] options if Togowa takes #1 (#2 to #6). 
- Xu has [REDACTED] options if Souza takes #1 or #2. 
- Souza has [REDACTED] options if Xu takes any space from #1 to #4. 

Therefore, at most, [REDACTED] employees (Robertson, Young, Xu, and Souza) are limited to only [REDACTED] possible spaces each. 

Instructions:
1. Identify the fixed starting point: Robertson must be assigned #1 to #4. 
2. Understand the conditions for Young, Xu, and Souza in relation to other employees' assignments. 
3. Consider the best-case scenario for Young, Xu, and Souza, where their options are most flexible. 
4. Count the number of employees with limited options. 

Advice:
- Understand the rules and conditions thoroughly. Ensure you interpret "must be higher/lower" as providing flexibility rather than strict limitations. 
- Consider the most flexible scenarios first, as these will provide the lower bound for the number of possible options. 
- Systematically work through each employee's options, considering the impact of each possible assignment on the remaining employees.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The parking space assignment is limited to two possible spaces for three employees: Robertson, Xu, and Young.

Robertson must be assigned one of the first four spaces (#1 to #4). This leaves only two options for Xu and Young each, as they have to be assigned higher numbers than Souza and Togowa, respectively.
Action: Answer("C")
