## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I made a mistake in my calculation of the perimeter. I correctly found the length and breadth, but when calculating the perimeter, I made an arithmetic error.
Error Keywords:
- Calculation error
- Arithmetic error
- Perimeter calculation error
Solution:
Let's denote the breadth as x. Then the length is 4x + 1.
The area of the rectangle is length * breadth = 150 sq m, so x * (4x + 1) = 150.
Solving this equation gives x = 5 and 4x + 1 = 21.
The perimeter of a rectangle is 2 * (length + breadth), so the perimeter is 2 * (21 + 5) = 52 m.
Instructions:
1. Denote the breadth as x and the length as 4x + 1.
2. Set up the equation for the area of the rectangle: x * (4x + 1) = 150.
3. Solve this equation to find the values of x and 4x + 1.
4. Calculate the perimeter of the rectangle using the formula 2 * (length + breadth).
5. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
6. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
- Always read the question carefully and understand what is being asked.
- Break down complex problems into simpler steps.
- Be careful with your calculations, especially when dealing with multiple steps.
- Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
- Remember the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle: 2 * (length + breadth).
