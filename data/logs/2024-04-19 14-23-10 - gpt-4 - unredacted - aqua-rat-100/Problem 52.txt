Question: X and Y are two alloys which were made by mixing zinc and copper in the ratio 6:9 and 7:11, respectively. If 40 grams of alloy X and 60 grams of alloy Y are melted and mixed to form alloy Z, what is the ratio of zinc and copper in the alloy Z ?
Choices:
  A: 69:91
  B: 59:91
  C: 59:90
  D: 59:91
  E: 69:101

Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I made a mistake in my calculations. I incorrectly calculated the amount of zinc and copper in alloy Y. I also made a rounding error when calculating the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z. 
Error Keywords:
- Calculation error
- Arithmetic error
- Ratio error
- Rounding error
Solution:
For alloy X, the total ratio is 6+9=15. So, the amount of zinc is 6/15*40=16 grams and the amount of copper is 9/15*40=24 grams.
For alloy Y, the total ratio is 7+11=18. So, the amount of zinc is 7/18*60=23.33 grams and the amount of copper is 11/18*60=36.67 grams.
Then, we add the amounts of zinc and copper from both alloys to get the amounts in alloy Z. The amount of zinc is 16+23.33=39.33 grams and the amount of copper is 24+36.67=60.67 grams.
Finally, we find the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z by dividing both amounts by their greatest common divisor. The greatest common divisor of 39.33 and 60.67 is approximately 1. So, the ratio is approximately 39:61, which is not one of the choices.
However, if we round the amounts to the nearest whole number, we get 39 grams of zinc and 61 grams of copper, which gives a ratio of 39:61. This is also not one of the choices.
Therefore, there seems to be a mistake in the question or the choices.
Instructions:
1. Identify the ratio of zinc and copper in each alloy.
2. Calculate the amount of zinc and copper in each alloy.
3. Add the amounts of zinc and copper from both alloys to get the amounts in the new alloy.
4. Find the ratio of zinc to copper in the new alloy by dividing both amounts by their greatest common divisor.
5. Round the amounts to the nearest whole number if necessary.
6. Choose the answer that matches your calculated ratio.
Advice:
- Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
- Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
- Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
- Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
- Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
- Remember that the ratio of two numbers is the result of dividing them, not adding them.
