Question: A straight picket fence is composed of x pickets each of which is 1/2 inch wide. If there are 6 inches of space between each pair of pickets, which of the following represents the length of fence in feet?
Choices:
  A: 13x/2
  B: 13x/2 - 6
  C: 13x/24
  D: (13x+1)/24
  E: (13x-12)/24

Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I made a mistake in considering the space between the pickets. I included the space after the last picket, which should not be counted. This led to an overestimation of the total length of the fence.
Error Keywords:
- Conceptual error
- Overestimation
- Space calculation error
Solution:
Each picket is 1/2 inch wide and there are 6 inches of space between each pair of pickets. So, the total length for each picket including the space is 6.5 inches (6 + 0.5). 
However, there is no space after the last picket, so we need to subtract 6 inches from the total length.
The total length in inches is then 6.5x - 6.
To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot). 
So, the length in feet is (6.5x - 6)/12 = (13x - 12)/24.
Instructions:
1. Identify the width of each picket and the space between each pair of pickets.
2. Calculate the total length for each picket including the space.
3. Multiply this length by the number of pickets.
4. Subtract the space that is not present after the last picket.
5. Convert the total length from inches to feet by dividing by 12.
6. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
- Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
- Pay attention to the details in the problem, such as whether the space after the last item should be included or not.
- Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
- Remember to convert units when necessary.
