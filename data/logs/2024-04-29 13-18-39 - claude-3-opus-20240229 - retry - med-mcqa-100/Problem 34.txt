## Assistant 2:
To determine the type of hypersensitivity reaction for spring catarrh, let's think through the different types:
Type I (immediate) - IgE-mediated, examples include anaphylaxis and allergic asthma
Type II (cytotoxic) - IgG or IgM mediated, examples include hemolytic anemia and Goodpasture syndrome 
Type III (immune complex) - Antigen-antibody complexes deposited in tissues, examples include serum sickness and lupus nephritis
Type IV (delayed, cell-mediated) - T-cell mediated, examples include contact dermatitis and tuberculosis
Spring catarrh, also known as vernal keratoconjunctivitis, is a recurrent, bilateral, and self-limiting inflammation of conjunctiva. It is an allergic condition.
Based on the allergic nature and lack of involvement of other antibody types or immune complexes, spring catarrh is most likely a Type I hypersensitivity reaction.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: B
