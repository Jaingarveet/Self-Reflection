## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. Split skin grafts are commonly used in children to treat burns or other injuries where skin coverage is needed.
2. When choosing a donor site for a split skin graft, we want an area that:
   - Has healthy, undamaged skin
   - Is relatively hidden for cosmetic reasons
   - Will not be subject to a lot of movement or friction during healing
3. In young children, the buttocks are a good choice because:
   - The skin is usually healthy and undamaged 
   - It's a hidden area, important for cosmetic outcomes as the child grows
   - When lying supine or prone, there is little movement or friction on the buttocks compared to the thighs or limbs
4. The thighs and limbs move a lot in a young active child which could disrupt graft healing. The trunk is more visible cosmetically.
Therefore, the best donor site for a split skin graft in a young child is the buttocks.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
