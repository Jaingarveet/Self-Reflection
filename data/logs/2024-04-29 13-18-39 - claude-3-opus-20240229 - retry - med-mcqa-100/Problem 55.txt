## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The patient is a 60 year old male diagnosed with carcinoma of the right lung. 
2. The CECT chest shows two tumor nodules:
   - One 5x5 cm tumor in the upper lobe 
   - Another 2x2 cm tumor in the middle lobe
3. With two separate tumor nodules in different lobes of the right lung, this likely represents stage IV non-small cell lung cancer.
4. For stage IV non-small cell lung cancer, the primary treatment modality is systemic therapy, not localized therapy. 
5. Of the choices provided, chemotherapy is the only systemic therapy. Surgery and radiotherapy are localized treatments not indicated for stage IV disease.
Therefore, the best answer is:
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
