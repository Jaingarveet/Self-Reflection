## Assistant 2:
To determine when the mental health programme was started, I'll think through the given choices chronologically:
A: 1982 - This is the earliest year listed. Mental health awareness and treatment programs have evolved significantly since the 1980s, but large-scale national programs may have started emerging around this time. However, I don't have enough certainty to select this without more context.
B: 1987 - Five years later than choice A. The late 1980s saw continued development in mental health care and public health initiatives. This seems like a reasonable timeframe for a major mental health programme launch, but I still lack specific knowledge to confirm this year.
C: 1990 - The start of a new decade. By 1990, understanding and social awareness of mental health issues had grown, making it a likely time for the rollout of significant programmes. However, I don't have definite information that the programme in question began this exact year.
D: 1995 - This is the latest year provided. While certainly possible that the mental health programme started in the mid-90s, the earlier choices feel more likely to me given the trajectory of mental healthcare over the decades. But I can't rule this out conclusively.
Upon review, I realize I don't have sufficiently detailed knowledge about the origin of this specific mental health programme to select an answer with full confidence. More contextual information about the programme, the region it was implemented in, and its scale would help pinpoint the start year. 
Without being able to definitively select the correct year, I'll make an educated guess based on the progression of mental health care and public initiatives over time. The late 1980s through early 1990s seem most probable to me.
Action: Answer("B")
