## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The facial artery is a branch of the external carotid artery that supplies blood to the face.
2. It runs upward and forward, beneath the digastric and stylohyoid muscles, and over the submandibular gland. 
3. It then curves around the inferior border of the mandible and runs across the face to the angle of the mouth.
4. Near the angle of the mouth, the facial artery terminates by anastomosing (connecting) with a branch of another artery.
5. Looking at the choices, the infra-orbital artery is a branch of the maxillary artery that emerges onto the face through the infra-orbital foramen. This is the artery that the facial artery anastomoses with near the angle of the mouth.
Therefore, the correct answer is C: the facial artery terminates in the anastomosis with the infra-orbital artery.
Action: Answer("C")
