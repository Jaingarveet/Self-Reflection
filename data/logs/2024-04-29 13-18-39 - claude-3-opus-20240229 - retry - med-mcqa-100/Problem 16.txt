## System:
You are an expert in Medicine.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The axillary artery is the main artery supplying the upper limb. It is a continuation of the subclavian artery.
2. The axillary artery is divided into three parts by the pectoralis minor muscle. The second part lies behind the pectoralis minor.
3. If the second part of the axillary artery is obstructed, blood supply to the upper limb will be compromised. However, collateral circulation can maintain the blood supply.
4. Looking at the choices, we need to find the arteries that can provide collateral circulation around the second part of the axillary artery.
5. The posterior circumflex humeral artery arises from the third part of the axillary artery and anastomoses with the anterior circumflex humeral artery.
6. The subscapular artery also arises from the third part of the axillary artery. One of its branches, the circumflex scapular artery, anastomoses with branches of the transverse cervical artery (which arises from the thyrocervical trunk of the subclavian artery).
7. Therefore, the anastomosis between the circumflex scapular artery (a branch of the subscapular artery) and the deep branch of transverse cervical artery can maintain blood supply to the upper limb if the second part of the axillary artery is obstructed.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
