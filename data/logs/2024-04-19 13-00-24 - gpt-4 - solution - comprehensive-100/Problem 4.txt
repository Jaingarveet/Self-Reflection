## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

  C: 100 m
  D: 125 m
  E: 150 m
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
The space shuttle's maximum speed is 700m/40s = 17.5 m/s. 
If it takes 5 seconds to pass a point, then the length of the shuttle is 17.5 m/s * 5s = 87.5 m. 
The correct answer is not in the choices because I made a calculation error. The correct calculation is 17.5 m/s * 5s = 87.5 m, which rounds to 88 m. The closest value to 88 m is [REDACTED].
