## User 2:
Topic: Law
Context: Of the eight students—George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert—in a seminar, exactly six will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
Question: If George, Nina, and Robert give reports and they do so on different days from one another, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Helen gives a report on Wednesday.
  B: Nina gives a report on Monday.
  C: Nina gives a report on Tuesday.
  D: Olivia gives a report on Monday.
  E: Robert gives a report on Wednesday.

Solution:
Given that George, Nina, and Robert give reports on different days, and George can only report on Tuesday, this means that Nina and Robert must report on Monday and Wednesday. However, since Nina's report requires Helen and Irving to report the next day (unless Nina reports on Wednesday), Nina can report on Monday, and Helen and Irving can report on Tuesday. Therefore, Helen can give a report on Wednesday.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Given that George, Nina, and Robert give reports on different days, and George can only report on Tuesday, this means that Nina and Robert must report on Monday and Wednesday. However, since Nina's report requires Helen and Irving to report the next day (unless Nina reports on Wednesday), Nina cannot report on Monday. Therefore, the only possible day for Nina to report is Wednesday. This means Robert must report on Monday. Given these constraints, Helen cannot give a report on Wednesday because she must report the day after Nina, which would be Thursday, a day not in the schedule. Therefore, the only possible answer is E: Robert gives a report on Wednesday.
Action: Answer("E")
