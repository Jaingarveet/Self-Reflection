Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
If H is in team 2, Q is in the middle of team 1. So, Q must be in the middle of team 1.
If G or H is arranged to play, they must be in front Bit. So, G or H must be in the front of team 2.
If K is scheduled to play, he must be in the middle. So, K must be in the middle of team 1.
If L is scheduled to play, he must be on team 1. So, L must be in team 1.
Neither P nor K can be in the same team as N. So, P and K must be in team 2 and N must be in team 1.
P cannot be in the same team as Q. So, P must be in team 2 and Q must be in team 1.
Option [REDACTED]: H is in team 2, so Q must be in the middle of team 1. But P and K are also in team 2, which violates the condition. So, option [REDACTED] is not valid.
Option [REDACTED]: H is in team 2, so Q must be in the middle of team 1. L is in team 1, so this option satisfies all the conditions. So, option [REDACTED] is valid.
Option [REDACTED]: G is in team 2, so H cannot be in team 2. But H is not in team 1, which violates the condition. So, option [REDACTED] is not valid.
Option [REDACTED]: G is in team 2, so H cannot be in team 2. L is in team 1, so this option satisfies all the conditions. Also, N is in team 1, which satisfies the condition. So, option [REDACTED] is valid.
