The gap in my knowledge was not in geography but in basic arithmetic. 
I knew the correct city and state but made a calculation error.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Arithmetic error
 - Multiplication error
Solution:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
Iowa State University is located in the state of Iowa.
The city name "Ames" contains 4 letters.
The state name "Iowa" contains 4 letters.
The product of 4*4 is 16.
Instructions:
1. Identify the city where the university is located.
2. Identify the state where the university is located.
3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.
4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.
5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.
6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.
7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.

Topic: Law
Context: A shopping center has exactly seven spaces—space 1 through space 7—arranged in a straight row. Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
Question: If the optometrist is next to the shoe store, the businesses immediately on either side of this pair must be
Choices:
  A: the pharmacy and a restaurant
  B: the pharmacy and the toy store
  C: the two restaurants
  D: a restaurant and the toy store
  E: a restaurant and the veterinarian

  Thought: 
If the optometrist is next to the shoe store, the businesses immediately on either side of this pair must be the pharmacy and a restaurant. The pharmacy must be at one end of the row, and one of the restaurants must be at the other end. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, so the restaurant next to the optometrist must be the one that is not next to the pharmacy. Therefore, the businesses immediately on either side of the optometrist and shoe store pair must be the pharmacy and a restaurant.
Action: Answer("A")
