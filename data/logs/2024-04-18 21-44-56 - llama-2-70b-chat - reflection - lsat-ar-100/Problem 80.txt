## Assistant 1:
Explanation:

The gap in my knowledge was not in geography but in basic arithmetic. 
I knew the correct city and state but made a calculation error.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Arithmetic error
 - Multiplication error
Solution:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
Iowa State University is located in the state of Iowa.
The city name "Ames" contains 4 letters.

Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.

Context: An administrator must assign parking spaces to six new employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young. Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
Question: Which one of the following could be the assignment of parking spaces to the new employees?
Choices:
  A: #1: Young; #2: Souza; #3: Vaughn; #4: Robertson; #5: Togowa; #6: Xu
  B: #1: Vaughn; #2: Togowa; #3: Young; #4: Souza; #5: Robertson; #6: Xu
  C: #1: Togowa; #2: Young; #3: Xu; #4: Robertson; #5: Souza; #6: Vaughn
  D: #1: Togowa; #2: Robertson; #3: Young; #4: Souza; #5: Vaughn; #6: Xu
  E: #1: Souza; #2: Togowa; #3: Young; #4: Robertson; #5: Xu; #6: Vaughn

  Answer: C

Explanation:
The assignment of parking spaces must satisfy the following rules:
1. Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
2. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
3. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
4. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.

Option C meets all the above rules:

* Young is assigned parking space #3, which is higher than Togowa's #5.
* Xu is assigned parking space #4, which is higher than Souza's #5.
* Robertson is assigned parking space #1, which is higher than Young's #3.
* Robertson is assigned parking space #1, which is one of the allowed spaces (#1, #2, #3, or #4).

Therefore, option C is the correct answer.
