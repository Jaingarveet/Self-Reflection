## Assistant 2:
  Thought: The most likely completion to the text is option B: "Be sure to jot down this information to work through later. Otherwise, you might find yourself feeling bitterness or resentment."

Explanation: The text suggests that talking to a trusted friend can provide new perspective on the situation and help the person realize the value of their relationship with the frenemy. However, if the person does not jot down the information and work through it later, they may find themselves feeling bitterness or resentment towards the frenemy. This is a common pitfall when dealing with difficult relationships, and it is important to address the issues in a constructive manner to avoid holding onto negative emotions.
