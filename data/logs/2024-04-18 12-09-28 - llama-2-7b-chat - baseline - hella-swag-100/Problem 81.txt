[header] How to use dowsing or divining rods [title] Find dowsing or divining rods. [step] You can use natural items as dowsing or divining rods, such as tree branches or sticks. Often, diviners use forked sticks from trees such as willow, peach, and witch hazel.
Choices:
  A: [substeps] Some people also use exaggerated branches or canes because canes have been used so often in witchcraft. There may even be string hung from the branches before getting started on your project.
  B: Look for a stick that has a fork with branches of equal length on either end of the fork. [substeps] If you do not want to use a forked stick, you can use coat hanger, two wire rods, or a pendulum as a dowsing rod.
