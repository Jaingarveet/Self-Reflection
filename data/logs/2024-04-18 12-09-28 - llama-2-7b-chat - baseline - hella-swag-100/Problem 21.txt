[header] How to survive a sexless marriage
[title] Accept that you and your spouse have different needs and desires.
[step] Whether your sexual needs aren't being met or you're not interested in having sex, acknowledge that your partner's needs are just as valid. If rekindling your sex life isn't an option, having empathy for each other will help you deepen your bond in nonsexual ways.

The most likely completion to the text is:

C: You're each entitled to your individual physical and emotional needs. Try to put yourself in your partner's shoes and find ways to compromise with each other.

Explanation:
The text suggests that the couple should acknowledge and respect each other's needs, even if they are not being met. Option C best completes the text by providing a solution that involves compromise and understanding. Options A and B are not as relevant to the text, as they do not provide a practical solution to the problem of a sexless marriage. Option D is not a valid completion, as it does not relate to the topic of a sexless marriage.
## Result:
Agent Answer: None
Correct Answer: C
