## Assistant 2:
 Thought: The most likely completion to the text is option B: Ask your friends and family members if they would be willing to lend you some of the maternity clothes they wore when they were pregnant. This is the most practical and feasible option for obtaining maternity clothes without having to buy them.

Explanation: The text mentions that maternity clothes are only worn for a short period of time and are often still in good condition, making it a waste of money to buy them. Asking friends and family members for their unwanted maternity clothes is a more affordable and sustainable option. It also shows that the writer is willing to ask for help and support from their social network, which is a common practice when expecting a baby.
