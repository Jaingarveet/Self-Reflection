[title] Ask why you were stopped.
[step] A police officer may stop and temporarily detain you if he suspects you were engaged in illegal activity. This is called a "Terry stop."
Choices:

A: "Under this scenario, the officer can only ask you questions about the particular suspicious activity he observed. Ask the officer why you were stopped so that you know what kinds of questions he is legally permitted to ask you."

Explanation: When you are stopped by the police, it is important to understand your rights and how to react. A Terry stop is a temporary detention of an individual by a police officer who suspects illegal activity. During this stop, the officer can only ask questions about the specific activity that led to the stop. Therefore, it is important to ask the officer why you were stopped to understand what kinds of questions they are legally permitted to ask you.

C: "If you protest the stop, or argue, why the police stopped you, say your own honest story."

Explanation: When you are stopped by the police, it is important to be honest and provide your own story. If you protest or argue, it is important to explain your side of the story in a calm and respectful manner.
