Topic: Law
Context: A software company employs exactly seven sales representatives—Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall—to work in its three sales zones—Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3. Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Question: Which one of the following could be a complete and accurate list of the sales representatives working in Zone 3?
Choices:
  A: Kim, Mahr
  B: Kim, Tiao
  C: Parra, Quinn
  D: Stuckey, Tiao, Udall
  E: Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Udall
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I misunderstood the conditions and made an incorrect assumption about Tiao's placement. I assumed that Tiao must work in Zone 3, which led me to the wrong answer. 
Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation
- Incorrect assumption
- Logical reasoning error
Solution:
From the conditions, we know that Parra and Quinn work in the same zone, and Stuckey and Udall work in the same zone. 
Since either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, and either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2, it means that Tiao can work in either Zone 1 or Zone 2, but not in both. 
Since Parra and Quinn work in the same zone, and Stuckey and Udall work in the same zone, they cannot be in Zone 3 as Tiao cannot be with them. 
Therefore, the only sales representatives left to work in Zone 3 are Kim and Mahr. 
So, the correct answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Understand the conditions given in the problem.
2. Identify the restrictions for each sales representative.
3. Determine the possible zones for each sales representative based on the conditions.
4. Eliminate the zones that cannot be assigned to each sales representative.
5. Identify the sales representatives that can work in Zone 3.
6. Choose the answer that matches your result.
Advice:
- Always read the conditions carefully and understand the restrictions.
- Do not make assumptions that are not supported by the conditions.
- Use logical reasoning to determine the possible placements for each element.
- Double-check your reasoning and final answer.
