Context: For the school paper, five students—Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, Megregian, and O'Neill—each review one or more of exactly three plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation, but do not review any other plays. The following conditions must apply: Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
Question: Which one of the following could be an accurate and complete list of the students who review Tamerlane?
Choices:
  A: Jiang, Kramer
  B: Kramer, O'Neill
  C: Kramer, Lopez, O'Neill

Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I misunderstood the condition that Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. I interpreted it as Megregian cannot review the same play as Kramer and O'Neill, which is incorrect. The condition only implies that Megregian reviews more plays, not necessarily different ones.
Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation
- Condition misunderstanding
- Logical reasoning error
Solution:
From the conditions, Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. So, any option that does not include both Kramer and O'Neill is incorrect, eliminating option [REDACTED]. 
Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Since Jiang is not mentioned as reviewing Tamerlane, this does not eliminate any options. 
Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. This does not mean Megregian cannot review Tamerlane. It only means she reviews more plays. So, options [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] are possible. 
Since exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other, and Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, this means that no other student can review Tamerlane, eliminating option [REDACTED]. 
Therefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Understand the conditions given in the problem.
2. Interpret the conditions correctly and apply them to the options.
3. Eliminate options that do not meet the conditions.
4. Be careful not to misinterpret conditions.
5. Choose the answer that meets all conditions.
Advice:
- Always read the conditions carefully and understand them.
- Break down complex conditions into simpler ones.
- Be careful not to misinterpret conditions.
- Apply conditions to each option and eliminate those that do not meet them.
- Double-check your understanding of the conditions and your application of them to the options.
