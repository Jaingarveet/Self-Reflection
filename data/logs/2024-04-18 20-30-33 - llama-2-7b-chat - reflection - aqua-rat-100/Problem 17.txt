Question: What is the product of the number of letters contained in the name of the city where Iowa State University is located multiplied by the number of letters contained in the name of the state?
Choices:
    A: 16
    B: 20
    C: 24
    D: 32
Thought:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
ISU is located in the state of Iowa.
Action: Answer("D")

Correct Answer: A
## Assistant 1:
Explanation:
I miscalculated the product of the number of letters in the city and state names. 
The gap in my knowledge was not in geography but in basic arithmetic. 
I knew the correct city and state but made a calculation error.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Arithmetic error
 - Multiplication error
Solution:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
Iowa State University is located in the state of Iowa.
The city name "Ames" contains 4 letters.
The state name "Iowa" contains 4 letters.
The product of 4*4 is 16.
Instructions:
1. Identify the city where the university is located.
2. Identify the state where the university is located.
3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.
4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.
5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.
6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.
7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them.

Question: A company produces 420 units of a particular computer component every month, at a production cost to the company of $110 per component, and sells all of the components by the end of each month. What is the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee that the yearly profit (revenue from sales minus production costs) will be at least $626,400 ?
Choices:
  A: 226
  B: 230
  C: 240
  D: 260
  E: 280

  Great, let's solve this problem step by step!

The production cost per component is $110, and the company produces 420 units per month. So, the total production cost per month is:

420 units x $110 per unit = $46,800 per month

The company sells all the components by the end of each month, so the total revenue per month is:

420 units x selling price per unit = $46,800 per month

To guarantee a yearly profit of at least $626,400, we need to find the selling price per component that will result in a yearly revenue of at least:

$626,400 = 12 x $51,300 (since there are 12 months in a year)

Now, we can set up an equation based on the information given:

Revenue per month = Production cost per month

So, we can solve for the selling price per component:

Selling price per component = Revenue per month / Production cost per month

Substituting the values given in the question:

Selling price per component = $46,800 / $110 per unit = 426

So, the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee a yearly profit of at least $626,400 is:

Answer: B - 230

Therefore, the company should sell the components for at least $230 per unit to ensure a yearly profit of at least $626,400.
