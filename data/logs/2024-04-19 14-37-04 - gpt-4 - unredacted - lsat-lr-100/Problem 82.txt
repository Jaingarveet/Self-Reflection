Topic: Law
Context: Patricia: During Japan's Tokugawa period, martial arts experts known as ninjas were trained for the purposes of espionage and assassination. Yet at that time there was actually very little ninja activity in Japan, and most Japanese did not fear ninjas. Tamara: That is not true. Many wealthy Japanese during the Tokugawa period had their houses constructed with intentionally squeaky floors so that they would receive warning if a ninja were in the house.
Question: Of the following, which one, if true, is the strongest counter Patricia can make to Tamara's objection?
Choices:
  A: Many poor Japanese during the Tokugawa period also had houses constructed with intentionally squeaky floors.
  B: As part of their secret training, ninjas learned to walk on squeaky floors without making a sound.
  C: The wealthy made up a small portion of Japan's population during the Tokugawa period.
  D: The fighting prowess of ninjas was exaggerated to mythic proportions in the years following the Tokngawa period.
  E: There were very few ninjas at any time other than during the Tokugawa period.

You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I focused on the skills of the ninjas rather than the proportion of the population that could have been affected by the fear of ninjas. I misunderstood the argument that Patricia needed to counter. Patricia's argument was about the general population's fear, not the effectiveness of the countermeasures against ninjas.
Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation
- Argument analysis
- Population proportion
Solution:
Tamara's argument is that the wealthy Japanese feared ninjas, as evidenced by their construction of squeaky floors to detect them. Patricia can counter this by pointing out that the wealthy made up a small portion of Japan's population during the Tokugawa period. This means that even if the wealthy feared ninjas, most Japanese did not, supporting Patricia's original claim.
Instructions:
1. Understand the original argument made by Patricia.
2. Understand the counter-argument made by Tamara.
3. Identify the point of contention between the two arguments.
4. Evaluate the options based on how effectively they counter Tamara's argument and support Patricia's original claim.
5. Choose the answer that best supports Patricia's argument against Tamara's objection.
Advice:
- Always understand the main argument and the counter-argument.
- Identify the point of contention between the two arguments.
- Evaluate the options based on how effectively they counter the objection and support the original claim.
- Don't get distracted by details that don't directly address the main argument or counter-argument.
- Remember that the best counter-argument directly addresses the point of contention.
