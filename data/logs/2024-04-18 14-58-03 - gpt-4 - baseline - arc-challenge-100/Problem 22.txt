Topic: Science
Question: In a healthy forest, dead trees and limbs fall to the ground and decompose. Which of these statements best describes why decomposition is important to a forest ecosystem?
Choices:
  A: Nutrients are released when wood is broken down.
  B: Worms produce oxygen used by other organisms.

  D: Water is stored in dead trees and limbs.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Decomposition is a process where organic substances are broken down into simpler organic matter. The process is performed by decomposers and leads to the release of nutrients back into the environment, which can be used by other organisms. Therefore, decomposition is important to a forest ecosystem because it allows for the recycling of nutrients.
Action: Answer("A")
