## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The process of a tree growing out of a crack in a boulder is an example of weathering. Weathering is the breaking down or dissolving of rocks and minerals on Earth's surface by natural processes such as water, ice, wind, and plants. In this case, the tree's roots can cause the rock to break apart, which is a form of biological weathering.
