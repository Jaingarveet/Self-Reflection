Question: Red-clay bricks have a density of approximately 2000 kg/m^3. Air has a density of 1 kg/m^3. Which of the following has the lowest mass?
Choices:
  A: 2 m^3 of bricks
  B: 4 m^3 of bricks
  C: 6000 m^3 of air
  D: 10,000 m^3 of air
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The mass of a substance can be calculated by multiplying its volume by its density. 
For each option:
A: 2 m^3 of bricks = 2 * 2000 kg/m^3 = 4000 kg
B: 4 m^3 of bricks = 4 * 2000 kg/m^3 = 8000 kg
C: 6000 m^3 of air = 6000 * 1 kg/m^3 = 6000 kg
D: 10,000 m^3 of air = 10,000 * 1 kg/m^3 = 10,000 kg
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
