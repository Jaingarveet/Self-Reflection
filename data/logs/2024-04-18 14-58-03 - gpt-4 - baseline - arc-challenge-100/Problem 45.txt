Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")

Question: As part of an experiment, an astronaut takes a scale to the Moon and weighs himself. The scale reads 31 pounds. If the astronaut has a mass of about 84 kilograms, which are the approximate weight and mass of the astronaut when standing on the Earth?
Choices:
  A: 31 pounds and 14 kilograms
  B: 31 pounds and 84 kilograms
  C: 186 pounds and 14 kilograms
  D: 186 pounds and 84 kilograms
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The astronaut's mass remains constant regardless of where he is, so his mass on Earth is still 84 kilograms. 
Weight, however, changes depending on the gravitational pull of the body you're standing on. The Moon's gravity is about 1/6th of Earth's, so if the astronaut weighs 31 pounds on the Moon, he would weigh approximately 6 times that on Earth. 
31 pounds * 6 = 186 pounds
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
