## System:
You are an expert in Science.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")

Question: A toy car rolls at a constant speed down a straight inclined track. When the car reaches the flat surface at the base of the inclined track, the speed of the car decreases. Which statement best explains why the speed of the car decreases when it reaches the flat surface?
Choices:
  A: The force of gravity acting on the car increases.
  B: The force of gravity acting on the car decreases.
  C: The forces influencing the car are not balanced.
  D: The forces influencing the car are balanced.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
When the toy car is on the inclined track, the force of gravity is pulling it down the slope, which increases its speed. When the car reaches the flat surface, the force of gravity is still acting on it, but it's no longer pulling it down a slope. Instead, it's pulling it straight down, which doesn't contribute to forward motion. At the same time, the force of friction is acting against the car's motion, slowing it down. Therefore, the forces influencing the car are not balanced.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
