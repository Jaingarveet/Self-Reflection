Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Science
Question: A pharmaceutical company develops a new antibiotic to treat pneumonia. After limited testing, the researchers conclude that the antibiotic seems to be effective. How can the researchers strengthen their conclusions?
Choices:
  A: Test the antibiotic on human volunteers.
  B: Publish their results in a medical journal.
  C: Ask an independent lab to retest the antibiotic.
  D: Test the effectiveness of the antibiotic at killing other bacteria.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
To strengthen their conclusions, the researchers need to conduct more extensive testing. This could involve testing the antibiotic on human volunteers (A), asking an independent lab to retest the antibiotic (C), or testing the antibiotic's effectiveness at killing other bacteria (D). However, the most direct way to confirm the antibiotic's effectiveness against pneumonia would be to test it on human volunteers, as this would provide the most relevant data.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
