Context: A chemistry class has six lab sessions scheduled over three days—Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday—one session heing held each morning and one each afternoon. Each session will be led by a different lab assistant—Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, or Rebecca. The assignment of lab assistants to sessions is constrained as follows: Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day. Nessa must lead an afternoon session. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
Question: If Lan does not lead a Wednesday session, then which one of the following lab assistants must lead a Thursday session?
Choices:
  A: Rebecca
  B: Olivia
  C: Nessa
  D: Kevin
  E: Julio
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
If Lan does not lead a Wednesday session, then Olivia must lead the Wednesday afternoon session (since Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions on the same day).

This means that Kevin and Rebecca must lead the Wednesday morning session, as they have to lead sessions on the same day.

With Wednesday accounted for, and given that Julio's session must meet before Olivia's, Julio must now lead the Thursday morning session.

This leaves Kevin, Rebecca, and Nessa as the remaining lab assistants who could lead a Thursday session.

Nessa must lead an afternoon session, so she is now accounted for on Thursday afternoon.

This means that either Kevin or Rebecca could lead the Thursday morning session, so they must lead sessions on Thursday.
Action: Answer("D")
