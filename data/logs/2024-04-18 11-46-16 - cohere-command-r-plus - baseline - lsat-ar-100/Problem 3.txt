Context: An administrator must assign parking spaces to six new employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young. Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
Question: If Robertson is assigned parking space #3, then which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Souza is assigned parking space #4.
  B: Togowa is assigned parking space #2.
  C: Vaughn is assigned parking space #5.
  D: Xu is assigned parking space #6.
  E: Young is assigned parking space #2.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
If Robertson is assigned parking space #3, then Young must be assigned a higher number, which is at least #4. This means that Robertson and Young take parking spaces #3 and #4, respectively.
Now, Xu must have a higher number than Souza, so Xu could be #5 or #6, with Souza then taking the remaining space.
This leaves Togowa and Vaughn, who can take parking spaces #1 and #2 in either order as they are not subject to any specific conditions.
Therefore, statement B is the correct answer as Togowa could be assigned parking space #2.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: E
Score: 0
