Context: A chemistry class has six lab sessions scheduled over three days—Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday—one session heing held each morning and one each afternoon. Each session will be led by a different lab assistant—Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, or Rebecca. The assignment of lab assistants to sessions is constrained as follows: Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day. Nessa must lead an afternoon session. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
Question: If Julio and Kevin both lead morning sessions, then any of the following could be true EXCEPT:
Choices:
  A: Lan's session meets Wednesday morning.
  B: Lan's session meets Thursday afternoon.
  C: Nessa's session meets Friday afternoon.
  D: Olivia's session meets Thursday morning.
  E: Olivia's session meets Friday morning.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
If Julio and Kevin both lead morning sessions, then Julio's session must meet on Wednesday morning (as it must be earlier in the week than Olivia's, and Kevin and Rebecca must be on the same day). This means that Wednesday afternoon, Thursday morning, and Thursday afternoon are no longer options for Kevin and Rebecca. So, we can deduce the following:

- Wednesday morning: Julio and Kevin
- Wednesday afternoon: Rebecca
- Thursday morning/afternoon: Lan and Olivia (on different days due to constraint)
- Friday morning/afternoon: Nessa (must be in the afternoon) and open for either Lan or Olivia

Therefore, the only option that cannot be true is Lan's session meeting on Wednesday morning, as this spot is taken by Julio and Kevin.
Action: Answer("A")
