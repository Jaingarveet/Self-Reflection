Context: During a recital, two pianists—Wayne and Zara—will perform solos. There will be five solos altogether, performed one immediately after another. Each solo will be either a modern piece or a traditional piece. The choice of pianist and type of piece for the solos must conform to the following conditions: The third solo is a traditional piece. Exactly two of the traditional pieces are performed consecutively. In the fourth solo, either Wayne performs a traditional piece or Zara performs a modern piece. The pianist who performs the second solo does not perform the fifth solo. No traditional piece is performed until Wayne performs at least one modem piece.
Question: Which one of the following could be all of the solos that are traditional pieces?
Choices:
  A: the first, third, and fourth
  B: the second, third, and fourth
  C: the third and fourth
  D: the third and fifth
  E: the fourth and fifth
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The third solo is a traditional piece, and exactly two traditional pieces are performed consecutively. This means that the third and fourth solos are traditional pieces. The other solos could be either modern or traditional, so we cannot determine whether any of the other solos are traditional.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
