Context: The organizer of a reading club will select at least five and at most six works from a group of nine works. The group consists of three French novels, three Russian novels, two French plays, and one Russian play. The organizer's selection of works must conform to the following requirements: No more than four French works are selected. At least three but no more than four novels are selected. At least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected. If both French plays are selected, then the Russian play is not selected.
Question: Which one of the following could be the organizer's selection of works?
Choices:
  A: one French novel, two Russian novels, one French play, one Russian play
  B: two French novels, one Russian novel, two French plays, one Russian play
  C: two French novels, two Russian novels, two French plays
  D: three French novels, one Russian novel, two French plays
  E: three French novels, two Russian novels, one Russian play
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The requirements state that there must be at least three novels, and no more than four French works. This immediately eliminates options B and C, as they do not meet the minimum number of novels.

Option A does not work because it violates the requirement to select at least as many French novels as Russian novels.

Option D is also invalid because it includes too many French works - three French novels and two French plays would be five in total, which exceeds the limit of four.

That leaves us with option E, which meets all the requirements: three French novels and two Russian novels meet the minimum of three novels and the maximum of four French works, and the additional Russian play is permissible as only one French play was selected.
Action: Answer("E")

Agent Answer: E
Correct Answer: C
