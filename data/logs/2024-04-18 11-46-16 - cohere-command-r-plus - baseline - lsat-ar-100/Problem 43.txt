Topic: Law
Context: An editor will edit seven articles, one at a time. Three of the articles—G, H, and J—cover finance; three other articles—Q, R, and S—cover nutrition; and the remaining article, Y, covers wildlife. The order in which the articles are edited is subject to the following conditions: Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other. S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third. S must be earlier than Y. J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
Question: If Y is fourth, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: J is second.
  B: J is third
  C: Q is first.
  D: Q is third
  E: R is seventh.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
If Y is the fourth article edited, then the first three articles must cover finance, nutrition, and finance or nutrition and finance, respectively, due to the condition that consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic. This means that J, G, H, Q, R, or S must be first and second, and S must be third because Q cannot be third if S is earlier in the order. Therefore, if Y is fourth, then S must be third, which corresponds to choice D.
Action: Answer("D")
