Context: Exactly eight books—F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O—are placed on a bookcase with exactly three shelves—the top shelf, the middle shelf, and the bottom shelf. At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.
Question: Which one of the following could be a complete and accurate list of the books placed on the bottom shelf?
Choices:
  A: F, M
  B: F, H, M
  C: G, H, K
  D: F, G, M, O
  E: G, H, L, M
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The prompt states that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, and that I is placed on the middle shelf. This means that the bottom shelf must have at least 3 books. Therefore, choices A and B can be eliminated as they only have 2 books each. 

It is also given that K is placed on a higher shelf than F, and that O is placed on a higher shelf than L. We can deduce that F, L, and K cannot be on the bottom shelf, eliminating choices C and E. 

The only possible answer that satisfies all the conditions is choice D, with F, G, M, and O on the bottom shelf.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
