Topic: Law
Context: A software company employs exactly seven sales representatives—Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall—to work in its three sales zones—Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3. Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Question: If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Kim works in Zone 2.
  B: Mahr works in Zone 2.
  C: Parra works in Zone 3.
  D: Tiao works in Zone 1.
  E: Udall works in Zone 3.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Given that more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, and that there are more in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, we can deduce that Zone 1 has at least 4 sales representatives, Zone 3 has 2 or 3, and Zone 2 has 1 or 2.

We also know the following pairings:
- Parra and Quinn
- Stuckey and Udall

And the following conditions:
- Either Parra or Tiao in Zone 1
- Either Tiao or Udall in Zone 2

Given these conditions, it's possible that:
- Parra, Quinn, and Mahr work in Zone 1
- Tiao and Kim work in Zone 2
- Stuckey and Udall work in Zone 3

This satisfies all the given conditions, and confirms that choice D is a possible scenario.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: E
Score: 0
