Context: During a recital, two pianists—Wayne and Zara—will perform solos. There will be five solos altogether, performed one immediately after another. Each solo will be either a modern piece or a traditional piece. The choice of pianist and type of piece for the solos must conform to the following conditions: The third solo is a traditional piece. Exactly two of the traditional pieces are performed consecutively. In the fourth solo, either Wayne performs a traditional piece or Zara performs a modern piece. The pianist who performs the second solo does not perform the fifth solo. No traditional piece is performed until Wayne performs at least one modem piece.
Question: What is the minimum number of solos in which Wayne performs a traditional piece?
Choices:
  A: zero
  B: one
  C: two
  D: three
  E: four
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Based on the conditions provided, we can deduce the following:
- Wayne must perform at least one modern piece before any traditional pieces are played.
- The third solo is a traditional piece, and there must be two consecutive traditional pieces.
- This means that the second solo must be a modern piece, and the fourth and fifth solos can be either modern or traditional.
- To minimize the number of traditional pieces played by Wayne, we can assume he plays modern pieces in the second and fifth solos.
- This leaves the third, fourth, and one other solo as traditional pieces.
- Of these three traditional pieces, Wayne could play a minimum of one (e.g., the fourth solo) or a maximum of three (the third, fourth, and one other).
Action: Answer("B")
