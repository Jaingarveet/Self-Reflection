Context: A software company employs exactly seven sales representatives—Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall—to work in its three sales zones—Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3. Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Question: Which one of the following could be a complete and accurate list of the sales representatives working in Zone 3?
Choices:
  A: Kim, Mahr
  B: Kim, Tiao
  C: Parra, Quinn
  D: Stuckey, Tiao, Udall
  E: Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Udall
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Given that more sales representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, and that Stuckey and Udall work in the same zone, it follows that Zone 3 must include Stuckey and Udall. From the condition that either Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1, but not both, it is possible that either of them works in Zone 3. Therefore, the list of sales representatives working in Zone 3 could include any of the following combinations: Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall; Stuckey, Parra, and Udall; or Kim, Tiao, and Udall.
Action: Answer("D")

Agent Answer: D
