Context: At a concert, exactly eight compositions—F, H, L, O, P, R, S, and T—are to be performed exactly once each, consecutively and one composition at a time. The order of their performance must satisfy the following conditions: T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R. At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F. O is performed either first or fifth. The eighth composition performed is either L or H. P is performed at some time before S. At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
Question: P CANNOT be performed
Choices:
  A: second
  B: third
  C: fourth
  D: sixth
  E: seventh
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
From the first condition, we know that T must be performed in position 1, 7, or 8, and F must be performed in position 2 or 8.

From the second condition, we know that at least two compositions must be performed in one of the following sequences: positions 3-6 or positions 7-2.

The third condition tells us that O must be performed first or fifth.

The fourth condition tells us that L or H must be performed eighth.

The fifth condition tells us that P must be performed before S.

The sixth condition tells us that at least one composition must be performed in the sequence: positions 2-5 or positions 6-1.

Now, we can deduce that P cannot be performed second as it would violate the fifth condition.
Action: Answer("A")
