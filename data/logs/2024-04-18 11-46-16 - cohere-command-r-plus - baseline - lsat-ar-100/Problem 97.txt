Context: A bakery makes exactly three kinds of cookieâ€”oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar. Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day. The following conditions apply: No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
Question: If the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday, then each of the following could be true EXCEPT:
Choices:
  A: Two different kinds of cookie have their first batch made on Monday.
  B: Two different kinds of cookie have their first batch made on Tuesday.
  C: Two different kinds of cookie have their second batch made on Wednesday.
  D: Two different kinds of cookie have their second batch made on Thursday.
  E: Two different kinds of cookie have their third batch made on Friday.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
If the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday, then oatmeal cookies batches are made on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Sugar cookies batches are made on Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday.
This means that on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday two different kinds of cookies have their first batch made, and on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday two different kinds have their second batch made. Finally, on Friday, two different kinds have their third batch made.
Therefore, the statement that could be false is that two different kinds of cookies have their first batch made on Monday.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
