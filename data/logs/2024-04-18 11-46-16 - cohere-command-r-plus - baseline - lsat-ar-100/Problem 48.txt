Context: On the first day of a two-day study for a cycling magazine, four riders—Reynaldo, Seamus, Theresa, and Yuki—will each test one of four bicycles—F, G, H, and J. Each rider will then test a different one of the bicycles on the second day. Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day. The assignment of riders to bicycles is subject to the following conditions: Reynaldo cannot test F. Yuki cannot test J. Theresa must be one of the testers for H. The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
Question: Any of the following could be true EXCEPT:
Choices:
  A: Reynaldo tests J on the first day.
  B: Reynaldo tests J on the second day.
  C: Seamus tests H on the first day.
  D: Yuki tests H on the first day.
  E: Yuki tests H on the second day.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The conditions state that Reynaldo cannot test F, and Yuki cannot test J.
It also states that Theresa must be one of the testers for H, and the bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second.
This means that on the first day, Yuki tests one of the bicycles F or G, and on the second day, Reynaldo tests either F or J, depending on which bicycle is left over from Yuki's test.
Seamus tests the same bicycle as Yuki on the second day, leaving the remaining untested bicycle for Theresa on that day.
Therefore, it could not be true that Yuki tests H on the first day, as H is tested by Theresa on one of the days, and Seamus tests the same bicycle as Yuki on the second day.
Action: Answer("D")
