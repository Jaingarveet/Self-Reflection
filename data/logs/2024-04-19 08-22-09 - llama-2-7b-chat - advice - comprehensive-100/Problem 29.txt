Reflection:

I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand the mistake now. Let me analyze the problem again:

The organizer of a reading club must select at least five and at most six works from a group of nine works. The group consists of three French novels, three Russian novels, two French plays, and one Russian play. The organizer's selection of works must conform to the following requirements:

* No more than four French works are selected.
* At least three but no more than four novels are selected.
* At least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected.
* If both French plays are selected, then the Russian play is not selected.

Now, let's evaluate each of the given options:

A: No Russian novels and exactly one play are selected.
This option is incorrect because it violates the requirement of selecting at least three novels.

B: Exactly one Russian novel and both French plays are selected.
This option is also incorrect because it violates the requirement of selecting at least as many French novels as Russian novels.

C: Exactly two French novels and the Russian play are selected.
This option is incorrect because it violates the requirement of selecting no more than four French works.

D: Exactly two French novels and exactly two plays are selected.
This option is incorrect because it violates the requirement of selecting at least three novels.

E: Exactly two Russian novels and exactly one play are selected.
This option is incorrect because it violates the requirement of selecting at least as many French novels as Russian novels.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A). The organizer cannot select no Russian novels and exactly one play.
