Topic: Law
Context: Carl is clearly an incompetent detective. He has solved a smaller percentage of the cases assigned to him in the last 3 years—only 1 out of 25—than any other detective on the police force.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument above?
Choices:
  A: Because the police chief regards Carl as the most capable detective, she assigns him only the most difficult cases, ones that others have failed to solve.
  B: Before he became a detective, Carl was a neighborhood police officer and was highly respected by the residents of the neighborhood he patrolled.
  C: Detectives on the police force on which Carl serves are provided with extensive resources, including the use of a large computer database, to help them solve crimes.
  D: Carl was previously a detective in a police department in another city, and in the 4 years he spent there, he solved only 1 out of 30 crimes.
  E: Many of the officers in the police department in which Carl serves were hired or promoted within the last 5 years.

  Topic: Law
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument above?

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and after reflecting on the problem, my solution, and the correct answer, I realize that I made a mistake. The correct answer is (B) Before he became a detective, Carl was a neighborhood police officer and was highly respected by the residents of the neighborhood he patrolled.

Explanation:
The argument above suggests that Carl is an incompetent detective because he has solved a smaller percentage of cases assigned to him than any other detective on the police force. However, if Carl was previously a neighborhood police officer and was highly respected by the residents of the neighborhood he patrolled, it could indicate that he has strong relationships and a good reputation within the community, which could potentially offset his lower solving percentage. Therefore, this information most seriously weakens the argument above.
