You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Question: In planning maintenance for a city's infrastructure, a civil engineer estimates that, starting from the present, the population of the city will decrease by 10 percent every 20 years. If the present population of the city is 50,000, which of the following expressions represents the engineer's estimate of the population of the city $t$ years from now?
Choices:
  A: $50,000(0.1)^{20 t}$
  B: $50,000(0.1)^{\frac{t}{20}}$
  C: $50,000(0.9)^{20 t}$
  D: $50,000(0.9)^{\frac{t}{20}}$

  Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand now that the population growth model can be represented by different formulas, such as linear decay functions or exponential functions, depending on the specific pattern of growth.

To solve this problem, I will use the formula for a linear decay function, which is $P(t) = P_0 \times (1 - 0.1 \times t)$, where $P_0$ is the initial population and $t$ is the time in years.

In this case, the initial population is 50,000, so $P_0 = 50,000$.

The question asks for the population of the city $t$ years from now, so we can substitute $t$ for $t$ in the formula:

$P(t) = 50,000 \times (1 - 0.1 \times t)$

Now, I will simplify the formula by multiplying both sides by $1 - 0.1 \times t$ to get rid of the fraction:

$P(t) = 50,000 - 0.1 \times t \times 50,000$

Finally, I will substitute the value of $t$ that is given in the question: $t = 20$.

$P(20) = 50,000 - 0.1 \times 20 \times 50,000 = 25,000$

Therefore, the engineer's estimate of the population of the city $20$ years from now is $25,000$.
