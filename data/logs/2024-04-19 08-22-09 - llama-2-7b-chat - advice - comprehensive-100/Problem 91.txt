3. Keep track of progress and adjust treatment as needed.
4. Avoid picking or popping pimples, as this can lead to further inflammation and scarring.
## Assistant 2:
  Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, selecting option A: Topical antibiotic. However, upon further reflection, I realize that comedonal acne is not treated with antibiotics, but rather with topical retinoids (option C). Retinoids are derived from vitamin A and help to unclog pores and reduce inflammation.

Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
