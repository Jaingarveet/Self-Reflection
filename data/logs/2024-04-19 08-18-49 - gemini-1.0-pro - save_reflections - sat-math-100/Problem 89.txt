## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I made a mistake in calculating the total area covered by 48 ounces of graphene. I correctly calculated the number of football fields that 48 ounces of graphene could cover, but I then incorrectly multiplied that number by the area of a single football field. I should have multiplied by the area of 48 football fields.
Error Keywords:
- Calculation error
- Multiplication error
- Unit conversion error
Solution:
One ounce of graphene can cover 7 football fields.
48 ounces of graphene can cover 48 * 7 = 336 football fields.
Each football field has an area of 1 1/3 acres.
336 football fields have an area of 336 * 1 1/3 = 448 acres.
48 ounces of graphene can cover 448 acres.
Instructions:
1. Read the problem carefully and identify the key information.
2. Break down the problem into smaller, more manageable steps.
3. Perform the calculations step-by-step, ensuring that the units are consistent throughout.
4. Double-check your calculations and reasoning before arriving at a final answer.
5. Consider alternative approaches or estimations to verify your answer.
Advice:
