Explanation:
I incorrectly calculated the original price of the computer. 
I made a mistake in the order of operations when calculating the final price. 
I should have first calculated the discounted price and then added the sales tax.
Error Keywords:
 - Order of operations error
 - Calculation error
 - Discount and tax calculation error
Solution:
Let x be the original price of the computer.
After a 20% discount, the price becomes 0.8x.
An 8% sales tax is added, resulting in a final price of 1.08(0.8x) = 0.864x.
We are given that the final price is p dollars, so 0.864x = p.
To isolate x, we divide both sides by 0.864: x = p / 0.864.
The original price of the computer is p / 0.864, which can be written as p / (0.8)(1.08).
Instructions:
1. Identify the original price of the computer as x.
2. Calculate the discounted price by multiplying the original price by (1 - discount).
3. Calculate the final price by multiplying the discounted price by (1 + sales tax).
4. Set the final price equal to p dollars.
5. Solve for x by isolating it on one side of the equation.
6. Express the original price in terms of p.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember the order of operations: parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), addition and subtraction (from left to right).
