## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I incorrectly interpreted the conditions for the solution $(0,0)$. 
I focused on the signs of $a$ and $b$ individually instead of considering their relative values.
Error Keywords:
 - Relative value error
 - Inequality interpretation error
 - Solution point interpretation error
Solution:
If $(0,0)$ is a solution, then both inequalities must be satisfied when $x=0$ and $y=0$.
The first inequality becomes $0<-0+a$, which simplifies to $a>0$.
The second inequality becomes $0>0+b$, which simplifies to $b<0$.
Since $a$ is positive and $b$ is negative, $a$ must be greater than $b$.
Instructions:
1. Identify the solution point $(x,y)$.
2. Substitute the solution point into each inequality.
3. Simplify each inequality to determine the conditions on $a$ and $b$.
4. Compare the conditions on $a$ and $b$ to determine their relative values.
5. Choose the answer that reflects the correct relationship between $a$ and $b$.
Advice:
 - Always consider the solution point in the context of the entire problem.
 - Pay attention to the relative values of variables, not just their individual signs.
 - Carefully interpret the conditions imposed by inequalities.
 - Double-check your reasoning and conclusions before selecting an answer.
 - Remember that the solution point must satisfy all inequalities in the system.
