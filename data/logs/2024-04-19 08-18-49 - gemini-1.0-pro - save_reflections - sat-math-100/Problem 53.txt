## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that the line passes through the point $(0,0)$ because it passes through the origin. This assumption is incorrect because the line can pass through any point on the $y$-axis as long as its slope is $\frac{1}{7}$.
Error Keywords:
 - Incorrect assumption
 - Misinterpretation of the problem
 - Failure to consider all possibilities
Solution:
The slope of the line is $\frac{1}{7}$.
This means that for every 1 unit increase in the $x$ coordinate, the $y$ coordinate increases by $\frac{1}{7}$ units.
Starting from the origin $(0,0)$, we can move 14 units to the right to get to the point $(14,0)$.
To get to a point on the line, we need to move $\frac{1}{7}$ units up from $(14,0)$.
Therefore, the point $(14,2)$ lies on the line.
Instructions:
1. Identify the slope of the line.
2. Remember that the slope represents the change in $y$ for every 1 unit change in $x$.
3. Starting from the origin, move the $x$ coordinate by the desired amount.
4. Calculate the corresponding change in $y$ based on the slope.
5. Move the $y$ coordinate by the calculated amount.
6. The resulting point lies on the line.
Advice:
 - Carefully read the problem and identify all given information.
 - Do not make assumptions that are not explicitly stated in the problem.
 - Consider all possible scenarios and eliminate answer choices that do not fit.
 - Use the given information to calculate the unknown values step-by-step.
 - Double-check your calculations and reasoning before choosing an answer.
