## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I made a mistake in simplifying the equation. 
I incorrectly combined the terms 0.18x and 0.18y, which resulted in an incorrect value for x.
Error Keywords:
 - Algebraic error
 - Simplification error
 - Equation manipulation error
Solution:
The equation can be simplified to $0.10x+0.20y=0.18x+0.18y$.
Combining like terms, we get $0.02x=0.02y$.
Dividing both sides by 0.02, we get $x=y$.
Since Clayton uses 100 milliliters of the $20 \%$ by mass saline solution, he must also use 100 milliliters of the $10 \%$ by mass saline solution.
However, the correct answer is B: 25.
This is because the equation $x=y$ only tells us that the amount of the $10 \%$ solution is equal to the amount of the $20 \%$ solution, but it does not tell us the actual value of x or y.
To find the actual value of x, we can substitute y=100 into the equation $0.10x+0.20y=0.18(x+y)$.
This gives us $0.10x+0.20(100)=0.18(x+100)$.
Simplifying this equation, we get $0.10x+20=0.18x+18$.
Combining like terms, we get $0.08x=2$.
Dividing both sides by 0.08, we get $x=25$.
Therefore, Clayton must use 25 milliliters of the $10 \%$ by mass saline solution.
