# Model: mistral-large | Task: save_reflection | Exam: logiqa-en-100 | Problem 84 of 100
## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I focused too much on the direct negation of a property rather than the negation of a condition.

Error Keywords:
 - Focusing on direct negation of property
 - Overlooking negation of condition
 - Misinterpreting argument structure

Solution:
The original argument follows the structure:
All A are B, C is not B, therefore C is not A.
We need to find an argument with a similar structure.

Option A: Kind people will be respected by the villagers, Chenggong who is kind and charitable will be respected by the villagers, so Chenggong is a kind person.
This argument follows the structure: All A are B, C is B, therefore C is A. This is not similar to the original argument.

Option B: Vegetables in Dongdun Market are very cheap. This basket of vegetables is not bought in Dongdun Market. Therefore, this basket of vegetables is not cheap.
This argument follows the structure: All A are B, C is not A, therefore C is not B. This is similar to the original argument but not the most similar.

Option C: Employees of Jiutian Company can speak English, Lin Yingrui is an employee of Jiutian Company, therefore, Lin Yingrui can speak English.
This argument follows the structure: All A are B, C is A, therefore C is B. This is not similar to the original argument.

Option D: Anyone who meets the basic conditions can apply for a small loan. Sun Wen did not apply for a small loan. Therefore, Sun Wen did not meet the basic conditions.
This argument follows the structure: All A are B, C is not B, therefore C is not A. This is the most similar to the original argument.

Instructions:
1. Identify the structure of the original argument.
2. Compare the structure of each option to the original argument.
3. Focus on the negation of conditions rather than the direct negation of properties.
4. Choose the option that most closely matches the structure of the original argument.

Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your answer against the original argument structure.
 - Remember that the negation of a condition is not the same as the direct negation of a property.
