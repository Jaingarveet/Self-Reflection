# Model: mistral-large | Task: save_reflection | Exam: logiqa-en-100 | Problem 96 of 100
## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I misunderstood the argument and the type of evidence needed to strengthen it.
The gap in my knowledge was in understanding the argument's main point and the type of evidence needed to support it.
I chose an answer that weakened the argument instead of strengthening it.
Error Keywords:
 - Misunderstanding the argument
 - Misinterpreting the evidence
 - Choosing an answer that weakens the argument
Solution:
The argument is that advertisers consider ethical responsibilities, not just economic benefits.
The item that strengthens this argument would show that the advertisers' decision to leave "Inferno" was based on ethical concerns, not economic ones.
Choice D suggests that other advertisers turned to "Inferno" despite its violent and pornographic content, which implies that the advertisers who left were motivated by ethical concerns.
Instructions:
1. Identify the argument's main point.
2. Determine the type of evidence needed to support the argument.
3. Evaluate each answer choice to see if it provides the necessary evidence.
4. Choose the answer that best supports the argument.
5. Double-check your answer to ensure that it strengthens the argument, not weakens it.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the argument.
 - Always identify the type of evidence needed to support the argument.
 - Always evaluate each answer choice to see if it provides the necessary evidence.
 - Never choose an answer that weakens the argument.
 - Always double-check your answer to ensure that it strengthens the argument.
