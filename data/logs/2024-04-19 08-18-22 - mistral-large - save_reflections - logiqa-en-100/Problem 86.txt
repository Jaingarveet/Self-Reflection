## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I made an incorrect assumption about the position of Yinling Station.
The gap in my knowledge was not in logic but in my interpretation of the given information.
I misinterpreted the information about the position of Jiushang Station.
Error Keywords:
 - Incorrect assumption
 - Misinterpretation of information
 - Positioning error
Solution:
We know that Fuyi Station is east of Haoyun Station and west of Huyao Station, and is adjacent to Huyao Station.
We also know that Jiushang Station is adjacent to Haoyun Station and east of Haoyun Station.
Since Fuyi is east of Haoyun and west of Huyao, it must be in the middle of the five stations.
Since Jiushang is adjacent to Haoyun and east of Haoyun, it must be to the east of Haoyun.
Since Jiushang is adjacent to Yinling, Yinling must be to the west of Jiushang.
Therefore, Huyao Station must be to the east of Fuyi Station.
Instructions:
1. Identify the position of each station relative to the other stations.
2. Use the given information to determine the order of the stations from west to east.
3. Consider the position of each station relative to its adjacent stations.
4. Use logical reasoning to determine the position of the remaining stations.
5. Double-check your reasoning to ensure accuracy.
6. Choose the answer that matches your conclusion.
