# Model: mistral-large | Task: save_reflection | Exam: logiqa-en-100 | Problem 4 of 100
## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I made an incorrect assumption about the possible positions of M and N.
The gap in my knowledge was not in logic but in my interpretation of the given information.
I knew the correct order of the speakers but made an assumption error.

Error Keywords:
 - Assumption error
 - Interpretation error
 - Logic error

Solution:
If J is the fourth speaker, then J speaks after lunch.
Since G must speak before lunch, G cannot be the third speaker.
Since only one speaker is between M and N, M and N cannot both be in the first three speakers.
Since F speaks in the first or third place, F can be the third speaker.
However, if F is the first speaker, then M must be the second speaker, and N must be the third speaker.
Therefore, if J is the fourth speaker, then N must be the third speaker.

Instructions:
1. Identify the position of the given speaker (J).
2. Identify the speakers who cannot be in the third position based on the given conditions.
3. Identify the possible speakers who can be in the third position based on the given conditions.
4. Consider all possible scenarios for the first three speakers.
5. Eliminate any scenarios that violate the given conditions.
6. Choose the answer that matches the remaining scenario.

Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never make assumptions about the problem without verifying them.
 - Always consider all possible scenarios before making a decision.
 - Always double-check your reasoning and final answer.
 - Remember that logic problems require careful interpretation of the given information.
