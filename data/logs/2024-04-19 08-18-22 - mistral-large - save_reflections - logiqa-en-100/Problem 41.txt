## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I misunderstood the logical implication of the statement.
The gap in my knowledge was in understanding the conditional statement and its contrapositive.
I incorrectly assumed that if Green Island increases productivity by 20%, it will not go bankrupt, but the statement only implies that if Green Island cannot increase productivity by 10%, it will go bankrupt.
Error Keywords:
 - Logical error
 - Conditional statement error
 - Contrapositive error
Solution:
The statement says that if Green Island increases productivity by 10%, it can achieve the goal of increasing productivity by 20%.
The contrapositive of this statement is that if Green Island cannot achieve the goal of increasing productivity by 20%, it cannot increase productivity by 10%.
Since the statement says that Green Island must increase productivity by 10% over the next two years, otherwise it will go bankrupt, it follows that if Green Island cannot achieve its goal of increasing productivity by 20%, it will go bankrupt.
Instructions:
1. Identify the conditional statement in the problem.
2. Identify the contrapositive of the conditional statement.
3. Use the contrapositive to determine the logical implication of the statement.
4. Choose the answer that matches the logical implication of the statement.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always identify the conditional statement in the problem.
 - Always identify the contrapositive of the conditional statement.
 - Always use the contrapositive to determine the logical implication of the statement.
 - Never assume that the converse of the conditional statement is true.
 - Always double-check your answer to ensure that it matches the logical implication of the statement.
