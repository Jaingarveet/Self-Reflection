Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Identify the selling price and profit percentage.
2. Calculate the cost price using the formula: Cost price = Selling price / (100 + profit percentage) * 100
3. Calculate the new selling price.
4. Calculate the profit or loss using the formula: Profit/Loss = New selling price - Cost price
5. Calculate the profit or loss percentage using the formula: Profit/Loss percentage = (Profit/Loss / Cost price) * 100
6. Choose the answer that matches your calculated profit or loss percentage.
## Assistant 2:
Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly because I did not calculate the cost price correctly. I used the formula for calculating the selling price with a profit, but I should have used the formula for calculating the cost price with a profit.
Here is the correct solution:
1. Selling price = Rs 27.50, Profit percentage = 10%
2. Cost price = 27.50 / (100 + 10) * 100 = Rs 25
3. New selling price = Rs 25.75
4. Profit/Loss = 25.75 - 25 = Rs 0.75
5. Profit/Loss percentage = (0.75 / 25) * 100 = 3%
6. The answer is 3% Profit.
Action: Answer("B")
