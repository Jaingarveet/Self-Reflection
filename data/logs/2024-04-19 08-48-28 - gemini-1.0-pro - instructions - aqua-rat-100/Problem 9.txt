## Self-Reflection
**Previous Incorrect Answer:** C: 24
**Reasoning for Incorrect Answer:**
My initial approach involved calculating the profit margin per bag ($25) and dividing the total profit ($3,000) by that margin. However, this approach only considered the profit percentage on the selling price, not the actual cost of the bags.
**Correct Answer:** B: 16
**Reasoning for Correct Answer:**
To arrive at the correct answer, I needed to consider the following:
1. **Cost Price:** Since the profit is a percentage of the selling price, we need to determine the cost price first. We know the selling price is $100 and the profit margin is 25%, so the cost price can be calculated as:
    Cost Price = Selling Price / (1 + Profit Margin)
    Cost Price = $100 / (1 + 0.25)
    Cost Price = $80
2. **Number of Bags Sold:** Now that we know the cost price, we can calculate the number of bags sold by dividing the total profit by the profit per bag:
    Number of Bags = Total Profit / Profit per Bag
    Number of Bags = $3,000 / ($100 - $80)
    Number of Bags = $3,000 / $20
    Number of Bags = 150
Therefore, the grocer sold 150 bags of flour. 
**Key Takeaways:**
* When dealing with percentages, it's crucial to consider the base value on which the percentage is applied.
* In profit calculations, remember to account for both the selling price and the cost price.
* Carefully analyze the problem and identify the key information needed to reach the correct solution.
**Action:** Answer("B")
