## Assistant 2:
Let x be the number of friends who attended the picnic.
The total cost of the picnic was Rs. 96, and each person originally planned to contribute Rs. 96/x.
However, four friends did not turn up, so the remaining x-4 friends had to contribute Rs. 4 extra each, resulting in a total contribution of Rs. 96 + 4(x-4).
Setting these two expressions equal, we get:
96/x = 96 + 4(x-4)
Simplifying the equation:
96 = 96x + 4x^2 - 64x
Rearranging and factoring:
4x^2 - 32x - 96 = 0
2x^2 - 16x - 48 = 0
Dividing by 2:
x^2 - 8x - 24 = 0
Factoring:
(x-12)(x+2) = 0
Therefore, x = 12 or x = -2.
Since the number of friends cannot be negative, the number of friends who attended the picnic was 12.
Action: Answer("B")
