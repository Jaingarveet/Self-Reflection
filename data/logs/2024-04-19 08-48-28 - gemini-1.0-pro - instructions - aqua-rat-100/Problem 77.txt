## Self-Reflection
**Previous Incorrect Answer:**
My previous answer was incorrect because I did not consider the condition that the sum of the 5 numbers should be divisible by 10 to result in a perfect square when divided by 10.
**Corrected Approach:**
1. **Identify the set of 5 consecutive two-digit odd numbers:**
    - Let the first number be x.
    - The next 4 consecutive odd numbers are x + 2, x + 4, x + 6, and x + 8.
2. **Calculate the sum of these numbers:**
    - Sum = x + (x + 2) + (x + 4) + (x + 6) + (x + 8) = 5x + 20.
3. **Divide the sum by 10:**
    - (5x + 20) / 10 = 0.5x + 2.
4. **Check if the result is a perfect square:**
    - For the result to be a perfect square, 0.5x + 2 must be an integer.
    - This means x must be an even number.
5. **Evaluate the options:**
    - A: 47 is odd, so it cannot be the first number.
    - B: 91 is odd, so it cannot be the first number.
    - C: 41 is odd, so it cannot be the first number.
    - D: 67 is odd, so it cannot be the first number.
    - E: 44 is even, so it can be the first number.
6. **Verify the sum and divisibility by 10:**
    - Sum of 5 consecutive odd numbers starting with 44: 44 + 46 + 48 + 50 + 52 = 240.
    - 240 / 10 = 24, which is a perfect square (6^2).
Therefore, the correct answer is E: 44.
**Action: Answer("E")**
