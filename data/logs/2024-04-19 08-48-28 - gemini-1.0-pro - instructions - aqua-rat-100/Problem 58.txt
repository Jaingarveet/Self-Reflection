## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Topic: Math
Question: Two balls A and B rotate along a circular track. Ball A makes 2 full rotations in 26 minutes. Ball B makes 5 full rotation in 35 minutes. If they start rotating now from the same point, when will they be at the same starting point again?
Choices:
  A: 1 hour and 31 minutes
  B: 2 hour and 31 minutes
  C: 3 hour and 31 minutes
  D: 4 hour and 31 minutes
  E: 5 hour and 31 minutes
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Identify the rotation time for each ball.
2. Calculate the LCM of the rotation times for each ball.
3. Multiply the LCM by the number of full rotations for each ball.
4. Add the results from step 3 to get the total time for both balls to be at the same starting point again.
5. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
6. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
## Assistant 2:
## Self-Reflection on Previous Incorrect Answer:
**Mistake:** I incorrectly calculated the LCM (Least Common Multiple) of the rotation times for each ball. This led to an inaccurate answer.
**Corrected Approach:**
1. **Rotation Time:**
    - Ball A: 26 minutes / 2 rotations = 13 minutes per rotation
    - Ball B: 35 minutes / 5 rotations = 7 minutes per rotation
2. **LCM:**
    - LCM of 13 and 7 is 91 minutes.
3. **Total Time:**
    - Ball A: 91 minutes * 2 rotations = 182 minutes
    - Ball B: 91 minutes * 5 rotations = 455 minutes
4. **Combined Time:**
    - 182 minutes + 455 minutes = 637 minutes
5. **Double-Check:**
    - 637 minutes / 13 minutes/rotation (Ball A) = 49 rotations (matches)
    - 637 minutes / 7 minutes/rotation (Ball B) = 91 rotations (matches)
6. **Answer:**
    - 637 minutes = 10 hours and 37 minutes
Therefore, the correct answer is:
**Action: Answer("E")**
## Result:
Agent Answer: E
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
