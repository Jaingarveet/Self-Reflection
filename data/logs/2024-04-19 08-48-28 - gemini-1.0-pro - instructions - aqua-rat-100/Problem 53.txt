## Assistant 2:
Let's assign variables:
* Let x be the amount of money Arjun has.
* Let y be the amount of money Sajal has.
Now, let's write equations based on the given information:
1. If Arun gives $30 to Sajal, Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun:
y + 30 = 2(x - 30)
2. If Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal:
x + 10 = 3(y - 10)
Now, let's simplify the equations:
1. y + 30 = 2x - 60
2. x + 10 = 3y - 30
Let's solve this system of equations using substitution. From equation 1, we can express y as:
y = 2x - 90
Substitute this expression for y in equation 2:
x + 10 = 3(2x - 90) - 30
x + 10 = 6x - 270 - 30
x + 10 = 6x - 300
5x = 290
x = 58
Now that we know x, we can substitute it back into the equation for y:
y = 2(58) - 90
y = 116 - 90
y = 26
Therefore, Arjun has $58 and Sajal has $26.
Checking our solution:
1. If Arun gives $30 to Sajal, Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun:
26 + 30 = 2(58 - 30)
56 = 56 (True)
2. If Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal:
58 + 10 = 3(26 - 10)
68 = 68 (True)
Our solution is correct.
Action: Answer("A")
