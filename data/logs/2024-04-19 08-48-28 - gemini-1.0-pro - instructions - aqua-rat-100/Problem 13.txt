Instructions:
1. Let the unknown number be x.
2. Express the given fractions of x in terms of x.
3. Calculate the difference between the two fractions.
4. Simplify the expression for the difference.
5. Solve the equation for x.
6. Double-check your calculations and final answer.
## Assistant 2:
Let the unknown number be x.
7/8 of x is (7/8)x.
7/18 of x is (7/18)x.
The student's answer differed from the actual one by 770, so we can set up the equation:
(7/8)x - (7/18)x = 770
To solve for x, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions. The least common multiple of 8 and 18 is 72.
Multiplying both sides of the equation by 72, we get:
63x - 28x = 55440
Combining like terms, we get:
35x = 55440
Dividing both sides by 35, we get:
x = 1584
Therefore, the number is 1584.
Action: Answer("A")
