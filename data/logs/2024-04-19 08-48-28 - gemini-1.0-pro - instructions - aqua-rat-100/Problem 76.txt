# Model: gemini-1.0-pro | Agent: instructions | Exam: aqua-rat-100 | Problem 76 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Instructions:
1. When finding the range of an expression, consider all possible values of the variable within the given constraints.
2. Be careful when simplifying expressions, especially when dealing with inequalities.
3. Double-check your calculations and final answer to ensure accuracy.
4. Pay attention to rounding errors and ensure they do not significantly impact the final result.
## Assistant 2:
Self-reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly because I did not consider all possible values of n within the given constraints. I also made a mistake when simplifying the expression.
I have learned from my mistake and will be more careful in the future.
Thought:
We are given that 36 ≤ n ≤ 72. We want to find the range of x = (n2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16) / (n+ 4√n+ 4).
First, we can simplify the expression for x:
x = (n2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16) / (n+ 4√n+ 4)
x = (n + 4√n + 4)(n - 4√n + 4) / (n+ 4√n+ 4)
x = n - 4√n + 4
Now, we can find the range of x by considering all possible values of n within the given constraints.
When n = 36, x = 36 - 4√36 + 4 = 20.
When n = 72, x = 72 - 4√72 + 4 = 58.
Therefore, the range of x is 20 < x < 58.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
