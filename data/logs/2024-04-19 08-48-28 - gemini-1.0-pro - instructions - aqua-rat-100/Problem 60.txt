## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: Points A, B, C, D lie in this order on the circumference of a circle. Minor arc AC is 160°, and minor arc BD is 150°. If B bisects minor arc AC, then what is the measure of minor arc AD?
Choices:
  A: 80°
  B: 130°
  C: 140°
  D: 160°
  E: 220°
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Identify the given information about the circle and its arcs.
2. Determine the measure of minor arc A[REDACTED] based on the fact that [REDACTED] bisects minor arc A[REDACTED].
3. Calculate the measure of minor arc A[REDACTED] by subtracting the measure of minor arc B[REDACTED] from the measure of minor arc A[REDACTED].
4. If the result is negative, add 360° to obtain the positive measure of minor arc A[REDACTED].
5. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
6. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
## Assistant 2:
## Self-reflection on previous incorrect answer:
**Mistake:** I incorrectly assumed that minor arc AC was the entire circumference of the circle, leading to an incorrect calculation of minor arc AD.
**Learning:** I need to pay closer attention to the details of the problem and not make assumptions about missing information.
## Applying the learnings to solve the problem:
1. **Given information:**
    - Points A, B, C, D lie on the circumference of a circle in that order.
    - Minor arc AC is 160°.
    - Minor arc BD is 150°.
    - B bisects minor arc AC.
2. **Minor arc AB:**
    - Since B bisects minor arc AC, minor arc AB is half of 160°, which is 80°.
3. **Minor arc AD:**
    - Minor arc AD can be calculated by subtracting minor arc BD from the sum of minor arcs AB and AC:
    - Minor arc AD = Minor arc AB + Minor arc AC - Minor arc BD
    - Minor arc AD = 80° + 160° - 150°
    - Minor arc AD = 90°
4. **Final answer:**
    - The measure of minor arc AD is 90°.
## Choosing the correct answer:
Action: Answer("A") 
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: B
