Topic: Math
Question: A car is being driven, in a straight line and at a uniform speed, towards the base of a vertical tower. The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower?
Choices:
  A: 5(√3 + 1)
  B: 6(√3 + √2)
  C: 7(√3 – 1)
  D: 8(√3 – 2)
  E: None of these

**Previous Incorrect Answer:** C: 7(√3 – 1)
**Reasoning for Incorrect Answer:**
My initial approach involved calculating the distance traveled by the car during the 10-minute observation period. I used the formula:
```
distance = speed × time
```
However, I made a crucial mistake in assuming that the car's speed was constant throughout the observation period. This assumption was incorrect because the angle of elevation was changing, indicating that the car was getting closer to the tower and therefore its speed was increasing.
**Correct Answer:** B: 6(√3 + √2)
**Reasoning for Correct Answer:**
To address the issue of varying speed, I used the concept of **trigonometry** to relate the angle of elevation, the height of the tower, and the distance traveled by the car. I constructed a right triangle with the tower as the vertical side, the distance traveled by the car as the base, and the line of sight from the car to the top of the tower as the hypotenuse.
Using the tangent function, I obtained the following equation:
```
tan(θ) = height of tower / distance traveled
```
where θ is the angle of elevation.
I then substituted the given values of θ (45° and 60°) and solved for the distance traveled in each case. The difference between these distances gave me the distance remaining to be traveled by the car.
Finally, I used the formula `time = distance / speed` to calculate the remaining time, taking into account the car's increasing speed due to its proximity to the tower.
**Key Learnings:**
* Pay close attention to the details of the problem, especially when dealing with changing variables.
* Utilize appropriate mathematical concepts and formulas to solve the problem accurately.
* Double-check calculations and assumptions to avoid errors.
