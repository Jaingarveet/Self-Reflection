## Self-Reflection:
**Previous Incorrect Answer:**
My previous answer was incorrect because I did not consider the time it took Kevin to travel from B back to A. I only focused on the time he spent traveling from A to B.
**Correct Answer:**
To solve this problem, we need to consider the total time of the trip and the different speeds at which Kevin traveled.
**Step-by-step solution:**
1. **Define variables:**
    - Let x be the distance between A and B.
    - Let t be the total time of the trip.
2. **Set up equations:**
    - The time it takes Kevin to travel from A to B is x/70 hours.
    - The time it takes Kevin to travel from B back to A is x/90 hours.
    - The total time of the trip is t hours.
    - We know that 3 hours before the end of the trip, Kevin was still approaching B, only 70 miles away from it. This means that he had already traveled x - 70 miles from A.
3. **Solve the equations:**
    - We can set up the following equation based on the information above:
    ```
    t = (x - 70)/70 + x/90
    ```
    - We also know that the total time of the trip is 3 hours more than the time it takes Kevin to travel from A to B:
    ```
    t = x/70 + 3
    ```
    - Setting these two equations equal to each other, we get:
    ```
    (x - 70)/70 + x/90 = x/70 + 3
    ```
    - Solving for x, we get:
    ```
    x = 270 miles
    ```
4. **Check the answer:**
    - If Kevin travels from A to B at 70 mph, it takes him 270/70 = 3.86 hours.
    - If he then travels from B back to A at 90 mph, it takes him 270/90 = 3 hours.
    - The total time of the trip is 3.86 + 3 = 6.86 hours.
    - Three hours before the end of the trip, he would have been 3 hours * 70 mph = 210 miles away from A.
    - This is consistent with the information given in the problem.
Therefore, the distance between A and B is 270 miles.
**Action: Answer("C")**
