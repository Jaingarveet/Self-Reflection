* I have learned from this mistake and will be more careful in the future to ensure the accuracy of my responses.
**Answering the question:**
**Question:** Find the total no. of distinct bike no.'s that can be formed using 2 letters followed by 2 no.'s. How many letters need to be distinct?
**Choices:**
* A: 74453
* B: 64543
* C: 74325
* D: 65000
* E: 97656
**Solution:**
1. **Number of letters:** We need to determine the number of distinct letters required for the bike number. Since the question asks for the total number of distinct bike numbers, all two letters must be distinct. Therefore, we need **2 distinct letters**.
2. **Number of numbers:** There are 10 digits available (0-9). We need to choose 2 distinct numbers from these 10 digits. The number of ways to choose 2 distinct numbers from 10 is 10C2 = 45.
3. **Total number of bike numbers:** To calculate the total number of distinct bike numbers, we multiply the number of distinct letter combinations by the number of distinct number combinations. Therefore, the total number of distinct bike numbers is 26 * 25 * 45 = **74325**.
**Answer:**
Action: Answer("C")
