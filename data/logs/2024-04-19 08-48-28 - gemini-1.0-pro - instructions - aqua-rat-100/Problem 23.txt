## Self-Reflection
**Previous Incorrect Answer:**
My previous answer was incorrect because I used the wrong formula to calculate the cost price. I used the formula for calculating the selling price, which resulted in an incorrect answer.
**Corrected Approach:**
1. **Selling Price:** The selling price of the article is given as Rs. 360.
2. **Profit Percentage:** The profit percentage is given as 20%.
3. **Decimal Conversion:** Converting the profit percentage into a decimal, we get 0.20.
4. **Cost Price Formula:** The correct formula for calculating the cost price is:
```
Cost Price = Selling Price / (1 + Profit Percentage)
```
5. **Calculation:** Plugging in the values, we get:
```
Cost Price = 360 / (1 + 0.20) = 360 / 1.20 = 300
```
6. **Double-Checking:** 300 + 20% of 300 = 300 + 60 = 360. This confirms that the cost price is Rs. 300.
7. **Answer:** Therefore, the correct answer is **B: 300**.
