## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Identify the total distance traveled by adding the distances traveled in each activity.
2. Identify the total time taken for both activities.
3. Divide the total distance traveled by the total time taken to calculate the average speed.
4. Express the average speed in miles per hour.
## Assistant 2:
Self-reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly because I did not consider the total time taken for both activities. I only focused on the time taken for each individual activity.
To answer this question correctly, I need to:
1. Identify the total distance traveled by adding the distances traveled in each activity.
2. Identify the total time taken for both activities.
3. Divide the total distance traveled by the total time taken to calculate the average speed.
4. Express the average speed in miles per hour.
Following these steps, I can calculate the average speed as follows:
Total distance traveled = M + N miles
Total time taken = 4 hours
Average speed = (M + N miles) / 4 hours = M + N / 4 miles per hour
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
