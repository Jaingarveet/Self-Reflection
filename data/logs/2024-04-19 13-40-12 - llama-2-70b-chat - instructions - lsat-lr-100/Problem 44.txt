Context: Most people who shop for groceries no more than three times a month buy prepared frozen dinners regularly. In Hallstown most people shop for groceries no more than three times a month. Therefore, in Hallstown most people buy prepared frozen dinners regularly.
Question: Which one of the following arguments has a flawed pattern of reasoning most like the flawed reasoning in the argument above?
Choices:
  A: It is clear that most drivers in West Ansland are safe drivers since there are very few driving accidents in West Ansland and most accidents there are not serious.
  B: It is clear that John cannot drive, since he does not own a car and no one in his family who does not own a car can drive.
  C: It is clear that Fernando's friends usually drive to school, since all of his friends can drive and all of his friends go to school.
  D: It is clear that most people in Highland County drive sedans, since most people who commute to work drive sedans and most people in Highland County commute to work.

## Assistant 2:
  Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my revised answer:

The argument "In Hallstown most people buy prepared frozen dinners regularly" has a flawed pattern of reasoning because it makes an unwarranted assumption about the relationship between grocery shopping frequency and frozen dinner purchasing habits. Just because most people in Hallstown shop for groceries no more than three times a month, it does not follow that they necessarily buy prepared frozen dinners regularly. There could be other factors at play that influence their food purchasing decisions.

The argument that has a flawed pattern of reasoning most similar to the argument above is:

B: It is clear that John cannot drive, since he does not own a car and no one in his family who does not own a car can drive.

This argument makes an unwarranted assumption about the relationship between car ownership and driving ability. Just because John does not own a car, it does not follow that he cannot drive. There could be other factors at play that influence his ability to drive, such as his age, physical ability, or experience.

Therefore, the answer is B.
