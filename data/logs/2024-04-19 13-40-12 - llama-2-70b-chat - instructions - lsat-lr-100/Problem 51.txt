7. Use the above steps to determine the best answer choice.

My previous answer was option A.
However, upon reflection, I realize that my answer was incorrect.
The argument does not assume that there are no other causes of decreasing voter turnout.
Instead, it focuses on one specific cause: the belief that politicians cannot solve important problems.
Therefore, option A is not the best answer.

The correct answer is option D.
The argument suggests that people are dissatisfied with politicians, which undermines its claim that people no longer believe there are political solutions to important problems.
If people are dissatisfied with politicians, it could be because they believe that politicians are not effectively addressing important problems.
This implies that people still believe that political solutions are possible, but politicians are not delivering.
Therefore, option D is the best answer.

Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
