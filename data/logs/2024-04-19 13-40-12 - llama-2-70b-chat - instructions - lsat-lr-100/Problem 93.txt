4. Evaluate the assumptions made in the passage.
5. Choose the answer that logically follows from the information provided.

My previous answer was incorrect because I failed to consider the context of the passage. I mistakenly chose option A, assuming that everyone suspects self-righteous people of being unethical. However, the passage only suggests that Ellsworth is self-righteous and easily offended, not that everyone suspects him of being unethical.

Upon further reflection, I realize that the correct answer is option E: Everyone expects self-righteous people to be easily offended. The passage states that Ellsworth is self-righteous and easily offended, which suggests that people who know him expect him to be easily offended. Therefore, option E logically follows from the information provided in the passage.

Action: Answer("E")
## Result:
Agent Answer: E
Correct Answer: E
Score: 1
