Answer:
The conclusion of the argument is that publishing a scholarly journal must be much more profitable now than it was several years ago.
The premises are:
* The average subscription rate a library pays for a scholarly journal has increased dramatically over the last several years.
* The costs of publishing a scholarly journal have remained fairly constant.

The weakening factor that challenges the conclusion is choice D: Most subscribers to scholarly journals are individuals, not libraries, and the subscription rates for individuals have generally remained unchanged for the past several years.

This weakening factor affects the argument by suggesting that the increase in subscription rates paid by libraries may not necessarily translate to an increase in profit for the publishers of scholarly journals. If the majority of subscribers are individuals and their subscription rates have remained unchanged, then the increased revenue from library subscriptions may simply be offset by the lack of increase in revenue from individual subscribers. This means that publishing a scholarly journal may not necessarily be more profitable now than it was several years ago.

Therefore, the weakening factor seriously weakens the argument by casting doubt on the conclusion that publishing a scholarly journal must be much more profitable now than it was several years ago. The argument relies on the assumption that the increase in library subscription rates translates to an increase in profit for publishers, but this assumption is challenged by the fact that individual subscription rates have remained unchanged.
