Topic: Law
Context: In 1963, a young macaque monkey was observed venturing into a hot spring to retrieve food which had fallen in. Soon, other macaques began to enter the spring, and over a few years this behavior was adopted by the entire troop. Prior to 1963, no macaques had ever been observed in the hot spring; by 1990, the troop was regularly spending time there during the winters. Thus, these macaques are able to adopt and pass on new patterns of social behavior, and are not complete captives of their genetic heritage.
Question: Which one of the following is an assumption required by the argument above?
Choices:
  A: Mutations in the genetic heritage of a certain variety of macaques can occur over a time span as short as a few years or decades.
  B: New patterns of behavior that emerge in macaque populations over the course of a few years or decades are not necessarily genetically predetermined.
  C: Only when behaviors become typical among an animal population can we conclude that a genetic alteration has occurred in that variety or species.
  D: The social behaviors of macaques are completely independent of their genetic heritage.
  E: The macaques' new pattern of behavior will persist over several generations.

## Assistant 2:
  My apologize for my previous response. After reflecting on the question, I realize that my answer was incorrect. The correct answer is (B) New patterns of behavior that emerge in macaque populations over the course of a few years or decades are not necessarily genetically predetermined.

The argument states that the macaques' behavior of entering the hot spring was adopted and passed on to other members of the troop, and by 1990, the troop was regularly spending time there during the winters. This suggests that the behavior was not genetically predetermined, but rather learned and passed on through social interaction. Therefore, option (B) is the best answer.

Option (A) Mutations in the genetic heritage of a certain variety of macaques can occur over a time span as short as a few years or decades is not relevant to the argument. The argument does not mention anything about mutations or changes in the genetic heritage of the macaques.

Option (C) Only when behaviors become typical among an animal population can we conclude that a genetic alteration has occurred in that variety or species is also not relevant to the argument. The argument does not mention anything about genetic alterations or changes in the species.

Option (D) The social behaviors of macaques are completely independent of their genetic heritage is incorrect. The argument suggests that the macaques' behavior was not genetically predetermined, but rather learned and passed on through social interaction. This implies that the macaques' social behaviors are not completely independent of their genetic heritage.

Option (E) The macaques' new pattern of behavior will persist over several generations is not stated in the argument. The argument only mentions that the troop was regularly spending time in the hot spring by 1990, but it does not provide information about the long-term persistence of the behavior.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) New patterns of behavior that emerge in macaque populations over the course of a few years or decades are not necessarily genetically predetermined.
