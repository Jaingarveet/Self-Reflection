Context: Peter: Unlike in the past, most children's stories nowadays don't have clearly immoral characters in them. They should, though. Children need to learn the consequences of being bad. Yoko: Children's stories still tend to have clearly immoral characters in them, but now these characters tend not to be the sort that frighten children. Surely that's an improvement.

## Assistant 2:
  Sure, here's my revised answer:

Action: Answer("B")

Reflection:
Previously, I incorrectly answered this question as choice "E".
Upon reflection, I realized that the question asks about Peter and Yoko's disagreement regarding children's stories, specifically whether they tend to be less frightening nowadays.
Peter believes that children's stories should have clearly immoral characters to teach children the consequences of being bad, while Yoko thinks that today's children's stories still have immoral characters, but they are not as frightening as they used to be.
Therefore, the correct answer is choice "B", which aligns with Yoko's view that today's children's stories tend to be less frightening than earlier ones.

Plugging my revised answer back into the original question, I can see that choice "B" makes sense: Peter and Yoko disagree over whether today's children's stories tend to be less frightening than earlier children's stories were.
I'm confident that my revised answer is correct.
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
