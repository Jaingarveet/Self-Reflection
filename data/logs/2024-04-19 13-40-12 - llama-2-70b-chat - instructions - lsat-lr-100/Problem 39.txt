## User 2:
Topic: Law
Context: Rossi: It is undemocratic for people to live under a government in which their interests are not represented. So children should have the right to vote, since sometimes the interests of children are different from those of their parents. Smith: Granted, children's interests are not always the same as their parents'; governmental deficits incurred by their parents' generation will later affect their own generation's standard of living. But even if children are told about the issues affecting them, which is not generally the case, their conceptions of what can or should be done are too simple, and their time horizons are radically different from those of adults, so we cannot give them the responsibility of voting.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes Rossi's argument?
Choices:
  A: It makes an appeal to a general principle.
  B: It denies the good faith of an opponent.
  C: It relies on evaluating the predictable consequences of a proposal.
  D: It substitutes description for giving a rationale for a policy.
  E: It employs a term on two different occasions in different senses.

Answer: A

Rossi's argument appeals to the general principle of democracy, which holds that all people should have an equal say in the government that represents their interests. Rossi argues that children are not adequately represented by their parents and should, therefore, have the right to vote. This argument relies on the idea that children have unique interests that may not align with those of their parents and that they should have a say in the government that affects their lives.

Rossi's argument does not deny Smith's good faith (choice B), nor does it rely solely on evaluating the predictable consequences of a proposal (choice C). While Rossi does mention the impact of governmental deficits on future generations, this is not the primary focus of his argument. Instead, his argument is based on the principle of democracy and the idea that all people should have an equal say in their government.

Nor does Rossi's argument substitute description for giving a rationale for a policy (choice D). Instead, he provides a clear rationale for why children should have the right to vote, based on their unique interests and the undemocratic nature of being governed without representation.

Finally, Rossi's argument does not employ a term on two different occasions in different senses (choice E).

Therefore, the best answer is A: Rossi's argument makes an appeal to a general principle.
