  B: In general, persons under the age of 65 are less likely to be victims of violent crimes than persons over the age of 65.
  C: As a result of the town's community outreach programs, more people than ever are willing to report violent crimes to the proper authorities.

## Assistant 2:
  Sure, I'll do my best to answer the question based on the information provided.

The correct answer is E: Community officials have shown that a relatively small number of repeat offenders commit the majority of violent crimes in the town.

My reasoning is as follows:

The argument is that the increase in calls involving violent crimes means that the average citizen is more likely to become a victim of a violent crime. However, if a small number of repeat offenders are responsible for the majority of violent crimes, then the increase in calls may not necessarily indicate an increase in the overall risk of violent crime for the average citizen. It could simply mean that the same group of repeat offenders is responsible for a larger proportion of the violent crimes being reported.

Therefore, option E weakens the argument by suggesting that the increase in calls may not necessarily reflect an increase in the risk of violent crime for the average citizen.

I hope that's correct! Let me know if you have any further questions or concerns.
