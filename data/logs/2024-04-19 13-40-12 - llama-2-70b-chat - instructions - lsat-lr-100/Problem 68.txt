Topic: Law
Context: City dog licensing records show that more cocker spaniels are registered to addresses in the Flynn Heights neighborhood than to addresses in all other neighborhoods combined. So if an animal control officer finds a stray cocker spaniel anywhere near Flynn Heights, it is likely that the dog belongs to someone in Flynn Heights.
Question: Which one of the following would be most useful to know in order to evaluate the argument?
Choices:
  A: whether cocker spaniels are more likely than dogs of other breeds to stray from their owners
  B: whether there are more cocker spaniels registered to addresses in Flynn Heights than any other breed of dog
  C: whether the city's animal control officers find more stray dogs in and around Flynn Heights than in any other part of the city
  D: whether the number of pets owned, per capita, is greater for residents of Flynn Heights than for residents of any other neighborhood
  E: whether residents of Flynn Heights are more likely to license their dogs than residents of other neighborhoods are

## Assistant 2:
  Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my revised answer:

Action: Answer("B")

Reflection:
Previously, I incorrectly answered this question as "C." However, upon reflection, I realized that the number of stray dogs found in Flynn Heights is not relevant to the argument. What's important is the proportion of cocker spaniels registered to addresses in Flynn Heights compared to other breeds. Choice B provides this information, indicating that there are more cocker spaniels registered to addresses in Flynn Heights than any other breed of dog. This supports the argument that if an animal control officer finds a stray cocker spaniel near Flynn Heights, it is likely that the dog belongs to someone in Flynn Heights. Therefore, Choice B is the best answer.
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: E
