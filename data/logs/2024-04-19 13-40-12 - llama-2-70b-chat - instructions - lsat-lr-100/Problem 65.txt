Context: The size of northern fur seals provides a reliable indication of their population levelsâ€”the smaller the average body size of seals in a population, the larger the population. Archaeologists studied seal fossils covering an 800-year period when the seals were hunted for food by Native peoples in North America and found that the average body size of the seals did not vary significantly.
Question: The statements above, if true, provide the most support for which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: During the 800-year period studied, seal hunting practices did not vary substantially between different groups of Native peoples in North America.
  B: The body size of northern fur seals is not strongly correlated with the overall health of the seals.
  C: Before the 800-year period studied, the average body size of northern fur seals fluctuated dramatically.
  D: Native peoples in North America made an effort to limit their hunting of northern fur seals in order to prevent depletion of seal populations.
  E: Hunting by Native peoples in North America did not significantly reduce the northern fur seal population over the 800-year period studied.

## Assistant 2:
  Action: Answer("E")

The passage states that the average body size of northern fur seals did not vary significantly over an 800-year period, despite being hunted for food by Native peoples in North America. This suggests that the hunting practices did not have a significant impact on the population size of the seals, and therefore, answer choice E is the best answer.

The passage does not provide information to support answer choice A, which states that seal hunting practices did not vary substantially between different groups of Native peoples in North America. The passage only mentions that the average body size of the seals did not vary significantly, and it does not address whether the hunting practices varied between different groups.

Answer choice B is also not supported by the passage, as it states that the body size of northern fur seals is not strongly correlated with the overall health of the seals. The passage only mentions that the average body size of the seals did not vary significantly, and it does not address the correlation between body size and health.

Answer choice C is not supported by the passage, as it states that before the 800-year period studied, the average body size of northern fur seals fluctuated dramatically. The passage only mentions that the average body size did not vary significantly over the 800-year period, and it does not address any fluctuations that may have occurred before that period.

Answer choice D is also not supported by the passage, as it states that Native peoples in North America made an effort to limit their hunting of northern fur seals in order to prevent depletion of seal populations. The passage does not mention any efforts made by Native peoples to limit their hunting, and it only states that the average body size of the seals did not vary significantly over the 800-year period.

Therefore, the best answer choice is E, which states that hunting by Native peoples in North America did not significantly reduce the northern fur seal population over the 800-year period studied. This answer choice is supported by the information in the passage, which states that the average body size of the seals did not vary significantly over the 800-year period despite being hunted for food.
