You are an expert in Law.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")

Context: Game show winners choosing between two equally desirable prizes will choose either the one that is more expensive or the one with which they are more familiar. Today's winner, Ed, is choosing between two equally desirable and equally unfamiliar prizes, A and B. He will thus choose A, which is more expensive.
Question: The reasoning in which one of the following is most similar to the reasoning above?
Choices:
  A: With a book contract, an academic writer receives either an advance or a guarantee of royalties. Professor al-Sofi received an advance for a book contract, so al-Sofi did not receive a guarantee of royalties.
  B: When entering this amusement park, children always choose to take their first ride on either the Rocket or the Mouse. Janine insisted on the Rocket for her first ride. Thus, Janine would not have been standing near the Mouse during her first half hour in the amusement park.
  C: The elliptical orbit of an asteroid is only slightly eccentric unless it is affected by the gravitational pull of a planet. Asteroid Y is affected by Jupiter's gravitational pull and asteroid X is not. Thus, the orbit of asteroid Y is the more eccentric of the two.
  D: New students in this program must choose either a physics class or an art class. Miyoko has no desire to take a class in either of those fields, so Miyoko will probably not enter this program.
  E: To avoid predators, rabbits will either double back on their pursuers or flee for nearby cover. The rabbit being pursued by a fox in this wildlife film is in a field that offers no opportunity for nearby cover, so it will try to double back on the fox.

## Assistant 2:
  My previous answer was incorrect, and I realize that I made a mistake in my reasoning. The correct answer is choice B: When entering this amusement park, children always choose to take their first ride on either the Rocket or the Mouse. Janine insisted on the Rocket for her first ride. Thus, Janine would not have been standing near the Mouse during her first half hour in the amusement park.

The reasoning in this question is similar to the original scenario in that it presents a choice between two equally desirable and equally unfamiliar options. In this case, the children entering the amusement park have to choose between two rides, the Rocket and the Mouse. Janine chose the Rocket, and therefore, it can be inferred that she did not choose the Mouse. This line of reasoning is similar to the original scenario where Ed chose the more expensive option, A, as he was not familiar with both options.

In choice A, Professor al-Sofi received an advance for a book contract, and it cannot be inferred that they did not receive a guarantee of royalties. The information provided does not allow us to make a definitive statement about the Professor's receipt of royalties.

In choice C, the gravitational pull of a planet affects the elliptical orbit of an asteroid, making it more eccentric. This information does not relate to the reasoning of choosing between two equally desirable and unfamiliar options.

In choice D, Miyoko does not desire to take a class in physics or art, but it cannot be inferred that she will probably not enter the program. There may be other options available in the program that Miyoko is interested in.

In choice E, the rabbit being pursued by a fox will try to double back on the fox as there is no nearby cover available. This information does not relate to the reasoning of choosing between two equally desirable and unfamiliar options.

Therefore, the answer is choice B, as it most closely resembles the reasoning in the original scenario.
