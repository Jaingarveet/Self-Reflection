## User 2:
Topic: Law
Context: To accommodate the personal automobile, houses are built on widely scattered lots far from places of work and shopping malls are equipped with immense parking lots that leave little room for wooded areas. Hence, had people generally not used personal automobiles, the result would have to have been a geography of modern cities quite different from the one we have now.
Question: The argument's reasoning is questionable because the argument
Choices:
  A: infers from the idea that the current geography of modern cities resulted from a particular cause that it could only have resulted from that cause
  B: infers from the idea that the current geography of modern cities resulted from a particular cause that other facets of modern life resulted from that cause
  C: overlooks the fact that many technological innovations other than the personal automobile have had some effect on the way people live
  D: takes for granted that shopping malls do not need large parking lots even given the use of the personal automobile
  E: takes for granted that people ultimately want to live without personal automobiles

Answer: C

Explanation:
The argument's reasoning is questionable because it overlooks the fact that many technological innovations other than the personal automobile have had some effect on the way people live. The argument assumes that the personal automobile is the sole cause of the observed effect, which is the widespread use of large parking lots and scattered residential areas. However, other technological innovations, such as public transportation, bicycles, or even delivery services, could have also contributed to the observed effect. Therefore, the argument's reasoning is flawed, and the conclusion that the personal automobile is the sole cause of the observed effect is not well-supported.

Alternative causes that may have contributed to the observed effect include:

* Public transportation: The availability and accessibility of public transportation could have influenced the way people live and work, potentially reducing the need for personal automobiles.
* Bicycles: The use of bicycles as a mode of transportation could have also influenced the way people live and work, potentially reducing the need for personal automobiles.
* Delivery services: The availability of delivery services, such as food delivery or package delivery, could have reduced the need for personal automobiles, as people may not need to travel as much for daily errands.

The evidence provided to support the main cause-and-effect relationship is weak, as it does not consider alternative causes that may have contributed to the observed effect. To revise the argument, the author could consider alternative causes and evaluate their impact on the observed effect. Additionally, the author could provide more evidence to support the main cause-and-effect relationship, such as statistical data or expert opinions.

In conclusion, the argument's reasoning is questionable because it overlooks alternative causes that may have contributed to the observed effect. To strengthen the argument, the author should consider alternative causes and provide more evidence to support the main cause-and-effect relationship.
