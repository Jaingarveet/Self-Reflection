Context: Ethicist: Marital vows often contain the promise to love "until death do us part." If "love" here refers to a feeling, then this promise makes no sense, for feelings are not within one's control, and a promise to do something not within one's control makes no sense. Thus, no one—including those making marital vows—should take "love" in this context to be referring to feelings.
Question: The ethicist's conclusion follows logically if which one of the following is assumed?
Choices:
  A: None of our feelings are within our control.
  B: People should not make promises to do something that is not within their control.
  C: "Love" can legitimately be taken to refer to something other than feelings.
  D: Promises should not be interpreted in such a way that they make no sense.
  E: Promises that cannot be kept do not make any sense.

## Assistant 2:
  My previous answer was incorrect because I misunderstood the question. I thought the correct answer was choice A, "None of our feelings are within our control," because I believed that the argument was based on the premise that feelings are not within our control. However, upon reflection, I realized that the argument is not based on that premise. Instead, the argument is based on the idea that a promise to do something not within one's control makes no sense. Therefore, the correct answer is choice B, "People should not make promises to do something that is not within their control."

Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: D
