Context: Native speakers perceive sentences of their own language as sequences of separate words. But this perception is an illusion. This is shown by the fact that travelers who do not know a local language hear an unintelligible, uninterrupted stream of sound, not sentences with distinct words.
Question: Which one of the following is an assumption on which the argument depends?
Choices:
  A: It is impossible to understand sentences if they are in fact uninterrupted streams of sound.
  B: Those who do not know a language cannot hear the way speech in that language actually sounds.
  C: People pay less close attention to the way their own language sounds than they do to the way an unfamiliar language sounds.
  D: Accomplished non-native speakers of a language do not perceive sentences as streams of sound.
  E: Native speakers' perceptions of their own language are not more accurate than are the perceptions of persons who do not know that language.

  Topic: Law
Context: Native speakers perceive sentences of their own language as sequences of separate words. But this perception is an illusion. This is shown by the fact that travelers who do not know a local language hear an unintelligible, uninterrupted stream of sound, not sentences with distinct words.
Question: Which one of the following is an assumption on which the argument depends?
Choices:
  A: It is impossible to understand sentences if they are in fact uninterrupted streams of sound.
  B: Those who do not know a language cannot hear the way speech in that language actually sounds.
  C: People pay less close attention to the way their own language sounds than they do to the way an unfamiliar language sounds.
  D: Accomplished non-native speakers of a language do not perceive sentences as streams of sound.
  E: Native speakers' perceptions of their own language are not more accurate than are the perceptions of persons who do not know that language.
Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly.
After reflecting on the problem, my solution, and the correct answer, I realized that I misunderstood the argument's assumption.
The argument assumes that the way native speakers perceive their language is not more accurate than the way non-native speakers perceive it.
I incorrectly assumed that the argument assumed that non-native speakers cannot understand the language they are hearing.
I now understand that the argument's assumption is necessary for the conclusion, and alternative assumptions would not support the conclusion.

1. Identify the argument's conclusion:
The conclusion of the argument is that native speakers' perception of their language as a sequence of separate words is an illusion.

2. Identify the premise that supports the conclusion:
The premise that supports the conclusion is that travelers who do not know a local language hear an unintelligible, uninterrupted stream of sound, not sentences with distinct words.

3. Identify the assumption that is made in the argument:
The assumption made in the argument is that native speakers' perceptions of their own language are not more accurate than are the perceptions of persons who do not know that language.

4. Evaluate the assumption's validity:
The assumption is valid because it is reasonable to assume that native speakers' perceptions of their language may be influenced by their familiarity with it, and that non-native speakers may have a different perception of the language.

5. Determine if the assumption is necessary for the argument's conclusion:
Yes, the assumption is necessary for the argument's conclusion. Without the assumption, it would be impossible to draw the conclusion that native speakers' perception of their language as a sequence of separate words is an illusion.

6. If the assumption is not necessary, consider alternative assumptions that could support the conclusion:
Alternative assumptions that could support the conclusion could be:

* Non-native speakers have a more accurate perception of the language than native speakers.
* The way native speakers perceive their language is influenced by their cultural background.
* The way native speakers perceive their language is influenced by their language learning experience.

7. Evaluate the strength of the argument with the alternative assumptions:
The argument would be stronger with the alternative assumption that non-native speakers have a more accurate perception of the language than native speakers. This assumption would provide a clearer explanation for why travelers who do not know a local language hear an unintelligible, uninterrupted stream of sound.
