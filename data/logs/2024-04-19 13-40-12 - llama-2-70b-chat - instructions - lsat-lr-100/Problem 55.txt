Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Law
Context: Ethicist: Only when we know a lot about the events that led to an action are we justified in praising or blaming a person for that actionâ€”as we sometimes are. We must therefore reject Tolstoy's rash claim that if we knew a lot about the events leading up to any action, we would cease to regard that action as freely performed.
Question: Which one of the following, if assumed, enables the conclusion of the ethicist's argument to be properly drawn?
Choices:
  A: People should not be regarded as subject to praise or blame for actions that were caused by conditions beyond their control.
  B: Whether an act is one for which the person doing it is genuinely responsible is not determined by how much information others possess about that act.
  C: We can be justified in praising or blaming a person for an action only when we regard that action as freely performed.
  D: The responsibility a person bears for an action is not a matter of degree; however, our inclination to blame or praise whoever performed the action varies with the amount of information available.
  E: If we do not know much about the events leading up to any given action, we will regard that action as freely performed.

## Assistant 2:
  My apologize for my previous response. After reflecting on the problem, I realized that my answer was incorrect. The correct answer is option C: We can be justified in praising or blaming a person for an action only when we regard that action as freely performed.

The ethicist's argument relies on the idea that we can only justifiably praise or blame someone for an action if we believe that the action was freely performed. If we know a lot about the events leading up to the action, we may be able to determine that the person was not responsible for the action, and therefore should not be praised or blamed. However, if we do not know much about the events leading up to the action, we may still regard the action as freely performed and therefore be justified in praising or blaming the person.

Therefore, option C is the best answer. It directly supports the ethicist's argument that we can only justifiably praise or blame someone for an action if we regard that action as freely performed.

I hope this answer is correct. Please let me know if there is any further information that I can provide to support my response.
