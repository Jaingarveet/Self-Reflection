Context: Patricia: During Japan's Tokugawa period, martial arts experts known as ninjas were trained for the purposes of espionage and assassination. Yet at that time there was actually very little ninja activity in Japan, and most Japanese did not fear ninjas. Tamara: That is not true. Many wealthy Japanese during the Tokugawa period had their houses constructed with intentionally squeaky floors so that they would receive warning if a ninja were in the house.
Question: Of the following, which one, if true, is the strongest counter Patricia can make to Tamara's objection?
Choices:
  A: Many poor Japanese during the Tokugawa period also had houses constructed with intentionally squeaky floors.
  B: As part of their secret training, ninjas learned to walk on squeaky floors without making a sound.
  C: The wealthy made up a small portion of Japan's population during the Tokugawa period.
  D: The fighting prowess of ninjas was exaggerated to mythic proportions in the years following the Tokngawa period.
  E: There were very few ninjas at any time other than during the Tokugawa period.

Action: Answer("C")

My reasoning for choosing option C is that it directly addresses Tamara's objection that wealthy Japanese had squeaky floors to detect ninjas. If the wealthy made up a small portion of Japan's population during the Tokugawa period, then it's unlikely that the prevalence of squeaky floors was primarily due to fear of ninjas. This weakens Tamara's argument and supports Patricia's initial statement that there was little ninja activity in Japan during that time.

I hope this answer is correct. Please let me know if I need to revise it.
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
