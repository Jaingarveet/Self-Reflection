Topic: Law
Context: Counselor: Many people assume that personal conflicts are inevitable, but that assumption is just not so. Personal conflicts arise primarily because people are being irrational. For instance, people often find it easier to ascribe bad qualities to a person than good ones-even when there is more evidence of the latter. If someone suspects that a friend is unreliable, for example, a single instance may turn this suspicion into a feeling of certainty, whereas a belief that someone is reliable is normally built up only after many years of personal interaction.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main conclusion drawn in the argument?
Choices:
  A: Many people assume that personal conflicts are inevitable.
  B: Even when there is more evidence of good qualities than of bad ones, people find it easier to ascribe bad qualities than good ones.
  C: It is irrational to allow a single instance to turn one's suspicion that a friend is unreliable into a feeling of certainty.
  D: Personal conflicts are not inevitable.
  E: Unlike a suspicion that a friend is unreliable, a belief that someone is reliable is normally built up only after many years of personal interaction.

## Assistant 2:
  Action: Answer("D")

The main conclusion of the argument is that personal conflicts are not inevitable, as many people assume. The counselor argues that people are often irrational in their judgments of others, ascribing bad qualities more easily than good ones. However, this does not mean that personal conflicts are unavoidable. Therefore, the correct answer is D: Personal conflicts are not inevitable.

In my previous response, I incorrectly answered B: Even when there is more evidence of good qualities than of bad ones, people find it easier to ascribe bad qualities than good ones. I realized that this choice does not accurately reflect the main conclusion of the argument. The counselor's point is not that people are always quick to judge others negatively, but that personal conflicts are not necessarily inevitable.
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
