## User 2:
Topic: Law
Context: There are 70 to 100 Florida panthers alive today. This represents a very large increase over their numbers in the 1970s, but their population must reach at least 250 if it is to be self-sustaining. Their current habitat is not large enough to support any more of these animals, however.
Question: If the statements above are true, which one of the following must also be true?
Choices:
  A: Some part of the panthers' current habitat is only of marginal quality.
  B: If the population of Florida panthers ever exceeds 250, it will be self-sustaining.
  C: Unless Florida panthers acquire a larger habitat, their population will not be self-sustaining.
  D: The population of Florida panthers will never increase much beyond its current level.
  E: Today, Florida panthers occupy a larger habitat than they did in the 1970s.

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly.
After reflecting on the problem, my solution, and the correct answer, I realized that I misunderstood the question and chose an answer that was not logically supported by the given statements.
I will carefully read the question, identify the key information, and analyze the connections between the statements to determine the correct answer.

1. Read the question carefully and understand the problem.
The question asks which statement must also be true if the given statements are true.
2. Identify the key information provided in the question.
The key information includes the current population of Florida panthers (70-100), the minimum population required for self-sustainability (250), and the fact that the current habitat cannot support any more panthers.
3. Analyze the given statements and identify the logical connections between them.
Statement 1: The current population of Florida panthers is 70-100.
Statement 2: The population must reach 250 to be self-sustaining.
Statement 3: The current habitat cannot support any more panthers.
The logical connection between the statements is that the current population is not self-sustaining because it is less than the required population of 250, and the current habitat cannot support any more panthers.
4. Apply the principles of logic to determine the correct answer choice.
The correct answer choice must logically follow from the given statements.
The only answer choice that logically follows from the given statements is:

Action: Answer("C")

The explanation for this answer is that if the population must reach 250 to be self-sustaining, and the current habitat cannot support any more panthers, then the population will not be self-sustaining unless Florida panthers acquire a larger habitat.

5. Check your answer to ensure it is correctly formatted.
The answer should be in the format "Action: Answer("[choice]")".
The answer is correctly formatted as "Action: Answer("C")".

Therefore, the correct answer is:
Action: Answer("C")

The correct answer is:
C: Unless Florida panthers acquire a larger habitat, their population will not be self-sustaining.
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
