## Assistant 2:
Thought:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, so I need to be careful and read the question and rules carefully.
To determine the answer, I need to identify which employees have limited parking space options.
Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4, so he has only four possible spaces.
Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa, so Young has only two possible spaces (#5 or #6).
Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, so Xu has only two possible spaces (#5 or #6).
Vaughn has not been mentioned in any of the rules, so he has all six possible spaces.
Therefore, three employees have limited parking space options: Robertson, Young, and Xu.
Action: Answer("C")

Agent Answer: C
