## Assistant 2:
Thought:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, so I need to be careful and avoid making the same mistake again.
The conditions state that I is placed on the middle shelf, and F is placed on the same shelf as M. Therefore, F and M must be on the middle shelf as well.
The conditions also state that K is placed on a higher shelf than F, so K must be on the top shelf.
O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so O must be on the top shelf and L must be on the middle or bottom shelf.
More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, so the bottom shelf must have at least three books.
Action: Answer("B")
