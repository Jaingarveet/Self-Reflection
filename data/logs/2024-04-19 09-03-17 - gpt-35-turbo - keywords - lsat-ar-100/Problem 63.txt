Context: A chemistry class has six lab sessions scheduled over three days—Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday—one session heing held each morning and one each afternoon. Each session will be led by a different lab assistant—Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, or Rebecca. The assignment of lab assistants to sessions is constrained as follows: Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day. Nessa must lead an afternoon session. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
Question: If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, then for how many of the other lab assistants can one determine which sessions they lead?
Choices:
  A: one
  B: two
  C: three
  D: four
  E: five

## Assistant 2:
Thought:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, so I need to be careful with my assumptions and interpretations of the constraints.
If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, then we know that Nessa cannot lead that session, and Olivia's session must be on Friday. Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions on the same day, so they must be on Wednesday or Thursday. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions on the same day, so Lan's session must be on Wednesday. That leaves only one session for Nessa, which is the Thursday morning session. Therefore, we can determine the sessions for all the lab assistants except for one.
