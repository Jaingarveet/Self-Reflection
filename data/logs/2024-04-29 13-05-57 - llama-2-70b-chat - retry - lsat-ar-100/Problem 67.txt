## Assistant 2:
  I'm sorry, but since there is no reflection information provided, I cannot use my self-reflection to help me answer this question. However, I can provide a solution to the problem.

Let's analyze the given information:

1. No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
2. At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
3. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
4. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
5. No batch of cookies is made on Wednesday.

From condition 1, we can infer that the three batches of each kind of cookie are made on different days. Let's create a table to organize the information:

| Day | Oatmeal Cookies | Peanut Butter Cookies | Sugar Cookies |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Monday | X |  |  |
| Tuesday |  | X |  |
| Wednesday |  |  | X |
| Thursday |  |  | X |
| Friday | X |  |  |

Now, let's consider the options:

A. Exactly three batches of cookies are made on Tuesday.
Since the second batch of peanut butter cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of oatmeal cookies, and the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, it's not possible to have three batches of cookies made on Tuesday. Therefore, this option is incorrect.

B. Exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday.
This option is also incorrect for the same reason as A.

C. At least two batches of cookies are made on Monday.
Since the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Monday, and the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, this option is correct.

D. At least two batches of cookies are made on Thursday.
This option is incorrect because only one batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.

E. Fewer batches of cookies are made on Monday than on Tuesday.
This option is incorrect because we know that at least one batch of cookies is made on Monday, and we cannot have fewer than one batch.

Therefore, the correct answer is C. At least two batches of cookies are made on Monday.
## Result:
Agent Answer: None
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
