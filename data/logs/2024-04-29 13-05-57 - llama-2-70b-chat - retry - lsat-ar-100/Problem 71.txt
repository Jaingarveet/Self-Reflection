## Assistant 2:
  I apologize for the confusion. Since there's no reflection information provided, I'll answer the question based on the given information.

Let's analyze the given information:

1. Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
2. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
3. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
4. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
5. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

From condition 1, we know that Parra works in Zone 1, as Tiao works in Zone 2.
From condition 2, we know that Udall works in Zone 2, as Tiao works in Zone 1.
From condition 3, we know that Parra and Quinn work in Zone 3.
From condition 4, we know that Stuckey and Udall work in Zone 3.
From condition 5, we know that there are three sales representatives working in Zone 3, and only two working in Zone 2.

Now, let's evaluate the choices:

A: Kim, Mahr - Incorrect. Kim and Mahr do not work in Zone 3.

B: Kim, Tiao - Incorrect. Tiao works in Zone 2, not Zone 3.

C: Parra, Quinn - Incorrect. While Parra and Quinn work in Zone 3, this choice does not include all the sales representatives working in Zone 3.

D: Stuckey, Tiao, Udall - Incorrect. Tiao works in Zone 2, not Zone 3.

E: Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Udall - Correct. This choice includes all the sales representatives working in Zone 3: Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, and Udall.

Therefore, the correct answer is E: Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Udall.
