## Assistant 2:
  Answer: B

Explanation:
This question is a classic logic puzzle that requires a systematic approach to solve. Let's break it down step by step:

1. Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
2. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
3. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
4. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
5. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

From condition 1, we know that either Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1. Let's assume that Parra works in Zone 1.

From condition 2, we know that Tiao works in Zone 2.

From condition 3, we know that Quinn works in Zone 1, since Parra works in Zone 1.

From condition 4, we know that Udall works in Zone 2, since Stuckey works in Zone 2.

From condition 5, we know that Mahr works in Zone 3, since there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

Now, let's look at the choices:

Choice A: This choice does not match the conditions. According to condition 1, either Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1, but this choice has both of them working in Zone 1.

Choice B: This choice matches the conditions. Parra works in Zone 1, Tiao works in Zone 2, and Mahr works in Zone 3.

Choice C: This choice does not match the conditions. According to condition 3, Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other, but this choice has Parra working in Zone 1 and Quinn working in Zone 3.

Choice D: This choice does not match the conditions. According to condition 4, Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other, but this choice has Stuckey working in Zone 2 and Udall working in Zone 3.

Choice E: This choice does not match the conditions. According to condition 5, there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, but this choice has only one sales representative (Mahr) working in Zone 3.

Therefore, the correct answer is Choice B.
