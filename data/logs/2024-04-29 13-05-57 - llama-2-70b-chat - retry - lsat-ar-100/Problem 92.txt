## Assistant 2:
  I apologize for the confusion. Since there is no reflection information provided, I'll answer the question based on the given information.

Action: Answer("C")

Explanation:
Quinn works in the same sales zone as Parra, and Parra cannot work in Zone 2. Therefore, Quinn cannot work in Zone 2. Stuckey works in the same sales zone as Udall, and Udall cannot work in Zone 2. Therefore, Stuckey cannot work in Zone 2.

Since there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, and Quinn and Stuckey cannot work in Zone 2, it means that Quinn and Stuckey work in Zone 3.

Therefore, Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Stuckey, which is choice C.

Answer: C
