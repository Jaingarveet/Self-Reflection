Topic: Law
Context: During a recital, two pianists—Wayne and Zara—will perform solos. There will be five solos altogether, performed one immediately after another. Each solo will be either a modern piece or a traditional piece. The choice of pianist and type of piece for the solos must conform to the following conditions: The third solo is a traditional piece. Exactly two of the traditional pieces are performed consecutively. In the fourth solo, either Wayne performs a traditional piece or Zara performs a modern piece. The pianist who performs the second solo does not perform the fifth solo. No traditional piece is performed until Wayne performs at least one modem piece.
Question: If the pianist who performs the first solo also performs the second solo, then which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Zara performs the first solo.
  B: Wayne performs the third solo.
  C: Zara performs the fifth solo.
  D: The second solo is a traditional piece.
  E: The fourth solo is a modem piece.

## Assistant 2:
  Answer: B

Explanation:
We know that the third solo is a traditional piece. If the pianist who performs the first solo also performs the second solo, then the second solo must be a modern piece (since no traditional piece can be performed until Wayne performs at least one modern piece). Therefore, the third solo cannot be performed by the pianist who performs the first and second solos.

Thus, Wayne must perform the third solo, and the fourth solo must be a modern piece (since Zara does not perform any traditional pieces). Therefore, the statement that must be true is:

B: Wayne performs the third solo.

The other choices do not logically follow from the given conditions:

A: Zara performs the first solo. This is not necessarily true, as the pianist who performs the first solo could be either Wayne or Zara.

C: Zara performs the fifth solo. This is not necessarily true, as the fifth solo could be performed by either Wayne or Zara.

D: The second solo is a traditional piece. This is not necessarily true, as the second solo could be a modern piece.

E: The fourth solo is a modern piece. This is not necessarily true, as the fourth solo could be a traditional piece.
