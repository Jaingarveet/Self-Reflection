Context: A shopping center has exactly seven spaces—space 1 through space 7—arranged in a straight row. Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
Question: If the veterinarian is in space 5, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: The optometrist is in space 2.
  B: The pharmacy is in space 7.
  C: A restaurant is in space 4.

## Assistant 2:
  Answer: B

The veterinarian being in space 5 means that the pharmacy must be in space 7, as it must be next to the veterinarian or the optometrist, and it cannot be in space 5. Therefore, choice B is the correct answer.

The other choices do not logically follow from the given constraints:

* Choice A: The optometrist could be in any of the other six spaces.
* Choice C: A restaurant could be in any of the other six spaces.
* Choice D: The shoe store could be in any of the other six spaces.
* Choice E: The toy store could be in any of the other six spaces, but it cannot be next to the veterinarian, so it must be in one of the other five spaces.

Therefore, the correct answer is B: The pharmacy is in space 7.
