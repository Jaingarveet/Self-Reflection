## Assistant 2:
  Answer: B

Explanation:
This question is a logic puzzle that requires a systematic approach to solve. Let's break it down step by step:

1. Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report, so George's report must be on Tuesday.
2. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report, so they must give morning reports.
3. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day, Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
4. Since Kyle, Lenore, and Helen are giving morning reports, and George is giving a report on Tuesday, we can deduce that:
* Helen's report is on Monday.
* Kyle's report is on Tuesday.
* Lenore's report is on Wednesday.
5. Now, let's consider the options:
* A: Helen gives a report on Monday. - Correct
* B: Irving gives a report on Monday. - Incorrect (Irving gives a report on Wednesday)
* C: Irving gives a report on Wednesday. - Correct
* D: Kyle gives a report on Tuesday. - Incorrect (Kyle gives a report on Wednesday)
* E: Kyle gives a report on Wednesday. - Incorrect (Kyle gives a report on Wednesday)

Therefore, the answer is B: Irving gives a report on Wednesday.

Reflection:
My previous answer was incorrect because I misunderstood the condition stated in point 3. I thought Nina's report had to be on Wednesday, which led me to choose option D. However, re-reading the question, I realized that Nina's report can be on any day, and the condition only states that if Nina gives a report, then on the next day, Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.
## Result:
Agent Answer: None
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
