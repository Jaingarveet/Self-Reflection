## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Let X be the percentage of students who are members of the swim team but not the chess club.
We know that 24% are members of both, and 20% are members of the swim team but not chess club, so:
X% + 24% = 20%.
Solving for X gives us X = 16%.
Thus, 36% of students are members of the swim team (16% + 20%).
Action: Answer("E")
## Result:
Agent Answer: E
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
