## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The cow is tethered in the middle of the field, so the field is a circle with a radius of 7 feet (half the length of the rope).
The area of the field is $7^2 \pi \approx 154$ square feet.
At a rate of 10 square feet per day, it will take approximately $154 / 10 = \mathbf{15.4}$ \text{ days } for the cow to graze the whole field.

Choice A, 51 days, is too large.
Choice B, 61 days, is too large.
Choice C, 71 days, is too large.
Choice D, 81 days, is too large.
Choice E, 91 days, is too large.

The correct answer is that there is \textbf{no suitable option}.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
