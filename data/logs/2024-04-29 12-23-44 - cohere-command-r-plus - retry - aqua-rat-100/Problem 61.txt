## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Let the one-way distance between A and B be x miles.

Kevin drives for 3 hours at 70 mph, so he covers a distance of 3 * 70 = 210 miles.
At this point, he is 70 miles away from B, so the total distance he has covered is 210 + 70 = 280 miles.
Thus, 280 miles is equal to a round trip, so the distance between A and B is x = 280 / 2 = **140** miles.

The correct answer is not listed among the choices.
Action: Answer("E")
