## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Let's assume C joined for the remaining 8 months, for a total of 10 months, as B joined after 2 months.
In that case, A's share for the year would be (40000*12)/600000*375000 = 90000,
B's share would be (60000*10)/600000*375000 = 150000,
and C's share would be 120000/600000*375000 = 75000,
which is half of the stated amount of 150000.

Therefore, C joined 4 months after B, for a total of 6 months.
Action: Answer("B")

Agent Answer: B
