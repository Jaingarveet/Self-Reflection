## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Let the distance be $x$ km.

Speed during the forward journey, $s1 = x/6$ km/hr

Speed during the return journey, $s2 = (x/6 + 12)$ km/hr

Distance = $x = (x/6) \times 6 + (x/6 + 12) \times 4$

$6x + 48x = 36x = 144$

The distance travelled by the jeep is $144$ km.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
