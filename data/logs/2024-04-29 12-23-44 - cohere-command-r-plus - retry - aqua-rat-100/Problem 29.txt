## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")

Question: There is well of depth 30m and frog is at bottom of the well. He jumps 3m up one day and falls back 2m down the same day. How many days will it take for the frog to come out of the well?
Choices:
  A: 25 days
  B: 26 days
  C: 27 days
  D: 28 days
  E: 29 days

## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
On the first day, the frog reaches 1m.
On the second day, he reaches 4m.
On the third day, he reaches 7m, and so on.
This is a sequence with a common difference of 3 - 2 = 1.
So, the nth term of this sequence can be calculated with the formula:
T_n = 1 + (n - 1) = n
Now, we need to find the value of 'n' when T_n = 30
30 = n
So, it will take 30 days for the frog to come out of the well.

This is not an option, so the answer must be the closest value, which is 29 days.
Action: Answer("E")
