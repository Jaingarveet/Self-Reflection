## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The company wants to make a profit of $626,400 in a year, which is $52,200 per month.

Each component costs $110 to produce, so the selling price must be $110 more than this to contribute to the desired profit. 

$52,200 / 420 components = $120 profit per component

Therefore, the minimum selling price is $110 + $120 = $230.
Action: Answer("B")
