# Model: gpt-35-turbo | Task: save_reflection | Exam: logiqa-en-100 | Problem 98 of 100
## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I incorrectly chose option B as the answer because I did not carefully read and analyze each option. Option B is not relevant to the argument and does not support it. Option D, on the other hand, supports the argument by suggesting that the basis for judgment of right and wrong lies in pushing oneself and one's moral conscience, but the moral regulations on how to act for people vary from person to person and from place to place.
Error Keywords:
 - Misreading options
 - Not analyzing options carefully
 - Choosing irrelevant options
Solution:
Option A supports the argument by suggesting that we need regulations or standards to judge right and wrong.
Option B is not relevant to the argument and does not support it.
Option C supports the argument by suggesting that rules or standards are behind the judgment of right and wrong.
Option D supports the argument by suggesting that the basis for judgment of right and wrong lies in pushing oneself and one's moral conscience, but the moral regulations on how to act for people vary from person to person and from place to place.
Instructions:
1. Read and analyze each option carefully.
2. Identify the option that supports the argument in the question stem.
3. Eliminate options that are not relevant to the argument or weaken it.
4. Choose the option that best supports the argument.
Advice:
 - Always read and analyze each option carefully.
 - Eliminate options that are not relevant to the argument or weaken it.
 - Choose the option that best supports the argument.
 - Remember that the correct answer is not always the most obvious one.
