## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I misread the question stem and did not pay attention to the phrase "best refute". I chose an answer that provided evidence against the possibility of "customized babies" but did not necessarily refute the views of ordinary people. 
Error Keywords:
 - Misreading
 - Inattention
 - Misunderstanding
Solution:
The question asks for the choice that would best refute the views of ordinary people. The views of ordinary people are that humans may usher in the era of "customized babies". Therefore, the correct answer should provide evidence against the possibility of "customized babies" and refute the views of ordinary people.
Option A talks about the limitations of artificial genetic screening, but it does not refute the possibility of "customized babies".
Option B talks about the potential risks of technological development, but it does not refute the possibility of "customized babies".
Option C distinguishes between gene screening and eugenics, and suggests that the concept of cloning is more involved, which refutes the possibility of "customized babies".
Option D suggests that "customized babies" have not been tried globally and challenges human reproductive ethics, but it does not necessarily refute the possibility of "customized babies".
Instructions:
1. Read the question stem carefully and pay attention to key phrases.
