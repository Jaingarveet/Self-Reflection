## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I chose option D, which does not necessarily refute the argument. The argument states that hundreds of people had lived in the cave, but option D only states that the entrance to the cave collapsed 5000 years ago. This does not necessarily mean that people did not live in the cave before the entrance collapsed. Option B, on the other hand, provides an alternative explanation that contradicts the argument. If the cave is actually an ancient cemetery and funeral venue, then it is less likely that hundreds of people had lived in the cave. 
Error Keywords:
 - Misunderstanding the question
 - Incorrectly evaluating answer choices
 - Insufficiently analyzing answer choices
Solution:
The argument states that hundreds of people had lived in the cave, but we need to find a statement that contradicts this claim. Option B provides an alternative explanation that contradicts the argument. If the cave is actually an ancient cemetery and funeral venue, then it is less likely that hundreds of people had lived in the cave.
