## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I misinterpreted the question and did not carefully consider each option. 
The question asks for the most doubtful assertion, which means we need to find the statement that is least likely to be true.
Option D is a possible reason for the increase in housing prices, but it is not necessarily true.
Option B provides specific data on the increase in housing and land prices in Beijing, which makes it less likely to be false.
Error Keywords:
 - Misinterpretation
 - Lack of attention to detail
 - Failure to consider all options
Solution:
Read the question carefully and consider each option individually.
Eliminate options that are likely to be true and focus on options that are less likely to be true.
