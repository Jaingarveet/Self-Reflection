## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that the argument relied on the idea that stealing is the best option for someone who only has one day to live. However, the argument relies on the assumption that a person can know exactly how long they will live before deciding whether to steal something from someone else. 
Error Keywords:
 - Misunderstanding the assumption
 - Misinterpreting the argument
 - Incorrectly identifying the key factor
Solution:
The argument assumes that a person can know exactly how long they will live before deciding whether to steal something from someone else. 
Instructions:
1. Read the argument carefully and identify the conclusion.
2. Identify the evidence and assumptions used to support the conclusion.
3. Evaluate each answer choice and determine which one is necessary for the argument to hold.
4. Choose the answer that best fits the assumption made in the argument.
Advice:
 - Always read the argument carefully and identify the conclusion.
 - Identify the evidence and assumptions used to support the conclusion.
 - Evaluate each answer choice and determine which one is necessary for the argument to hold.
 - Choose the answer that best fits the assumption made in the argument.
