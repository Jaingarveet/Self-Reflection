## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I incorrectly chose option B as the answer because I thought that the increase in the number of internet users could be an alternative explanation for the increase in posts related to evildoing, escaping evil, and killing more people. However, option D is the correct answer because it weakens the argument by questioning the credibility of the online forum that made the statistical comparison. If the online forum is not a credible source, then the statistical comparison may not be reliable, and the argument may not be valid.
Error Keywords:
 - Misunderstanding the question
 - Incorrect reasoning
 - Incorrect evaluation of answer choices
Solution:
Option D is the correct answer because it weakens the argument by questioning the credibility of the online forum that made the statistical comparison. If the online forum is not a credible source, then the statistical comparison may not be reliable, and the argument may not be valid.

2. Identify the conclusion and the evidence used to support it.
