## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I incorrectly matched the word "Doximayo" with "hostage" instead of "student". 
The gap in my knowledge was in the interpretation of the meaning of the words. 
I did not pay close attention to the meaning of the words in the context of the sentences.
Error Keywords:
 - Interpretation error
 - Meaning error

Solution:
"Alingoits Doximayo Makasey" means "kidnapping student (host) hostage".
"Huholikaso Makasey Mugbudengs" means "hostage holding (see) "Reporter".

Therefore, "Doximayo" means "student".
