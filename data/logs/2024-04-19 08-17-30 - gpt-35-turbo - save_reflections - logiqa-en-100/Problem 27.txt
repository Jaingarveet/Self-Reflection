# Model: gpt-35-turbo | Task: save_reflection | Exam: logiqa-en-100 | Problem 27 of 100
## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I misinterpreted the conclusion of the scientist. The scientist concluded that the initial experiment's result was caused by the wrong measurement method, but I incorrectly assumed that the hypothetical hypothesis of the scientist should be related to the wrong measurement method. 
Error Keywords:
 - Misinterpretation
 - Assumption error
 - Logical error
Solution:
The scientist concluded that the initial experiment's result was caused by the wrong measurement method. The hypothetical hypothesis of the scientist should be related to the conclusion that the result of an experiment is correct if the experiment under the same conditions should yield the same result.
The hypothetical hypothesis of the scientist is A: If the result of an experiment is correct, then the experiment under the same conditions should yield the same result.
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and understand the problem.
2. Identify the conclusion of the scientist.
3. Identify the hypothetical hypothesis of the scientist.
4. Choose the answer that matches the hypothetical hypothesis of the scientist.
5. Double-check your answer to ensure accuracy.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Never make assumptions or jump to conclusions.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Always double-check your answer to ensure accuracy.
 - Remember that the hypothetical hypothesis is a statement that can be tested by an experiment.
