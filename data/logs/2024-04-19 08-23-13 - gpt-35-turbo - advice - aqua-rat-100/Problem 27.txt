## Assistant 2:
Self-reflection:
To solve this problem, we need to find the amount each man has to contribute towards the purchase of the gift after 3 men drop out. 
Let the amount each man has to contribute be x. 
Then, initially, each man has to contribute D/M. 
After 3 men drop out, the total number of men left is M-3. 
So, the total amount available to purchase the gift is still D. 
Thus, we can set up the equation (M-3)x = D. 
Solving for x, we get x = D/(M-3). 
Therefore, the answer is A.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
