## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let's first calculate the total distance the train travels. 
Speed = Distance / Time
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 100 * 10 = 1000 miles
After covering a quarter of the distance, the train has traveled 1000/4 = 250 miles.
Now, the remaining distance is 1000 - 250 = 750 miles.
Let's calculate the time taken to cover the remaining distance.
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 750 / 75 = 10 hours
The total journey duration is the sum of the time taken to cover the first quarter of the distance and the time taken to cover the remaining distance.
Total time = 10 + 10 = 20 hours
Action: Answer("E")
