## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let's use the formula: distance = speed x time
Let's assume the speed of the jeep on the forward journey is S km/hr.
Let's also assume the distance travelled by the jeep is D km.
On the forward journey, the jeep took 6 hours to travel D km at S km/hr.
Therefore, D = S x 6.
On the return journey, the jeep increased its speed by 12km/hr, so its speed was (S + 12) km/hr.
The jeep took 4 hours to travel D km at (S + 12) km/hr.
Therefore, D = (S + 12) x 4.
We can now solve for D by equating the two expressions for D:
S x 6 = (S + 12) x 4
6S = 4S + 48
2S = 48
S = 24
Substituting S = 24 into D = S x 6, we get D = 144 km.
