## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The product of two numbers is equal to the product of their GCF and LCM.
Let x be the other integer.
11 * LCM = 11 * 350 * x = 3850x
LCM = 7700 = 2^2 * 5^2 * 7 * 11
3850x = 2^2 * 5^2 * 7 * 11 * 11
x = 2 * 5^2 * 7 * 11 / 3850 = 308 / 11
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
