Question: In a railway station, there are two trains going. One in the harbor line and one in the main line, each having a frequency of 10 minutes. The main line service starts at 5 o'clock and the harbor line starts at 5.02 A.M. A man goes to the station every day to catch the first train that comes. What is the probability of the man catching the first train?
Choices:
  A: 0.9
  B: 0.8
  C: 0.6
  D: 0.65
  E: 1.5

## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The man wants to catch the first train that comes, which means he can catch either the main line or the harbor line.
The main line train starts at 5 o'clock, and the harbor line train starts at 5.02 A.M.
The frequency of both trains is 10 minutes, which means they will arrive every 10 minutes.
To calculate the probability of the man catching the first train, we need to calculate the probability of him catching the main line train or the harbor line train.
The probability of him catching the main line train is the probability of him arriving between 5 o'clock and 5.10 A.M.
The probability of him catching the harbor line train is the probability of him arriving between 5.02 A.M. and 5.12 A.M.
We can calculate these probabilities by dividing the time interval by the frequency of the trains.
The total probability of him catching either train is the sum of these probabilities.
