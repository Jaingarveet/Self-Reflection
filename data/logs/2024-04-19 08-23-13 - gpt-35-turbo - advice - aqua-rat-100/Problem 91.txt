# Model: gpt-35-turbo | Agent: advice | Exam: aqua-rat-100 | Problem 91 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:

## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: A starts travel towards south 3km, then travel 5 km towards east, and again travels 3 km to north, and finally travels 2km towards west. In the end how far from is A from home?
Choices:
  A: 3km
  B: 2km
  C: 4km
  D: 5km
  E: 6km
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always draw a diagram to visualize the problem.
 - Always use Pythagoras theorem to find the distance between two points in a right-angled triangle.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
From the given information, we can draw a diagram and see that A has formed a right-angled triangle.
The distance traveled towards the south and north will cancel each other out.
The distance traveled towards the east and west will cancel each other out.
So, the final distance from home will be the hypotenuse of the right-angled triangle formed by the remaining distances.
Using Pythagoras theorem, we can find the hypotenuse.
a² + b² = c²
where a and b are the remaining distances traveled by A.
a = 5 km and b = 3 km
c = √(5² + 3²) = √34 km (rounded to two decimal places)
Action: Answer("E")
## Result:
Agent Answer: E
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
