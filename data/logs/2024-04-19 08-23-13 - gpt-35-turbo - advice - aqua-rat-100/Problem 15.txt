## Assistant 2:
Thought:
To add two numbers with different signs, we need to subtract the smaller absolute value from the larger absolute value and keep the sign of the larger number.
Here, the larger absolute value is 45 and the smaller absolute value is 30.
So, the result is 45 - 30 = 15 with the sign of the larger number, which is positive.
Action: Answer("D")

Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
