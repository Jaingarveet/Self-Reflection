## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The original square piece of cloth has four equal sides.
Let's assume that each side of the original square piece of cloth is "x" feet long.
After trimming 4 feet from one edge, the new rectangular piece has one side that is "x-4" feet long and the other side that is still "x" feet long.
The area of a triangle is (1/2) * base * height.
Each triangle has an area of 70 square feet, so the area of both triangles is 140 square feet.
The two triangles are congruent, so they have the same base and height.
Let's assume that the base of each triangle is "b" feet long and the height of each triangle is "h" feet long.
Then, we have the following equation: (1/2) * b * h = 70.
Solving for "h", we get h = 140 / b.
The diagonal of the rectangular piece is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with sides "x-4" and "h".
Using the Pythagorean theorem, we get (x-4)^2 + h^2 = x^2.
Substituting h = 140 / b, we get (x-4)^2 + (140 / b)^2 = x^2.
Simplifying, we get b^2 * (x-4)^2 + 140^2 = b^2 * x^2.
Expanding and simplifying, we get 16x - 560 = b^2.
We know that the perimeter of the original square piece of cloth is 4x.
Action: Answer("D")
