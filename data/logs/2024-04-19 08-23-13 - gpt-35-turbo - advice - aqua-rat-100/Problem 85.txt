## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: Consider there is an staircase elevator and you are coming down. If you walk 20 steps and stop, then you reach bottom in 10 minutes. If you walk 10 steps and stop, you reach to the ground in 20 minutes. What is the speed of the elevator?
Choices:
  A: 1 step/minute
  B: 2 step/minute
  C: 3 step/minute
  D: 4 step/minute
  E: None of the above
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always identify the unknown variable and assign a variable to it.
 - Always use the given information to create equations.
 - Always solve the equations to find the value of the unknown variable.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that the speed is constant, so it cannot have two different values.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let's assume that the speed of the elevator is "s" steps/minute.
Let's also assume that the total number of steps in the staircase is "n".
From the first scenario, we know that:
- Time = 10 minutes
- Distance = n - 20 (since we stop at the 20th step)
- Speed = s steps/minute
Using the formula: Distance = Speed x Time, we can write:
n - 20 = s x 10
n = 10s + 20
From the second scenario, we know that:
- Time = 20 minutes
- Distance = n - 10 (since we stop at the 10th step)
- Speed = s steps/minute
Using the formula: Distance = Speed x Time, we can write:
n - 10 = s x 20
n = 20s + 10
Now we can equate the two expressions for "n":
10s + 20 = 20s + 10
10 = 10s
s = 1
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
