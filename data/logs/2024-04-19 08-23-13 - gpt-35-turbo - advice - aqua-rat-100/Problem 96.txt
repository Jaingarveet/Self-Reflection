Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.

 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that the sum of their shares of the profit should be equal to 1.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let's assume C joined after x months.
The ratio of their investments is (A*12):(B*10):(C*x) = 40,000*12 : 60,000*10 : 120,000*x = 16:20:3x.
Let's assume the total profit is divided into 39 parts (16+20+3x).
Then C's share is 15 parts (150,000/375,000 * 39).
So, 3x = 15, and x = 5.
Therefore, C joined after 5 months since B joined after 2 months.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
