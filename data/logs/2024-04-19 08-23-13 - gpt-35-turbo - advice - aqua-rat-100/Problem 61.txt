## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: Kevin drove from A to B at a constant speed of 70 mph. Once he reached B, he turned right around with pause, and returned to A at a constant speed of 90 mph. Exactly 3 hours before the end of his trip, he was still approaching B, only 70 miles away from it. What is the distance between A and B?
Choices:
  A: 180
  B: 90
  C: 270
  D: 360
  E: None of the above
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.

Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Advice:
 - Always read the problem carefully and make sure you understand it.
 - Always identify the variables and equations needed to solve the problem.
 - Always use the formula distance = rate x time to set up the equations.
 - Always be careful when substituting expressions for variables.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that the distance from [REDACTED] to [REDACTED] may not be the same as the distance from [REDACTED] to [REDACTED].
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let's call the distance between A and B "d".
Let's call the time it takes Kevin to drive from A to B "t1".
Let's call the time it takes Kevin to drive from B to A "t2".
We know that Kevin drove at a constant speed of 70 mph from A to B, so we can use the formula distance = rate x time to get:
d = 70t1
We also know that Kevin drove at a constant speed of 90 mph from B to A, so we can use the same formula to get:
d = 90t2
We know that exactly 3 hours before the end of his trip, Kevin was still approaching B, only 70 miles away from it. This means that he had already driven 70 miles from A to B, and had 3 more hours of driving left. We can use this information to set up another equation:
70 + 70 = 90(t2 - 3)
Simplifying this equation, we get:
t2 = 8
Now we can use the equation d = 90t2 to solve for d:
d = 90(8)
d = 720
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: A
