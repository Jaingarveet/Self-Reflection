## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The outer surface of the cube is painted, which means all the faces of the outer layer of the cube are painted.
The given cube is of size 5cm, with a thickness of 1cm, which means the inner cube is of size 3cm.
The number of smaller cubes on the outer layer of the cube is (5x5x6) - (3x3x6) = 150.
Each face of the smaller cube has an area of 1cm^2.
Therefore, the total number of faces of the smaller cubes that remain unpainted is 150 x 6 - 100 = 800.
Action: Answer("E")
