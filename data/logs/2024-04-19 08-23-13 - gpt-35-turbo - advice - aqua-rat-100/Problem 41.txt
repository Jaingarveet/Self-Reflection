## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let's assume that the total number of friends who planned to go on a picnic is "x".
The total amount they planned to spend is Rs. 96.
The amount each person would have to contribute if all of them attended the picnic is 96/x.
Since 4 of them did not turn up, the remaining people had to contribute Rs. 4 extra each.
So, the new amount each person contributed is (96/x) + 4.
The total amount collected after 4 people did not turn up is (96/x + 4) * (x-4).
We can set up an equation based on the information given in the problem:
96 = (96/x + 4) * (x-4)
Simplifying the equation:
96 = 96 - 16/x + 4x - 16
16/x = 4x
x^2 = 4 * 16
x = 8 or x = -8
Since the number of friends cannot be negative, the answer is x = 8.
Action: Answer("A")
