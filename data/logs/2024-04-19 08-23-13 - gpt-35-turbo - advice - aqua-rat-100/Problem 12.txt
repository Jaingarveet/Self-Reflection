## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let's call the number we're trying to find "x".
From the problem, we know that:
x - 30 = (1/3)x
Multiplying both sides by 3 gives:
3x - 90 = x
Simplifying gives:
2x = 90
x = 45
Now we need to find 50% of x:
(50/100) * 45 = 22.5
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
