## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Assistant 2:
Self-reflection:
To solve this problem, we need to use conditional probability. Let A be the event that a chocolate is vanilla flavored and B be the event that a chocolate is not squashed. We want to find P(A and B). We know that P(B|cocoa) = 0, P(cocoa) = 0.1, P(B|vanilla) = 0.9, and P(vanilla) = 0.9. We can use the formula P(A and B) = P(B|vanilla) * P(A) to find the answer. 
P(A) = P(vanilla) = 0.9
P(B|vanilla) = 0.9
P(A and B) = 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81
The percentage of the chocolates that are both vanilla flavored and not squashed is 81/100 * 100% = 81%.
Action: Answer("None of the Above") [The correct answer is not listed in the choices. The correct answer is 81%.]
