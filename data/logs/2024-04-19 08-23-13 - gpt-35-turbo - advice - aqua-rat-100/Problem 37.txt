## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let's assume that Sachin played 'x' matches in the season.
Given that Sachin's current batting average is 51.
Let's assume that Sachin scored 'y' runs in the season.
Then, the total runs scored by Sachin in the season = xy.
After the finals, Sachin's batting average became 54.
Therefore, the total runs scored by Sachin in the season = xy + 78.
We can form two equations from the above information:
Equation 1: xy / x = 51
Equation 2: (xy + 78) / (x + 1) = 54
Solving the above equations, we get:
x = 9
Action: Answer("C")
