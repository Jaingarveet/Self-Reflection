## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The total amount borrowed is Rs.360 and the monthly installment is Rs.31.50.
The number of installments is 12.
The total amount paid back is 12 x Rs.31.50 = Rs.378.
The interest paid is Rs.378 - Rs.360 = Rs.18.
The interest rate is (interest paid / total amount borrowed) x 100.
Substituting the values, the interest rate is (18/360) x 100 = 5%.
Action: Answer("D")
