Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

  A: 51 days
  B: 61 days
  C: 71 days
  D: 81 days
  E: 91 days
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.

Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always use the correct formula for the problem.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that the radius of a circle is half of its diameter.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The area of the field is the area of the circle with a radius of 14 feet.
Area of a circle = πr^2
Area of the field = π(14)^2 = 616π sq.ft.
The cow grazes 10 sq.ft. per day.
Time taken by the cow to graze the whole field = Area of the field / Rate of grazing
Time taken by the cow to graze the whole field = (616π) / 10 = 61.6π days
Approximately, the time taken by the cow to graze the whole field is 61 days.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
