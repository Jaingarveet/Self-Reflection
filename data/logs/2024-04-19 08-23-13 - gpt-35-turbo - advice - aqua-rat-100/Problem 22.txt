## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: Alex and Jacob works at a toy shop that make toys. Alex takes 7 hours to make a toy, and Jacob takes 9 hours to make a toy. During a month, both of them makes 35 toys in total. If both of them have worked for almost similar number of hours how many toys have been prepared by Jacob?
Choices:
  A: 15
  B: 16
  C: 17
  D: 18
  E: 19

 - Remember that approximation can be used if the difference is negligible.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let's assume that Alex and Jacob worked for x hours each.
Alex makes 1/7 of a toy in an hour.
Jacob makes 1/9 of a toy in an hour.
Together, they make 35 toys in total.
Using the formula: Work = Rate x Time
We can create two equations:
Alex's work: (1/7)x = A
Jacob's work: (1/9)x = J
A + J = 35
Substituting the first two equations into the third equation:
(1/7)x + (1/9)x = 35
Simplifying the equation:
(16/63)x = 35
x = (35*63)/16
x = 138.28125
Since both of them worked for almost similar hours, we can assume that they worked for 138 hours each.
Jacob's work: (1/9)x = (1/9)*138 = 15.3333
Rounding off to the nearest whole number, we get:
Action: Answer("D") 18
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
