## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The yearly profit should be at least $626,400.
The company produces 420 units of the component every month.
The production cost per component is $110.
Let's calculate the yearly production cost: 420 units/month x $110/unit x 12 months/year = $554,400/year.
The yearly revenue should be $626,400 + $554,400 = $1,180,800.
To find the minimum selling price per component, we need to divide the yearly revenue by the number of components produced per year: $1,180,800/year รท (420 units/month x 12 months/year) = $230/unit.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
