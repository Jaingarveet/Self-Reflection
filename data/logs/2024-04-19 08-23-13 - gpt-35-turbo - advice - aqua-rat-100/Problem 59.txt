Question: 20 marbles were pulled out of a bag of only white marbles, painted black, and then put back in. Then, another 20 marbles were pulled out, of which 1 was black, after which they were all returned to the bag. If the percentage of black marbles pulled out the second time represents their percentage in the bag, how many marbles in total Q does the bag currently hold?

 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that percentages are calculated by dividing the part by the whole and multiplying by 100.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let's first calculate the number of black marbles pulled out the second time. If one out of 20 marbles is black, then 20 * (1/20) = 1 black marble was pulled out the second time. If this represents the percentage of black marbles in the bag, then there must be 1 black marble out of Q marbles in the bag. We can set up the equation (1/Q) * 100 = 1/20 * 100 and solve for Q. First, simplify the equation to 100/Q = 5, then cross-multiply to get Q = 20 * 5 = 100.
Action: Answer("D")
