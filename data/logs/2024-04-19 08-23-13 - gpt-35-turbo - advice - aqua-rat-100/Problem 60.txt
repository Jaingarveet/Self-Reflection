## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Assistant 2:
Self-reflection:
To solve this problem, we need to use the fact that B bisects minor arc AC. This means that the measure of minor arc AB is equal to the measure of minor arc BC. We can use this fact to find the measure of minor arc BD, which is 150°. We know that the sum of the measures of minor arcs AB, BC, and CD is equal to the measure of the whole circle, which is 360°. We can set up an equation using this fact and the fact that minor arc AB is equal to minor arc BC. Solving for the measure of minor arc AD, we get 140°. Therefore, the answer is (C) 140°.
Action: Answer("C")
