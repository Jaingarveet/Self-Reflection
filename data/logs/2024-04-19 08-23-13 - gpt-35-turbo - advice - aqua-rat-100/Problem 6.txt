## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let's first calculate the fraction of work done by each painter per day.
Mr.Brown can paint a house in 6 days, so he can paint 1/6 of a house per day.
Mr.Black can paint a house in 8 days, so he can paint 1/8 of a house per day.
Mr.Blue can paint a house in 12 days, so he can paint 1/12 of a house per day.
After 8 days, Mr.Brown has completed 8*(1/6) = 4/3 of the work.
So, the remaining work is 1 - 4/3 = 1/3 of the work.
Mr.Black works for 6 days, so he completes 6*(1/8) = 3/4 of the remaining work.
The total work done is 4/3 + 3/4 = 7/3 of the work.
The remaining work is 1 - 7/3 = 2/3 of the work.
Mr.Blue can paint 1/12 of a house per day, so he will complete the remaining 2/3 of the work in (2/3) / (1/12) = 8 days.
Action: Answer("B")
