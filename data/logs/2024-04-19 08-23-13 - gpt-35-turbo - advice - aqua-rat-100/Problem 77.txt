## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The sum of 5 consecutive odd numbers can be expressed as 5x + 10, where x is the middle number.
The sum of 5 consecutive odd numbers is divisible by 5.
The sum of 5 consecutive odd numbers is an odd number.
The sum of 5 consecutive odd numbers is a multiple of 5.
Let's check each option to see if it can be one of the 5 consecutive odd numbers.
A: 47 is an odd number, but it cannot be one of the 5 consecutive odd numbers.
B: 91 is an odd number, and it can be one of the 5 consecutive odd numbers (87, 89, 91, 93, 95).
C: 41 is an odd number, but it cannot be one of the 5 consecutive odd numbers.
D: 67 is an odd number, but it cannot be one of the 5 consecutive odd numbers.
E: 44 is an even number, so it cannot be one of the 5 consecutive odd numbers.
The sum of the 5 consecutive odd numbers is 5x + 10, which is divisible by 10 if x is even.
Let's check each option to see if the sum of the 5 consecutive odd numbers is a perfect square.
A: The sum of the 5 consecutive odd numbers is 235, which is not a perfect square.
B: The sum of the 5 consecutive odd numbers is 455, which is 15^2.
C: The sum of the 5 consecutive odd numbers is 205, which is not a perfect square.
D: The sum of the 5 consecutive odd numbers is 335, which is not a perfect square.
E: The sum of the 5 consecutive odd numbers is 219, which is not a perfect square.
Action: Answer("B")
