Question: Sheep Challenge Evolution A species of sheep lives on the Scottish island of Hirta. Hirta has plenty of grass for the sheep to eat, and no natural predators of the sheep live on the island. Some sheep have dark wool, and some have light wool. The sheep with dark wool tend to be much larger and stronger than the sheep with light wool. However, researchers have found that in the last 20 years, the sheep with light wool have increased in number. Usually, strength and size help animals survive and breed. A new sheep predator is introduced to the island. Which change to the sheep population will most likely occur first?
Choices:
  A: a decrease in the population of sheep with dark wool
  B: a decrease in the population of sheep with light wool
  C: an increase in the population of sheep with dark wool
  D: an increase in the population of sheep with light wool

## Reflection on Previous Error:
While I don't have access to the specifics of my previous error, I can analyze the situation and likely causes for getting the answer wrong. Here's what I'll consider:
* **Misinterpretation of the scenario:** I might have misunderstood the relationship between wool color and size/strength, or the impact of the new predator.
* **Ignoring key information:**  I might have overlooked the fact that light-wool sheep were increasing despite the advantages of dark-wool sheep. This suggests an additional factor favoring light-wool sheep.
* **Incorrect assumption about predator behavior:** I might have assumed the predator would target larger sheep (dark wool) when it could prefer smaller, easier-to-catch prey (light wool).
## Answering the Question:
Given the new predator and the existing trend of increasing light-wool sheep, the most likely immediate impact would be:
**Action: Answer("B")** - a decrease in the population of sheep with light wool 
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
