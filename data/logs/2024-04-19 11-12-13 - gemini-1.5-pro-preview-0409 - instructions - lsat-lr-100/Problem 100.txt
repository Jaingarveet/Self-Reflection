## User 2:
Topic: Law
Context: In some jurisdictions, lawmakers have instituted sentencing guidelines that mandate a penalty for theft that is identical to the one they have mandated for bribery. Hence, lawmakers in those jurisdictions evidently consider the harm resulting from theft to be equal to the harm resulting from bribery.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would most strengthen the argument?
Choices:
  A: In general, lawmakers mandate penalties for crimes that are proportional to the harm they believe to result from those crimes.
  B: In most cases, lawmakers assess the level of harm resulting from an act in determining whether to make that act illegal.
  C: Often, in response to the unusually great harm resulting from a particular instance of a crime, lawmakers will mandate an increased penalty for that crime.
  D: In most cases, a victim of theft is harmed no more than a victim of bribery is harmed.
  E: If lawmakers mandate penalties for crimes that are proportional to the harm resulting from those crimes, crime in those lawmakers' jurisdictions will be effectively deterred.

## Assistant 2:
## Reflection on Previous Attempt:
**Error Analysis:**
In my previous attempt, I likely focused on the general principles of lawmaking and harm assessment, leading to an incorrect choice. The key to strengthening the argument lies in finding an option that directly supports the equivalence of harm between theft and bribery as perceived by the lawmakers.
**Understanding the Correct Answer:**
The correct answer should provide evidence that lawmakers equate the harm caused by theft and bribery. This could be achieved by demonstrating instances where similar harm levels lead to identical penalties or by highlighting the lawmakers' specific reasoning behind their decision.
**Applying the Learning:**
I will now carefully analyze each option, focusing on its direct relevance to the equivalence of harm between theft and bribery as perceived by the lawmakers in the context of the argument.
