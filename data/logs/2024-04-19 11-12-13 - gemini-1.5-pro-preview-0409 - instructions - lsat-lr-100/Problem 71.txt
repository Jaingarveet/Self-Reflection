Context: Curator: Our museum displays only twentieth-century works, which are either on loan from private collectors or in the museum's permanent collection. Prints of all of the latter works are available in the museum store. The museum store also sells prints of some works that are not part of the museum's permanent collection, such as Hopper's Nighthawks.

## Assistant 2:
## Reflection on Previous Attempt:
**Error Analysis:**
In my previous attempt, I incorrectly chose option A. This was due to a misinterpretation of the curator's statement. I focused on the fact that the museum store sells prints of all works in the permanent collection and some works not in the collection, leading me to believe all prints were of displayed works. 
**Understanding the Problem:**
The key to solving this problem lies in understanding the relationship between the museum's displayed works, its permanent collection, and the prints sold in the store. We need to identify a statement that MUST be true based on the given information.
**Insights from the Correct Answer (C):**
Option C correctly states: "There are prints in the museum store of every work that is displayed in the museum and not on loan from a private collector." This is true because:
* The museum displays only 20th-century works.
* These works are either on loan or part of the permanent collection.
* Prints of ALL works in the permanent collection are available in the store.
Therefore, any displayed work NOT on loan MUST be part of the permanent collection and have a print available in the store.
**Applying the Insights:**
Using this understanding, let's analyze the current question.
