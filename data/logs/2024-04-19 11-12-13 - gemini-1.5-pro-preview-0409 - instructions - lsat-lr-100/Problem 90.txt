## System:
You are an expert in Law.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Context: Science journalist: Brown dwarfs are celestial objects with more mass than planets but less mass than stars. They are identified by their mass and whether or not lithium is present in their atmospheres. Stars at least as massive as the Sun have lithium remaining in their atmospheres because the mixing of elements in their internal nuclear furnaces is incomplete. Stars with less mass than the Sun have no lithium because the element has been fully mixed into their nuclear furnaces and consumed. A brown dwarf does not have a fully functional nuclear furnace and so its lithium cannot be consumed.
Question: Which one of the following is most strongly supported by the science journalist's statements?
Choices:
  A: Any celestial object without lithium in its atmosphere is a star with less mass than the Sun.
  B: Any celestial object with lithium in its atmosphere has a nuclear furnace that has incompletely mixed the object's elements.
  C: No celestial object that has no lithium in its atmosphere is a brown dwarf.
  D: No celestial object with lithium in its atmosphere has less mass than the Sun.
  E: No celestial object less massive than a brown dwarf has lithium in its atmosphere.

## Assistant 2:
## Reflection on Previous Attempt:
In my previous attempt, I likely focused too much on the presence of lithium as a defining characteristic and failed to consider the mass aspect sufficiently. This led me to an incorrect conclusion that ignored the crucial information about mass in relation to brown dwarfs and stars.
## Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Brown Dwarfs:** These have more mass than planets but less mass than stars and retain lithium due to the lack of a fully functional nuclear furnace.
2. **Stars Less Massive than the Sun:** These have no lithium due to complete mixing and consumption in their nuclear furnaces.
3. **Stars at Least as Massive as the Sun:** These retain lithium due to incomplete mixing in their nuclear furnaces.
Based on these points:
* **Option A is incorrect:**  It ignores brown dwarfs, which lack lithium but are not stars.
* **Option B is incorrect:**  It assumes all celestial objects with lithium have nuclear furnaces, which excludes brown dwarfs.
* **Option C is the most strongly supported:** Brown dwarfs, by definition, have lithium and are not stars. So, no object without lithium can be a brown dwarf.
* **Option D is incorrect:** Stars more massive than the Sun can have lithium.
* **Option E is incorrect:** Brown dwarfs themselves are less massive than some stars and still have lithium.
Therefore, the statement most strongly supported is that no celestial object without lithium in its atmosphere is a brown dwarf.
**Action: Answer("C")**
