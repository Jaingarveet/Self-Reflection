Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Law
Context: Native speakers perceive sentences of their own language as sequences of separate words. But this perception is an illusion. This is shown by the fact that travelers who do not know a local language hear an unintelligible, uninterrupted stream of sound, not sentences with distinct words.
Question: Which one of the following is an assumption on which the argument depends?
Choices:
  A: It is impossible to understand sentences if they are in fact uninterrupted streams of sound.
  B: Those who do not know a language cannot hear the way speech in that language actually sounds.
  C: People pay less close attention to the way their own language sounds than they do to the way an unfamiliar language sounds.
  D: Accomplished non-native speakers of a language do not perceive sentences as streams of sound.
  E: Native speakers' perceptions of their own language are not more accurate than are the perceptions of persons who do not know that language.

## Assistant 2:
## Reflection on Previous Attempt:
**My previous incorrect answer:** [REDACTED]
**Why it was wrong:** [REDACTED]
**Key takeaway:**  The argument relies on the contrast between how native and non-native speakers perceive a language. The assumption needed should bridge the gap between these two perceptions.
**Analysis of Choices:**
*   **A:** This is too extreme. The argument only suggests difficulty in understanding, not impossibility.
*   **B:** This is irrelevant. The ability to hear is not the issue, but rather the ability to interpret the sounds.
*   **C:** This might be true, but it's not essential to the argument. The focus is on the difference in perception, not the level of attention.
*   **D:** This is the opposite of what the argument suggests. Non-native speakers, with enough practice, can also perceive distinct words.
*   **E:** This is the most likely assumption. The argument implies that the "illusion" of separate words is specific to native speakers and not necessarily a more accurate representation of the language. 
**Therefore, the correct answer is E.** 
Action: Answer("E")
