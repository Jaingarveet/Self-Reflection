## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

## Assistant 2:
Thought:
To solve this problem, I need to expand the equation $(a x+2)(b x+7)$ and compare it with $15 x^{2}+c x+14$.
Expanding the equation, I get $a b x^{2}+7 a x+2 b x+14$.
Comparing the coefficients of $x^{2}$ on both sides, I get $a b=15$.
Comparing the coefficients of $x$ on both sides, I get $7 a+2 b=c$.
I know that $a+b=8$.
I can solve for $a$ in terms of $b$ or vice versa using this equation.
Let's solve for $a$: $a=8-b$.
Substituting this into the equation $7 a+2 b=c$, I get $7(8-b)+2 b=c$.
Simplifying this equation, I get $c=56-5 b$.
Since $a b=15$, I can substitute $a=8-b$ into this equation to get $(8-b) b=15$.
Expanding this equation, I get $b^{2}-8 b+15=0$.
Factoring this equation, I get $(b-3)(b-5)=0$.
This means that $b$ can be either $3$ or $5$.
If $b=3$, then $a=5$ and $c=56-5 \times 3=31$.
If $b=5$, then $a=3$ and $c=56-5 \times 5=21$.
Therefore, the two possible values for $c$ are $31$ and $21$.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
