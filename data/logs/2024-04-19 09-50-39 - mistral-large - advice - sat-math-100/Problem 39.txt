## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:

## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math

Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that for a system of linear equations to have no solution, the slopes must be equal, but the lines must not be the same.
 - Understand the concept of parallel lines and their slopes.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
To find the value of $a$ for which the system has no solution, we need to find the value of $a$ that makes the slopes of the two lines equal, but the lines not the same.
The slope of the first line is $-3$, and the slope of the second line is $-\frac{a}{2}$.
For the slopes to be equal, we need $-3 = -\frac{a}{2}$.
Solving for $a$, we get $a = 6$.
However, we need to check if the lines are the same or not.
If we substitute $a = 6$ into the second equation, we get $6x + 2y = 4$.
This is not the same as the first equation, so the lines are parallel and have no solution.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
