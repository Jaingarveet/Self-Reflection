# Model: mistral-large | Agent: advice | Exam: sat-math-100 | Problem 60 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: Mr. Kohl has a beaker containing $n$ milliliters of solution to distribute to the students in his chemistry class. If he gives each student 3 milliliters of solution, he will have 5 milliliters left over. In order to give each student 4 milliliters of solution, he will need an additional 21 milliliters. How many students are in the class?
Choices:
  A: 16
  B: 21
  C: 23
  D: 26
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.

Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember to simplify equations correctly and solve for the correct variable.
 - Be aware of common algebraic errors such as equation setup errors and simplification errors.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Let's denote the number of students in the class as x.
According to the problem, Mr. Kohl has n milliliters of solution.
When he gives each student 3 milliliters of solution, he has 5 milliliters left over. So, we can write the equation:
n = 3x + 5
When he gives each student 4 milliliters of solution, he needs an additional 21 milliliters. So, we can write the equation:
n + 21 = 4x
Now, we have a system of two equations with two variables. We can solve this system by substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution.
From the first equation, we can express n as:
n = 3x + 5
Now, substitute this expression for n in the second equation:
3x + 5 + 21 = 4x
Simplify the equation:
26 = x
So, there are 26 students in the class.
Action: Answer("D")

Reflection:
Previously, I made a mistake in simplifying the equation. I incorrectly wrote 21 = x instead of 26 = x. This time, I made sure to simplify the equation correctly and double-checked my calculations. I also followed the advice to decompose the problem into multiple simple steps and think through each step carefully.
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
