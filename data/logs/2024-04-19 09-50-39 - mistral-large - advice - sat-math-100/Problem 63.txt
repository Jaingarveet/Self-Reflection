Question: A television with a price of $\$ 300$ is to be purchased with an initial payment of $\$ 60$ and weekly payments of $\$ 30$. Which of the following equations can be used to find the number of weekly payments, $w$, required to complete the purchase, assuming there are no taxes or fees?
Choices:
  A: $300=30 w-60$
  B: $300=30 w$
  C: $300=30 w+60$
  D: $300=60 w-30$

## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The initial payment of $60 is subtracted from the total price of $300, leaving $240 to be paid in weekly installments.
The weekly payment is $30, so we need to find the number of weeks, w, required to pay off the remaining $240.
The equation should represent the remaining balance after the initial payment, which is $240, and the weekly payments of $30 multiplied by the number of weeks, w.
The correct equation is $240 = 30w.
However, this is not one of the available choices.
I need to adjust the equation to match one of the available choices.
The initial payment of $60 was subtracted from the total price, so I need to subtract $60 from both sides of the equation to get $300 = 30w + 60.
This is still not one of the available choices.
I need to subtract $60 from both sides of the equation again to get $240 = 30w.
This is equivalent to the equation $300 = 30w + 60 - 60, which simplifies to $300 = 30w.
Action: Answer("B")
