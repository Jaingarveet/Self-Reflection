## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I focused too much on the assumption about commercial viability and societal benefit, and not enough on the core logical flaw in the argument - that it assumes an action is unlikely to produce an outcome unless it is motivated by a desire to produce that outcome. While B points out a questionable assumption, D more directly addresses the key logical gap.
Error Keywords:
 - Logical flaw 
 - Causal reasoning error
 - Confusing motivations and outcomes
 - Overlooking unintended consequences
Solution:
The argument concludes that technological innovation rarely serves society's interests because those responsible for it are motivated by personal gain rather than societal benefit. The key flaw is that it assumes that because the innovators are not primarily motivated by benefiting society, their innovations are unlikely to benefit society. 
However, as D points out, this assumes that an action is unlikely to produce an outcome unless the actor desires that outcome. In reality, actions can have unintended positive consequences regardless of the actor's motivations. An innovator primarily seeking profit could still end up creating something that greatly benefits society. The argument fails to consider this possibility.
Instructions:
1. Identify the conclusion of the argument.
2. Identify the premises and assumptions the conclusion is based on. 
3. For each answer choice, determine if it points out a genuine flaw in the reasoning.
4. Pay special attention to gaps between the motivations behind actions and the outcomes of those actions.
5. Select the answer choice that best identifies the key logical flaw in the argument.
Advice:
 - Always look for gaps or invalid leaps in the logical reasoning.
 - Be careful not to get distracted by tangential assumptions and focus on the core logic.
 - Remember that people's motivations and the actual outcomes of their actions can often diverge.
 - Consider unintended consequences and side effects, not just intended results.
 - The correct answer will often pinpoint the central flaw that undermines the whole argument.
