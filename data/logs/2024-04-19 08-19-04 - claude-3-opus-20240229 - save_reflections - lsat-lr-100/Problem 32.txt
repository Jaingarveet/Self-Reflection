## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that the editorial was claiming it is always inconsistent to support a goal but oppose a specific means of achieving that goal. However, the editorial is actually assuming the opposite - that a consistent policy would not simultaneously claim a goal is worthy but should not be pursued.
Error Keywords:
- Misinterpreting the main assumption
- Confusing consistency and inconsistency
- Misunderstanding the relationship between goals and actions
Solution:
1. The editorial states that the political party's policy is inconsistent because:
   a) They say increasing education spending is a worthy goal.
   b) They also say the government should not increase education spending.
2. The editorial assumes that a consistent policy would not simultaneously claim a goal is worthy but should not be pursued.
3. Answer choice D states: "A consistent political policy does not hold that an action that comprises a worthy goal should not be performed." This matches the editorial's underlying assumption.
4. The other answer choices do not accurately capture the assumption the editorial relies on.
5. Therefore, choice D is the correct answer.
Instructions:
1. Carefully read the argument and identify the main conclusion.
2. Look for the key assumption that the argument relies on to reach its conclusion.
3. Rephrase the assumption in your own words to ensure you understand it.
4. Evaluate each answer choice to see if it matches the assumption you identified.
5. Select the answer choice that best represents the argument's critical assumption.
6. Double-check that your selected answer is necessary for the argument's conclusion to hold.
Advice:
- Take your time to fully understand the argument before trying to identify the assumption.
- Focus on what the argument must assume to be true, not just what it explicitly states.
- Be careful not to bring in outside assumptions or interpret the argument too broadly.
- Eliminate answer choices that are irrelevant, extreme, or contrary to the argument's reasoning.
- Select the answer that is most integral to the logic of the argument as written.
