Context: The painter Roy Lichtenstein helped to define pop art—the movement that incorporated commonplace objects and commercial-art techniques into paintings— by paraphrasing the style of comic books in his work. His merger of a popular genre with the forms and intentions of fine art generated a complex result: while poking fun at the pretensions of the art world, Lichtenstein's work also managed to convey a seriousness of theme that enabled it to transcend mere parody. That Lichtenstein's images were fine art was at first difficult to see, because, with their word balloons and highly stylized figures, they looked like nothing more than the comic book panels from which they were copied. Standard art history holds that pop art emerged as an impersonal alternative to the histrionics of abstract expressionism, a movement in which painters conveyed their private attitudes and emotions using nonrepresentational techniques. The truth is that by the time pop art first appeared in the early 1960s, abstract expressionism had already lost much of its force. Pop art painters weren't quarreling with the powerful early abstract expressionist work of the late 1940s but with a second generation of abstract expressionists whose work seemed airy, high-minded, and overly lyrical. Pop art paintings were full of simple black lines and large areas of primary color. Lichtenstein's work was part of a general rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism, rather than an aloof attempt to ignore it. But if rebellion against previous art by means of the careful imitation of a popular genre were all that characterized Lichtenstein's work, it would possess only the reflective power that parodies have in relation to their subjects. Beneath its cartoonish methods, his work displayed an impulse toward realism, an urge to say that what was missing from contemporary painting was the depiction of contemporary life. The stilted romances and war stories portrayed in the comic books on which he based his canvases, the stylized automobiles, hot dogs, and table lamps that appeared in his pictures, were reflections of the culture Lichtenstein inhabited. But, in contrast to some pop art, Lichtenstein's work exuded not a jaded cynicism about consumer culture, but a kind of deliberate naivete, intended as a response to the excess of sophistication he observed not only in the later abstract expressionists but in some other pop artists. With the comics— typically the domain of youth and innocence—as his reference point, a nostalgia fills his paintings that gives them, for all their surface bravado, an inner sweetness. His persistent use of comic-art conventions demonstrates a faith in reconciliation, not only between cartoons and fine art, but between parody and true feeling.
Question: Based on the passage, which one of the following would be an example of pop art that is most in keeping with the spirit of Lichtenstein's work?
Choices:
  A: a painting that uses realistic techniques to represent several simple objects arranged on a table
  B: a painting that parodies human figures by depicting them as stick figures
  C: a painting that conveys its creator's inner turmoil through the use of bold lines and primary colors
  D: a painting that employs vague shapes and images to make a statement about consumer culture
  E: a painting that depicts products as they appear in magazine advertisements to comment on society's values

Action: Answer(E)

The correct answer is E: A painting that depicts products as they appear in magazine advertisements to comment on society's values.

Lichtenstein's work was characterized by its use of comic book imagery and stylized representations of everyday objects, with a focus on reconciling parody and true feeling. A painting that depicts products as they appear in magazine advertisements to comment on society's values aligns with Lichtenstein's style and themes, as it uses a popular genre (advertising) to make a commentary on contemporary life.

The other options do not align as closely with Lichtenstein's style and themes:

A: A painting that uses realistic techniques to represent several simple objects arranged on a table does not have the same playful, cartoonish quality that Lichtenstein's work is known for.

B: A painting that parodies human figures by depicting them as stick figures could be considered pop art, but it does not share the same focus on realism and naivete that characterizes Lichtenstein's work.

C: A painting that conveys its creator's inner turmoil through the use of bold lines and primary colors sounds more like abstract expressionism, which Lichtenstein's work was reacting against.

D: A painting that employs vague shapes and images to make a statement about consumer culture could be considered pop art, but it does not have the same focus on reconciling parody and true feeling that Lichtenstein's work does.
