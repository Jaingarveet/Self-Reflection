Context: At a concert, exactly eight compositions—F, H, L, O, P, R, S, and T—are to be performed exactly once each, consecutively and one composition at a time. The order of their performance must satisfy the following conditions: T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R. At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F. O is performed either first or fifth. The eighth composition performed is either L or H. P is performed at some time before S. At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
Question: Which one of the following lists the compositions in an order in which they could be performed during the concert, from first through eighth?
Choices:
  A: L, P, S, R, O, T, F, H
  B: O, T, P, F, S, H, R, L

## Assistant 2:
Thought:
We know the following:
* T is before F or after R.
* O is first or fifth.
* The eighth is L or H.
* P is before S.
* At least two compositions are between F and R.
Let's analyze the options:
* **A: L, P, S, R, O, T, F, H**: This violates the rule that T is before F or after R.
* **B: O, T, P, F, S, H, R, L**: This violates the rule that there must be at least two compositions between F and R.
* **C: P, T, F, S, L, R, O, H**: This violates the rule that O is first or fifth.
* **D: P, T, F, S, O, R, L, H**: This option satisfies all the given conditions.
* **E: T, F, P, R, O, L, S, H**: This violates the rule that there must be at least two compositions between F and R. 
Action: Answer("D")
