Topic: Law
Context: A maintenance company that takes service requests from three clients—Image, Solide, and Truvest—plans to set targets for its average service response times. Service targets will be set at 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day. Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail. The six targets are set according to the following conditions: None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
Question: If none of the clients has a website target of 2 days, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Image's website target is shorter than Solide's.
  B: Solide's website target is shorter than Image's.
  C: Solide's voicemail target is shorter than Truvest's.
  D: Truvest's website target is shorter than Image's.
  E: Truvest's voicemail target is shorter than Solide's.

## Assistant 2:
Thought:
*  None of the clients have a 2-day website target, so all website targets are either 1 or 3 days.
*  Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's, meaning Solide must have a 1-day website target and Truvest a 3-day one.
*  Image's voicemail target is shorter than the others, so it must be 1 day. 
*  No website target can be longer than the voicemail target for the same client, so Image's website target must also be 1 day.
Analysis:
*  Option A: This is possible as both Image and Solide could have 1-day website targets.
*  Option B: This is impossible as we know Solide's website target (1 day) must be shorter than Truvest's (3 days).
*  Option C: This is impossible as Image's voicemail target must be the shortest (1 day).
*  Option D: This is impossible as Truvest's website target must be the longest (3 days).
*  Option E: This is impossible as Image's voicemail target must be the shortest (1 day). 
Action: Answer("A")
