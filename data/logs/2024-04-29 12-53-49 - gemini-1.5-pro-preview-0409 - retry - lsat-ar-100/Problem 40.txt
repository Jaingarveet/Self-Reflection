Context: A shopping center has exactly seven spaces—space 1 through space 7—arranged in a straight row. Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
Question: If the shoe store is in space 2, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: The optometrist is in space 5.
  B: The pharmacy is in space 1.
  C: A restaurant is in space 3.

## Assistant 2:
Thought:
We know the shoe store is in space 2. Let's analyze each option:
* A: If the optometrist is in space 5, the pharmacy could be in space 1 (satisfying the constraint of being at one end and next to the optometrist). This is a possibility. 
* B: If the pharmacy is in space 1, the optometrist or veterinarian must be in space 2, which is occupied by the shoe store. This is not possible.
* C: A restaurant in space 3 would mean the other restaurant must be in space 7 (to have at least two businesses between them). This leaves space 1 for the pharmacy, satisfying the constraint. This is a possibility.
* D: If the toy store is in space 6, the veterinarian cannot be in space 7 due to the constraint. This would force the pharmacy to be in space 7 (as it must be at one end), leaving no suitable space for the veterinarian next to the pharmacy. This is not possible.
* E: If the veterinarian is in space 4, the pharmacy could be in space 1 (satisfying the constraint of being at one end and next to the veterinarian). This is a possibility. 
Action: Answer("A")
