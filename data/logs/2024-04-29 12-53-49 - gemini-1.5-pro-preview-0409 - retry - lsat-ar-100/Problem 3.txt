Context: An administrator must assign parking spaces to six new employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young. Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.

## Assistant 2:
Thought:
*   Robertson is in #3, so Young must be in #4, #5, or #6 (Robertson must have a higher number than Young).
*   This leaves spaces #1, #2, and one of #4, #5, or #6 for Souza, Togowa, Xu, and Vaughn.
*   We know Xu must have a higher number than Souza, and Young must have a higher number than Togowa, but these constraints still leave multiple possibilities for spaces #1, #2, and #4/5/6. 
*   Therefore, none of the options A through E are *must be true*.
