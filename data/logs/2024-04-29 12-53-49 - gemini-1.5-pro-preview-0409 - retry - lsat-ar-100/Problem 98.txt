## Assistant 2:
Thought:
*  J must be shown in the evening.
*  K cannot be shown in the morning, so it must be shown in the afternoon or evening.
*  L must be shown between K and M.
Analysis of Choices:
*  A: If K is after J, then both are in the evening, leaving no room for L and M. So, this is not possible.
*  B: If J is in the evening, L could be in the afternoon before it. This is possible.
*  C:  This is possible as both J and P are in the evening.
*  D:  M has to be after L, and L has to be after K. So, N and O being after M pushes everything to the evening, leaving no room for J in the morning. This is not possible.
*  E: Similar to D, this option pushes everything to the evening, which is not possible.
Action: Answer("C")
