## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Julio on Thursday afternoon means Olivia must be on Friday (either AM or PM). 
This leaves Kevin and Rebecca to be on Wednesday or Thursday. 
Since Nessa must be in the afternoon, and Thursday afternoon is taken, she must be on Wednesday afternoon.
This leaves only Lan's schedule undetermined.
