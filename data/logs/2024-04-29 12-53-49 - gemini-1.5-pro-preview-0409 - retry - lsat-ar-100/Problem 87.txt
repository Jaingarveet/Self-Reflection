## Assistant 2:
Thought:
We need to find the minimum number of works the organizer must select while satisfying all conditions.
*   **French works limit:** We can have a maximum of 4 French works, so focusing on minimizing French works might help us reach the minimum overall selection.
*   **Novels limit:** We need at least 3 but no more than 4 novels. 
*   **French/Russian novel balance:** We need at least as many French novels as Russian novels.
*   **Plays condition:**  This condition is only relevant if we consider both French plays, which would push us towards the maximum limit of French works (4). 
Let's try to minimize French works while satisfying other conditions:
*   **1 French novel:** This satisfies the minimum French novel requirement.
*   **2 Russian novels:** This satisfies the minimum novel requirement (3 total) and keeps the number of French novels at least equal to Russian novels.
*   **No French plays:**  This keeps the number of French works low and avoids triggering the Russian play restriction.
This combination gives us 1 French novel + 2 Russian novels = 3 works. We still need at least 2 more to reach the minimum of 5. We can add:
*   **1 Russian play:** This doesn't affect any conditions.
*   **1 French play or 1 Russian novel:**  Either option works without violating any conditions.
Therefore, the organizer must select at least one French novel and one Russian play to satisfy all conditions while minimizing the total number of works. 
Action: Answer("B")
