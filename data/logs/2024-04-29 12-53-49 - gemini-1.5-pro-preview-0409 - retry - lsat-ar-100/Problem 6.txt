Context: For the school paper, five students—Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, Megregian, and O'Neill—each review one or more of exactly three plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation, but do not review any other plays. The following conditions must apply: Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.

Choices:
  A: Jiang reviews more of the plays than Lopez does.
  B: Megregian reviews more of the plays than Jiang does.
  C: Megregian reviews more of the plays than O'Neill does.

## Assistant 2:
Thought:
We know the following:
*   Kramer and Lopez review fewer plays than Megregian.
*   Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
*   Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
*   Exactly two students review the same play(s) as each other.
From this, we can deduce:
*   Jiang reviews a different set of plays than Kramer, Lopez, and Megregian.
*   Since only two students have the same reviews, and Kramer & O'Neill share Tamerlane, their third reviewed play must be different.
Therefore, we cannot definitively say anything about the number of plays reviewed by Jiang compared to others. However, we know Megregian reviews more plays than both Kramer and Lopez. 
Action: Answer("B") 
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
