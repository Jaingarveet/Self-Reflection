Topic: Law
Context: A maintenance company that takes service requests from three clients—Image, Solide, and Truvest—plans to set targets for its average service response times. Service targets will be set at 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day. Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail. The six targets are set according to the following conditions: None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
Question: Which one of the following targets CANNOT be set for more than one of the clients?
Choices:
  A: a 1-day website target
  B: a 2-day voicemail target
  C: a 2-day website target
  D: a 3-day voicemail target
  E: a 3-day website target

We know the following:
*   No client can have a longer website target than their voicemail target.
*   Image's voicemail target must be the shortest.
*   Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
Let's analyze each option:
*   **A 1-day website target:** This could potentially be assigned to multiple clients as long as their voicemail target is also 1 day. 
*   **A 2-day voicemail target:** This cannot be assigned to Image (they need the shortest voicemail target). It's possible for both Solide and Truvest to have this target if their website targets are also 2 days or 1 day. 
*   **A 2-day website target:** If a client has a 2-day website target, their voicemail target must be either 2 days or 1 day.  Image cannot have this target as their voicemail target needs to be the shortest. However, both Solide and Truvest could potentially have this target.
*   **A 3-day voicemail target:** This could only be assigned to either Solide or Truvest, as Image needs the shortest voicemail target.  The client with this voicemail target would also need a website target of 3 days.
*   **A 3-day website target:** Similar to the previous option, this could only be assigned to either Solide or Truvest.  The client with this website target would also need a voicemail target of 3 days.
Therefore, both a 3-day voicemail target and a 3-day website target can only be assigned to one client each. We need to determine which one is impossible to assign to more than one client based on the given conditions.
Considering Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's, it's impossible for both of them to have a 3-day website target (as that would be the longest). However, they could both potentially have a 3-day voicemail target as long as one of them has a 2-day website target.
