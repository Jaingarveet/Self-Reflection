Context: Of the eight students—George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert—in a seminar, exactly six will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.

## Assistant 2:
Thought:
*  George must present on Tuesday, so he cannot present on Monday or Wednesday. This eliminates options A, B, and E.
*  Neither Olivia nor Robert can give afternoon reports, so they must present in the morning if they present at all. This leaves us with options C and D.
*  If Nina presents, then Helen and Irving must present the next day. Since Nina cannot present on Wednesday (due to the condition), the only possibility for option C is if Nina presents on Monday. However, this would require both Helen and Irving to present on Tuesday, which is impossible as George is already presenting on Tuesday. 
*  Therefore, option D is the only remaining possibility. 
Action: Answer("D") 
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
