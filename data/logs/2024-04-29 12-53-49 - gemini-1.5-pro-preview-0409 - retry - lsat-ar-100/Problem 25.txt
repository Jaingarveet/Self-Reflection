## User 2:
Topic: Law
Context: An editor will edit seven articles, one at a time. Three of the articles—G, H, and J—cover finance; three other articles—Q, R, and S—cover nutrition; and the remaining article, Y, covers wildlife. The order in which the articles are edited is subject to the following conditions: Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other. S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third. S must be earlier than Y. J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
Question: If G is fourth, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: H is fifth.
  B: J is first.
  C: Q is second.
  D: S is fifth

## Assistant 2:
Thought:
*  G is fourth, so the third and fifth articles cannot be finance-related (H or J).
*  J must be before G, so J must be first, second, or third.
*  Since Q being third is the only way S can be before Q, and S must be before Y, then Q cannot be second (eliminating C).
*  If J is first or second, then H cannot be fifth (eliminating A).
*  If J is third, then the second article must be nutrition-related (Q or R). This would force S and Y to be fifth and sixth, making D impossible. 
*  Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that Y is sixth.
Action: Answer("E")
