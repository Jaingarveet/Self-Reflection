Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to decide to take testosterone [title] Ask yourself if you want to improve your sexual function. [step] If you have a low sex drive, or if your sex drive has declined with age, you might want to give it a boost with some extra testosterone. In addition to increased libido, testosterone supplements can help you avoid unwanted erections and maintain erections when aroused.
Choices:
  A: A healthy body needs more testosterone in order to maintain erections. Some women who are female or older do not maintain regular erections until all their testosterone has been expended, so other people may need testosterone anyway.
  B: [substeps] Be honest with yourself if you want to lower your testosterone. Taking testosterone supplements can lead to a reduction in your sex drive.
  C: [title] Distinguish between testosterone and regular erections. [step] Studies have shown that women with low testosterone are able to have slightly lower levels of sexual function after sex, which is because the hormone changes are carried out through pleasure.
  D: [title] Ask yourself if you want a healthier body. [step] Men who suffer from low testosterone may experience increased body fat and larger breasts.

Thought:
The original text is discussing the benefits of taking testosterone supplements for improving sexual function, specifically for men who have a low sex drive or have experienced a decline in sex drive with age.

Answer choice A is incorrect because it suggests that all people, including women, need testosterone to maintain erections, which is not relevant to the topic of the original text.

Answer choice B is incorrect because it contradicts the information in the original text by suggesting that taking testosterone supplements can lead to a reduction in sex drive.

Answer choice C is incorrect because it discusses the relationship between testosterone and sexual function in women, which is not relevant to the topic of the original text.

Answer choice D is the most relevant to the topic and context of the original text, as it discusses the potential benefits of taking testosterone supplements for men who suffer from low testosterone levels, which can lead to increased body fat and larger breasts.
