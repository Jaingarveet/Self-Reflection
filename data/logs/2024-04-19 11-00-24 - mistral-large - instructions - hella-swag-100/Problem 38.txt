The main action in the text is a man putting seasonings into a pan and swishing it around. This suggests that he is cooking something.
The context of the text is a kitchen, and the man is using a pan and seasonings, which are typically used for cooking.
Answer choice A is unrelated to the text because it mentions cookies in a pan, which is not mentioned in the text.
Answer choice C is unrelated to the text because it mentions an aerobic video, which is not related to cooking.
Answer choice D is related to the text because it mentions pasta and eggs, which are both food items that could be cooked in a pan.
Answer choice B is also related to the text because it mentions a cooking video, which is relevant to the context of the text.
