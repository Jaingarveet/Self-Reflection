## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:** My focus on the immediate context of sexual function led me to neglect the broader health implications of testosterone. I failed to consider that the passage might expand beyond sexual benefits to encompass other aspects of health.
**Error Keywords:**
*   Limited context consideration
*   Narrow focus
*   Ignoring broader implications
**Step-by-Step Solution:**
1.  **Analyze the passage:** The passage discusses the positive effects of testosterone on sexual function in men.
2.  **Consider potential continuations:** The passage could continue by:
    *   Exploring downsides of testosterone (Option B)
    *   Discussing other benefits of testosterone (Option D)
    *   Providing inaccurate or irrelevant information (Options A and C)
3.  **Evaluate options:**
    *   Option B is plausible but limited in scope.
    *   Option D broadens the discussion to overall health, aligning with the general theme of testosterone's impact on men's well-being.
    *   Options A and C are factually incorrect and irrelevant.
4.  **Choose the best option:** Option D provides the most logical and informative continuation.
