## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:** I focused too much on the literal next step in making lemonade and neglected to consider the broader context of the prompt, which seems to describe a scene in a movie or video.
**Error Keywords:**
*   Context misinterpretation 
*   Assuming real-world scenario
*   Neglecting narrative possibility 
**Step-by-Step Solution:**
1. **Analyze the prompt:** The text describes a visual scene with specific actions (pouring, stirring).
2. **Consider the options:** Options B, C, and D describe actions related to making lemonade, while option A describes a camera movement.
3. **Choose the most fitting option:** Given the visual nature of the prompt, option A, which describes a camera panning over the glasses, aligns best with the context.
