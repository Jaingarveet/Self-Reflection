## Assistant 2:
I understand. I will use my self-reflection to answer this question correctly.
**Self-reflection:**
* **Error:** I previously selected the incorrect answer, which was "A: Irving, Lenore, and Nina."
* **Reason for error:** I did not consider the condition that if Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
* **Correct answer:** The correct answer is "D: Robert, George, and Irving."
**Solution:**
* **Monday:**
    * Since Kyle gives the afternoon report on Tuesday, he cannot give a report on Monday.
    * Since neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report, they cannot give a report on Monday.
    * Therefore, the only possible students who can give the morning report on Monday are George, Helen, Irving, Lenore, and Nina.
* **Tuesday:**
    * Since Kyle gives the afternoon report on Tuesday, the morning report must be given by one of the remaining students: George, Helen, Irving, Lenore, and Nina.
    * Since George can only give a report on Tuesday, he must give the morning report on Tuesday.
    * Since Nina's report cannot be followed by reports from both Helen and Irving, Nina cannot give the morning report on Tuesday.
    * Therefore, the only possible students who can give the morning report on Tuesday are Helen, Irving, Lenore, and Robert.
* **Wednesday:**
    * Since Helen gives the afternoon report on Wednesday, the morning report must be given by one of the remaining students: Irving, Lenore, Nina, and Robert.
    * Since Nina's report cannot be followed by reports from both Helen and Irving, and since Helen has already given a report on Tuesday, Nina cannot give the morning report on Wednesday.
    * Therefore, the only possible students who can give the morning report on Wednesday are Irving, Lenore, and Robert.
**Conclusion:**
The only possible list of students who give the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, is "D: Robert, George, and Irving."
**Action:** Answer("D")
