Context: A shopping center has exactly seven spaces—space 1 through space 7—arranged in a straight row. Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.

## Assistant 2:
Self-reflection:
In my previous attempt, I incorrectly identified the businesses immediately on either side of the optometrist and shoe store as the pharmacy and a restaurant. This was a constraint violation, as the pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
To avoid this error, I will carefully consider the constraints and the given information to ensure that the placement of businesses is logically consistent.
Here's my step-by-step analysis:
1. **Pharmacy and Restaurant Placement:**
   - The pharmacy must be at one end of the row, and one of the restaurants must be at the other end.
   - This leaves five spaces remaining for the other businesses.
2. **Restaurant Separation:**
   - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
   - This means that the restaurants cannot be placed in adjacent spaces.
3. **Pharmacy Adjacency:**
   - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
4. **Toy Store and Veterinarian:**
   - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
Now, let's consider the given information:
- The optometrist is next to the shoe store.
Based on this information and the constraints, we can deduce the following:
- The pharmacy cannot be next to the optometrist, as this would violate the restaurant separation constraint.
- Therefore, the pharmacy must be at the opposite end of the row from the optometrist and shoe store.
- This leaves the veterinarian as the only possible business to be next to the pharmacy.
- Since the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, it must be placed next to the shoe store.
- This leaves the two restaurants to be placed in the remaining three spaces, satisfying the restaurant separation constraint.
Therefore, the businesses immediately on either side of the optometrist and shoe store must be:
**Action: Answer("E")**
- A restaurant (next to the optometrist)
- The veterinarian (next to the shoe store)
