## Assistant 2:
## Self-Reflection on Previous Incorrect Answer:
**Error:** I incorrectly identified **C: Parra works in Zone 3** as the correct answer.
**Reasoning:** I made the mistake of assuming that since Parra and Quinn work in the same zone, and there are more representatives in Zone 3 than Zone 2, Parra must be in Zone 3. However, I **failed to consider the condition that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.** This crucial detail invalidates my initial assumption.
**Corrected Approach:**
1. **Analyze the given conditions:**
    - Parra and Quinn work in the same zone.
    - Stuckey and Udall work in the same zone.
    - Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
    - Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
    - There are more representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
2. **Consider the information about Mahr and Stuckey:**
    - Mahr and Stuckey work in the same zone.
3. **Evaluate the answer choices:**
    - **A: Kim works in Zone 2:** This is possible. Kim could be in Zone 2 with either Tiao or Udall.
    - **B: Mahr works in Zone 1:** This is possible. Mahr could be in Zone 1 with Parra.
    - **C: Parra works in Zone 3:** This is **not possible** due to the condition that either Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1.
    - **D: Stuckey works in Zone 2:** This is possible. Stuckey could be in Zone 2 with Tiao.
    - **E: Tiao works in Zone 1:** This is possible. Tiao could be in Zone 1 with Mahr.
**Conclusion:**
Based on the analysis, **all options except C are possible** if Mahr and Stuckey work in the same zone.
**Action: Answer("E")**

Agent Answer: E
