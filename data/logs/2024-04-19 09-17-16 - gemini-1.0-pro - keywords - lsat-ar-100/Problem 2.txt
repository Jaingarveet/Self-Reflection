Context: A shopping center has exactly seven spaces—space 1 through space 7—arranged in a straight row. Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
Question: Which one of the following, if substituted for the constraint that the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, would have the same effect in determining the locations of the businesses?
Choices:
  A: A restaurant must be in either space 3, space 4, or space 5.
  B: A restaurant must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  C: Either the toy store or the veterinarian must be somewhere between the two restaurants.
  D: No more than two businesses can separate the pharmacy and the restaurant nearest it.
  E: The optometrist cannot be next to the shoe store.

## Assistant 2:
Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly because I did not fully understand the constraint that the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. I thought that this constraint meant that there must be at least two businesses between the two restaurants, but this is not the case. The constraint actually means that there must be at least two businesses between the two restaurants, not including the restaurants themselves.
To answer this question correctly, I need to find a constraint that would have the same effect as the original constraint. This means that the new constraint must also ensure that there are at least two businesses between the two restaurants.
Action: Answer("C")
