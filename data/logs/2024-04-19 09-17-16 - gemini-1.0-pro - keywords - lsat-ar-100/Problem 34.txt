## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
P is the only zoologist selected.
M is not selected (because P is the only zoologist selected and if M were selected, both P and R would have to be selected).
K is not selected (because M is not selected and K and M cannot both be selected).
F is selected (because F and K cannot both be selected and K is not selected).
G is not selected (because more than one botanist is selected (F is selected) and at most one zoologist is selected (P is selected)).
L is not selected (because exactly two chemists are selected (K is not selected and M is not selected) and F cannot be selected).
Action: Answer("E")
