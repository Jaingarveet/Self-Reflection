## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
I previously answered this question incorrectly because I did not consider all of the conditions.
I now understand that the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
This means that the first batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Monday, because the second batch of peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Monday.
This also means that the first batch of peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Friday, because the second batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Friday.
Therefore, the first batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Tuesday, and the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Thursday.
This means that the second batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Thursday, and the second batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Tuesday.
This means that the third batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Friday, and the third batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Wednesday.
This means that the first batch of sugar cookies must be made on Monday, the second batch of sugar cookies must be made on Thursday, and the third batch of sugar cookies must be made on Friday.
Therefore, the following statement must be true:
At least two batches of cookies are made on Thursday.
Action: Answer("D")
