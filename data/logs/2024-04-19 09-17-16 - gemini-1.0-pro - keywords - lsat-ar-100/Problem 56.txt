## Assistant 2:
Self-reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly because I did not consider all of the conditions. I only considered the condition that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. I did not consider the other conditions, such as the condition that either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
I have learned that it is important to consider all of the conditions when solving a problem. I will try to do this in the future.
