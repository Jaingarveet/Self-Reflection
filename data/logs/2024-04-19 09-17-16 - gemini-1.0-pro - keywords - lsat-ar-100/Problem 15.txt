Context: A shopping center has exactly seven spaces—space 1 through space 7—arranged in a straight row. Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.

## Assistant 2:
Self-reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly because I did not fully consider all of the constraints. I jumped to the conclusion that the pharmacy must be next to the veterinarian, but I did not consider the constraint that the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. This led me to an incorrect answer.
To avoid making the same mistake again, I will carefully consider all of the constraints before drawing any conclusions. I will also make sure to check my work carefully before submitting my answer.
Here is my step-by-step analysis of the question:
1. The shoe store is in space 4.
2. The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. This means that the pharmacy and one of the restaurants must be in either spaces 1 and 7 or spaces 2 and 6.
3. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. This means that the two restaurants cannot be in spaces 1 and 7 or spaces 2 and 6.
4. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. This means that the pharmacy must be in either space 1 or space 7.
5. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian. This means that the toy store cannot be in space 2 or space 6.
Based on these constraints, the following arrangements are possible:
Arrangement 1:
- Pharmacy in space 1
- Optometrist in space 2
- Toy store in space 3
- Shoe store in space 4
- Restaurant in space 5
- Veterinarian in space 6
- Restaurant in space 7
Arrangement 2:
- Restaurant in space 1
- Veterinarian in space 2
- Toy store in space 3
- Shoe store in space 4
- Restaurant in space 5
- Optometrist in space 6
- Pharmacy in space 7
In both of these arrangements, the shoe store is next to the toy store. Therefore, the answer to the question is **D: The shoe store is next to the toy store.**
## Result:
Agent Answer: None
Correct Answer: B
