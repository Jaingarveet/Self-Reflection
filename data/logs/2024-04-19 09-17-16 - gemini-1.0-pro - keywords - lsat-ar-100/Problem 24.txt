## System:
You are an expert in Law.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Topic: Law
Context: A government needs to assign new ambassadors to Venezuela, Yemen, and Zambia. The candidates for these ambassadorships are Jaramillo, Kayne, Landon, Novetzke, and Ong. One ambassador will be assigned to each country, and no ambassador will be assigned to more than one country. The assignment of the ambassadors must meet the following constraints: Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships. If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne. If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen. If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
Question: Which one of the following, if substituted for the constraint that if Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne, would have the same effect in determining the assignment of the ambassadors?
Choices:
  A: If Kayne is assigned to an ambassadorship, then so is Jaramillo.
  B: If Landon and Ong are both assigned to ambassadorships, then so is Novetzke.
  C: If Ong is not assigned to an ambassadorship, then Kayne is assigned to an ambassadorship.
  D: Jaramillo and Novetzke are not both assigned to ambassadorships.
  E: Novetzke and Ong are not both assigned to ambassadorships.

Error Keywords:
 - Logical reasoning error
 - Constraint analysis error
 - Contrapositive confusion
## Assistant 2:
Self-reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly because I did not fully understand the constraints and their implications. I also made a logical reasoning error by assuming that the contrapositive of the original constraint was equivalent to the original constraint.
To avoid making the same mistake again, I will carefully analyze the constraints and their implications, and I will be mindful of the difference between a constraint and its contrapositive.
I will also use the following steps to answer the question:
1. Identify the original constraint.
2. Identify the answer choice that is the contrapositive of the original constraint.
3. Determine whether the contrapositive of the original constraint has the same effect as the original constraint in determining the assignment of the ambassadors.
4. Select the answer choice that is the contrapositive of the original constraint.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
