## System:
You are an expert in Science.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")

Solution:
## Assistant 2:
Thought: To determine the boiling point, a student needs to observe the liquid and measure the temperature when bubbles of vapor rise from the liquid's surface. A heat source and a thermometer are necessary tools for this experiment. Safety goggles are also important to protect the student's eyes. A stopwatch is not required as the boiling point can be identified by the formation of vapor bubbles and a sudden rise in temperature.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
