Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and understand the problem.
2. Identify the parts of the axillary artery and their branches.
3. Identify the anastomoses between the arteries that provide collateral circulation to the upper limb.
4. Choose the option that correctly identifies the anastomoses that provide collateral circulation in case of obstruction of the axillary artery.
5. Double-check your reasoning and answer.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The second part of the axillary artery gives rise to the anterior and posterior circumflex humeral arteries, which anastomose with each other and with the subscapular artery and the suprascapular artery. The deep branch of the transverse cervical artery and the circumflex scapular artery are not involved in this anastomosis.
Action: Answer("B")
