The superior mesenteric vein and the inferior mesenteric vein drain into the portal vein, which then drains into the liver.
The right suprarenal vein drains into the inferior vena cava, but it is not a direct drainage.
The renal vein drains the kidney and it directly drains into the inferior vena cava.
