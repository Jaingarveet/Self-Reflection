## Assistant 2:
Reflection:
Comedonal acne is a type of acne that is characterized by the presence of comedones, which are non-inflammatory lesions that can be open (blackheads) or closed (whiteheads). 
Benzoyl peroxide is a topical medication that is effective in treating comedonal acne by reducing the number of bacteria on the skin and preventing the formation of new comedones. 
Topical antibiotics are also used to treat acne, but they are more effective in treating inflammatory acne rather than comedonal acne. 
Retinoids are another option for treating comedonal acne, as they work by increasing cell turnover and preventing the formation of new comedones. However, they can be irritating to the skin and are not recommended for patients with sensitive skin. 
Estrogen is not a treatment option for acne, as it can actually worsen acne in some cases. 
Based on this information, the best treatment option for the patient's comedonal acne would be benzoyl peroxide. 
Action: Answer("B")
