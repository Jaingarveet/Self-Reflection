## Assistant 2:
Self-reflection:
Unstable lie refers to the position of the fetus in the uterus. It is not in the normal vertex position. 
I previously answered this question incorrectly by selecting option A, which is oligohydramnios. However, oligohydramnios is a condition where there is a deficiency of amniotic fluid, which is not related to the position of the fetus. 
The correct answer is D, uterine anomalies, which can cause an unstable lie due to the abnormal shape of the uterus. 
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
