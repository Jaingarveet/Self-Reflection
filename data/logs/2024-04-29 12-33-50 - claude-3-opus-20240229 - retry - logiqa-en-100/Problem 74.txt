## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The group needs to select 2 out of the 3 girls. If He Zhilian is not selected, then Fang Rufen and Guo Yanran must be the two girls selected.
2. The group also needs to select 3 out of the 5 boys. 
3. Requirement (1) states that Guo Yanran and Tang Xiaohua cannot be selected together. Since Guo Yanran is selected, Tang Xiaohua cannot be selected.
4. Requirements (2) and (3) don't provide any additional information, since we already know Tang Xiaohua is not selected.
5. So if He Zhilian is not selected, we can definitively say that Tang Xiaohua will also not be selected. The question doesn't provide enough information to determine which of the other boys will or will not be selected.
Therefore, the correct answer is A: If He Zhilian is not selected, Tang Xiaohua will also not be selected.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
