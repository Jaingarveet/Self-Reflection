## System:
You are an expert in Logic.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Topic: Logic
Context: Since 1993, sand and dust storms have frequently occurred in the Inner Mongolia region of our country, causing major economic losses.Some people think that sand and dust storms are caused by grassland degradation and desertification caused by climate drought.They are natural disasters, so they are inevitable.
Question: If the following items are true, can the above opinions be questioned, except?
Choices:
  A: In the 1950s, grass in Xilin Gol grassland in Inner Mongolia was as tall as a horse's belly, and now grass can't even cover mice.
  B: Opposite the degraded grasslands of Hulunbeier and Xilinguole in Inner Mongolia, the grasslands of Mongolian grassland are about 1 meter high.
  C: On the almost uninhabited border line of 10 kilometers wide between China and Mongolia, grass still maintains the height of the 1950s.
  D: The increase in dust storms is mainly due to human factors such as overloaded grazing and predatory management of grasslands.

## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
The question is asking which choice, if true, would not allow the stated opinion to be questioned. In other words, which choice is consistent with the idea that sand and dust storms are natural disasters caused by climate and are inevitable.
Choice A suggests that grassland degradation has occurred over time in Inner Mongolia. This allows questioning the opinion, as it points to factors other than just climate.
Choice B compares the degraded grasslands in Inner Mongolia to healthier grasslands in Mongolia. This also allows questioning the opinion by suggesting factors other than climate are at play, since the grasslands differ despite being in the same general region.
Choice C notes that grass height is maintained in an uninhabited border area. This again allows questioning the opinion, as it indicates human factors play a role - where humans are absent, the grasslands are healthier.
Choice D directly states that human factors like overgrazing are the main cause of increased dust storms. This is the only choice that, if true, supports the stated opinion rather than allowing it to be questioned. Overgrazing could exacerbate the effects of natural drought.
Therefore, choice D is the only one that, if true, would not allow the stated opinion to be questioned.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
