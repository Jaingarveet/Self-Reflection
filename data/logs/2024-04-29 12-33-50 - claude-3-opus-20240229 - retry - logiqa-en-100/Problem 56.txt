## User 2:
Topic: Logic
Context: The Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge, built in 1968, has a clear height of 24 meters in the Fengshui area.Theoretically, it can pass a maximum of 3,000 tons of ships.Today, with the rapid economic development, it has become a building that “cuts the waist” of the Yangtze River waterway and hinders the passage of giant ships.A bridge expert asserted that the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge must be demolished and rebuilt in order to dredge the golden waterways of the Yangtze River completely.
Question: If any of the following is true, can you raise the most doubts about this expert's point of view?
Choices:
  A: Due to the inability of large ships to pass through the Nanjing Bridge, a large number of exported goods in the middle and upper reaches of the Yangtze River can only be taken by road or railway.
  B: 99% of international ships entering the Yangtze River are moored at ports below the Nanjing Bridge, and dozens of foreign trade terminals above Nanjing rarely have large external ships berthed.
  C: It is not enough to dismantle only the Nanjing Bridge.The Yangtze River Bridge, which was built in Wuhu, Tongling, Anqing and other places, has a clear height of 24 meters.
  D: Shipbuilding technology is highly developed, and 8000-ton ships designed for adapting to the passage of the Yangtze River abroad have passed through Nanjing to Wuhan.

## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
The expert asserts that the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge must be demolished and rebuilt to allow giant ships to pass through and fully utilize the Yangtze River waterway.
Looking at the answer choices:
A) This supports the expert's view by pointing out the economic impact of large ships being unable to pass the bridge. It does not raise doubts.
B) If 99% of international ships entering the Yangtze moor below the Nanjing Bridge, and ports above it rarely have large ships, this suggests demolishing the bridge may not be necessary, as most large ship traffic is already below it. This raises doubts about the expert's assertion.
C) This also supports the expert's view by noting other bridges also block ship traffic, so demolishing only Nanjing's bridge would be insufficient. It does not raise doubts.
D) If 8000-ton ships designed for the Yangtze have already passed through Nanjing to Wuhan, this directly contradicts the claim that the bridge must be demolished for large ships to pass. This raises significant doubts.
Between B and D, D most directly challenges the expert's core claim by demonstrating that large ships can in fact already pass the bridge. B raises doubts more indirectly.
Therefore, D raises the most doubts about the expert's view.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
