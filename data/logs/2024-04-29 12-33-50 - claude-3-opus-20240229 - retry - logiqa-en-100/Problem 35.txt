## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) We know Li was hired by Tianshu. 
2) Li and Zhao were not hired by the same unit. So Zhao must have been hired by either Tianji or Tianxuan.
3) Liu and Zhao were hired by the same unit. Since Zhao wasn't hired by Tianshu (where Li works), Liu and Zhao must both work at either Tianji or Tianxuan.
4) If Zhang was hired by Tianxuan, then Wang was also hired by Tianxuan. 
5) Looking at the answer choices:
A) This can't be correct. Li works at Tianshu but Liu works with Zhao at either Tianji or Tianxuan.
B) This could be correct. Zhao and Liu work together, so if they're at Tianji, Wang could also be there. This doesn't contradict any of the given information.
C) This can't be correct. Liu and Zhao work together, so Liu can't be the only one at Tianxuan. 
D) This can't be definitively correct. If Zhang works at Tianxuan, then Wang must also. But Wang could also work at Tianji or Tianshu. We don't have enough info to say only Wang is at Tianxuan.
Therefore, B is the only choice that could possibly be correct given the information provided.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
