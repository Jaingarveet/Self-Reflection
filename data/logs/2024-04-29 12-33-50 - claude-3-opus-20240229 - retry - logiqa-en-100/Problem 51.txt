## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. We know F must be in the production department based on condition (4).
2. The question states that X and F are assigned to the same department. Since F is in production, this means X must also be in the production department.
3. Based on condition (3), if X is in sales, then W must be in production. However, we determined X is in production, not sales. Therefore, W does not have to be in production. W could be in either sales or public relations.
4. H and Y must be in the same department according to condition (1). Since there are 3 people in production (including F and X), and 3 people in sales, the only department H and Y can be in together is sales.
5. This leaves I, G and W. We know F and G can't be in the same department based on condition (2). Since F is in production, G must be in either sales or public relations.
6. If G is in sales, then I and W must be in public relations and production respectively (since sales is full with H, Y and G). 
7. If G is in public relations, then I and W must be in sales and production respectively.
Looking at the answer choices:
A. G being in sales is possible, as explained above.
B. H must be in sales with Y, not production.
C. I being in sales is possible if G is in public relations.
D. W being in public relations is possible if G is in sales.
Therefore, the only statement that cannot be true is B - H being assigned to the production department.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
