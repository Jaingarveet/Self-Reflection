Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

## User 2:
Topic: Logic
Context: A laboratory has three types of robots, A.B, and C.Type A can recognize colors, type B can recognize shapes, and type C can neither recognize colors nor shapes.The laboratory experimented with robots 1 and 2 with red balls, blue balls, red squares, and blue squares, and ordered them to pick up the red balls, but number 1 picked up the red squares, and number 2 picked up the blue balls.
Question: Based on the above experiment, which of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Both No.1 and No.2 are type C.
  B: Only one of No.1 and No.2 is C type.
  C: No.1 is type A and No.2 is type B.
  D: No.1 is not Type B and No.2 is not Type A.

## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. Robot #1 picked up the red squares instead of the red balls. This means it can recognize shapes but not colors. Therefore, robot #1 must be type B.
2. Robot #2 picked up the blue balls instead of the red balls. This means it can recognize neither shapes nor colors. Therefore, robot #2 must be type C. 
3. Looking at the answer choices:
   A: This can't be true, as we determined robot #1 is type B, not C.
   B: This is true - robot #2 is type C, while robot #1 is not. 
   C: This is false, as robot #1 is type B and robot #2 is type C.
   D: This is true - robot #1 is not type B (it is type A), and robot #2 is not type A (it is type C).
Both B and D are correct based on the information given. However, since I must select only one answer, I'll choose D as it provides more specific information about both robots.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
