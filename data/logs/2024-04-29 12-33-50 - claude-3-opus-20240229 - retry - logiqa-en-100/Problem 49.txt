## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1. "Alingoits Doximayo Makasey" means "kidnapping student (host) hostage"
2. "Huholikaso Makasey Mugbudengs" means "hostage holding (see) reporter"  
3. "Mugbudengs Ftoufgke Alingoits" means "kidnapping reporters away"
From sentence 1, we can deduce:
- "Alingoits" likely means "kidnapping"
- "Doximayo" likely means "student"
- "Makasey" likely means "hostage"
From sentence 2:
- "Huholikaso" likely means "holding"
- "Mugbudengs" likely means "reporter"
And sentence 3 supports:
- "Mugbudengs" meaning "reporter"
- "Alingoits" meaning "kidnapping"
Therefore, looking at the answer choices:
A: "Doximayo" does not seem to mean "hostage", it more likely means "student". 
B: This looks correct based on the analysis. "Doximayo" probably means "student".
C: "Mugbudengs" does not mean "kidnapping", it seems to mean "reporter".
D: We can make reasonable deductions about the word meanings, so this is not the best answer.
In conclusion, B is the most likely correct answer - "Doximayo" appears to mean "student".
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: B
Score: 1
