## Assistant 2:
To explain the seemingly contradictory results, we need to find a statement that provides a plausible reason why people who favor college students as nannies would still not hire them.
A: This doesn't explain the discrepancy, as it only describes the type of work those who would hire college nannies want them to do. It doesn't address why those who favor them still wouldn't hire them.
B: If a majority of respondents are only willing to pay a low salary, this could explain why they wouldn't actually hire college students as nannies, even if they favor the idea in principle. College students may not accept such low pay.
C: This also doesn't explain the discrepancy, as it only describes why people think nannying is good for the students, not why they wouldn't hire them.
D: This is about people who don't approve of college nannies at all, so it doesn't explain why those who do approve still wouldn't hire them.
Therefore, B is the best explanation. If the offered salary is too low, people may like the idea of college nannies but still not actually hire them.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
