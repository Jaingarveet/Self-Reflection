Context: Xiao Chen? At present, part of the orbit of Comet 1996D3 is far from the sun, but recently it can be found to emit flickering light through the solar telescope.In the past, people never observed such flashes of comets far away from the sun, so this flicker must be an unusual scene.Xiao Wang? Normally people don't observe comets far away from the sun.The 1996D3 comet flicker light discovered this time was obtained by continuous and careful tracking observation.
Question: Which of the following most accurately summarizes the method Xiao Wang used to refute Xiao Chen's views?
Choices:
  A: Point out that the key concepts used by Xiao Chen are ambiguous.
  B: pointed out that Xiao Chen's argument is clearly lacking in persuasion.
  C: pointed out that Xiao Chen's arguments contradict themselves.
  D: Disagree with Xiao Chen's conclusion, and put forward another explanation for Xiao Chen's argument.E.Agree with Xiao Chen's conclusion, but put forward another explanation for Xiao Chen's argument.

## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. Xiao Chen argues that the flickering light from Comet 1996D3 far from the sun must be unusual, because people have never observed such flickers from distant comets before.
2. Xiao Wang counters by saying that normally people don't observe comets far from the sun at all. The flickering light was only discovered this time through continuous and careful tracking.
3. Xiao Wang is not saying Xiao Chen's concepts are ambiguous (A), or that the argument lacks persuasion (B) or is self-contradictory (C). 
4. Rather, Xiao Wang provides an alternative explanation for why the flickers haven't been seen before - because distant comets aren't normally observed carefully. This fits with choice (D) - disagreeing with the conclusion and providing an alternative explanation.
5. Xiao Wang does not agree with Xiao Chen's conclusion that the flickers are unusual, so (E) is incorrect.
Therefore, the best answer is (D) - Xiao Wang disagrees with Xiao Chen's conclusion, and puts forward another explanation for why the flickers haven't been observed before.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
