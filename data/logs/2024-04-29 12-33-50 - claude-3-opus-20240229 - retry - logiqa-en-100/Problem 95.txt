## System:
You are an expert in Logic.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Topic: Logic
Context: Premier Wen Jiabao said in an interview with the editor-in-chief of The Washington Post? 1.3 billion, which is a big number.If you use multiplication, a small problem, multiplied by 1.3 billion, will become a big problem; if you use division, a large total, divided by 1.3 billion, will become a small number .This is something many foreigners do not understand.
Question: Which of the following options is closest to what Premier Wen Jiabao said above?
Choices:
  A: It is an extremely difficult task for 1.3 billion people to live a good life.Which ones have to threaten others?
  B: China's large population makes China's affairs very complicated and arduous, so remember to be cautious for politicians.
  C: China has a large population and arduous development tasks, and it is impossible to threaten any other country.
  D: Everyone collects firewood and the flame is high.

## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. Premier Wen Jiabao is talking about China's large population of 1.3 billion people. This is the key context.
2. He uses two mathematical analogies to illustrate his point:
   - If you multiply a small problem by 1.3 billion, it becomes a big problem. 
   - If you divide a large total by 1.3 billion, it becomes a small number.
3. He says this is something many foreigners do not understand about China.
4. Looking at the answer choices:
   A) This doesn't quite capture the mathematical analogies or the point about foreigners not understanding.
   B) This seems to align well. The large population makes China's affairs complicated and arduous (the multiplication analogy). And the call for politicians to be cautious fits with foreigners not understanding this.
   C) While true that the large population means arduous development tasks, this doesn't capture the mathematical analogies or the point about threatening other countries.
   D) This Chinese proverb doesn't seem directly relevant to what Premier Wen Jiabao said.
5. Therefore, choice B seems to be the closest to capturing the key points Premier Wen Jiabao made with his mathematical analogies and comment about foreign understanding.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
