## System:
You are an expert in Logic.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Logic
Context: There must be an outside world, because if there is something outside me that can shine or reflect, shining the light into my eyes, which gives me a visual experience, I ca nâ€™t see the buildings, the crowds and the stars these things.And, not only have visual experience like me, but others also have such visual experience; book knowledge also tells us repeatedly that there is an outside world outside of us.
Question: Which of the following does not constitute doubt or rebuttal to the above argument?
Choices:
  A: To use sensory evidence to explain the existence of the external world requires presupposing the existence of the external world in the mind.
  B: How do you prove that others have similar visual experience to you?
  C: Since the visual experience is reliable, Mirage is not a so-called illusion, but a real existence.
  D: If there is no external world and natural science knowledge is not a true reflection of it, then why does natural science achieve such great success in practice?
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.

Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
No reflection information provided.
## Assistant 2:
Let's think through this step-by-step:
A: This is a valid doubt. It points out the circular reasoning in using sensory evidence, which itself presupposes an external world, to prove the external world exists. This challenges the argument.
B: Also a reasonable doubt. The argument assumes others have similar visual experiences, but provides no proof for this claim. Questioning this assumption pokes a hole in the reasoning.
C: This choice does not challenge the argument, but rather supports it illogically. Claiming mirages are real because visual experiences are reliable is faulty logic that actually aligns with the flawed reasoning in the original argument. So this is not a rebuttal.
D: This brings up the practical success of natural science as evidence for an external world that science describes. While not definitively proving an external world, it at least provides a reasonable counter-argument to pure skepticism. So it does present some challenge to the original argument's certainty.
Therefore, C is the only choice that does not offer any doubt or rebuttal to the argument for an external world. All the others raise some valid questions or counter-points.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
