Topic: Law
Context: There are two kinds of horror stories: those that describe a mad scientist's experiments and those that describe a monstrous beast. In some horror stories about monstrous beasts, the monster symbolizes a psychological disturbance in the protagonist. Horror stories about mad scientists, on the other hand, typically express the author's feeling that scientific knowledge alone is not enough to guide human endeavor. However, despite these differences, both kinds of horror stories share two features: they describe violations of the laws of nature and they are intended to produce dread in the reader.
Question: If the statements above are true, which one of the following would also have to be true?
Choices:
  A: All descriptions of monstrous beasts describe violations of the laws of nature.
  B: Any story that describes a violation of a law of nature is intended to invoke dread in the reader.
  C: Horror stories of any kind usually describe characters who are psychologically disturbed.
  D: Most stories about mad scientists express the author's antiscientific views.
  E: Some stories that employ symbolism describe violations of the laws of nature.
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I overlooked the keyword "some" in the question and the option choices. 
The correct answer is [REDACTED] because it is the only option that refers to "some stories," indicating a partial truth, rather than making a generalization about all horror stories.
Error Keywords:
- Oversight
- Keyword neglect
- False generalization
Solution:
The provided statements describe two types of horror stories: those featuring mad scientists and those featuring monstrous beasts. Both types share two common features: they violate the laws of nature and evoke dread in readers.

Option [REDACTED] states: "[REDACTED]"
This option is the correct answer because it is the only one that captures the partial truth reflected in the statements. While not all horror stories employ symbolism, the statements indicate that some stories within these two subtypes do violate the laws of nature.

The other options make broader generalizations that are not supported by the provided information. They either refer to "all" stories or make assertions about the intentions or content of all stories within a specific type, which goes beyond the scope of the given statements.
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and identify the keywords, such as "some" or "all."
2. Analyze the provided statements to identify the common features of the two types of horror stories.
3. Evaluate each option:
    - Option [REDACTED]: Incorrect because it refers to "all" descriptions and makes a broader assertion than what is stated.
    - Option [REDACTED]: Incorrect because it generalizes beyond the scope of the provided information.
    - Option [REDACTED]: Incorrect because it makes a broad assertion about all horror stories, which is not supported.
    - Option [REDACTED]: Incorrect because it focuses on authors' views, which is not the main point of the statements.
    - Option [REDACTED]: Correct because it refers to "some stories" and captures the partial truth about violations of the laws of nature.
4. Select option [REDACTED] as the correct answer.
Advice:
- Pay close attention to keywords and qualifiers in the question and options, such as "some," "all," "always," or "never." These words can significantly impact the scope and nature of the conclusion.
- Analyze the provided statements to identify specific commonalities or differences between the described categories.
- Avoid making broad generalizations or inferences beyond the scope of the provided information. Stick to the specific details given.
- Remember that the correct answer may not be the most appealing or interesting option; it should be the one that is most strongly supported by the provided statements.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: The correct answer is supported by the partial truth that some horror stories within the two subtypes violate the laws of nature. While it is not true for all horror stories, it is true for some within these categories.
