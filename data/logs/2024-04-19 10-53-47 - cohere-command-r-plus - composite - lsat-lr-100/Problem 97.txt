Topic: Law
Context: Editorial: Cell-phone usage on buses and trains is annoying to other passengers. This suggests that recent proposals to allow use of cell phones on airplanes are ill-advised. Cell-phone use would be far more upsetting on airplanes than it is on buses and trains. Airline passengers are usually packed in tightly. And if airline passengers are offended by the cell-phone excesses of their seatmates, they often cannot move to another seat.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes the role played in the editorial's argument by the statement that cell-phone use would be far more upsetting on airplanes than it is on buses and trains?
Choices:
  A: It is the main conclusion of the argument.
  B: It is a claim that the argument tries to rebut.
  C: It is a premise that indirectly supports the main conclusion of the argument by supporting a premise for that conclusion.
  D: It is a conclusion for which support is provided and that itself is used in turn to directly support the argument's main conclusion.
  E: It provides background information that plays no role in the reasoning in the argument.

Solution: The statement, "Cell-phone use would be far more upsetting on airplanes than it is on buses and trains," is a conclusion that supports the main conclusion. It does so by providing a reason why allowing cell phone use on airplanes is ill-advised. This statement is not the main conclusion, it is a step in the argument's reasoning. The argument's main conclusion is that proposals to allow cell phone use on airplanes are ill-advised. 

Solution:
Instructions:
1. Identify the main conclusion of the argument. 
2. Determine if the statement in question is a premise or a conclusion. 
3. Assess the role of the statement in the argument's structure. 
4. Evaluate how the statement supports the main conclusion. 
5. Choose the answer that most accurately describes the role of the statement. 

Advice:
 - Identify the argument's main conclusion and understand its scope. 
 - Recognize the difference between a premise and a conclusion. [REDACTED] premise provides support, while a conclusion is supported. 
 - Understand the hierarchical structure of arguments. Conclusions are often supported by multiple layers of reasoning. 
 - Assess how each statement functions in the argument's structure. 
 - Recognize that conclusions can be supported by other conclusions, creating layers of reasoning. 
 - Practice identifying the role of various statements in arguments to improve your critical thinking skills.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The statement, "Cell-phone use would be far more upsetting on airplanes than it is on buses and trains," is a conclusion that supports the argument's main conclusion. It provides a reason why allowing cell phone use on airplanes is problematic and why the proposals are ill-advised. This statement is not the main conclusion itself, but it plays a crucial role in the argument's reasoning by offering a layer of support for the main point.
