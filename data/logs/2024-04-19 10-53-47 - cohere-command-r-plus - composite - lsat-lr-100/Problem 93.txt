## User 2:
Topic: Law
Context: Anyone who knows Ellsworth knows that he is bursting with self-righteousness, touting the idealism of his generation over the greed of the previous generation. So no one who knows him will be surprised that Ellsworth is offended by the suggestions in the media that he has engaged in unethical business practices.
Question: The conclusion drawn above follows logically if which one of the following is assumed?
Choices:
  A: Everyone suspects self-righteous people of being, in actuality, unethical.
  B: Ellsworth has been accused of unethical business practices before.
  C: Hypocrites often hide behind righteous indignation.
  D: Ellsworth is in fact innocent of all wrongdoing.
  E: Everyone expects self-righteous people to be easily offended.
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I misinterpreted the relationship between self-righteousness and offense. I incorrectly assumed that self-righteous people are expected to be offended by suggestions of unethical behavior. However, the correct answer choice ("[REDACTED]") reflects the idea that self-righteous individuals are easily offended in general, regardless of the nature of the suggestion.

Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation
- Logical error
- Assumption error

Solution:
The correct answer is "[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]" 

The argument concludes that Ellsworth's indignation at media accusations of unethical business practices is likely due to his self-righteous nature, which makes him sensitive to any criticism or suggestion of wrongdoing. 

Instructions:
1. Identify the conclusion drawn in the argument: Ellsworth's indignation at media accusations. 
2. Recognize the premise: Ellsworth's self-righteous nature. 
3. Understand the relationship between self-righteousness and sensitivity to criticism. 
4. Evaluate each answer choice: 
   - "[REDACTED]" is incorrect because it suggests a suspicion of underlying unethical behavior, which is not relevant to Ellsworth's reaction. 
   - "[REDACTED]" is irrelevant to the argument's conclusion. 
   - "[REDACTED]" is incorrect because it focuses on hiding rather than offense. 
   - "[REDACTED]" is irrelevant to the argument's conclusion, which is based on expectations of self-righteous people's behavior. 
   - "[REDACTED]" correctly reflects the assumption that self-righteous people are expected to be easily offended, aligning with Ellsworth's reaction. 

Advice:
 - Carefully read and understand the argument's conclusion and premise. 
 - Identify the relationship between the given information and the conclusion. 
 - Evaluate each answer choice critically, considering logical connections and assumptions. 
 - Avoid making assumptions or interpretations that go beyond the given information. 
 - Stay focused on the specific logical connections presented in the argument.
