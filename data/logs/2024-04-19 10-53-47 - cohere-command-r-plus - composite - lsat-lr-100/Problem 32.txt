Topic: Law
Context: Editorial: This political party has repeatedly expressed the view that increasing spending on education is a worthy goal. On other occasions, however, the same party has claimed that the government should not increase spending on education. So this party's policy is clearly inconsistent.
Question: The argument in the editorial depends on assuming which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: It is inconsistent for a legislator both to claim that increasing spending on education is a worthy goal and to vote against increasing spending on education.
  B: A consistent course of action in educational policy is usually the course of action that will reduce spending on education in the long run.
  C: Even if a goal is a morally good one, one should not necessarily try to achieve it.
  D: A consistent political policy does not hold that an action that comprises a worthy goal should not be performed.
  E: Members of one political party never have inconsistent views on how to best approach a political issue.

Explanation:
I misinterpreted the editorial's assumption about the political party's position on education spending. 
The editorial points out the apparent inconsistency in the party's statements, but the correct answer choice ('D') clarifies that a consistent policy does not require always acting on a stated goal. 
Error Keywords:
 - Misinterpretation error
 - Law error
 - Logical error
 - Consistency error
Solution:
The editorial presents a view that a political party's statements on education spending are inconsistent. 
The party expresses support for increasing education spending but also opposes increased spending on other occasions. 

Re-examining the answer choices: 
 - Choice 'A' focuses on the inconsistency between a legislator's statements and voting actions, which is not the main point of the editorial. 
 - Choice 'B' introduces the idea of reducing spending, which is not implied by the editorial's argument. 
 - Choice 'C' discusses the relationship between moral goals and actions, which is irrelevant to the specific issue of consistency in policy stances. 
 - Choice 'D' correctly captures the editorial's assumption. It states that a consistent policy does not dictate that an action aligned with a stated goal must always be taken. In this case, the party's position is that increasing education spending is a worthy goal, but their actions (opposing increased spending) do not necessarily align with this goal, creating an apparent inconsistency. 
 - Choice 'E' is incorrect as it denies the existence of inconsistent views within a political party, contradicting the editorial's observation. 

Instructions:
1. Identify the central claim or argument presented in the editorial. 
2. Recognize the apparent inconsistency highlighted by the editorial regarding the political party's stance on education spending. 
3. Understand that the question seeks to identify the assumption underlying the editorial's argument. 
4. Analyze each answer choice critically: 
   - Choice 'A' misrepresents the editorial's focus by emphasizing the actions of a legislator rather than the party's overall stance. 
   - Choice 'B' introduces a red herring by bringing up long-term spending reduction, which is unrelated to the editorial's argument. 
   - Choice 'C' shifts the discussion to moral goals and actions, which is irrelevant to the specific issue of policy consistency. 
   - Choice 'D' accurately reflects the editorial's assumption that a consistent policy does not require acting on every stated goal. 
   - Choice 'E' contradicts the editorial's observation of inconsistent views within the political party. 

5. Select choice 'D' as the correct answer. 

Advice:
 - Carefully read and understand the editorial's argument, identifying any assumptions or logical connections. 
 - Distinguish between the central argument and peripheral details or red herrings. 
 - Recognize that answer choices may introduce irrelevant or misleading information. 
 - Critically evaluate each answer choice against the provided context to identify the most accurate reflection of the editorial's assumption. 
 - Ensure that your interpretation of the editorial's assumption aligns with the specific issue being discussed.
