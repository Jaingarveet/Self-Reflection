2. Based on the self-reflection, the thigh is the preferred donor site for split skin grafts in young children. The reasons given are:
   - The thigh has a large surface area, allowing for a greater yield of graft tissue.
   - The thigh is less prone to contamination and infection compared to the buttocks.
   - The thigh has good skin quality, can be easily immobilized, and does not significantly interfere with the child's growth and development.
3. The other choices are buttocks, trunk, and upper limb. The self-reflection specifically mentions that the thigh is preferred over the buttocks due to lower risk of contamination and infection.
