## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: A paper is in a square form whose one side is 20 cm. Two semi circles are drawn on its opposites as diameters. If these semi circles are cut down what is the area of the remaining paper?
Choices:
  A: 8.75
  B: 8.79
  C: 8.75
  D: 8.71
  E: 8.72
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
The area of the square is side^2 = 20^2 = 400 cm^2.
The diameter of each semicircle is 20 cm, so the radius is 20/2 = 10 cm.
The area of a full circle is πr^2, so the area of each semicircle is (π(10)^2)/2 = 50π cm^2.
The area of both semicircles is 2*50π = 100π cm^2.
The area of the remaining paper is the area of the square minus the area of the semicircles = 400 - 100π cm^2.
The area of the remaining paper is approximately 314.16 cm^2, which is not an option. However, if the question intended to ask for the area in square meters, then the correct answer would be approximately 0.0314 m^2, which rounds to 0.03 m^2. This is still not an option, so the question may be flawed.
