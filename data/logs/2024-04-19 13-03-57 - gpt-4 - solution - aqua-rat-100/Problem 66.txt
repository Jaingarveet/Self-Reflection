## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
The sum of an arithmetic series is given by the formula: 
Sum = n/2 * (2a + (n-1)d) 
where n is the number of terms (members in this case), a is the first term (age of the youngest member), and d is the common difference.
We can set up the equation: 
[REDACTED]0 = n/2 * (2*7 + (n-1)*0.[REDACTED])
Solving this equation will give us the number of members in the club.
Rearranging the equation gives:
n^2 + 4n - [REDACTED]00 = 0
Solving this quadratic equation gives n = [REDACTED] or n = -80. Since the number of members cannot be negative, the number of members in the club is [REDACTED].

The sum of an arithmetic series is given by the formula: 
Sum = n/2 * (2a + (n-1)d) 
where n is the number of terms (members in this case), a is the first term (age of the youngest member), and d is the common difference.
We can set up the equation: 
250 = n/2 * (2*7 + (n-1)*0.25)
Solving this equation will give us the number of members in the club.
Rearranging the equation gives:
n^2 + 4n - 1000 = 0
Solving this quadratic equation gives n = 20 or n = -50. Since the number of members cannot be negative, the number of members in the club is 20.
Action: Answer("B")
