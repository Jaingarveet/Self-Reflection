## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: X and Y are two alloys which were made by mixing zinc and copper in the ratio 6:9 and 7:11, respectively. If 40 grams of alloy X and 60 grams of alloy Y are melted and mixed to form alloy Z, what is the ratio of zinc and copper in the alloy Z ?
Choices:
  A: 69:91
  B: 59:91
  C: 59:90
  D: 59:91
  E: 69:101
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
For alloy X, the total ratio is 6+9=15. So, the amount of zinc is 6/15*40=16 grams and the amount of copper is 9/15*40=24 grams.
For alloy Y, the total ratio is 7+11=18. So, the amount of zinc is 7/18*60=23.33 grams and the amount of copper is 11/18*60=36.67 grams.
Then, we add the amounts of zinc and copper from both alloys to get the amounts in alloy Z. The amount of zinc is 16+23.33=39.33 grams and the amount of copper is 24+36.67=60.67 grams.
Finally, we find the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z by dividing both amounts by their greatest common divisor. The greatest common divisor of 39.33 and 60.67 is approximately 1. So, the ratio is approximately 39:61, which is not one of the choices.
However, if we round the amounts to the nearest whole number, we get 39 grams of zinc and 61 grams of copper, which gives a ratio of 39:61. This is also not one of the choices.
Therefore, there seems to be a mistake in the question or the choices.
## Assistant 2:
