Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
The profit per bag is 25% of the cost price. If the selling price is $100, then the cost price is $100 / 1.25 = $80. So, the profit per bag is $100 - $80 = $20.
If the total profit is $[REDACTED]00, then the number of bags sold is $[REDACTED]00 / $20 = 150 bags.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
The profit per bag is 25% of the selling price. If the selling price is $100, then the profit per bag is $100 * 0.25 = $25.
If the total profit is $3000, then the number of bags sold is $3000 / $25 = 120 bags.
However, this option is not available in the choices. There seems to be a mistake in the question or the choices provided. The correct answer should be 120 bags, but this is not an option. 
Action: Answer("E") 
Note: This answer is based on the closest available option to the correct answer. The actual correct answer should be 120 bags, but this is not an option.
## Result:
Agent Answer: E
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
