## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
First, we can set up ratios to represent the relationships between the different types of breads. 
From the first sentence, we know that 6 pita breads = [REDACTED] rolls. So, 1 roll = [REDACTED] pita breads.
From the second sentence, we know that [REDACTED] rolls = 5 baguettes. So, 1 baguette = [REDACTED]/5 rolls.
We want to find out how many pita breads are in [REDACTED] baguettes. 
So, [REDACTED] baguettes = [REDACTED] * ([REDACTED]/5 rolls) = 6/5 rolls.
And since 1 roll = [REDACTED] pita breads, 6/5 rolls = 6/5 * [REDACTED] pita breads = 18/5 = [REDACTED].6 pita breads.
Therefore, [REDACTED] baguettes contain the same amount of falafel as [REDACTED] pita breads.

Thought: 
First, we can set up ratios to represent the relationships between the different types of breads. 
From the first sentence, we know that 6 pita breads = 2 rolls. So, 1 roll = 3 pita breads.
From the second sentence, we know that 3 rolls = 5 baguettes. So, 1 baguette = 3/5 rolls.
We want to find out how many pita breads are in 2 baguettes. 
So, 2 baguettes = 2 * (3/5 rolls) = 6/5 rolls.
And since 1 roll = 3 pita breads, 6/5 rolls = 6/5 * 3 pita breads = 18/5 = 3.6 pita breads.
Therefore, 2 baguettes contain the same amount of falafel as 3.6 pita breads.
