Solution:
The initial number of boys is 64 and girls is 40. 
The final ratio of boys to girls is 4:3. 
Let's denote the number of new members as x. 
So, the number of boys is now 64 + x and the number of girls is 40 + x. 
The ratio of boys to girls is now (64 + x) : (40 + x) = 4 : 3. 
Solving this equation for x gives x = 24. 
So, the total number of members now is 64 + 40 + 2x = 64 + 40 + 2*24 = 152.
