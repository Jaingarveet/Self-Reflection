Topic: Law
Context: A shopping center has exactly seven spaces—space 1 through space 7—arranged in a straight row. Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
Question: If the shoe store is in space 2, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: The optometrist is in space 5.
  B: The pharmacy is in space 1.
  C: A restaurant is in space 3.
  D: The toy store is in space 6.
  E: The veterinarian is in space 4.

Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I incorrectly determined that a restaurant could not be in space 3. I failed to consider all possible arrangements that satisfy the given constraints. Specifically, I did not realize that with the shoe store in space 2, it's possible to have the pharmacy in space 1, a restaurant in space 7, and the other restaurant in space 3, with the other businesses arranged in the middle spaces according to the constraints.
Error Keywords:
 - Incomplete analysis
 - Failure to consider all possibilities
 - Incorrect constraint application
 - Hasty conclusion
Solution:
Given:
- The shoe store is in space 2.
- The pharmacy must be at one end (space 1 or 7) and a restaurant at the other end.
- The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. 
- The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
- The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
Considering each choice:
A. The optometrist in space 5 is possible. The pharmacy could be in space 7 (next to optometrist), restaurant in space 1, restaurant in space 3, satisfying all constraints.
B. The pharmacy in space 1 is possible. Restaurant in space 7, optometrist or veterinarian in space 2, satisfying all constraints.
C. A restaurant in space 3 is possible. Pharmacy in space 1, restaurant in space 7, satisfying the separation constraint.
D. The toy store in space 6 is possible. Pharmacy in space 1 or 7, restaurants in spaces 3 and 7 or 1 and 5, satisfying all constraints.
E. The veterinarian in space 4 is possible. Pharmacy in space 1, optometrist in space 3, restaurant in space 7, satisfying all constraints.
Therefore, the correct answer is A. The optometrist could be in space 5.
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and note all given constraints.
2. Identify the fixed position(s) given in the question.
3. For each answer choice, try to construct a possible arrangement that satisfies all constraints.
4. If an arrangement is possible, the choice could be true. If not, eliminate the choice.
5. Choose the answer that could be true based on the possible arrangements.
Advice:
 - Always consider all possibilities before drawing conclusions.
 - Make sure to satisfy all given constraints in your analysis.
 - Work through each constraint systematically.
 - Eliminate choices only when they clearly violate constraints.
 - In arrangement problems, try constructing concrete examples to test possibilities.
