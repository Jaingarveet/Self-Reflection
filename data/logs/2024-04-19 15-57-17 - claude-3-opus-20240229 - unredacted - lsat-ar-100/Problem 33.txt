## System:
You are an expert in Law.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Law
Context: The organizer of a reading club will select at least five and at most six works from a group of nine works. The group consists of three French novels, three Russian novels, two French plays, and one Russian play. The organizer's selection of works must conform to the following requirements: No more than four French works are selected. At least three but no more than four novels are selected. At least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected. If both French plays are selected, then the Russian play is not selected.
Question: Any one of the following could be true about the organizer's selections of works EXCEPT:
Choices:
  A: No Russian novels and exactly one play are selected.
  B: Exactly one Russian novel and both French plays are selected.
  C: Exactly two French novels and the Russian play are selected.
  D: Exactly two French novels and exactly two plays are selected.
  E: Exactly two Russian novels and exactly one play are selected.
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I incorrectly determined that choice A was possible and choice B was impossible. I failed to properly apply the constraint that if both French plays are selected, the Russian play cannot be selected. With choice A, selecting both French plays would preclude selecting the one play mentioned.
Error Keywords:
 - Misapplied constraints
 - Overlooked problem conditions
 - Faulty logical reasoning
 - Incomplete analysis of choices
Solution:
Let's re-examine each choice carefully, ensuring all constraints are satisfied:
A. No Russian novels and exactly one play: This is not possible. If no Russian novels are selected, then all 3 French novels must be selected to have at least 3 novels. But then selecting 1 play would require selecting 4 French works, violating the limit of no more than 4 French works.
B. Exactly one Russian novel and both French plays: This is possible. We can select 1 Russian novel, 2 French novels, and both French plays, satisfying all constraints.
C. Exactly two French novels and the Russian play: This is possible, as previously determined.
D. Exactly two French novels and exactly two plays: This is possible, as previously determined. 
E. Exactly two Russian novels and exactly one play: This is possible, as previously determined.
Therefore, the only choice that cannot be true is A.
Instructions:
1. Carefully read the question and note all problem constraints.
2. Analyze each answer choice individually.
3. For each choice, mentally select the works described.
4. Check if the selection violates any of the given constraints.
5. If a violation is found, eliminate that choice as a possibility.
6. If no violations are found, keep that choice as a possibility.
7. The choice that cannot be true will violate at least one constraint.
Advice:
 - Always fully grasp the problem conditions before attempting a solution.
 - Consider each constraint separately and in combination.
 - Systematically evaluate each answer choice against all constraints.
 - Be thorough in your analysis; don't make assumptions.
 - If a choice seems impossible, double-check your reasoning.
 - Eliminate choices through the process of contradiction.
 - The one choice that cannot be true will be the correct answer in an EXCEPT question.
