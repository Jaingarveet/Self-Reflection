Context: A shopping center has exactly seven spaces—space 1 through space 7—arranged in a straight row. Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
Question: If the optometrist is next to the shoe store, the businesses immediately on either side of this pair must be
Choices:
  A: the pharmacy and a restaurant
  B: the pharmacy and the toy store
  C: the two restaurants
  D: a restaurant and the toy store

Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I made an error in my reasoning about the positions of the businesses. I correctly identified that the pharmacy must be next to the optometrist, and that the optometrist is next to the shoe store. However, I then incorrectly assumed that the second restaurant must be in the 6th position, which led me to incorrectly place the veterinarian and toy store.
Error Keywords:
 - Logical reasoning error
 - Constraint satisfaction error
 - Incorrect assumption
 - Faulty deduction
Solution:
1. The pharmacy must be at one end and a restaurant at the other end.
2. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. Since the optometrist is next to the shoe store, the pharmacy must be next to the optometrist.
3. So we have this arrangement so far: 
   Pharmacy - Optometrist - Shoe Store - ? - ? - ? - Restaurant
4. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. This means the second restaurant could be in the 4th, 5th, or 6th position.
5. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian. 
6. Given these constraints, there are two possible arrangements:
   a) Pharmacy - Optometrist - Shoe Store - Restaurant - Toy Store - Veterinarian - Restaurant
   b) Pharmacy - Optometrist - Shoe Store - Toy Store - Restaurant - Veterinarian - Restaurant
7. In both cases, the businesses immediately on either side of the optometrist-shoe store pair are a restaurant and the toy store.
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and note all the constraints.
2. Identify the fixed positions first (in this case, the pharmacy and one restaurant).
3. Identify the pair mentioned in the question (in this case, optometrist and shoe store).
4. Try to position the pair based on the constraints.
5. Fill in the remaining positions, ensuring that each placement satisfies all the constraints.
6. If there are multiple possible arrangements, consider all of them.
7. Check the businesses immediately on either side of the mentioned pair in all possible arrangements.
8. Choose the answer that matches in all possible arrangements.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and note all the constraints.
 - Start with the most restrictive constraints and work from there.
 - Consider all possible arrangements that satisfy the constraints.
 - Don't make assumptions that are not supported by the given information.
 - Double-check that your final answer satisfies all the given constraints.
