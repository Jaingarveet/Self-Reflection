## System:
You are an expert in Law.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Topic: Law
Context: An administrator must assign parking spaces to six new employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young. Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
Question: Which one of the following could be the assignment of parking spaces to the new employees?
Choices:
  A: #1: Young; #2: Souza; #3: Vaughn; #4: Robertson; #5: Togowa; #6: Xu
  B: #1: Vaughn; #2: Togowa; #3: Young; #4: Souza; #5: Robertson; #6: Xu
  C: #1: Togowa; #2: Young; #3: Xu; #4: Robertson; #5: Souza; #6: Vaughn
  D: #1: Togowa; #2: Robertson; #3: Young; #4: Souza; #5: Vaughn; #6: Xu
  E: #1: Souza; #2: Togowa; #3: Young; #4: Robertson; #5: Xu; #6: Vaughn

You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I incorrectly determined that Choice D satisfied all the rules, when in fact it violates rule 3. I failed to properly apply the transitive property of the "higher-numbered than" relationship. Since Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered space than Young, and Young must be assigned a higher-numbered space than Togowa, it follows that Robertson must also be assigned a higher-numbered space than Togowa. Choice D violates this by assigning Robertson space #2 and Togowa space #1.
Error Keywords:
 - Logical reasoning error
 - Transitive property error
 - Rule application error
 - Parking space assignment error
Solution:
Let's go through each choice again, carefully applying all the rules:
Choice A: Violates rule 3 as Young (#1) is assigned a lower-numbered space than Robertson (#4).
Choice B: Violates rule 1 as Togowa (#2) is assigned a higher-numbered space than Young (#3). 
Choice C: Violates rule 2 as Souza (#5) is assigned a higher-numbered space than Xu (#3).
Choice D: Violates rule 3. Since Robertson must be higher than Young, and Young must be higher than Togowa, Robertson must also be higher than Togowa. But here Robertson (#2) is lower than Togowa (#1).
Choice E: Satisfies all the rules:
- Young (#3) is assigned a higher-numbered space than Togowa (#2). 
- Xu (#5) is assigned a higher-numbered space than Souza (#1).
- Robertson (#4) is assigned a higher-numbered space than Young (#3).
- Robertson is assigned parking space #4, which is allowed.
Therefore, the correct answer is Choice E.
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and identify all the rules/constraints.
2. Go through each answer choice one by one.
3. For each choice, check if it violates any of the stated rules.
4. If a choice violates a rule, eliminate it and move to the next choice.
5. If a choice satisfies all the rules, select it as the correct answer.
6. Double-check that the selected answer indeed satisfies all rules.
7. Watch out for implicit rules that arise from combining explicit rules.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and identify all explicit and implicit constraints.
 - Always consider each answer choice methodically, eliminating choices that violate constraints.
 - Never select an answer without checking that it satisfies all constraints.
 - Always watch out for implicit constraints that arise from combining explicit constraints.
 - Remember that "higher-numbered than" is a transitive relationship: if A is higher than B, and B is higher than C, then A must also be higher than C.
