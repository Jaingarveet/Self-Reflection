Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")

Topic: Law
Context: For the school paper, five students—Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, Megregian, and O'Neill—each review one or more of exactly three plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation, but do not review any other plays. The following conditions must apply: Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
Question: Which one of the following could be an accurate and complete list of the students who review Tamerlane?
Choices:
  A: Jiang, Kramer
  B: Kramer, O'Neill
  C: Kramer, Lopez, O'Neill
  D: Kramer, Megregian, O'Neill
  E: Lopez, Megregian, O'Neill
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I made an error in my reasoning about the number of students who could review the same play(s). I incorrectly assumed that if Megregian reviewed Tamerlane, it would violate the condition that exactly two students review the same play(s). However, the condition states that exactly two students review exactly the same play or plays as each other, which allows for more than two students to review a single play as long as only two of them review an identical set of plays.
Error Keywords:
 - Misinterpretation of constraints
 - Incorrect assumption
 - Logical reasoning error
Solution:
1. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, so they must be included in the list.
2. Megregian reviews more plays than Kramer and Lopez. 
3. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Therefore, Jiang cannot review Tamerlane.
4. Lopez reviews fewer plays than Megregian. If Lopez reviewed Tamerlane, then Megregian would also have to review it to satisfy the condition that Megregian reviews more plays than Lopez. However, the correct answer includes Megregian but not Lopez, so Lopez cannot review Tamerlane.
5. Therefore, the only possible complete and accurate list of students who review Tamerlane is Kramer, Megregian, and O'Neill.
Instructions:
1. Carefully read and understand all the conditions and constraints given in the question.
2. Identify the students who are definitively required to review the play in question based on the given conditions.
3. Eliminate the students who are definitively prohibited from reviewing the play based on the given conditions.
4. Analyze the remaining students and conditions to determine which additional students, if any, must review the play to satisfy all conditions.
5. Select the answer choice that matches your determined list of students.
Advice:
 - Always carefully read and consider all conditions and constraints given in the question.
 - Break down complex conditions into individual requirements and analyze each one separately.
 - Use process of elimination to rule out definitively incorrect answer choices.
 - Consider each remaining answer choice individually and test it against all given conditions.
 - Be careful not to make unwarranted assumptions that add constraints beyond those explicitly given.
 - If stuck, try working backwards from the answer choices to see which one(s) could satisfy the conditions.
