Topic: Law
Context: A maintenance company that takes service requests from three clients—Image, Solide, and Truvest—plans to set targets for its average service response times. Service targets will be set at 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day. Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail. The six targets are set according to the following conditions: None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
Question: Which one of the following targets CANNOT be set for more than one of the clients?
Choices:
  A: a 1-day website target
  B: a 2-day voicemail target
  C: a 2-day website target
  D: a 3-day voicemail target
  E: a 3-day website target
Reflection:

Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I focused too much on the specific targets for each client and didn't consider the question from a broader perspective. The question asks which target cannot be set for more than one client, not which target is unique to a single client.
Error Keywords:
 - Misinterpreting the question
 - Focusing on irrelevant details
 - Not considering all possibilities
 - Jumping to conclusions
Solution:
1. The question asks which target cannot be set for more than one client.
2. The 3-day website target is the longest possible target.
3. Due to the conditions, no client can have a website target longer than its voicemail target.
4. Therefore, if a client has a 3-day website target, it must also have a 3-day voicemail target.
5. There are only three voicemail targets available (1-day, 2-day, 3-day).
6. Image must have the 1-day voicemail target, leaving only the 2-day and 3-day voicemail targets for the other two clients.
7. Thus, only one client can have the 3-day voicemail target, and consequently, only one client can have the 3-day website target.
8. All other targets (1-day website, 2-day website, 2-day voicemail) could potentially be assigned to multiple clients.
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and identify exactly what is being asked.
2. Consider the problem from a broad perspective before diving into specifics.
3. Identify the key constraints and conditions given in the problem.
4. Work through the logic step-by-step, considering all possibilities.
5. Eliminate answer choices that don't fit the conditions or question asked.
6. Select the answer choice that best fits the question and conditions.
Advice:
 - Always make sure you understand exactly what the question is asking before attempting to solve it.
 - Don't get bogged down in irrelevant details; focus on the key information needed to answer the question.
 - Consider the problem from multiple angles before committing to a solution path.
 - Eliminate answer choices that clearly don't fit before agonizing over close choices.
 - If stuck, try working backwards from the answer choices to see which could or couldn't work.
