Context: The organizer of a reading club will select at least five and at most six works from a group of nine works. The group consists of three French novels, three Russian novels, two French plays, and one Russian play.

At least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected. If both French plays are selected, then the Russian play is not selected.

Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I focused too much on trying to construct a specific scenario that satisfied all the constraints, rather than analyzing what must be true in all possible valid scenarios. By doing so, I overlooked that regardless of the specific works chosen, the organizer must always select at least two French novels to satisfy the requirement that at least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected.
Error Keywords:
 - Overspecification error
 - Scenario construction error
 - Overlooking necessary conditions
 - Failure to consider all possibilities
Solution:
The key insight is that to satisfy the requirement that at least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected, the organizer must always select at least two French novels, regardless of the specific scenario. Here's why:
1. There are only three Russian novels total. So at most, the organizer could select three Russian novels.
2. To have at least as many French novels as Russian novels, the number of French novels must be greater than or equal to the number of Russian novels.
3. Therefore, in all possible scenarios, the organizer must select at least two French novels.
4. None of the other answer choices are necessarily true in all valid scenarios.
Instructions:
1. Carefully read the question and understand what it is asking for.
2. Identify the key constraints and requirements given in the problem.
3. Analyze each requirement to determine what must be true in all possible scenarios that satisfy the constraints.
4. Look for necessary conditions that must hold regardless of the specific works chosen.
5. Avoid getting distracted by constructing specific scenarios that satisfy the constraints.
6. Choose the answer choice that must be true in all valid scenarios.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and make sure you understand what it is asking for.
 - Focus on identifying necessary conditions that must be true in all valid scenarios, rather than getting caught up in constructing specific scenarios.
 - Analyze each constraint separately to determine what it implies must be true in all cases.
 - Remember that a statement is only necessarily true if it holds in all possible scenarios that satisfy the given constraints.
 - Avoid overspecifying the problem by adding unwarranted assumptions or details.
 - If you're unsure, try to disprove an answer choice by constructing a counterexample scenario where it doesn't hold.
