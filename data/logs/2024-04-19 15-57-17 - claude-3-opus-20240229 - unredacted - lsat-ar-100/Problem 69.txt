You are an expert in Law.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Topic: Law
Context: At a concert, exactly eight compositions—F, H, L, O, P, R, S, and T—are to be performed exactly once each, consecutively and one composition at a time. The order of their performance must satisfy the following conditions: T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R. At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F. O is performed either first or fifth. The eighth composition performed is either L or H. P is performed at some time before S. At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
Question: If P is performed third and S is performed sixth, the composition performed fifth must be either
Choices:
  A: F or H
  B: F or O
  C: F or T
  D: H or L
  E: O or R
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I made an error in my reasoning about the possible compositions that could be performed fifth. I correctly identified that O must be performed first or fifth, and since P is third, O must be first. However, I then incorrectly concluded that O must be fifth, when in fact the question states that either F or O must be fifth if P is third and S is sixth.
Error Keywords:
 - Misreading the question
 - Faulty deduction
 - Overlooking stated conditions
 - Prematurely eliminating possibilities
Solution:
1. The question states that P is performed third and S is performed sixth. 
2. O must be performed either first or fifth. Since P is third, O must be first.
3. This leaves the second, fourth, fifth, and seventh positions open.
4. T must be either immediately before F or immediately after R. 
5. At least two compositions are between F and R in either order.
6. The eighth composition is either L or H.
7. The fifth composition must be either F or T, since:
   - O is first, not fifth
   - R must have F and two other compositions on one side, and T on the other side
   - If F is fifth, T and two other compositions are performed after it
   - If T is fifth, F and two other compositions are performed before it
8. Therefore, if P is third and S is sixth, the fifth composition must be either F or T.
Instructions:
1. Carefully read the question and the given conditions.
2. Identify the fixed positions stated in the question.
3. Use the fixed positions to deduce the possible positions for other compositions.
4. Consider each condition one by one, updating the possible positions as you go.
5. If a condition allows for multiple possibilities, consider them separately.
6. Eliminate possibilities only when they directly contradict a stated condition.
7. Identify the possible compositions for the position specified in the question.
8. Select the answer choice that matches your deduction.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and consider all stated conditions.
 - Draw conclusions based only on the given information, not assumptions.
 - Consider multiple possibilities when conditions allow for them.
 - Eliminate possibilities only when they clearly violate a condition.
 - Think through the implications of each condition step-by-step.
 - If stuck, try working backwards from fixed positions or clear conditions.
 - Double-check that your answer matches one of the given choices.
