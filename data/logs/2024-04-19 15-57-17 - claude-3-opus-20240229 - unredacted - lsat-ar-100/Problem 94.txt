Context: A shopping center has exactly seven spaces—space 1 through space 7—arranged in a straight row. Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
Question: If the veterinarian is in space 5, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: The optometrist is in space 2.
  B: The pharmacy is in space 7.
  C: A restaurant is in space 4.
  D: The shoe store is in space 6.
  E: The toy store is in space 3.
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I made an error in my reasoning about the location of the second restaurant. I correctly determined that the pharmacy must be in space 7 and one restaurant in space 1. However, I then incorrectly concluded that the second restaurant must be in space 6 to be separated by at least two businesses from the first restaurant. In fact, the second restaurant could be in space 4, which is also separated by at least two businesses (the optometrist and shoe store in some order in spaces 2 and 3) from the restaurant in space 1.
Error Keywords:
 - Logical reasoning error
 - Constraint satisfaction error
 - Spatial reasoning error
 - Incomplete consideration of possibilities
Solution:
Given:
- The veterinarian is in space 5.
- The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
- The pharmacy must be at one end and a restaurant at the other end.
Therefore, the pharmacy must be in space 7, and a restaurant must be in space 1.
The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
With a restaurant in space 1, the second restaurant could be in space 4 or space 6.
Looking at the answer choices, only C is a must be true statement. A restaurant must be in space 4.
Instructions:
1. Carefully read the question and constraints.
2. Identify the given information and what the question is asking.
3. Use the given information to make deductions about what must be true.
4. Consider all possibilities that satisfy the constraints.
5. Evaluate each answer choice against the deduced information.
6. Select the answer choice that must be true based on the given information and deductions.
Advice:
 - Always consider all possibilities that satisfy the stated constraints.
 - Be careful not to make unwarranted assumptions that overly constrain the possibilities.
 - Systematically evaluate each possibility against the constraints.
 - Clearly differentiate between what must be true, what could be true, and what cannot be true.
 - Rely only on the information given and logically derived from the given constraints.
