You are an expert in Law.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

Topic: Law
Context: Exactly eight books—F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O—are placed on a bookcase with exactly three shelves—the top shelf, the middle shelf, and the bottom shelf. At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.
Question: Which one of the following could be a complete and accurate list of the books placed on the bottom shelf?
Choices:
  A: F, M
  B: F, H, M
  C: G, H, K
  D: F, G, M, O
  E: G, H, L, M
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I made an error in my reasoning about the distribution of books on the shelves. I incorrectly assumed that since there were 7 books left to distribute between the top and bottom shelves, the only way to have more books on the bottom than the top was a 4-3 split. However, a 5-2 split also satisfies the condition. This incorrect assumption led me to eliminate correct answer B and choose incorrect answer E.
Error Keywords:
 - Faulty assumption
 - Incomplete consideration of possibilities
 - Prematurely eliminating correct answer
 - Choosing answer with incorrect books
Solution:
Given:
 - 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O
 - 3 shelves: top, middle, bottom
 - At least 2 books per shelf
 - More books on bottom than top
 - I on middle shelf
 - K on higher shelf than F
 - O on higher shelf than L
 - F on same shelf as M
Step 1: Place I on the middle shelf. 
Middle shelf: I
Step 2: Since F and M are on the same shelf, and K is higher than F, F and M must be on the bottom shelf and K on the middle or top.
Bottom shelf: F, M
Step 3: O is higher than L, so L must be on the bottom shelf.
Bottom shelf: F, M, L
Step 4: We now have 3 books on the bottom shelf, 1 on the middle shelf, and 4 books left to place: G, H, K, O.
Step 5: To have more books on the bottom than the top, the remaining distribution must be either:
 - Bottom: 4, Middle: 2, Top: 2
 - Bottom: 5, Middle: 2, Top: 1
Step 6: Looking at the answer choices, only B fits one of these distributions. It has F, H, and M on the bottom shelf, which matches the 5-2-1 distribution.
Therefore, B is correct.
Instructions:
1. Carefully read the rules and conditions.
2. Place books on shelves as explicitly stated in the conditions. 
3. Use the given conditions to deduce the placement of additional books.
4. Consider all possible distributions that satisfy the "more on bottom than top" condition.
5. Eliminate answer choices that violate any of the conditions.
6. Choose the answer that matches a valid distribution.
Advice:
 - Don't make unwarranted assumptions. Consider all possibilities that fit the conditions.
 - Use the process of elimination, but be careful not to prematurely eliminate correct answers.
 - Make deductions step-by-step based on the given conditions.
 - If a condition specifies a relative placement (e.g., higher, lower, same), use that information to place books on specific shelves.
 - Double-check that your final answer satisfies all the given conditions.
