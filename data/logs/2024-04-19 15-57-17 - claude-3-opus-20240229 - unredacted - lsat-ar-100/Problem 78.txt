## System:
You are an expert in Law.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## User 2:
Topic: Law
Context: Of the eight students—George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert—in a seminar, exactly six will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
Question: If George, Nina, and Robert give reports and they do so on different days from one another, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Helen gives a report on Wednesday.
  B: Nina gives a report on Monday.
  C: Nina gives a report on Tuesday.
  D: Olivia gives a report on Monday.
  E: Robert gives a report on Wednesday.
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I made an error in my reasoning about the possible scenarios given the constraints. I incorrectly concluded that Nina must give her report on Wednesday, which led me to incorrectly choose answer E. I failed to consider all possible valid scenarios.
Error Keywords:
 - Logical reasoning error
 - Incomplete analysis of constraints
 - Failure to consider all possible scenarios
Solution:
1. George must give his report on Tuesday, as that's the only day he can do so.
2. Robert cannot give an afternoon report. 
3. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is on Wednesday.
4. Let's consider the scenario where Nina gives her report on Monday:
   - Nina gives her report on Monday
   - Helen and Irving must then give their reports on Tuesday
   - George gives his report on Tuesday
   - Robert can give his report on Wednesday morning
5. In this scenario, all the constraints are satisfied. Importantly, Helen gives a report on Wednesday, so answer A is a possible scenario.
Instructions:
1. Carefully read the question and constraints.
2. Identify the fixed constraints (e.g. George must present on Tuesday).
3. Consider each answer choice one-by-one.
4. For each choice, try to construct a scenario that satisfies all the constraints.
5. If you can find a valid scenario, then that answer choice is possible.
6. If you cannot find a valid scenario after thorough consideration, then that answer choice is impossible.
7. Choose the answer that represents a possible scenario.
Advice:
 - Always carefully read and re-read the question and constraints.
 - Always consider each answer choice methodically.
 - Always try to construct concrete scenarios to test each answer choice.
 - Never assume an answer is impossible until you have thoroughly tried to find a valid scenario.
 - Always double-check that your chosen scenario satisfies all the given constraints.
 - Remember that for "could be true" questions, you only need to find one possible valid scenario.
