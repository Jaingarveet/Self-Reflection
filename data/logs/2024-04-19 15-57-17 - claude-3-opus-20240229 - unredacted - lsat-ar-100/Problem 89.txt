Context: A bakery makes exactly three kinds of cookieâ€”oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar. Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day. The following conditions apply: No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
Question: If the number of batches made on Friday is exactly one, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: The first batch of sugar cookies is made on Monday.
  B: The first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Tuesday.
  C: The third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Friday.
  D: The first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Wednesday.
  E: The second batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday.
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that the third batch of oatmeal cookies could not be made on Friday because it would violate the condition that no two batches of the same kind are made on the same day. However, I failed to consider that the first batch of sugar cookies being made on Monday is the only choice that could be true based on the given conditions.
Error Keywords:
 - Incorrect assumption
 - Incomplete analysis
 - Failure to consider all conditions
 - Failure to eliminate incorrect choices
Solution:
1. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday. 
2. No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
3. Therefore, the first and third batches of sugar cookies must be made on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday.
4. At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
5. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
6. Exactly one batch is made on Friday.
7. If the first batch of sugar cookies is made on Monday (A), this satisfies all conditions. No other choice does.
8. Therefore, (A) is the only choice that could be true.
Instructions:
1. Carefully read the question and note all given conditions.
2. Identify the fixed events (e.g. second sugar batch on Thursday, one batch on Friday).
3. Use the fixed events to constrain the possibilities for the other events.
4. Systematically consider each answer choice against all conditions.
5. Eliminate any choices that violate a condition.
6. If only one choice remains, it must be the correct answer.
7. If multiple choices remain, re-check each against the conditions to find the correct answer.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and note all conditions and constraints.
 - Always consider how the fixed or known events limit the possibilities for the unknown events.
 - Systematically evaluate each answer choice against all conditions, eliminating those that violate any condition.
 - If multiple choices seem possible, re-check each one carefully against all conditions to identify the correct answer.
 - Don't make assumptions; reason only from the given information and conditions.
