You are an expert in Law.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

## User 2:
Topic: Law
Context: An administrator must assign parking spaces to six new employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young. Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
Question: If Robertson is assigned parking space #3, then which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Souza is assigned parking space #4.
  B: Togowa is assigned parking space #2.
  C: Vaughn is assigned parking space #5.
  D: Xu is assigned parking space #6.
  E: Young is assigned parking space #2.
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I made an error in my logical reasoning. I correctly determined that Young must be in space #1 or #2, and that Togowa must be in the other of those two spaces. However, I then incorrectly focused on the relationship between Xu and Souza, ignoring the key fact that Robertson was assigned space #3. Since Robertson is in space #3, and Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered space than Young, Young must be assigned space #2 (since #1 is the only lower number than #3), and Togowa must therefore be assigned space #1.
Error Keywords:
 - Logical reasoning error
 - Incomplete consideration of given information
 - Incorrect deduction
 - Overlooking key facts
Solution:
Given:
 - Robertson is assigned parking space #3
 - Young must be assigned a lower-numbered parking space than Robertson
 - Togowa must be assigned a lower-numbered parking space than Young
Therefore:
 - Young must be assigned parking space #2 (the only space lower than Robertson's #3)
 - Togowa must be assigned parking space #1 (the only space lower than Young's #2)
So the correct answer is E: Young is assigned parking space #2.
Instructions:
1. Carefully read the question and note any specific information given (e.g. Robertson is in space #3).
2. Make a list of all the rules/constraints given in the question. 
3. Consider each rule one by one, noting what can be definitively determined from each.
4. When a definite assignment can be made based on the given information, make that assignment.
5. Continue working through the constraints logically until the question can be answered.
6. If the question cannot be fully answered, determine what can be known for certain.
7. Choose the answer choice that matches the definite determination.
Advice:
 - Always read the question fully and carefully.
 - Always note and consider all given information; don't ignore key facts.
 - Always work through the logic step-by-step, considering each constraint in turn.
 - Always make definite assignments when the given information allows it.
 - Never make unsupported assumptions; only determine what can be known for certain.
 - If the question cannot be fully answered, determine what can be partially answered.
 - Always double-check your reasoning before selecting your final answer.
