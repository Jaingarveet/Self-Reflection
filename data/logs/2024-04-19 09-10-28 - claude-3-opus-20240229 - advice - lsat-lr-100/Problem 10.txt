Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Advice:
 - Don't get too fixated on the specific examples given in the question stem. Look for the broader principles.
 - The correct answer often expresses a general principle rather than just restating details from the question.
 - Eliminate answer choices that are too specific or that focus on tangential issues.
 - The correct answer should justify the reasoning, not just be consistent with the final decision.
 - If two answers seem to fit, choose the one that expresses the broadest relevant principle.
## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. Mike's key reasoning is that it's okay for him to use Tom's computer without permission because Tom used Mary's bicycle without her permission. 
2. This suggests Mike believes there is some principle that if someone uses another person's property without permission, it's then okay to use their property without permission.
3. Looking at the answer choices:
A) This is too broad - the question isn't about theft in general. 
B) This is about telling the truth, which isn't the issue here.
C) This directly captures Mike's reasoning - if someone uses your stuff without asking, you can use theirs without asking. 
D) This is close, but a bit too broad - it's about treating people similarly in general, not specifically about using property.
E) This brings in the issue of harm, which Mike doesn't mention.
4. C seems to be the best answer. It most directly justifies Mike's specific reasoning.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
