## User 2:
Topic: Law
Context: People who are allergic to cats are actually allergic to certain proteins found in the animals' skin secretions and saliva; which particular proteins are responsible, however, varies from allergy sufferer to allergy sufferer. Since all cats shed skin and spread saliva around their environment, there is no such thing as a cat incapable of provoking allergic reactions, although it is common for a given cat to cause an allergic reaction in some-but not all-people who are allergic to cats.
Question: Which one of the following statements is most strongly supported by the information above?
Choices:
  A: Any particular individual will be allergic to some breeds of cat but not to others.
  B: No cat is capable of causing an allergic reaction in all types of allergy sufferers.
  C: Not all cats are identical with respect to the proteins contained in their skin secretions and saliva.
  D: The allergic reactions of some people who are allergic to cats are more intense than the allergic reactions of other allergy sufferers.
  E: There is no way to predict whether a given cat will produce an allergic reaction in a particular allergy sufferer.
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Advice:
 - Always read the passage closely, highlighting or noting the key facts and details.
 - Focus on what the passage directly states or implies, not just what it suggests or assumes.
 - Look for logical connections and inferences that can be drawn from the given information.
 - Be careful not to choose answers that are only partially supported or are based on information not in the passage.
 - Eliminate answers that are not supported, even if they could be true, and select the one with the strongest direct evidence.
## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
The key facts from the passage are:
1) Cat allergies are caused by certain proteins in cats' skin secretions and saliva
2) The specific proteins people are allergic to varies from person to person 
3) All cats shed skin and spread saliva in their environment
4) There are no cats that can't cause allergies at all
5) But a specific cat may cause allergies in some people and not others
Looking at the answer choices:
A) This is not supported. The passage indicates allergies depend on proteins, not cat breeds.
B) This is strongly supported. Since people are allergic to different proteins, no single cat will have all the proteins to trigger allergies in everyone.
C) The passage doesn't discuss variation in proteins between cats, only between allergy sufferers. Not enough info to support this.
D) The passage doesn't compare intensity of reactions, only whether a reaction occurs at all. Not supported.
E) This goes too far. The proteins a person is allergic to could potentially predict if a cat will trigger them. The passage just says there are no universally non-allergenic cats.
Therefore, B has the strongest support from the information provided.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
