## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The Lac Nichoutec Film Festival only shows Canadian films. 
2. This year, most (but not necessarily all) of the films that won prizes at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival also won prizes at international film festivals.
Now let's consider each answer choice:
A: This cannot be inferred. We don't know what proportion of Canadian films shown at international festivals won prizes at Lac Nichoutec. The information is about the reverse - films that won at Lac Nichoutec, not all Canadian films.
B: We cannot determine this. The passage doesn't tell us what proportion of all Canadian films were shown at Lac Nichoutec.
C: This must be true. If most Lac Nichoutec prize winners also won international prizes, then at least some of the international prize winners must have been Canadian, since Lac Nichoutec only shows Canadian films.
D: This is possible but not certain. Perhaps every Lac Nichoutec winner also won an international prize, or perhaps some didn't. We can't say for sure.
E: This is possible but not certain. The passage doesn't state whether all international prize winners were shown at Lac Nichoutec.
Therefore, C is the only statement that must be true based on the given information.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
