## User 2:
Topic: Law
Context: Patricia: During Japan's Tokugawa period, martial arts experts known as ninjas were trained for the purposes of espionage and assassination. Yet at that time there was actually very little ninja activity in Japan, and most Japanese did not fear ninjas. Tamara: That is not true. Many wealthy Japanese during the Tokugawa period had their houses constructed with intentionally squeaky floors so that they would receive warning if a ninja were in the house.
Question: Of the following, which one, if true, is the strongest counter Patricia can make to Tamara's objection?
Choices:
  A: Many poor Japanese during the Tokugawa period also had houses constructed with intentionally squeaky floors.
  B: As part of their secret training, ninjas learned to walk on squeaky floors without making a sound.
  C: The wealthy made up a small portion of Japan's population during the Tokugawa period.
  D: The fighting prowess of ninjas was exaggerated to mythic proportions in the years following the Tokngawa period.
  E: There were very few ninjas at any time other than during the Tokugawa period.

Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Advice:
 - Always keep the main point of the argument in mind; don't get sidetracked by minor details.
 - Consider the scope of the claim being made - does it apply to all or most of a group, or just to a specific subset?
 - Evaluate how each piece of information relates to and impacts the overall argument.
 - Be careful not to make unwarranted assumptions or inferences that go beyond the given information.
 - Eliminate answer choices that are irrelevant or fail to address the key issue raised in the objection.
## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
The main point of contention is whether most Japanese feared ninjas during the Tokugawa period. 
Patricia's claim: There was little ninja activity and most Japanese did not fear ninjas at that time.
Tamara's objection: Many wealthy Japanese had squeaky floors installed to detect ninjas, implying ninjas were feared.
To counter Tamara's objection, Patricia needs to show that the wealthy Japanese with squeaky floors are not representative of "most Japanese". 
Looking at the answer choices:
A) Poor Japanese also having squeaky floors supports Tamara's point that fear of ninjas was widespread. It doesn't help Patricia's argument.
B) Ninjas being able to silently walk on squeaky floors negates the purpose of the floors, but doesn't address whether most Japanese feared ninjas or not. 
C) If the wealthy were a small portion of the population, then their fear of ninjas as evidenced by the squeaky floors doesn't necessarily mean most Japanese shared that fear. This helps support Patricia's point.
D) Ninjas' fighting prowess being mythologized later doesn't tell us whether people feared them during the Tokugawa period itself.
E) The prevalence of ninjas at other times is not directly relevant to the level of fear during the Tokugawa period specifically.
Therefore, C is the strongest counter Patricia can make. It suggests the wealthy with their squeaky floors were an unrepresentative minority, consistent with Patricia's claim that most Japanese did not fear ninjas at the time.
Action: Answer("C")
