## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
We can solve the system of equations using substitution or elimination method.
Let's use the elimination method to solve the system of equations.
Multiplying the second equation by 3 and adding it to the first equation, we get:
$$\begin{array}{r}3 x+4 y=-23 \\6 y-3 x=-57\end{array}$$
Adding the two equations, we get:
$$7y=-80$$
Therefore, $y=-\frac{80}{7}$.
Substituting $y$ in the second equation, we get:
$$2\left(-\frac{80}{7}\right)-x=-19$$
Simplifying, we get:
$$x=3$$
Therefore, the solution to the system of equations is $(x,y)=(3,-\frac{80}{7})$.
