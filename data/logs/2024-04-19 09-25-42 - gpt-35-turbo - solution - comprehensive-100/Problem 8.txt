Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
Let's call the time it takes for the two cars to meet "t".
The distance each car travels is equal to the product of its speed and the time it travels.
For the car traveling at[REDACTED]2 mph, the distance it travels is[REDACTED]2t.
For the car traveling at[REDACTED]3 mph, the distance it travels is[REDACTED]3t.
The sum of the distances traveled by both cars is equal to the total distance between them, which is 50 miles.
So we can write the equation:
12t +[REDACTED]3t = 50
25t = 50
t =[REDACTED]
Therefore, the two cars will meet[REDACTED] hours after they begin.
