The order of their performance must satisfy the following conditions: T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R. At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F. O is performed either first or fifth. The eighth composition performed is either L or H. P is performed at some time before S. At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.

Choices:
  A: F, H, P
  B: H, P. L
  C: O, P, R
  D: O, P, T
  E: P, R, T
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
If S is performed fourth, then the order of the first three compositions must be either F, H, and L or L, H, and F. 
O is performed either first or fifth, so if S is performed fourth, then the fifth composition must be O. 
The eighth composition performed is either L or H, so if O is performed fifth, then the eighth composition must be either L or H. 
P is performed at some time before S, so P must be performed either first, second, or third. 
At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O, so T cannot be performed immediately after O. 
T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R, so if T is performed after O, then R must be performed before T. 
Action: Answer("C")
