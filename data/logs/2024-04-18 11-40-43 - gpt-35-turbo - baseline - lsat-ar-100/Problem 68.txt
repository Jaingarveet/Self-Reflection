Topic: Law
Context: An editor will edit seven articles, one at a time. Three of the articles—G, H, and J—cover finance; three other articles—Q, R, and S—cover nutrition; and the remaining article, Y, covers wildlife. The order in which the articles are edited is subject to the following conditions: Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other. S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third. S must be earlier than Y. J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
Question: If J is third, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: G is fourth
  B: His sixth
  C: Q is first
  D: S is second
  E: Y is fifth
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
If J is third, then G must be later than J.
If G is later than J, then R must be later than G.
If R is later than G, then S must be earlier than R.
If S is earlier than R, then Q must be earlier than S.
If Q is third, then S can be earlier than Q.
Therefore, Q cannot be first.
