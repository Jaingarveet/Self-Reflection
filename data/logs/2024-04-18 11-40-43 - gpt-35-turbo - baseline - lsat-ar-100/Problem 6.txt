Context: For the school paper, five students—Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, Megregian, and O'Neill—each review one or more of exactly three plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation, but do not review any other plays. The following conditions must apply: Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
Question: Which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Jiang reviews more of the plays than Lopez does.
  B: Megregian reviews more of the plays than Jiang does.
  C: Megregian reviews more of the plays than O'Neill does.
  D: O'Neill reviews more of the plays than Jiang does.
  E: O'Neill reviews more of the plays than Kramer does.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
- Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
- Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
- Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
- Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
- Five students review exactly three plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation.
- Therefore, there are two students who review the same play, and one student who reviews two plays.
- Jiang could review two plays, but neither Lopez nor Megregian could review any of those two plays.
- Therefore, Jiang must review only one play, and that play cannot be Tamerlane.
- Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, so they must review one other play each.
- Lopez and Megregian must review the remaining two plays, but we don't know which play each of them reviews.
- Megregian reviews at least two plays, so he must review more plays than Jiang.
- O'Neill reviews two plays, so he must review more plays than Jiang.
- Therefore, Megregian reviews more of the plays than Jiang does, and O'Neill reviews more of the plays than Jiang does.
- We don't know whether Megregian reviews more of the plays than O'Neill does, or vice versa.
Action: Answer("B")
