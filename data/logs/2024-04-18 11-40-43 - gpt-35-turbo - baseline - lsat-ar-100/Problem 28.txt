Context: A panel of five scientists will be formed. The panelists will be selected from among three botanists—F, G, and H—three chemists—K, L, and M—and three zoologists—P, Q, and R. Selection is governed by the following conditions: The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types. If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. F and K cannot both be selected. K and M cannot both be selected. If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
Question: If four of the scientists selected are F, L, Q, and R, which one of the following must be the fifth scientist selected?
Choices:
  A: G
  B: H
  C: K
  D: M
  E: P
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
We have 4 scientists selected: F, L, Q, and R.
We need to select the fifth scientist.
If F is already selected, we cannot select G or H because we cannot have more than one botanist.
We cannot select K because F and K cannot both be selected.
We cannot select M because K and M cannot both be selected.
If R is already selected, we must select P because if M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
Action: Answer("E")
