## System:
You are an expert in Law.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")

Context: Game show winners choosing between two equally desirable prizes will choose either the one that is more expensive or the one with which they are more familiar. Today's winner, Ed, is choosing between two equally desirable and equally unfamiliar prizes, A and B. He will thus choose A, which is more expensive.
Question: The reasoning in which one of the following is most similar to the reasoning above?
Choices:
  A: With a book contract, an academic writer receives either an advance or a guarantee of royalties. Professor al-Sofi received an advance for a book contract, so al-Sofi did not receive a guarantee of royalties.
  B: When entering this amusement park, children always choose to take their first ride on either the Rocket or the Mouse. Janine insisted on the Rocket for her first ride. Thus, Janine would not have been standing near the Mouse during her first half hour in the amusement park.
  C: The elliptical orbit of an asteroid is only slightly eccentric unless it is affected by the gravitational pull of a planet. Asteroid Y is affected by Jupiter's gravitational pull and asteroid X is not. Thus, the orbit of asteroid Y is the more eccentric of the two.
  D: New students in this program must choose either a physics class or an art class. Miyoko has no desire to take a class in either of those fields, so Miyoko will probably not enter this program.
  E: To avoid predators, rabbits will either double back on their pursuers or flee for nearby cover. The rabbit being pursued by a fox in this wildlife film is in a field that offers no opportunity for nearby cover, so it will try to double back on the fox.

## Assistant 2:
The correct answer is C.
The reasoning in the original question is that Ed will choose the more expensive prize because he is indifferent between the two prizes. This is similar to the reasoning in answer choice C, which states that the orbit of asteroid Y is more eccentric because it is affected by Jupiter's gravitational pull. This is because the eccentricity of an asteroid's orbit is determined by the gravitational pull of other objects, and Jupiter is a very massive object.
The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not involve a choice between two equally desirable options. For example, answer choice A states that Professor al-Sofi did not receive a guarantee of royalties, but this is not relevant to the question of whether he would have chosen an advance or a guarantee of royalties. Similarly, answer choice B states that Janine would not have been standing near the Mouse during her first half hour in the amusement park, but this is not relevant to the question of whether she would have chosen the Rocket or the Mouse for her first ride.
Answer choice D is incorrect because it states that Miyoko will probably not enter the program, but this is not relevant to the question of whether she would have chosen a physics class or an art class. Answer choice E is incorrect because it states that the rabbit will try to double back on the fox, but this is not relevant to the question of whether it would have chosen to double back or flee for nearby cover.
Therefore, the correct answer is C.
