## User 2:
Topic: Law
Context: Native speakers perceive sentences of their own language as sequences of separate words. But this perception is an illusion. This is shown by the fact that travelers who do not know a local language hear an unintelligible, uninterrupted stream of sound, not sentences with distinct words.
Question: Which one of the following is an assumption on which the argument depends?
Choices:
  A: It is impossible to understand sentences if they are in fact uninterrupted streams of sound.
  B: Those who do not know a language cannot hear the way speech in that language actually sounds.
  C: People pay less close attention to the way their own language sounds than they do to the way an unfamiliar language sounds.
  D: Accomplished non-native speakers of a language do not perceive sentences as streams of sound.
  E: Native speakers' perceptions of their own language are not more accurate than are the perceptions of persons who do not know that language.

Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Advice:
 - Pay close attention to the wording of the argument and the answer choices.
 - Consider the logical relationships between the different parts of the argument.
 - Do not make assumptions that are not explicitly stated in the argument.
 - Be aware of common fallacies and logical errors.
 - Evaluate the argument as a whole, not just individual parts.
## Assistant 2:
## Self-reflection on previous incorrect answer:
**My previous answer:** Answer("C")
**Reasoning behind the incorrect answer:** I incorrectly assumed that the argument was claiming that native speakers pay less attention to the way their own language sounds, which is not explicitly stated.
**Correct answer:** Answer("A")
**Reasoning behind the correct answer:** The argument hinges on the assumption that it is impossible to understand sentences if they are in fact uninterrupted streams of sound. This is because the argument claims that travelers who do not know a local language hear an unintelligible stream of sound, not sentences with distinct words. If it were possible to understand sentences as uninterrupted streams of sound, then the argument's conclusion would not follow.
**Lessons learned:**
* Pay close attention to the wording of the argument and the answer choices.
* Do not make assumptions that are not explicitly stated in the argument.
* Be aware of common fallacies and logical errors.
* Evaluate the argument as a whole, not just individual parts.
**Applying the lessons learned to the current question:**
The current question asks which assumption the argument depends on. The argument claims that native speakers perceive sentences as sequences of separate words, but this is an illusion. This illusion is shown by the fact that travelers who do not know a local language hear an unintelligible, uninterrupted stream of sound, not sentences with distinct words. The only answer choice that captures this assumption is A: "It is impossible to understand sentences if they are in fact uninterrupted streams of sound."
Therefore, the correct answer is A.
