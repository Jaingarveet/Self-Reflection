Topic: Law
Context: Mexican Americans share with speakers of Spanish throughout the world a rich and varied repertoire of proverbs as well as a vital tradition of proverb use. The term "proverb" refers to a self-contained saying that can be understood independent of a specific verbal context and that has as its main purpose the carrying of a message or piece of wisdom. The great majority of Spanish-language proverbs reached Mexico from peninsular Spain, though they did not all originate there. Many belong, in fact, to the common proverb tradition of Europe and have exact equivalents in English-language proverbial speech. Each use of a proverb is an individual act whose meaning varies depending on the individual speaker and the particular social context in which the use occurs. Nonetheless, it is important to recognize that proverb use is also shaped by the larger community with which the individual interacts. The fact that proverbs often serve a didactic purpose points us to one important function that proverbs serve in Mexican American communities: the instruction of the young. In fact, this function seems to be much more prominent in Mexican tradition in general than in English-speaking traditions. Adolescents of Mexican descent in the United States consistently report the frequent use of proverbs by their parents as a teaching tool, in areas ranging from the inculcation of table manners to the regulation of peer-group relationships. The latter area is a particularly frequent focus of proverb use within Mexican American communities: one of the most frequently used proverbs, for example, translates roughly as, "Tell me who you run with and I'll tell you who you are." Perhaps this emphasis on peer-group relations derives from a sense that traditional, community-approved norms are threatened by those prevalent in the surrounding society, or from a sense that, in dealing with older children especially, parents need to appeal to traditional wisdom to bolster their authority. Another dimension of proverb use within Mexican American communities is that proverbs often serve to foster a consciousness of ethnicity, that is, of membership in a particular ethnic group possessing features that distinguish it from other groups within a multiethnic environment. Even those Mexican American proverbs that do not have an explicitly didactic purpose nevertheless serve as a vehicle for the transmission of both the Spanish language and Mexican culture. It is in these sayings that links to folklore and other aspects of Mexican culture are established and maintained. Proverbs thus provide a means of enhancing Mexican American young people's familiarity with their heritage, thereby strengthening their ties to Mexican tradition.
Question: The passage most strongly suggests which one of the following about the use of proverbs?
Choices:
  A: Proverb use is seldom intended to reinforce community-approved norms.
  B: The way in which a proverb is used depends, at least in part, on the community in which it is used.
  C: The most frequent use of proverbs in Mexican American communities is for the purpose of regulating peer-group relationships.
  D: Proverbs are often used to help teach young people languages.
  E: When a proverb is used as an educational tool, it is usually intended to serve more than one purpose.

Thought:
The passage discusses the use of proverbs in Mexican American communities and their various functions, including the instruction of the young, regulation of peer-group relationships, and fostering a consciousness of ethnicity. It also mentions that proverb use is shaped by the larger community and that the most frequent use of proverbs is in regulating peer-group relationships.
Action: Answer("C")

Correct Answer: B
## Assistant 2:
Response:
Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I focused too much on the specific example given in the passage about regulating peer-group relationships and did not consider the broader context of proverb use in Mexican American communities.

Error Keywords:
- Overemphasis on specific example
- Lack of consideration of broader context

Solution:
The passage discusses the use of proverbs in Mexican American communities and their various functions, including the instruction of the young, regulation of peer-group relationships, and fostering a consciousness of ethnicity. It also mentions that proverb use is shaped by the larger community and that the most frequent use of proverbs is in regulating peer-group relationships. However, the passage does not suggest that this is the only or even the most important function of proverbs in Mexican American communities. Instead, it emphasizes that proverb use is shaped by the larger community and that the way in which a proverb is used depends, at least in part, on the community in which it is used.

Instructions:
1. Read the passage carefully and identify the main topic.
2. Consider the various functions of proverbs discussed in the passage.
3. Identify any specific examples given in the passage, but do not overemphasize them.
4. Consider the broader context of proverb use in Mexican American communities.
5. Identify the answer choice that best reflects the main idea of the passage.

Advice:
- Always read the passage carefully and identify the main topic.
- Consider the broader context of the topic, not just specific examples.
- Identify the answer choice that best reflects the main idea of the passage, not just specific details.
- Be aware of any biases or assumptions that may influence your interpretation of the passage.
- Always double-check your answer to ensure that it accurately reflects the information in the passage.
