Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand the mistake. Here's my reflection on the problem and my previous solution:

Mistake 1: I assigned parking space #1 to Young, which violates the rule that Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
