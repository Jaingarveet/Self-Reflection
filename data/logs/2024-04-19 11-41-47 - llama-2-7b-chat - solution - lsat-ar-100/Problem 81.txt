I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I realize that I misunderstood the requirements of the problem. Let me re-evaluate the situation.

The organizer of the reading club must select at least five and at most six works from the given group of nine works. The requirements are:

* No more than four French works are selected.
* At least three but no more than four novels are selected.
* At least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected.
* If both French plays are selected, then the Russian play is not selected.

From the given choices, the only possible answer is (C): All three plays are selected.

Action: Answer("C")

Explanation:
The organizer can select at most six works, and there are three French plays and two Russian plays in the group. If the organizer selects both French plays, then they cannot select the Russian play, which means they have selected five works. Therefore, the only possible answer is (C).
