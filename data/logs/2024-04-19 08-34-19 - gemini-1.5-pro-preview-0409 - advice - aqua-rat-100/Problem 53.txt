## Assistant 2:
Thought:
I recall this question and my previous incorrect response. 
I made an error in setting up the equations based on the given information. 
After reviewing the problem and the correct solution, I understand that I need to carefully translate the word problem into mathematical equations, paying close attention to the relationships described. 
I will use a step-by-step approach to ensure accuracy this time.
Let x be the amount Arjun has and y be the amount Sajal has.
From the given information:
*   If Arjun gives $30 to Sajal, Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun: y + 30 = 2(x - 30)
*   If Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal: x + 10 = 3(y - 10)
Solving these equations will give the amounts Arjun and Sajal have. 
Action: Answer("E") 
## Result:
Agent Answer: E
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
