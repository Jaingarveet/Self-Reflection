## Assistant 2:
Thought:
I recall this question and my previous incorrect reasoning. 
The key is to focus on the relative speed, not just the individual speeds. 
Let's analyze it step-by-step.
1. **Relative Speed:** If the plane is 10 times faster than the ship, their combined speed is 11 times the ship's speed.
2. **Time to Meet:** They will meet when the plane has covered the 180 miles the ship had already traveled. Since the plane is 10 times faster, it will take 1/10th of the time the ship took to cover that distance.
3. **Distance by Plane:** Using the time from step 2, we can find the distance the plane traveled: (10 * ship's speed) * (1/10 * time taken by ship) = 180 miles (as expected).
4. **Total Distance:**  The total distance from the starting point is the distance the ship traveled plus the distance the plane traveled: 180 miles (ship) + 180 miles (plane) = 360 miles. 
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
