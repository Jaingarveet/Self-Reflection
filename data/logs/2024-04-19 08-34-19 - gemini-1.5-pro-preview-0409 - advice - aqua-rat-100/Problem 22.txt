## Assistant 2:
Thought:
My previous approach of assuming equal work hours was incorrect. I need to consider the relative work rates. 
Alex makes 1 toy in 7 hours, so his rate is 1/7 toys per hour.
Jacob makes 1 toy in 9 hours, so his rate is 1/9 toys per hour.
Their combined rate is (1/7 + 1/9) toys per hour.
Let x be the number of toys Jacob made. Then Alex made (35-x) toys.
Since they worked similar hours, we can set up the equation: (time) * (Jacob's rate) = x and (time) * (Alex's rate) = 35-x
This simplifies to: (1/9) * (time) = x and (1/7) * (time) = 35-x
Solving this system of equations will give the value of x, which is the number of toys Jacob made.
