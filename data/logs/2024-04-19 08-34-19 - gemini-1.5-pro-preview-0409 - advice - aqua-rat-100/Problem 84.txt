## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The key to solving this problem is recognizing that the chairs are identical. This means that the order of the children matters, but their specific positions on the chairs do not. 
Since Susan must be to the left of Tim, we have two possible arrangements: 
1. Susan - Tim - Zen
2. Zen - Susan - Tim 
Therefore, there are 2 ways to arrange the children.
Action: Answer("C")
