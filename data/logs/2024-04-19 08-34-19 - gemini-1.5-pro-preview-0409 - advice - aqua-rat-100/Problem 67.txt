## Assistant 2:
Thought:
I recall this question and my previous incorrect approach. I need to carefully set up the ratios and ensure consistent units.
Let's use "F" for the amount of falafel in one pita bread. 
*  6 pita breads = 2 rolls --> 6F = 2R (amount of falafel in one roll)
*  3 rolls = 5 baguettes --> 3R = 5B (amount of falafel in one baguette)
*  We need to find the equivalent of 2B in terms of F.
Combining the equations:
*  From the first equation, R = 3F.
*  Substituting into the second equation, 3(3F) = 5B --> B = 9F/5.
*  Therefore, 2B = 2 * (9F/5) = 18F/5.
This means 2 baguettes have the same amount of falafel as 18/5 pita breads.
Action: Answer("E")
