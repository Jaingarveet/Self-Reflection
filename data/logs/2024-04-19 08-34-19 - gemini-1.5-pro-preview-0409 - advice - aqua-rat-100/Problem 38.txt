## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The total number of small cubes is 5*5*5 = 125.
The number of small cubes on the outer layer is found by subtracting the inner cube from the total. The inner cube has a side length of 3cm (5cm - 2*1cm), so it contains 3*3*3 = 27 cubes.
Therefore, there are 125 - 27 = 98 small cubes on the outer layer.
Each small cube on the outer layer has 1 face painted. So, 98 small cubes have 1 painted face.
The remaining small cubes (27) are not painted on any face.
Thus, the total number of unpainted faces is 98*5 + 27*6 = 656.
