## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The relationship between men and days is inverse proportion. 
More men will take less days and vice versa.
Let's set up the equation: 
8 men * 6 days = x men * 1/2 day
Solving for x: x = (8 * 6) / (1/2) = 96 men 
Action: Answer("D") 
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
