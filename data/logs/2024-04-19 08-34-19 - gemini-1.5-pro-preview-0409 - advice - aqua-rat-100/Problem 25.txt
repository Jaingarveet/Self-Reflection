Question: A car is being driven, in a straight line and at a uniform speed, towards the base of a vertical tower. The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower?
Choices:
  A: 5(√3 + 1)
  B: 6(√3 + √2)
  C: 7(√3 – 1)
  D: 8(√3 – 2)
  E: None of these

## Assistant 2:
## Reflection on Previous Attempt:
In my previous attempt, I made an error in calculating the distances involved. I incorrectly assumed a direct relationship between the angle of elevation and the distance traveled, which led to an inaccurate answer. 
## Corrected Approach:
1. **Diagram and Variables:**  We can visualize the problem with a right triangle where the tower is the vertical side, the initial distance to the tower is the base, and the line of sight is the hypotenuse. Let's denote:
    - Height of the tower as *h*
    - Initial distance to the tower as *x*
    - Distance traveled in 10 minutes as *d*
    - Speed of the car as *s*
2. **Trigonometry and Equations:** Using the given angles of elevation (45° and 60°) and the right triangle, we can set up two equations:
    - tan(45°) = h/x  ->  h = x  (since tan(45°) = 1)
    - tan(60°) = h/(x-d)  ->  h = √3(x-d)
3. **Solving for d:** Equating the two expressions for h, we get:
    - x = √3(x-d)
    - x = √3x - √3d
    - d = x(√3 - 1)/√3
4. **Time to Reach the Base:** The remaining distance to the base of the tower is (x-d). Since the speed is constant, the time taken will be:
    - Time = Distance/Speed = (x-d)/s
5. **Substituting and Simplifying:** Substitute the expression for d from step 3:
    - Time = [x - x(√3 - 1)/√3] / s
    - Time = x(1 - (√3 - 1)/√3) / s
    - Time = x / (s√3)
6. **Relating to Given Information:** We know that the car traveled distance d in 10 minutes. So, d = 10s. Using the expression for d from step 3:
    - 10s = x(√3 - 1)/√3
    - x / (s√3) = 10 / (√3 - 1)
7. **Final Answer:** Comparing this with the expression for time in step 5, we see that the time taken to reach the base is:
    - Time = 10 / (√3 - 1) minutes
To match the format of the answer choices, we can rationalize the denominator:
    - Time = 10(√3 + 1) / (3 - 1) minutes
    - Time = 5(√3 + 1) minutes
Therefore, the car will reach the base of the tower in **5(√3 + 1) minutes**.
