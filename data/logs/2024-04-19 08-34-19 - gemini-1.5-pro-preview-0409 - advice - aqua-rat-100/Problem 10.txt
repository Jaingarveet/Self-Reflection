## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Choices:
  A: 50 m
  B: 75 m
  C: 100 m
  D: 125 m
  E: 150 m
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Advice:
 - Be cautious of making assumptions, especially when the calculated answer is not among the choices.
 - Consider all relevant factors and relationships in the problem.
 - Pay attention to the units of measurement and ensure consistency throughout the calculations.
 - Remember that distance, speed, and time are related, and use this relationship to solve problems. 
 - When dealing with motion problems, consider the starting point and direction of movement.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The shuttle's speed is 700m / 40s = 17.5 m/s. 
In 5 seconds, it travels 17.5 m/s * 5s = 87.5m.
Since 87.5m isn't a choice, I need to consider the shuttle's length. 
The 87.5m includes the shuttle's length twice (front and back).
Therefore, the shuttle's length is 87.5m / 2 = 43.75m.
This is still not an option, so I need to re-evaluate the problem.
The shuttle travels its length PLUS 700m in 40 seconds.
So, it travels 700m in 35 seconds (40s - 5s for its length).
Thus, its speed is 700m / 35s = 20 m/s.
In 5 seconds, it travels 20 m/s * 5s = 100m.
Action: Answer("C") 
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
