Context: An economist suggested that when transferring polluting industries from developed countries to developing countries, developed countries benefited from the improvement of the natural environment; although the developing countries were polluted by the environment, they were compensated for solving employment and increasing taxes.As a result, the situation on both sides has improved, resulting in an increase in total global welfare.
Question: Which of the following is the hypothesis discussed by the economist?
Choices:
  A: A good natural environment is more important for people in developed countries than people in developing countries.
  B: Both developed and developing countries have polluting enterprises.
  C: The degree of environmental pollution in developed countries is more serious than in developing countries.

Solution:
The economist's hypothesis is based on the idea that transferring polluting industries from developed to developing countries can increase total global welfare. This is because developed countries benefit from an improved natural environment, while developing countries, despite suffering environmental pollution, gain employment and increased taxes. This implies that a good natural environment is more important for people in developed countries than people in developing countries (A), which is the correct answer.
