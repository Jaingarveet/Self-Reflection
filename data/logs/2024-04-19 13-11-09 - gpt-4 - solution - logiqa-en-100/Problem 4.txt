Solution:
Given that J is the fourth speaker, this means J speaks after lunch. 
From the conditions, we know that G must speak before lunch, so G must be one of the first three speakers. 
Also, F must speak in the first or third place. 
Since J is the fourth speaker, the third speaker cannot be J, so the third speaker must be F. 
However, considering the condition that "Only one speaker is between M and N", if F is the third speaker, there would be no way to place M and N with one speaker between them. Therefore, the third speaker must be either [REDACTED].
