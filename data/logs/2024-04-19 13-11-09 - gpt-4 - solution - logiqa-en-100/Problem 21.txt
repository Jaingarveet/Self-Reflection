Context: Xiao Chen? At present, part of the orbit of Comet 1996D3 is far from the sun, but recently it can be found to emit flickering light through the solar telescope.In the past, people never observed such flashes of comets far away from the sun, so this flicker must be an unusual scene.Xiao Wang? Normally people don't observe comets far away from the sun.The 1996D3 comet flicker light discovered this time was obtained by continuous and careful tracking observation.
Question: Which of the following most accurately summarizes the method Xiao Wang used to refute Xiao Chen's views?
Choices:
  A: Point out that the key concepts used by Xiao Chen are ambiguous.
  B: pointed out that Xiao Chen's argument is clearly lacking in persuasion.
  C: pointed out that Xiao Chen's arguments contradict themselves.
  D: Disagree with Xiao Chen's conclusion, and put forward another explanation for Xiao Chen's argument.E.Agree with Xiao Chen's conclusion, but put forward another explanation for Xiao Chen's argument.

Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
Xiao Wang refutes Xiao Chen's views by pointing out that the observation of the comet's flicker was not unusual but was the result of continuous and careful tracking observation. This suggests that the flicker might have been observed before if such careful observation had been done. However, this doesn't provide an alternative explanation, but rather points out that Xiao Chen's argument is lacking in persuasion because it's based on an assumption. Therefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED]
