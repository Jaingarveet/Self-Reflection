Explanation:
I miscalculated the interest rate by dividing the amount borrowed by the number of installments and the installment amount. I misunderstood the problem and thought it was asking for the total interest paid, rather than the interest rate.

Error Keywords:

* Misunderstanding the problem
* Calculation error
* Division error

Solution:
The man borrowed Rs.360.
He will pay it back in 12 monthly installments of Rs.31.50.
The interest rate is the amount of interest paid per year, divided by the amount borrowed.
The interest rate can be calculated by dividing the amount borrowed by the number of installments and the installment amount:
Interest rate = (Amount borrowed / Number of installments) x (Installment amount / 12)

Using the given values:
Interest rate = (Rs.360 / 12) x (Rs.31.50 / 12)
Interest rate = [REDACTED]

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) [REDACTED].
