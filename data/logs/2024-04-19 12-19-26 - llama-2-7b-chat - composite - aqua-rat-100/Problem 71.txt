## Assistant 2:
  Thought: 
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand the mistake. To solve this problem, I need to use the concept of relative speed, which is the speed at which the two cars are moving relative to each other.

Action: Answer("B")

Explanation:
The relative speed between the two cars is 13 - 12 = 1 mph. Since the highway is 50 miles long, it will take the cars x hours to meet, where x = 50 / (13 - 12) = 6.67 hours. Therefore, the cars will meet after 6.67 hours.

Reflection:
I reflected on my previous mistake and realized that I misunderstood the problem. I overlooked the concept of relative speed and calculated the time it would take for the cars to meet based on their absolute speeds instead. Thank you for providing feedback and giving me the opportunity to improve my answer.
