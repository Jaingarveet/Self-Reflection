Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
The student made a mistake by finding the value of 7/18 instead of 7/8 of a number. To find the correct answer, we need to determine the value of 7/8 of the number.

7/8 = 9/18

So, the number is:

x = 9/18

Now, the student's answer is:

x' = 7/18

The difference between the two answers is:

|x - x'| = |9/18 - 7/18| = 2/18

The correct answer is:

Action: Answer("[REDACTED]")

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) [REDACTED].
