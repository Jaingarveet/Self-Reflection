Question: 20 marbles were pulled out of a bag of only white marbles, painted black, and then put back in. Then, another 20 marbles were pulled out, of which 1 was black, after which they were all returned to the bag. If the percentage of black marbles pulled out the second time represents their percentage in the bag, how many marbles in total Q does the bag currently hold?

Question: 20 marbles were pulled out of a bag of only white marbles, painted black, and then put back in. Then, another 20 marbles were pulled out, of which 1 was black, after which they were all returned to the bag. If the percentage of black marbles pulled out the second time represents their percentage in the bag, how many marbles in total Q does the bag currently hold?

Reflection:

I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I realized that I made a mistake in my calculation. I misunderstood the problem and calculated the total number of marbles incorrectly.

Error Keywords:

* Misunderstood the problem
* Calculated the total number of marbles incorrectly

Solution:

To solve this problem, we need to use the information given in the question. We know that 20 marbles were pulled out of the bag the first time, and 1 of them was black. This means that the percentage of black marbles in the first pull is 1/20 = 0.05.

We also know that the second time, 20 marbles were pulled out, and 1 of them was black. This means that the percentage of black marbles in the second pull is 1/20 = 0.05 again.

Since the percentage of black marbles in the second pull is the same as the percentage of black marbles in the first pull, we can use the same percentage to calculate the total number of marbles in the bag.

Total number of marbles = (Number of black marbles in the first pull x Percentage of black marbles in the first pull) + (Number of black marbles in the second pull x Percentage of black marbles in the second pull)

Substituting the values given in the question, we get:

Total number of marbles = (1/20 x 0.05) + (1/20 x 0.05) = 0.1 + 0.1 = 0.2

Therefore, the total number of marbles in the bag is 200.

Advice:

To avoid making the same mistake again, I will carefully read and understand the problem before starting to calculate the solution. I will also make sure to use the correct formula and values given in the question to calculate the total number of marbles.

Evaluation:

Correct answer: 200

Explanation:
The total number of marbles in the bag is 200, which is calculated by using the percentage of black marbles in the first and second pulls.
