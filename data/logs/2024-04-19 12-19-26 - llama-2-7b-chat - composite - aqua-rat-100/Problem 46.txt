Error Keywords:

* Calculation error
* Arithmetic error
* Percentage error

Solution:
To find the monthly income of the man, we need to calculate it using the formula:
Monthly Income = Total Income / (1 - Savings Percentage)

Monthly Income = Rs. 3500 / (1 - 0.125)

Monthly Income = Rs. 3500 / 0.875

Monthly Income = Rs. 4000

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) Rs. 4000.
