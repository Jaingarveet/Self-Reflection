## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: A cyclist travels at 12 miles per hour. How many minutes will it take to travel 48 miles?
Choices:
  A: 1
  B: 240
  C: 30
  D: 60
  E: 120
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I misunderstood the problem and calculated the time incorrectly. I thought the problem was asking for the time it would take to travel a distance of 48 miles, but it was actually asking for the time it would take to travel a distance of 48 miles divided by the speed of the cyclist.

Error Keywords:

* Misunderstanding the problem
* Calculation error
* Division error

Solution:
The correct solution is:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 48 miles / [REDACTED]2 miles/hour = 4 hours

Instructions:

[REDACTED]. Identify the distance and speed given in the problem.
2. Divide the distance by the speed to find the time.
3. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.
4. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
5. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.

Advice:

* Always read the problem carefully and understand the given information.
* Always break down complex problems into smaller, manageable steps.
* Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
* Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
* Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
* Remember that division is the inverse operation of multiplication, so when dividing a number by another number, you are essentially multiplying by the reciprocal of the divisor.
