Question: A company produces 420 units of a particular computer component every month, at a production cost to the company of $110 per component, and sells all of the components by the end of each month. What is the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee that the yearly profit (revenue from sales minus production costs) will be at least $626,400 ?

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I realized that I made a mistake in my calculation. I reflected on my solution and the correct answer, and I understand now that the minimum selling price per component to guarantee a yearly profit of at least $626,400 is $240.

Here is my thought process:

* I calculated the total production cost for the year as 420 units x $110 per unit = $46,800.
* I subtracted the production cost from the revenue from sales to calculate the yearly profit: $626,400 - $46,800 = $580,600.
* To ensure a yearly profit of at least $626,400, the minimum selling price per component must be greater than or equal to $580,600 / 420 units = $1,387 per component.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) $240.
## Result:
Agent Answer: None
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
