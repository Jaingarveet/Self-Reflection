Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I misinterpreted the problem and calculated the wrong answer. I thought that the team lost [REDACTED]% of their matches, which is 6 matches, but the correct answer is [REDACTED] matches.

Error Keywords:

* Misinterpretation
* Calculation error
* Percentage error

Solution:
The tennis team won 20 matches and lost [REDACTED]% of their matches.
[REDACTED]% of 20 matches is 6 matches.
The team lost 6 matches.

Instructions:

1. Identify the number of matches the team won.
2. Identify the percentage of matches the team lost.
[REDACTED]. Calculate the number of matches the team lost by multiplying the percentage of matches lost by the number of matches won.
4. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.
[REDACTED]. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
6. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.

Advice:

* Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.

Question: During one season, a tennis team won 20 matches and lost 30% of their matches. What was the number of matches that the team lost?

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly. I misinterpreted the problem and calculated the wrong answer. I thought that the team lost 6 matches, but the correct answer is 3 matches.

Error Keywords:

* Misinterpretation
* Calculation error
* Percentage error

Solution:
The tennis team won 20 matches and lost 30% of their matches.
30% of 20 matches is 6 matches.
The team lost 6 matches.

Mathematical Steps:

1. Identify the number of matches the team won: 20 matches
2. Identify the percentage of matches the team lost: 30%
3. Calculate the number of matches the team lost by multiplying the percentage of matches lost by the number of matches won: 6 matches x 30% = 1.8 matches (round up to the nearest whole number)
4. Double-check the calculation: 20 matches - 1.8 matches = 18.2 matches (round down to the nearest whole number)

Answer: B - 3 matches

Explanation: The team lost 3 matches.
