Explanation:
I apologize for my mistake in the previous response. You are correct, the correct answer is (E) [REDACTED].

Here's how I arrived at the correct answer:

Let's analyze the problem step by step:

1. The man has 5 sons, 4 daughters, and 2 nephews.
2. Each daughter receives 4 times as much as each nephew. So, each daughter receives:
4 x Rs 8600 = Rs 35200
3. Each son receives 5 times as much as each nephew. So, each son receives:
5 x Rs 8600 = Rs 43000
4. Total amount of money distributed = Rs 35200 + Rs 43000 = Rs 78200

Therefore, the correct answer is (E) [REDACTED].
