Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:

We are given the following information in the problem:

* Silu weighs 51 kg.
* Meenu weighs 29 kg + half of her weight.

We need to find Meenu's weight.

Let's use the information given in the problem to find Meenu's weight:

Meenu's weight = 29 kg + (1/2)x

where x is Meenu's weight.

We know that Silu's weight is 51 kg, so Meenu's weight is half of Silu's weight plus 29 kg:

Meenu's weight = 51 kg / 2 = 25.5 kg + 29 kg = 54.5 kg

Therefore, Meenu weighs 54.5 kg.

The correct answer is (D) 54.5 kg.

Error Keywords:

* Half of weight
* Multiplication
* Subtraction

Solution:
Instructions:

1. Identify the information given in the problem.
2. Use the information to find Meenu's weight.
3. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.
4. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
5. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.

Advice:

* Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
* Always use the information given in the problem to find the answer.
* Always work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.
* Always double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
* Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them.

To find Meenu's weight, we are given that Silu weighs 51 kg and Meenu weighs 29 kg + half of her weight.

Let's use the information given in the problem to find Meenu's weight:

Meenu's weight = 29 kg + (1/2)x

where x is Meenu's weight.

We know that Silu's weight is 51 kg, so Meenu's weight is half of Silu's weight plus 29 kg:

Meenu's weight = 51 kg / 2 = 25.5 kg + 29 kg = 54.5 kg

Therefore, Meenu weighs 54.5 kg.

The correct answer is (D) 54.5 kg.

Error Keywords:

Solution:

1. Identify the information given in the problem:
Meenu's weight = 29 kg + (1/2)x
Silu's weight = 51 kg

2. Use the information to find Meenu's weight:
Meenu's weight = 29 kg + (1/2)x
Meenu's weight = 51 kg / 2 = 25.5 kg + 29 kg = 54.5 kg

3. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations:
Meenu's weight = 29 kg + (1/2)x
Meenu's weight = 29 kg + (1/2)(54.5 kg)
Meenu's weight = 29 kg + 27.75 kg = 56.75 kg

4. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy:
Meenu's weight = 56.75 kg

5. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result:
The correct answer is (D) 54.5 kg.
