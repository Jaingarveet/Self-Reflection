## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: Points A, B, C, D lie in this order on the circumference of a circle. Minor arc AC is 160°, and minor arc BD is 150°. If B bisects minor arc AC, then what is the measure of minor arc AD?
Choices:
  A: 80°
  B: 130°
  C: 140°
  D: 160°
  E: 220°
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I made a mistake in my reasoning and calculation. I misunderstood the question and overlooked an important detail.

The correct solution is:

If [REDACTED] bisects minor arc A[REDACTED], then the measure of minor arc A[REDACTED] is equal to the difference between the measures of minor arcs A[REDACTED] and B[REDACTED].

In this case, the measure of minor arc A[REDACTED] is [REDACTED], and the measure of minor arc B[REDACTED] is 150°. Therefore, the measure of minor arc A[REDACTED] is:

A[REDACTED] = A[REDACTED] - B[REDACTED] = [REDACTED] - 150° = 10°

So, the correct answer is (B) 10°.

Solution:
Instructions:

1. Identify the given information:
Points A, B, C, D lie in this order on the circumference of a circle.
Minor arc AC is 160°.
Minor arc BD is 150°.
B bisects minor arc AC.
2. Use the given information to find the measure of minor arc AD:
If B bisects minor arc AC, then the measure of minor arc AD is equal to the difference between the measures of minor arcs AC and AD.
In this case, the measure of minor arc AC is 160°, and the measure of minor arc AD is 10°. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 10°.
