## Assistant 2:
  Thank you for the feedback! I'm glad to see that I was able to arrive at the correct answer with your guidance. Here's my thought process for this question:

1. I started by reading the question carefully and identifying the key information: A started a business with Rs.40,000, B joined after 2 months with Rs.60,000, and C joined after some more time with Rs.120,000.
2. I then realized that the total profit at the end of the year was Rs.375,000, and C's share of the profit was Rs.150,000.
3. I deduced that B joined the business 4 months after A started, as there are 2 months between A starting the business and B joining.
4. I then calculated the time period between B joining and C joining, which is 8 months.
5. Finally, I selected the answer (E) 8 months, as it was the only option that matched the information provided in the question.

I hope this explanation helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can help with.
