Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I misunderstood the problem and calculated the time incorrectly. I thought Roy would take 5 tablets in total, but the problem states that he is asked to take one tablet every 15 minutes. Therefore, it will take Roy 5 x 15 = 75 minutes to consume all 5 tablets.

Error Keywords:

* Misunderstanding the problem
* Calculation error
* Time estimation

Solution:
Roy will take 5 tablets in total, and he is asked to take one tablet every 15 minutes.
The time it will take Roy to consume all 5 tablets is:
75 minutes (5 x 15 minutes)

Instructions:

1. Identify the number of tablets Roy is given.
2. Calculate the time it takes Roy to take one tablet.
3. Calculate the time it will take Roy to consume all 5 tablets.
4. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.
5. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
6. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.

Advice:

* Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
* Break down complex problems into smaller, manageable steps.
* Double-check your calculations and final answer.
* Remember that time estimation can be tricky, so make sure to use the correct units and calculations.

  Great, let's solve this problem together!

To find out how much time it will take Roy to consume all 5 tablets, we need to calculate the time it takes him to take one tablet and then multiply it by the number of tablets he is given.

1. First, let's calculate the time it takes Roy to take one tablet:

Time to take one tablet = 15 minutes (as given in the problem)

So, Roy takes one tablet every 15 minutes.

2. Now, let's calculate the time it will take Roy to consume all 5 tablets:

Time to consume all 5 tablets = 5 x 15 minutes = 75 minutes

Therefore, it will take Roy 75 minutes to consume all 5 tablets.

Now, let's choose the answer that matches our calculated result:

Answer("D") - 75 minutes

Great job! You have successfully solved the problem. Remember to always read the question carefully, break down complex problems into smaller steps, and double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
