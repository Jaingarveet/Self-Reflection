Question: Kevin drove from A to B at a constant speed of 70 mph. Once he reached B, he turned right around with pause, and returned to A at a constant speed of 90 mph. Exactly 3 hours before the end of his trip, he was still approaching B, only 70 miles away from it. What is the distance between A and B?

Self-Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I realized that I made a mistake in my calculation. I misunderstood the information given in the problem and calculated the distance incorrectly. I will use my self-reflection to help me answer the question correctly this time.

Error Keywords:
* Misunderstood the information given in the problem
* Calculated the distance incorrectly

Solution:
To find the distance between A and B, we need to use the formula: distance = speed x time.
We know that Kevin drove at a constant speed of 70 mph for the entire trip, so the distance he traveled can be calculated as:
distance = 70 x 3 = 210 miles

Therefore, the distance between A and B is 210 miles.

Advice:
When solving a problem, it's important to read the question carefully and make sure you understand what is being asked. In this case, I misunderstood the information given in the problem and calculated the distance incorrectly. To avoid making the same mistake, I will make sure to read the question carefully and double-check my calculations.

Answer: (C) 210 miles
## Result:
Agent Answer: None
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
