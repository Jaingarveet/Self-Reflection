Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I made a mistake in my reasoning and calculation. I used the concept of relative speed correctly, but I misunderstood the problem statement.

The problem states that the plane started with 10 times the speed of the ship, but I misunderstood this to mean that the plane started at a speed of 100 miles per hour, which is not the correct answer.

The correct calculation is:

The distance traveled by the ship = 180 miles
The distance traveled by the plane = 180 miles x 10 = 1800 miles

Therefore, the distance between the starting point and where they meet is 1800 miles.

Error Keywords:

* Misunderstanding problem statement
* Calculation error
* Relative speed

Solution:

The ship traveled 180 miles, and the plane traveled 1800 miles. Therefore, the distance between the starting point and where they meet is 1800 miles.

Instructions:

1. Identify the speed of the ship and the speed of the plane.
2. Use the concept of relative speed to find the distance traveled by the plane.
3. Calculate the distance between the starting point and where they meet.
4. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
5. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.

Advice:

* Always read the problem statement carefully and ensure you understand what is being asked.
* Use the correct units for your calculations to avoid mistakes.
* Double-check your calculations and ensure accuracy before making a final answer.
* Use the concept of relative speed to solve problems involving motion.
