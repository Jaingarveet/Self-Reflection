## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Question: Let A and B be independent events with P(A) = 0.2 and P(B) = 0.8. Find P(A/B)?

Reflection:

I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand the mistake. The correct solution is:

P(A/B) = P(A) / P(B) = 0.2 / 0.8 = 0.25

Explanation:

To find P(A/B), we need to divide the probability of A by the probability of B. Since A and B are independent events, we can use the formula:

P(A/B) = P(A) / P(B)

In this case, P(A) = 0.2 and P(B) = 0.8, so we can plug these values into the formula to get:

P(A/B) = 0.2 / 0.8 = 0.25

Advice:
When solving probability problems, it's important to carefully read the question and understand the requirements. In this case, we needed to divide the probability of A by the probability of B, which can be a tricky concept to grasp. Take your time and make sure you understand the problem before starting to solve it.
