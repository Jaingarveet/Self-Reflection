  A: 10
  B: 11.5
  C: 12.5
  D: 13.5
  E: 15
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I made a calculation error in my previous answer. I misunderstood the information provided in the question and made an incorrect assumption about the train's speed after it started raining.

The correct calculation for the total journey duration is as follows:

1. The train covers the first quarter of the distance at a speed of [REDACTED]0 miles/hour, which means it covers 25% of the total distance in [REDACTED] hours (since the train runs at a speed of [REDACTED]0 miles/hour for [REDACTED] hours).
2. After covering a quarter of the distance, the train's speed is reduced to 75 miles/hour, which means it covers the remaining distance at a speed of 75 miles/hour.
3. The total distance traveled by the train is half of the total distance, which is equal to the distance traveled before the rain plus the distance traveled after the rain.
4. The distance traveled before the rain is equal to the distance traveled in the first [REDACTED] hours (25% of the total distance).
5. The distance traveled after the rain is equal to the remaining distance (50% of the total distance).

Therefore, the total journey duration is:

[REDACTED] hours (distance traveled in the first [REDACTED] hours) + 5 hours (distance traveled after the rain) = [REDACTED] hours

So, the correct answer is (C) [REDACTED] hours.
