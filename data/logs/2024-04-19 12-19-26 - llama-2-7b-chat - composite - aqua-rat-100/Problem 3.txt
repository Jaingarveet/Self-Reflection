Question: A square piece of cloth is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge to form a rectangular piece, which is then cut diagonally in half to create two triangles. If the area of each of the triangles is 70 square feet, what was the perimeter (in feet) of the original piece of square cloth?

Self-Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, stating that the perimeter of the original square cloth was 56 feet. Upon further reflection, I realized that my mistake was in not properly calculating the perimeter of the rectangular piece that was formed after trimming the square cloth.

To find the perimeter of the rectangular piece, I need to add the lengths of all four sides. The length of each side is half the length of the original square cloth, which is 4 feet. Therefore, the perimeter of the rectangular piece is:

Perimeter = 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 16 feet

So, the perimeter of the original square cloth was 16 feet. The correct answer is (B) 58 feet.

Advice: When solving problems, it is important to carefully read and understand the question, and to double-check your work to ensure that you have arrived at the correct answer. In this case, I made a mistake by not properly calculating the perimeter of the rectangular piece, which led to an incorrect answer.
