Question: A paper is in a square form whose one side is 20 cm. Two semi circles are drawn on its opposites as diameters. If these semi circles are cut down what is the area of the remaining paper?

Self-Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and upon reflection, I realized that I made a mistake in my calculation. I misunderstood the problem and calculated the area of the remaining paper incorrectly.

Error Keywords:

* Misunderstood the problem
* Calculated the area of the remaining paper incorrectly

Solution:
To find the area of the remaining paper, we need to calculate the area of the two semi-circles and then subtract it from the total area of the original square paper.

The area of each semi-circle is equal to πr^2, where r is the radius of the semi-circle. Since the semi-circles are drawn as diameters, the radius of each semi-circle is half the length of the side of the square paper.

So, the area of each semi-circle is:

π(10 cm)^2 = 87.5 cm^2

Now, we need to subtract the area of the two semi-circles from the total area of the original square paper:

Total area of the original square paper = 20 cm x 20 cm = 400 cm^2

Area of remaining paper = Total area of the original square paper - Area of two semi-circles
= 400 cm^2 - 87.5 cm^2
= 312.5 cm^2

Therefore, the area of the remaining paper is 312.5 cm^2.

Advice:
To avoid making the same mistake again, I will carefully read and understand the problem before starting the calculation. I will also use the correct formula and units to ensure accuracy in my calculation.
