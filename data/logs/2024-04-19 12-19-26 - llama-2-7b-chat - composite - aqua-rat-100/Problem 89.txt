Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
You are correct that to calculate the maximum distance we can travel with $8.50 on a cab, we need to find the distance we can travel with $8.50 before reaching the next quarter-mile boundary.

You calculated the distance correctly as follows:

Distance = $8.50 / $3.50 = 2.5 quarter-miles

However, the correct answer is (B) [REDACTED].

The cab charges $3.50 for the first quarter-mile and $0.10 for each additional quarter-mile. Since you can travel 2.5 quarter-miles with $8.50, you will have $8.50 - $3.50 = $5.00 left after paying for the first quarter-mile.

The next quarter-mile will cost $0.10, so you can travel an additional 0.25 quarter-miles (25% of 1 quarter-mile) with the remaining $5.00, which is equal to 0.25 x 1 quarter-mile = 0.25 miles.

Therefore, the maximum distance you can travel with $8.50 on a cab is:

Distance = 2.5 quarter-miles + 0.25 miles = [REDACTED]

So, the correct answer is (B) [REDACTED].

Well done!
