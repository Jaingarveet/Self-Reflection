## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Topic: Math
Question: A rectangular piece of 150 sq m has a length which is 1m more than the 4 times the breadth. What is the perimeter of the piece?
Choices:
  A: 60 m
  B: 61 m
  C: 62 m
  D: 63 m
  E: 64 m
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I made a mistake in my reasoning and calculation. I incorrectly set up the equation for the perimeter of the rectangle.

Error Keywords:

* Misunderstanding the equation
* Incorrect equation
* Calculation mistake

Solution:
The perimeter of a rectangle is found by adding the lengths of all four sides. The correct equation is:

Perimeter = 2(Length + Width)

Since the length is 1m more than 4 times the breadth, we can set up the equation:

Length = 4[REDACTED] + 1

Now, we can substitute the value of Length in terms of [REDACTED]:

Length = 4[REDACTED] + 1

Perimeter = 2(4[REDACTED] + 1)

Perimeter = 8[REDACTED] + 2

Therefore, the perimeter of the rectangular piece is [REDACTED] (Answer: C).

Instructions:

1. Identify the dimensions of the rectangle.
2. Write the equation for the perimeter of a rectangle.
3. Use the given information to set up the equation for the length of the rectangle.
4. Solve the equation for the length.
5. Use the value of length to find the perimeter of the rectangle.
6. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
Advice:

* Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
* Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
* Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
* Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
* Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
* Remember that the perimeter of a rectangle is found by adding the lengths of all four sides.
