Context: A bakery makes exactly three kinds of cookieâ€”oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar. Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day. The following conditions apply: No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
Question: If the number of batches made on Friday is exactly one, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: The first batch of sugar cookies is made on Monday.
  B: The first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Tuesday.
  C: The third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Friday.

## Assistant 2:
Reflection:
I previously made an incorrect assumption that the second batch of peanut butter cookies was made on Wednesday, which led me to choose the wrong answer. However, upon re-reading the conditions, I realized that the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies, so they cannot be made on separate days.

Thought:
Since only one batch is made on Friday, it cannot be the second batch of any kind of cookie, as that would mean two batches of the same kind of cookie would be made on the same day. Therefore, the third batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Friday.

Now let's consider each choice:

A: The first batch of sugar cookies cannot be made on Monday because at least one batch of cookies is made on Monday, and since the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, the first batch cannot be made on Monday.

B: The first batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Tuesday because the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies, and since the third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Friday, the first batch cannot be made on Tuesday.

C: This is a possible answer since the third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Friday.

D: The first batch of peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Wednesday because it is made on the same day as the second batch of oatmeal cookies, and since the third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Friday, the first batch of peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Wednesday.

E: The second batch of peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Tuesday because it is made on the same day as the second batch of oatmeal cookies, and since the third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Friday, the second batch of peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Tuesday.
