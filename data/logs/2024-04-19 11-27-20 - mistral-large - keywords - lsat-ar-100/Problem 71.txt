## Assistant 2:
Reflection:
I made an incorrect assumption that Parra and Quinn work in Zone 1, which led me to a logical reasoning error. I also did not consider all the given conditions, resulting in incomplete information.

Thought:
Let's analyze the given conditions step-by-step:

1. Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
2. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
3. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
4. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
5. There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

From conditions 1 and 3, we can deduce that if Parra is in Zone 1, then Quinn must also be in Zone 1. However, this would mean that there is no space left for Tiao in Zone 1. Therefore, Tiao must be in Zone 1, and Parra and Quinn must be in a different zone together.

Now, since Tiao is in Zone 1, Udall cannot be in Zone 2 (condition 2). This means that Stuckey and Udall must be in Zone 3 together.

Since there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, and we already have Stuckey and Udall in Zone 3, there must be at least one more representative in Zone 3. The only remaining pair is Parra and Quinn, so they must also be in Zone 3.

Action: Answer("E")
