Context: A maintenance company that takes service requests from three clients—Image, Solide, and Truvest—plans to set targets for its average service response times. Service targets will be set at 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day.

The six targets are set according to the following conditions: None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.

## Assistant 2:
Thought:
The conditions state that none of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target, and Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
This means that Image's voicemail target must be either 1 or 2 days, and the other clients' voicemail targets must be either 2 or 3 days.
Additionally, Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.

Based on these conditions, the only target that cannot be set for more than one client is a 1-day website target. This is because none of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target, and Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Therefore, Image's website target must be either 1 or 2 days, and the other clients' website targets must be either 2 or 3 days.

Action: Answer("A")
