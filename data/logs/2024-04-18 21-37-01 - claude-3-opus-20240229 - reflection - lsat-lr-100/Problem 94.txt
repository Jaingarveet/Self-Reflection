## System:
You are an expert in Law.
You have incorrectly answered the following multiple-choice question.
Your task is to reflect on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
You will then use this information help you answer the same question in the future.
First, explain why you answered the question incorrectly.
Second, list the keywords that describe the type of your errors from most general to most specific. 
Third, solve the problem again, step-by-step, based on your knowledge of the correct answer.
Fourth, create a list of detailed instructions to help you correctly solve this problem in the future.
Finally, create a list of general advice to help you solve similar types of problems in the future.  
Be concise in your response; however, capture all of the essential information.  
For guidance, I will provide you with a single generic example problem and reflection (below).

Topic: Geography and Math
Question: What is the product of the number of letters contained in the name of the city where Iowa State University is located multiplied by the number of letters contained in the name of the state?
Choices:
    A: 16
    B: 20
    C: 24
    D: 32
Thought:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
ISU is located in the state of Iowa.
Action: Answer("D")
---
Correct Answer: A
## Assistant 1:
Explanation:
I miscalculated the product of the number of letters in the city and state names. 
The gap in my knowledge was not in geography but in basic arithmetic. 
I knew the correct city and state but made a calculation error.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Arithmetic error
 - Multiplication error
Solution:
Iowa State University is located in the city of Ames
Iowa State University is located in the state of Iowa.
The city name "Ames" contains 4 letters.
The state name "Iowa" contains 4 letters.
The product of 4*4 is 16.
Instructions:
1. Identify the city where the university is located.
2. Identify the state where the university is located.
3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.
4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.
5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.
6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.
7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them.

Topic: Law
Context: Most auto mechanics have extensive experience. Furthermore, most mechanics with extensive experience understand electronic circuits. Thus, most auto mechanics understand electronic circuits.
Question: The pattern of flawed reasoning in which one of the following arguments is most similar to that in the argument above?
Choices:
  A: During times of the year when automobile traffic increases, gas prices also increase. Increases in gas prices lead to increases in consumer complaints. Thus, increased automobile traffic causes increased consumer complaints.
  B: The most common species of birds in this region are migratory. Moreover, most migratory birds have left this region by the end of November. Hence, few birds remain in this region during the winter.
  C: It is not surprising that most speeding tickets in this region are issued to drivers of sports cars. After all, most drivers who are not interested in driving fast do not buy sports cars.
  D: Most nature photographers find portrait photography boring. Moreover, most portrait photographers especially enjoy photographing dignitaries. Thus, most nature photographers find photographing dignitaries especially boring.
  E: Most snow-removal companies run lawn-care services during the summer. Also, most companies that run lawn-care services during the summer hire additional workers in the summer. Thus, most snow-removal companies hire additional workers in the summer.

To determine which argument has the most similar flawed reasoning, let's break down the original argument:
1. Most auto mechanics have extensive experience.
2. Most mechanics with extensive experience understand electronic circuits.
3. Conclusion: Most auto mechanics understand electronic circuits.
The flaw is that it assumes the majority of the larger group (auto mechanics) is part of the majority of the subset group (mechanics with extensive experience). But this is not necessarily true.
Looking at the choices:
A: Increased traffic leads to increased gas prices, which leads to increased complaints. This is a causal chain argument, not the same flaw.
B: Most common birds are migratory. Most migratory birds leave by November. This validly concludes few birds remain in winter. Not the same flaw.
C: This just says most speeding tickets go to sports car drivers because they like to drive fast. No flawed reasoning like the original.
D: Most nature photographers find portraits boring. Most portrait photographers enjoy photographing dignitaries. The flawed conclusion is that most nature photographers find photographing dignitaries boring. This makes the same mistake of assuming the majority of the larger group has the trait of the majority of the subset. This matches the original flaw.
E: Most snow-removal companies do lawn-care in summer. Most lawn-care companies hire more in summer. This validly concludes most snow-removal companies hire more in summer. Not the same flaw.
Action: Answer("D")

 --- 
Correct Answer: E
## Assistant 2:
Response:
Explanation:
I incorrectly identified argument D as having the same flaw as the original argument. While D does have flawed reasoning, it is not the same flaw as the original. I failed to recognize that argument E actually contains the same logical flaw as the original argument.
Error Keywords:
 - Logical reasoning error
 - Misidentifying analogous reasoning flaw
 - Mistaking different reasoning errors as the same
 - Overlooking correct analogous reasoning error
Solution:
The original argument concludes that most auto mechanics understand electronic circuits because:
1) Most auto mechanics have extensive experience. 
2) Most mechanics with extensive experience understand electronic circuits.
The flaw is assuming the majority of the larger group (auto mechanics) must have the trait held by the majority of a subset group (mechanics with extensive experience).
Looking at argument E:
1) Most snow-removal companies run lawn-care services in summer.
2) Most lawn-care service companies hire additional workers in summer. 
3) The flawed conclusion is that most snow-removal companies hire additional workers in summer.
This makes the same error of assuming the majority of the larger group (snow-removal companies) must have the trait held by the majority of a subset group (lawn-care service companies).
Instructions:
1. Identify the logical structure and flaw in the original argument.
2. For each answer choice, map out the logical structure of the argument.
3. Compare the reasoning in each choice to the original argument.
4. Eliminate choices that have different reasoning errors or are not flawed.
5. Select the choice with the same flawed reasoning pattern as the original.
Advice:
 - Always break arguments down into their component logical steps.
 - Identify the specific nature of flawed reasoning, don't just note that it's flawed.
 - When comparing reasoning, focus on the logical structure, not just surface similarities.
 - Map out the logic of each argument fully before judging similarities.
 - Don't be distracted by arguments that are flawed in different ways than the original.
