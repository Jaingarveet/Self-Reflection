## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:
Topic: Geography
Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Math
Question: Which of the following is equivalent to $9^{\frac{3}{4}}$ ?
Choices:
  A: $\sqrt[3]{9}$
  B: $\sqrt[4]{9}$
  C: $\sqrt{3}$
  D: $3 \sqrt{3}$
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Identify the base number and the exponent.
2. If the exponent is a fraction, rewrite the expression according to the properties of exponents: $(a^{\frac{m}{n}}) = (\sqrt[n]{a})^m = (a^{\frac{1}{n}})^m$.
3. Simplify the inner expression first, i.e., $a^{\frac{1}{n}}$.
4. Then, raise the simplified inner expression to the power of the numerator of the original exponent.
5. Simplify the resulting expression if possible.
6. Choose the answer that matches your simplified expression.
## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step using the instructions from the reflection:
1. The base number is 9 and the exponent is $\frac{3}{4}$.
2. The exponent is a fraction, so we rewrite the expression:
   $9^{\frac{3}{4}} = (\sqrt[4]{9})^3 = (9^{\frac{1}{4}})^3$
3. Simplify the inner expression $9^{\frac{1}{4}}$:
   $9^{\frac{1}{4}} = \sqrt[4]{9} = \sqrt{3}$
   
   This is because $\sqrt[4]{9} = 9^{\frac{1}{4}} = (3^2)^{\frac{1}{4}} = 3^{\frac{2}{4}} = 3^{\frac{1}{2}} = \sqrt{3}$
4. Now, raise the simplified inner expression to the power of 3 (the numerator of the original exponent):
   $(\sqrt{3})^3 = \sqrt{3} \cdot \sqrt{3} \cdot \sqrt{3} = 3\sqrt{3}$
5. The resulting expression $3\sqrt{3}$ cannot be simplified further.
6. Looking at the answer choices, the expression $3\sqrt{3}$ matches choice D.
Therefore, the answer is D: $3\sqrt{3}$.
Action: Answer("D")
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: D
Score: 1
