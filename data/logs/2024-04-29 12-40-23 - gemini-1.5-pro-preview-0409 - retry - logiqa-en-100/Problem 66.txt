## Assistant 2:
Thought:
We know:
* G is the northernmost (given).
* F is north of H and adjacent (given).
* I and E are adjacent (given).
Therefore, with G at the north end, we need to arrange the two pairs FH and IE. 
There are two possible arrangements for each pair (FH or HF, IE or EI).
So, the total number of arrangements is 2 (arrangements for FH) * 2 (arrangements for IE) = 4.
Action: Answer("C") 
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: C
Score: 1
