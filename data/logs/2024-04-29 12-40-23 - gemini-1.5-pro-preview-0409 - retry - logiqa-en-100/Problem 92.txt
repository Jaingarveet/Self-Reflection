## Assistant 2:
Thought:
We know only one professor was entirely correct and one was entirely wrong. 
* If Professor Zhao is right, then the winner is neither Tsinghua nor Zhejiang. This would make Professor Qian and Sun both wrong, which contradicts the given information. So, Professor Zhao is not entirely correct.
* If Professor Qian is right, then the winner is USTC and not Tsinghua. This would make Professor Zhao partially correct and Professor Sun entirely wrong. This aligns with the given information.
* If Professor Sun is right, then the winner is Tsinghua and not USTC. This would make both Professor Zhao and Qian partially correct, which contradicts the given information. So, Professor Sun is not entirely correct.
Therefore, Professor Qian is entirely correct and the winner is the University of Science and Technology of China.
Action: Answer("B")
