# Model: gpt-35-turbo | Task: save_reflection | Exam: med-mcqa-100 | Problem 12 of 100
## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I did not know that Hydroxylysine does not require aminoacyl t-RNA for protein synthesis. 
The gap in my knowledge was in the specific amino acids that require aminoacyl t-RNA for protein synthesis. 
I knew that aminoacyl t-RNA was required for protein synthesis, but I did not know which amino acids required it.
Error Keywords:
 - Lack of knowledge
 - Specificity error
 - Misunderstanding of the question
Solution:
Aminoacyl t-RNA is required for protein synthesis, but not all amino acids require it.
Methionine is the first amino acid in protein synthesis and requires aminoacyl t-RNA.
Proline and Lysine require aminoacyl t-RNA for protein synthesis.
Hydroxylysine does not require aminoacyl t-RNA for protein synthesis.
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and understand the problem.
2. Identify the amino acids listed in the answer choices.
3. Recall which amino acids require aminoacyl t-RNA for protein synthesis.
4. Identify the amino acid that does not require aminoacyl t-RNA for protein synthesis.
5. Choose the answer that matches your identified amino acid.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always recall the basic concepts and definitions related to the question.
 - Always be specific in your knowledge and understanding of the topic.
 - Never assume that you know the answer without checking your knowledge.
 - Always double-check your answer to ensure accuracy.
