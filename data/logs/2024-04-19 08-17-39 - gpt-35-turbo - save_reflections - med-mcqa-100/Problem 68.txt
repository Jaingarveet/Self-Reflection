## Get Reflection:
Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question by choosing Mivacurium as the shortest acting skeletal muscle relaxant. However, Suxamethonium is the shortest acting skeletal muscle relaxant. 
The gap in my knowledge was in the mechanism of action and duration of action of different skeletal muscle relaxants. 
Error Keywords:
 - Knowledge gap
 - Mechanism of action
 - Duration of action
Solution:
The shortest acting skeletal muscle relaxant is Suxamethonium.
Suxamethonium has a rapid onset and short duration of action.
Mivacurium has a relatively short duration of action but not as short as Suxamethonium.
Instructions:
1. Understand the mechanism of action of different skeletal muscle relaxants.
2. Understand the duration of action of different skeletal muscle relaxants.
3. Identify the skeletal muscle relaxant with the shortest duration of action.
4. Double-check your answer to ensure accuracy.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always review your knowledge of the topic before answering the question.
 - Always double-check your answer to ensure accuracy.
 - Remember that the shortest acting skeletal muscle relaxant is expected to have a rapid onset and short duration of action.
