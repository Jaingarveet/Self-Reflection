Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.

Advice:
- Avoid overgeneralizing and making assumptions.
- Consider nuances and exceptions to general rules.
- Evaluate each option critically and independently.
- Understand the concept of instinct as innate and present from birth.
- Recognize that some behaviors can have both instinctual and learned components.
## Assistant 2:
Reflection: I made an incorrect assumption that all birds display innate nest-building behavior. While many bird species do have an instinct to build nests, it is not universal across all birds. Some birds, like the cuckoo, are brood parasites and do not build nests, instead laying their eggs in the nests of other bird species. Therefore, nest-building cannot be classified as an instinct present in all animals, and my answer should reflect this exception.

Action: Answer("D")
