# Model: cohere-command-r-plus | Agent: advice | Exam: arc-challenge-100 | Problem 50 of 100
## System:
You are an expert in Science.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.
## User 1:
Topic: Geography
Question: What is the capital of the state where Johns Hopkins University is located?
Choices:
  A: Baltimore
  B: Annapolis
  C: Des Moines
  D: Las Vegas
## Assistant 1:
Thought: 
Johns Hopkins University is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.
Action: Answer("B")
## User 2:
Topic: Science
Question: To determine the boiling point of a liquid, a student must use all of these tools except
Choices:
  A: a stopwatch.
  B: a heat source.
  C: safety goggles.
  D: a thermometer.
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Advice:
 - Always consider safety first when designing experiments. 
 - Ensure you have a comprehensive understanding of the experimental procedure and requirements. 
 - Avoid making assumptions about the necessity of safety equipment. 
 - Remember that a stopwatch is used for timing, which is not required to determine a fixed temperature like the boiling point.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
To find the boiling point of a liquid, a student must use a heat source, safety goggles, and a thermometer.
A stopwatch is not necessary as the boiling point is a fixed temperature.

Reflection: I made an incorrect assumption that a stopwatch would be needed to time the experiment, but the boiling point is a consistent temperature, not a variable, and therefore does not require timing. Safety goggles are essential for any experiment involving heat, and I will ensure I don't overlook safety equipment in the future.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
