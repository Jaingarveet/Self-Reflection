  B: presumes, without providing justification, that there are no political solutions to the most important problems
  C: infers that important problems can be seriously addressed if people's attitudes do change from the premise that these problems cannot be addressed if people's attitudes do not change
  D: undermines its claim that people no longer believe there are political solutions to important problems by suggesting that people are dissatisfied with politicians
  E: presumes, without providing justification, that voter apathy prevents the attitudinal changes that result in finding solutions to important problems
## Assistant 2:
  Action: Answer("C")

The reasoning in the political scientist's argument is most vulnerable to criticism because it infers that important problems can be seriously addressed if people's attitudes do change from the premise that these problems cannot be addressed if people's attitudes do not change. The argument does not provide any evidence or justification for this inference, and it is possible that other factors, such as decreased trust in government or increased cynicism about politics, may also contribute to decreasing voter turnout.
