Topic: Law
Context: In some countries, there is a free flow of information about infrastructure, agriculture, and industry, whereas in other countries, this information is controlled by a small elite. In the latter countries, the vast majority of the population is denied vital information about factors that determine their welfare. Thus, these countries are likely to experience more frequent economic crises than other countries do.
Question: The conclusion follows logically if which one of the following is assumed?
Choices:
  A: It is more likely that people without political power will suffer from economic crises than it is that people in power will.
  B: Economic crises become more frequent as the amount of information available to the population about factors determining its welfare decreases.
  C: In nations in which the government controls access to information about infrastructure, agriculture, and industry, economic crises are common.
  D: The higher the percentage of the population that participates in economic decisions, the better those decisions are.
  E: A small elite that controls information about infrastructure, agriculture, and industry is likely to manipulate that information for its own benefit.
## Assistant 2:
  Action: Answer("B")

The conclusion follows logically if the assumption that economic crises become more frequent as the amount of information available to the population about factors determining its welfare decreases is true. This is because when a small elite controls information about infrastructure, agriculture, and industry, the vast majority of the population is denied vital information about factors that determine their welfare, leading to more frequent economic crises.
