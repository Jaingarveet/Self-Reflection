Topic: Law
Context: Although Pluto has an atmosphere and is much larger than any asteroid, Pluto is not a true planet. Pluto formed in orbit around the planet Neptune and was then ejected from orbit around Neptune when Triton, Neptune's largest moon, was captured by Neptune's gravity.
Question: The conclusion of the argument follows logically if which one of the following is assumed?
Choices:
  A: No celestial body can simultaneously be a moon and a planet.
  B: Not all celestial bodies that have an atmosphere and orbit the sun are true planets.
  C: If Pluto had not been ejected from its orbit around Neptune, Pluto would not have its current orbit around the sun and would still be a moon.
  D: The size of a celestial body in orbit around the sun is not relevant to determining whether or not it is a true planet.
  E: For a celestial body to be a true planet it must have formed in orbit around the sun exclusively.
## Assistant 2:
  Thought: The argument states that Pluto is not a true planet, despite having an atmosphere and being larger than many asteroids. To determine the conclusion that follows logically, we need to identify the assumption that supports this argument.

Action: Answer("B") - Not all celestial bodies that have an atmosphere and orbit the sun are true planets.

Explanation: The argument implies that Pluto is not a true planet because it formed in orbit around Neptune and was later ejected from that orbit. If Pluto had not been ejected, it would still be considered a moon orbiting Neptune. Therefore, the assumption that not all celestial bodies that have an atmosphere and orbit the sun are true planets logically follows from the argument.
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: E
