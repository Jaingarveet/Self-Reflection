Context: Until 1985 all commercial airlines completely replenished the cabin air in planes in flight once every 30 minutes. Since then the rate has been once every hour. The less frequently cabin air is replenished in a plane in flight, the higher the level of carbon dioxide in that plane and the easier it is for airborne illnesses to be spread.
Question: Which one of the following is most strongly supported by the information above?
Choices:
  A: In 1985 there was a loosening of regulations concerning cabin air in commercial airline flights.
  B: People who fly today are more likely to contract airborne illnesses than were people who flew prior to 1985.
  C: Low levels of carbon dioxide in cabin air make it impossible for airborne illnesses to spread.
  D: In 1980 the rate at which the cabin air was replenished in commercial airliners was sufficient to protect passengers from the effects of carbon dioxide buildup.
  E: In 1980 the level of carbon dioxide in the cabin air on a two-hour commercial airline flight was lower than it is today on a similar flight.
## Assistant 2:
  Action: Answer("B")

The information provided suggests that the frequency of cabin air replenishment in commercial airliners has a direct impact on the level of carbon dioxide in the cabin and the likelihood of airborne illnesses being spread. The passage states that until 1985, cabin air was replenished once every 30 minutes, but since then, the rate has been once every hour. This implies that the lower the frequency of cabin air replenishment, the higher the level of carbon dioxide in the cabin and the easier it is for airborne illnesses to be spread. Therefore, option B is the most strongly supported by the information above.
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: E
Score: 0
