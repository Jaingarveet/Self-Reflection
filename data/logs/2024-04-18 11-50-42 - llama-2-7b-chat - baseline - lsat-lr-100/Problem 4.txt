Topic: Law
Context: A film makes a profit if the number of people who see it is sufficient to generate revenues from ticket sales greater than the amount spent to make it. Hence, the primary goal of movie executives is to maximize the number of people who see a film. However, it is not the primary goal of television executives to maximize the number of viewers for their shows.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain the difference between the goals of movie executives and those of television executives?
Choices:
  A: More people are willing to see a film more than once than are willing to watch a television show more than once.
  B: There is no analog in television to the large profits that owners of movie theaters make by selling refreshments to their customers.
  C: The average cost of producing an hour of film is much greater than the average cost of producing an hour of television.
  D: Television shows make their profits from sponsors, who are chiefly concerned with the purchasing power of the people who watch a television show.
  E: Over half of the most popular television shows are shows that viewers do not have to pay to watch.
## Assistant 2:
  Action: Answer("C")

The correct answer is (C) The average cost of producing an hour of film is much greater than the average cost of producing an hour of television.

Explanation:
The difference in the goals of movie executives and television executives can be attributed to the difference in production costs. The average cost of producing an hour of film is significantly higher than the average cost of producing an hour of television. This means that movie executives need to recoup their investment through ticket sales, which requires a larger audience. In contrast, television executives have a lower production cost, which allows them to focus on creating high-quality content that appeals to a smaller audience. Therefore, the primary goal of television executives is not to maximize the number of viewers but to create engaging content that attracts a loyal audience.
