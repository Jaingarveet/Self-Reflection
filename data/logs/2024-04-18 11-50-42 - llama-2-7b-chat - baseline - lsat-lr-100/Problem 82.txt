Context: Patricia: During Japan's Tokugawa period, martial arts experts known as ninjas were trained for the purposes of espionage and assassination. Yet at that time there was actually very little ninja activity in Japan, and most Japanese did not fear ninjas. Tamara: That is not true. Many wealthy Japanese during the Tokugawa period had their houses constructed with intentionally squeaky floors so that they would receive warning if a ninja were in the house.
Question: Of the following, which one, if true, is the strongest counter Patricia can make to Tamara's objection?
Choices:
  A: Many poor Japanese during the Tokugawa period also had houses constructed with intentionally squeaky floors.
  B: As part of their secret training, ninjas learned to walk on squeaky floors without making a sound.
  C: The wealthy made up a small portion of Japan's population during the Tokugawa period.
  D: The fighting prowess of ninjas was exaggerated to mythic proportions in the years following the Tokngawa period.
  E: There were very few ninjas at any time other than during the Tokugawa period.
## Assistant 2:
  Action: Answer("B")

The strongest counter to Tamara's objection is option B: As part of their secret training, ninjas learned to walk on squeaky floors without making a sound. This counterargument suggests that while there may not have been a lot of ninja activity during the Tokugawa period, the ninjas themselves were trained to be stealthy and quiet, which would have made it difficult for the wealthy Japanese to detect them even if they did have squeaky floors in their houses. This undermines Tamara's claim that the squeaky floors were a necessary measure to detect ninjas.
