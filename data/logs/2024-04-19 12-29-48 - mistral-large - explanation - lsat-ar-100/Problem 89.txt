Context: A bakery makes exactly three kinds of cookieâ€”oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar. Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day. The following conditions apply: No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.

Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I made an incorrect assumption about the number of batches made on Friday.
The gap in my knowledge was not in the law but in the interpretation of the given conditions.
I misunderstood the condition that no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
I also overlooked the condition that at least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Since only one batch is made on Friday, it cannot be the same kind of cookie as the one made on Thursday (second batch of sugar cookies). Therefore, it must be either the third batch of oatmeal cookies or the third batch of peanut butter cookies.
Since the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies, and no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day, the third batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. Therefore, the third batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Friday.
Action: Answer("C")
