Explanation:
I made an incorrect assumption about the number of plays Megregian reviews.
The gap in my knowledge was not in the law but in logical reasoning.
I knew the conditions but made an incorrect inference.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Since Kramer and Lopez each review fewer plays than Megregian, Megregian must review all three plays.
Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews, so Jiang must review Sunset.
Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, so they cannot review Sunset.
Lopez cannot review the same play as Kramer or O'Neill, so Lopez must review Sunset.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: A
Score: 1
