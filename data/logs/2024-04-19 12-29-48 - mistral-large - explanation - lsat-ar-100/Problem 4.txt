Context: A chemistry class has six lab sessions scheduled over three days—Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday—one session heing held each morning and one each afternoon. Each session will be led by a different lab assistant—Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, or Rebecca. The assignment of lab assistants to sessions is constrained as follows: Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day. Nessa must lead an afternoon session. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
Question: If Lan does not lead a Wednesday session, then which one of the following lab assistants must lead a Thursday session?
Choices:
  A: Rebecca
  B: Olivia
  C: Nessa
  D: Kevin
  E: Julio
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I made an incorrect assumption about the constraints of the problem.
The gap in my knowledge was not in law but in logical reasoning.
I misinterpreted the constraint that "[REDACTED] and [REDACTED] must lead sessions that meet on the same day" to mean that they must lead sessions on the same day of the week, rather than the same day of the lab schedule.
I also overlooked the constraint that "[REDACTED]'s session must meet on an earlier day of the week than [REDACTED]'s."
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Since Lan does not lead a Wednesday session, he must lead a session on Thursday or Friday. But since Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day, Olivia cannot lead a session on Thursday or Friday. Therefore, Olivia must lead a session on Wednesday.
Since Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's, Julio must lead a session on Wednesday as well.
Since Nessa must lead an afternoon session, she cannot lead a session on Wednesday morning. Therefore, Nessa must lead a session on Thursday or Friday afternoon.
Since Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day, they must lead sessions on Thursday or Friday. But since Olivia and Lan cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day, Kevin and Rebecca cannot lead sessions on Wednesday. Therefore, Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions on Thursday or Friday.
Since there are only two sessions on Thursday, one of Kevin and Rebecca must lead a Thursday session.
Action: Answer("D")
