Topic: Law
Context: A software company employs exactly seven sales representatives—Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall—to work in its three sales zones—Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3. Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I made an incorrect assumption about the distribution of sales representatives in the zones.
The gap in my knowledge was not in the law but in logical reasoning.
I incorrectly assumed that Zone 3 must have at least 3 sales representatives, but it could have more.
I also incorrectly assumed that Parra and Quinn must work in Zone 3 with Mahr, Stuckey, and Udall, but they could work in Zone 1.
## Assistant 2:
Thought:
Since Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, and Stuckey works in the same sales zone as Udall, Mahr, Stuckey, and Udall must work in the same sales zone.
Since there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, Zone 3 must have at least 3 sales representatives.
Since either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2, and Udall works in the same sales zone as Mahr and Stuckey, Tiao cannot work in Zone 2.
Since either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, and Tiao cannot work in Zone 1 or Zone 2, Parra must work in Zone 1.
Since Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other, Quinn must also work in Zone 1.
Since Mahr, Stuckey, and Udall work in the same sales zone, and Zone 3 has at least 3 sales representatives, they must work in Zone 3.
Therefore, Kim must work in Zone 2.
Action: Answer("A")
