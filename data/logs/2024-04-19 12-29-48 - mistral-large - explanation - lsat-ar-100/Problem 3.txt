Context: An administrator must assign parking spaces to six new employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young. Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.

## Assistant 2:
Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly because I did not consider all the rules governing the assignment of parking spaces. Specifically, I overlooked the rule that Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.

Thought:
Since Robertson is assigned parking space #3, Young must be assigned a lower-numbered parking space than #3. Therefore, Young can only be assigned parking space #1 or #2.

Additionally, Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Therefore, Togowa can only be assigned parking space #1.

Since Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, and Robertson is already assigned parking space #3, Xu can only be assigned parking space #4, #5, or #6.

Therefore, Souza can only be assigned parking space #2.

Action: Answer("B")

Explanation:
Since Togowa must be assigned a lower-numbered parking space than Young, and Young can only be assigned parking space #1 or #2, Togowa must be assigned parking space #1. However, since Togowa cannot be assigned parking space #1, the only remaining option is that Togowa is assigned parking space #2. Therefore, the correct answer is "B: Togowa is assigned parking space #2."
## Result:

Correct Answer: E
