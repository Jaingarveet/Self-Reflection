## System:
You are an expert in Law.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Topic: Law
Context: At a concert, exactly eight compositions—F, H, L, O, P, R, S, and T—are to be performed exactly once each, consecutively and one composition at a time. The order of their performance must satisfy the following conditions: T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R. At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F. O is performed either first or fifth. The eighth composition performed is either L or H. P is performed at some time before S. At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
Question: P CANNOT be performed
Choices:
  A: second
  B: third
  C: fourth
  D: sixth
  E: seventh
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
Error Keywords:
 - Ignored conditions
 - Misunderstood problem
 - Logical error
Solution:
We know that P is performed before S. Therefore, P cannot be performed in the [REDACTED], [REDACTED], [REDACTED], or [REDACTED] position because S is performed after P. If P is performed in the [REDACTED] position, then S must be performed in the eighth position, which satisfies the given condition. Therefore, P cannot be performed in the [REDACTED] position. The only remaining option is the fifth position, which satisfies all the given conditions. Therefore, P cannot be performed in the fifth position.
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and understand the problem.
2. Identify all the given conditions and constraints.
3. Consider all the given conditions and constraints while solving the problem.
4. Use logical reasoning to eliminate the positions where P cannot be performed.
5. Choose the position where P cannot be performed based on the given conditions.
6. Double-check your answer to ensure accuracy.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Identify all the given conditions and constraints.
 - Consider all the given conditions and constraints while solving the problem.
 - Use logical reasoning to eliminate the options that violate the given conditions.
 - Double-check your answer to ensure accuracy.
 - Remember that each condition is important and must be considered while solving the problem.
