Topic: Law
Context: On each of exactly seven consecutive days (day 1 though day 7), a pet shop features exactly one of three breeds of kitten—Himalayan, Manx, Siamese—and exactly one of three breeds of puppy—Greyhound, Newfoundland, Rottweiler. The following conditions must apply: Greyhounds are featured on day 1. No breed is featured on any two consecutive days. Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7. Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1. Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.
Question: If Himalayans are not featured on day 2, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Manx are featured on day 3.
  B: Siamese are featured on day 4.
  C: Rottweilers are featured on day 5.
  D: Himalayans are featured on day 6.
  E: Greyhounds are featured on day 7.
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
My reasoning was incorrect. I assumed that since Himalayans were not featured on day 2, they must be featured on days 4, 5, and 6. However, this is not necessarily true. Himalayans could be featured on any three days other than day 1 and day 2. Therefore, Rottweilers could be featured on day 5, which means that choice [REDACTED] could be true. However, choice [REDACTED] is also a possibility since Siamese could be featured on day 4.
Error Keywords:
 - Incorrect assumption
 - Misinterpretation of the problem
 - Logical error
Solution:
If Himalayans are not featured on day 2, then they must be featured on any three days other than day 1 and day 2. Therefore, Rottweilers could be featured on day 5, which means that choice [REDACTED] could be true. However, choice [REDACTED] is also a possibility since Siamese could be featured on day 4.
