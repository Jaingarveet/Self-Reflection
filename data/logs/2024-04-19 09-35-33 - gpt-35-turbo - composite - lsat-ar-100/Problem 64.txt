Topic: Law
Context: A software company employs exactly seven sales representatives—Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall—to work in its three sales zones—Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3. Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Question: If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Kim works in Zone 2.
  B: Mahr works in Zone 1.
  C: Parra works in Zone 3.
  D: Stuckey works in Zone 2.
  E: Tiao works in Zone 1.
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
My mistake was in assuming that Kim and Mahr must work in Zone 1. However, this is not necessarily true. 
Error Keywords:
 - Incorrect assumption
 - Misinterpretation of the problem
 - Logical error
Solution:
If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then Udall cannot work in Zone 2 because Udall and Stuckey work in the same sales zone. Therefore, Tiao must work in Zone 2. If Tiao works in Zone 2, then Parra must work in Zone 3. Since Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone, Quinn must also work in Zone 3. That means Kim must work in Zone 2.
Instructions:
1. Read the problem carefully and understand the constraints.
2. Identify any relationships between the sales representatives and the sales zones.
3. Use logic to deduce any additional relationships between the sales representatives and the sales zones.
4. Double-check your reasoning to ensure that it is valid.
5. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the problem carefully and understand the constraints.
 - Always use logic to deduce any additional relationships between the variables.
 - Always double-check your reasoning to ensure that it is valid.
 - Remember that assumptions can lead to incorrect answers.
