Context: On each of exactly seven consecutive days (day 1 though day 7), a pet shop features exactly one of three breeds of kitten—Himalayan, Manx, Siamese—and exactly one of three breeds of puppy—Greyhound, Newfoundland, Rottweiler.

Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1. Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.

Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I made an error in my analysis of the possible days that Himalayans and Rottweilers could be featured. 
I also did not consider all of the rules when evaluating the answer choices. 
Error Keywords:
 - Misinterpretation of rules
 - Error in analysis
 - Failure to consider all rules
Solution:
We know that Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1. Therefore, Himalayans can be featured on days 2, 3, and 4 or days 3, 4, and 5.
Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans. Therefore, Rottweilers can be featured on days 2, 4, and 6 or days 1, 3, and 5.
Greyhounds are featured on day 1. Therefore, Greyhounds cannot be featured on days 2 or 3.
No breed is featured on any two consecutive days. Therefore, we can eliminate some of the answer choices based on this rule.
Answer Choice [REDACTED]: [REDACTED]
- Himalayans are featured on consecutive days (days 3 and 4). Eliminate.
