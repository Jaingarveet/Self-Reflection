## System:
You are an expert in Law.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Topic: Law
Context: A chemistry class has six lab sessions scheduled over three days—Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday—one session heing held each morning and one each afternoon. Each session will be led by a different lab assistant—Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, or Rebecca. The assignment of lab assistants to sessions is constrained as follows: Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day. Nessa must lead an afternoon session. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
Question: Which one of the following could he an accurate assignment of lab assistants to morning and afternoon sessions, respectively, on the three days?
Choices:
  A: Wednesday: Rebecca, Kevin Thursday: Julio, Lan Friday: Nessa, Olivia
  B: Wednesday: Olivia, Nessa Thursday: Julio, Lan Friday: Kevin, Rebecca
  C: Wednesday: Lan, Kevin Thursday: Rebecca, Julio Friday: Olivia, Nessa
  D: Wednesday: Kevin, Rebecca Thursday: Julio, Nessa Friday: Olivia, Lan
  E: Wednesday: Julio, Lan Thursday: Olivia, Nessa Friday: Rebecca, Kevin
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I misread the constraint that Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day. 
I also misread the constraint that Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's. 
Error Keywords:
 - Misreading
 - Misinterpretation
 - Misunderstanding
Solution:
There are six lab assistants and six lab sessions, so each assistant will lead one session in the morning and one in the afternoon. 
The constraints are:
- Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
- Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
- Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
- Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
Option [REDACTED] violates the constraint that Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
Option [REDACTED] violates the constraint that Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
Option [REDACTED] violates the constraint that Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
Option [REDACTED] satisfies all the constraints.
Option [REDACTED] violates the constraint that Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
Therefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and understand the constraints.
2. Identify the number of lab assistants and lab sessions.
3. Determine the number of sessions each assistant will lead.
4. Eliminate options that violate the constraints.
5. Double-check the constraints to ensure accuracy.
6. Choose the answer that satisfies all the constraints.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the constraints.
 - Always double-check the constraints to ensure accuracy.
 - Always think through each constraint step-by-step.
 - Never skip any constraints; be explicit in each constraint of your reasoning.
 - Always eliminate options that violate the constraints.
 - Remember that constraints are essential to solving problems.
