Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I made an error in my reasoning. I assumed that if Franco testifies on the same day as Hong, then Franco cannot testify on Monday. However, this is not necessarily true. 
Error Keywords:
 - False assumption
 - Logical error
 - Misinterpretation
Solution:
If Franco testifies on the same day as Hong, then Franco can testify on Monday or Wednesday. 
If Franco testifies on Monday, then Hong cannot testify on Monday because Hong does not testify on Monday. Therefore, Hong must testify on Wednesday. 
If Franco testifies on Wednesday, then Iturbe cannot testify on Wednesday because Iturbe testifies on Wednesday. Therefore, Franco must testify on Monday. 
Garcia cannot testify on Monday because Franco does not testify on the same day that Garcia testifies. Therefore, Garcia must testify on Tuesday.
The only remaining day for Iturbe to testify is Wednesday.

## Assistant 2:
Action: Answer("D") 
If Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong, then Hong must testify on Tuesday. This is because Hong does not testify on Monday, and if Hong testifies on Wednesday, then Franco must testify on Monday, which is not possible because Franco cannot testify on the same day as Garcia. Therefore, Garcia must testify on Monday, leaving Iturbe to testify on Wednesday. Thus, Hong must testify on Tuesday.
