Context: A government needs to assign new ambassadors to Venezuela, Yemen, and Zambia. The candidates for these ambassadorships are Jaramillo, Kayne, Landon, Novetzke, and Ong. One ambassador will be assigned to each country, and no ambassador will be assigned to more than one country. The assignment of the ambassadors must meet the following constraints: Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships. If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne. If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen. If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
Question: The pair of candidates who are not assigned to ambassadorships could be
Choices:
  A: Jaramillo and Novetzke
  B: Jaramillo and Ong
  C: Kayne and Landon
  D: Kayne and Novetzke
  E: Landon and Ong

Explanation:
I misinterpreted the constraints of the problem.

I did not consider the constraint that either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships. 
Error Keywords:
 - Misinterpretation
 - Oversight
 - Neglect
Solution:
If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then Kayne is also assigned to one of the ambassadorships. 
If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen. 
If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia. 
Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships. 
There are three ambassadorships to be assigned, so two candidates will not be assigned. 
If Kayne is assigned to an ambassadorship, then Novetzke is not assigned to any ambassadorship. 
If Novetzke is assigned to an ambassadorship, then Kayne is not assigned to any ambassadorship. 
If Jaramillo is assigned to an ambassadorship, then Kayne is also assigned to an ambassadorship. 
If Ong is assigned to Venezuela, then Kayne is not assigned to Yemen. 
If Landon is assigned to Zambia, then the remaining candidates, [REDACTED], are not assigned to any ambassadorship. 
Instructions:
1. Read the problem carefully and identify all constraints.
2. Consider all possible combinations of candidates that could be unassigned.
3. Apply each constraint to eliminate impossible combinations.
4. Identify the remaining possible combinations of unassigned candidates.
