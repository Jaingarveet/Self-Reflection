## Assistant 2:
Action: Answer("D") 
If the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday, then the second batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Friday. The first batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Monday, the second batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Wednesday, and the second batch of sugar cookies must be made on Thursday. Therefore, two different kinds of cookie cannot have their second batch made on Thursday, making option D the answer that does not match any of the possible scenarios.
