You are an expert in Law.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Topic: Law
Context: At a concert, exactly eight compositions—F, H, L, O, P, R, S, and T—are to be performed exactly once each, consecutively and one composition at a time. The order of their performance must satisfy the following conditions: T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R. At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F. O is performed either first or fifth. The eighth composition performed is either L or H. P is performed at some time before S. At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
Question: If O is performed immediately after T, then F must be performed either
Choices:
  A: first or second
  B: second or third
  C: fourth or sixth
  D: fourth or seventh
  E: sixth or seventh

Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
My reasoning was correct up to a point, but I made an error in identifying the possible positions for the composition F. 
If O is performed immediately after T, then the order of the compositions must be T, O, and then the remaining six compositions. 
T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R. 
If T is performed immediately after R, then F must be performed immediately before T. 
If T is performed immediately before F, then at least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F. 
Therefore, F must be performed either [REDACTED].
However, I missed the fact that the eighth composition performed is either L or H, which means that F cannot be performed seventh. 
Error Keywords:
 - Missed information
 - Logical error
 - Positioning error
Solution:
If O is performed immediately after T, then the order of the compositions must be T, O, and then the remaining six compositions. 
T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R. 
If T is performed immediately after R, then F must be performed immediately before T. 
If T is performed immediately before F, then at least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F. 
The eighth composition performed is either L or H. 
P is performed at some time before S. 
At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
If F is performed fourth, then R must be performed immediately before T, and S must be performed immediately after O. 
If F is performed sixth, then R must be performed immediately after T, and P must be performed before S. 
Therefore, F must be performed either [REDACTED].
