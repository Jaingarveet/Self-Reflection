Topic: Law
Context: A panel of five scientists will be formed. The panelists will be selected from among three botanists—F, G, and H—three chemists—K, L, and M—and three zoologists—P, Q, and R. Selection is governed by the following conditions: The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types. If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. F and K cannot both be selected. K and M cannot both be selected. If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
Question: If M is the only chemist selected for the panel, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: F and G are both selected.
  B: G and H are both selected.
  C: H and P are both selected.
  D: F, G, and H are all selected.
  E: P, Q, and R are all selected.
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I made an error in my reasoning. 
If M is the only chemist selected, then P and R must be selected. 
If F or G is selected, then at most one zoologist can be selected. 
However, H cannot be selected because it would violate the condition that at most one zoologist can be selected if more than one botanist is selected. 
Therefore, both F and G must be selected, and no zoologist can be selected. 
Thus, the correct answer is [REDACTED].
Error Keywords:
 - Misinterpretation of the condition
 - Logical error
 - Misreading of the question
Solution:
If M is the only chemist selected, then P and R must be selected. 
If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist can be selected. 
H cannot be selected because it would violate the condition that at most one zoologist can be selected if more than one botanist is selected. 
Therefore, both F and G must be selected, and no zoologist can be selected. 
Thus, the correct answer is [REDACTED].
