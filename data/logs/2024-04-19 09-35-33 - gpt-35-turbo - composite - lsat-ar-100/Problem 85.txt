Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I misread the question and did not pay attention to the word "EXCEPT." 
I correctly identified the possible positions of S but failed to eliminate the one that was not possible.

Solution:
S can be in the [REDACTED], [REDACTED], [REDACTED], [REDACTED], or [REDACTED] position.
