Topic: Law
Context: Of the eight students—George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert—in a seminar, exactly six will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
Question: If Kyle gives the afternoon report on Tuesday, and Helen gives the afternoon report on Wednesday, which one of the following could be the list of the students who give the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively?
Choices:
  A: Irving, Lenore, and Nina
  B: Lenore, George, and Irving
  C: Nina, Irving, and Lenore

Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I misinterpreted the condition that "If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday." I assumed that if Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Monday and Tuesday, respectively. However, the condition only applies if Nina's report is given on Tuesday. 
Error Keywords:
 - Misinterpretation
 - Assumption
 - Logical error
Solution:
We know that George can only give a report on Tuesday, and neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Tuesday. Kyle gives the afternoon report on Tuesday, and Helen gives the afternoon report on Wednesday. 
If Kyle gives the afternoon report on Tuesday, then George must give the morning report on Tuesday. Therefore, George cannot give the morning report on Monday or Wednesday. 
If Helen gives the afternoon report on Wednesday, then Nina cannot give the morning report on Wednesday. Therefore, Nina must give the morning report on Monday or Tuesday. 
If Nina gives the morning report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday. Therefore, George and Lenore must give reports on Wednesday. 
If Nina gives the morning report on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving do not need to give reports on Wednesday. Therefore, Robert and Lenore must give reports on Wednesday. 
Therefore, the list of students who give the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday could be [REDACTED].
