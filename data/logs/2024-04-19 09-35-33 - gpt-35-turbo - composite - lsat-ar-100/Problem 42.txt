## System:
You are an expert in Law.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

Topic: Law
Context: A panel of five scientists will be formed. The panelists will be selected from among three botanists—F, G, and H—three chemists—K, L, and M—and three zoologists—P, Q, and R. Selection is governed by the following conditions: The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types. If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. F and K cannot both be selected. K and M cannot both be selected. If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
Question: Which one of the following is an acceptable selection of scientists for the panel?
Choices:
  A: F, G, K, P, Q
  B: G, H, K, L, M
  C: G, H, K, L, R
  D: H, K, M, P, R
  E: H, L, M, P, Q
Reflection:
You previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.
Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Explanation:
I made multiple errors in my reasoning. First, I did not consider all the conditions for selecting the panelists. Second, I did not check if the selected panelists met all the conditions. 
Error Keywords:
 - Incomplete analysis
 - Failure to consider all conditions
 - Failure to check if the solution meets all conditions
Solution:
The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types. Therefore, we need to select one botanist, one chemist, and one zoologist. 
If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. Therefore, we can select only one botanist. 
F and K cannot both be selected. Therefore, we cannot select F and K together. 
K and M cannot both be selected. Therefore, we cannot select K and M together. 
If M is selected, both P and R must be selected. Therefore, if we select M, we must select both P and R. 
Now, let's check each option to see if it meets all the conditions:
Option [REDACTED]: [REDACTED]
- Includes two botanists (F and G), which violates the condition that we can select only one botanist.
- Includes two zoologists (P and Q), which violates the condition that if more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
- Violates the condition that F and K cannot both be selected.
- Includes K but not M, which violates the condition that K and M cannot both be selected.
- Does not include L or R, which violates the condition that if M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
Option [REDACTED]: [REDACTED]
- Includes two chemists (K and L), which violates the condition that we need to select one chemist.
- Does not include any zoologist, which violates the condition that we need to select one zoologist.
- Violates the condition that F and K cannot both be selected.
- Includes both K and M, which violates the condition that K and M cannot both be selected.
- Does not include P or R, which violates the condition that if M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
Option [REDACTED]: [REDACTED]
- Includes one botanist (G), one chemist (K), and one zoologist (R), which meets the condition that we need to select one botanist, one chemist, and one zoologist.
- Does not include more than one botanist, which meets the condition that if more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
- Does not violate the condition that F and K cannot both be selected.
- Does not include M, which meets the condition that K and M cannot both be selected.
- Includes R, which meets the condition that if M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
Option [REDACTED]: [REDACTED]
- Includes no botanist, which violates the condition that we need to select one botanist.
- Includes two chemists (K and M), which violates the condition that we need to select one chemist.
- Includes both P and R, which meets the condition that if M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
- Violates the condition that F and K cannot both be selected.
- Violates the condition that K and M cannot both be selected.
Option [REDACTED]: [REDACTED]
- Includes no botanist, which violates the condition that we need to select one botanist.
- Includes two chemists (L and M), which violates the condition that we need to select one chemist.
- Includes both P and Q, which violates the condition that if more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
- Violates the condition that F and K cannot both be selected.
- Includes M but not R, which violates the condition that if M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
Therefore, the only acceptable selection of scientists for the panel is option [REDACTED]: [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Read the problem carefully and understand the conditions for selecting the panelists.
2. Check each option to see if it meets all the conditions.
3. If an option violates any condition, eliminate it.
4. If more than one option remains, check each option again to see if it meets all the conditions.
5. Choose the option that meets all the conditions.
Advice:
 - Always read the problem carefully and understand the conditions.
 - Always check each option to see if it meets all the conditions.
 - Always eliminate any option that violates any condition.
 - Always double-check your selected option to see if it meets all the conditions.
