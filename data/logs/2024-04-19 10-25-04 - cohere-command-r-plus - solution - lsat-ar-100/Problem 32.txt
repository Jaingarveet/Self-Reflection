Context: A maintenance company that takes service requests from three clients—Image, Solide, and Truvest—plans to set targets for its average service response times. Service targets will be set at 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day. Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail. The six targets are set according to the following conditions: None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.

## Assistant 2:
Thought: 
Given that none of the clients have a voicemail target of 3 days, the following must be true:
- Image's website target is 1 day (as it must be shorter than their voicemail target)
- Solide's website target is 2 days (as it must be shorter than Truvest's)
- Solide's voicemail target is 2 days (as Image's is shorter and it can't be the same as their website target)
- Truvest's website target is 2 days (as it must be longer than Solide's)
- Truvest's voicemail target is 2 days

Therefore, the exception is choice A, as Image's website target could also be 2 days (it doesn't have to be 1 day).
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
