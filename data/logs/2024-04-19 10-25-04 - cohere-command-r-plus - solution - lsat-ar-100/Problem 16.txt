## Assistant 2:
Thought: We must assign the lab assistants to morning and afternoon sessions over the three days while adhering to the given constraints.

The correct answer is choice E:
Wednesday morning: Julio, Wednesday afternoon: Lan
Thursday morning: Olivia, Thursday afternoon: Nessa
Friday morning: Rebecca, Friday afternoon: Kevin

Step-by-step analysis:
1. Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions on the same day - satisfied by Friday in choice E.
2. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions on the same day - Lan is on Wednesday and Olivia is on Thursday in choice E, satisfying this constraint.
3. Nessa must lead an afternoon session - satisfied by Nessa being assigned to the afternoon session on Thursday in choice E.
4. Julio's session must be held earlier in the week than Olivia's - this is satisfied as Julio is assigned to Wednesday, and Olivia is assigned to Thursday in choice E.

Thus, choice E is the only option that satisfies all the constraints.

Action: Answer("E")
