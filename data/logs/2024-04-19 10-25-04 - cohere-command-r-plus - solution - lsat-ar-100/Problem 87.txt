Solution:
To ensure compliance with the requirements, let's analyze the constraints step by step: 

1. At least five and at most six works will be selected.
2. There are four constraints: 
   - No more than 4 French works can be selected (constraint 1).
   - 3-4 novels must be selected (constraint 2).
   - The number of French novels selected is greater than or equal to the number of Russian novels selected (constraint 3).
   - If both French plays are selected, the Russian play is not selected (constraint 4).
3. Given the constraints, we can deduce the following: 
   - From constraint 1, we know that the maximum number of French works that can be selected is 4.
   - From constraint 2, we know that at least 3 novels must be selected.
   - From constraint 3, we can deduce that to meet the requirement of selecting at least as many French novels as Russian novels, we should select at least 1 French novel. 
   - From constraint 4, there is no mandate to select a Russian play if both French plays are not chosen.
4. Therefore, the organizer must select at least: 
   - Two French novels (to meet constraints 2 and 3)
   - This selection also complies with the overall constraint of selecting at least five works.
