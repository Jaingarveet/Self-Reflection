Topic: Law
Context: Of the eight students—George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert—in a seminar, exactly six will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
Question: If Kyle gives the afternoon report on Tuesday, and Helen gives the afternoon report on Wednesday, which one of the following could be the list of the students who give the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively?
Choices:
  A: Irving, Lenore, and Nina
  B: Lenore, George, and Irving
  C: Nina, Irving, and Lenore
  D: Robert, George, and Irving

Solution:
Given that Kyle gives the afternoon report on Tuesday and Helen gives the afternoon report on Wednesday, we can deduce the following: 

Tuesday: George (morning), Kyle (afternoon)
Wednesday: Irving (morning), Helen (afternoon)

Now, considering the condition that if Nina gives a report, then Helen and Irving must give reports the next day, we can conclude that Nina could give a report on Monday or Tuesday. 

If Nina gives a report on Monday morning, then the list of students giving morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday would be: Nina, [gap], Irving. This does not satisfy the conditions, as there is no clear student who could give the morning report on Tuesday. 

However, if Nina gives a report on Tuesday morning, following Tuesday afternoon's report by Kyle, then the list becomes: [gap], Nina, [gap]. This satisfies the condition that Helen and Irving give reports the next day, i.e., Wednesday morning and afternoon, respectively. 

Therefore, the list of students giving morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday is: [Monday], Robert or Olivia, [Tuesday: Nina], [Wednesday: Irving]. 

The correct answer, based on these deductions, is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED].
