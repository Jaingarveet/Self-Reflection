Given conditions: 
- At least two books on each shelf
- More books on the bottom shelf than the top
- I is on the middle shelf
- K is on a higher shelf than F
- O is on a higher shelf than L
- F and M are on the same shelf

If G is placed on the top shelf, we know that the middle shelf must have at least two books, and K and F cannot be on the same shelf. 

The only option that satisfies all conditions is: 
- I, K, and L are on the middle shelf (D)
