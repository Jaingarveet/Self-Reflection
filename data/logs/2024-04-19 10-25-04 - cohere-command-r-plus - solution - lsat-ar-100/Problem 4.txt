Context: A chemistry class has six lab sessions scheduled over three days—Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday—one session heing held each morning and one each afternoon. Each session will be led by a different lab assistant—Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, or Rebecca. The assignment of lab assistants to sessions is constrained as follows: Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day. Nessa must lead an afternoon session. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
Question: If Lan does not lead a Wednesday session, then which one of the following lab assistants must lead a Thursday session?
Choices:
  A: Rebecca
  B: Olivia
  C: Nessa
  D: Kevin
  E: Julio

Use your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.
Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:

Given that Lan does not lead a Wednesday session, we can deduce the following:

- Wednesday morning: [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] (must be on the same day)
- Wednesday afternoon: [REDACTED] (Lan cannot be on the same day)
- Thursday morning: [REDACTED] (must be before [REDACTED])
- Thursday afternoon: [REDACTED] (must be in the afternoon)
- Friday morning: Lan (by elimination)
- Friday afternoon: [REDACTED] or [REDACTED] (by elimination, and they must be on the same day)

Therefore, [REDACTED] must lead a Thursday session, fulfilling the condition that his session occurs before [REDACTED]'s on Friday.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: Given that Lan does not lead a Wednesday session, we can deduce the following:

- Wednesday morning: Kevin and Rebecca (must be on the same day)
- Wednesday afternoon: Julio (Lan and Olivia cannot be on the same day as each other or Kevin/Rebecca)
- Thursday morning: Julio (must be before Olivia)
- Thursday afternoon: Nessa (must be in the afternoon)
- Friday morning: Lan (by elimination)
- Friday afternoon: Olivia or Rebecca (by elimination, and they must be on the same day)

Therefore, Julio must lead a Thursday session, fulfilling the condition that his session occurs before Olivia's on Friday.

Action: Answer("E")
