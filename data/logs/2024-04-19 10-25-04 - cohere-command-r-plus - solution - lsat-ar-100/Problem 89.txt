Context: A bakery makes exactly three kinds of cookieâ€”oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar. Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day. The following conditions apply: No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
Question: If the number of batches made on Friday is exactly one, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: The first batch of sugar cookies is made on Monday.
  B: The first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Tuesday.
  C: The third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Friday.
  D: The first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Wednesday.
  E: The second batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday.

Solution:
Given the conditions provided, let's break down the possible schedules for each cookie type: 
1. Oatmeal cookies: 
   - First batch: Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday 
   - Second batch (made the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies): Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday 
   - Third batch: Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday 

2. Peanut butter cookies: 
   - First batch: Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday 
   - Second batch: Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday 
   - Third batch: Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday 

3. Sugar cookies: 
   - First batch: Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday 
   - Second batch: Thursday 
   - Third batch: Tuesday, Wednesday, or Friday 

Now, considering the condition that only one batch is made on Friday, we can deduce the following: 
- The third batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Friday, as this would mean the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Wednesday, resulting in two batches on Friday (the second batch of peanut butter cookies and the third batch of oatmeal cookies). 
- The second batch of peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Friday, as this would mean the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Wednesday, again resulting in two batches on Friday (the third batch of oatmeal cookies and the second batch of peanut butter cookies). 

Therefore, the only cookie batch that can be made on Friday is the third batch of sugar cookies. 

Now, let's consider the possible scenarios for the first batch of sugar cookies: 
- If the first batch of sugar cookies is made on Monday, it satisfies all the conditions. The first batch of oatmeal cookies can be made on Tuesday, the second batch of oatmeal cookies and the first batch of peanut butter cookies can be made on Wednesday, leaving Thursday for the second batch of sugar cookies and Friday for the third batch of sugar cookies. 
- If the first batch of sugar cookies is made on Tuesday, it results in two batches being made on Friday, which goes against the given condition. 
- If the first batch of sugar cookies is made on Wednesday, it again results in two batches on Friday. 

Therefore, the correct answer is Choice [REDACTED]: The first batch of sugar cookies could be made on Monday, satisfying all the given conditions.
