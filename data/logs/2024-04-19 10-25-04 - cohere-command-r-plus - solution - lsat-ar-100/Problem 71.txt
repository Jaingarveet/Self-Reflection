Any information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].
Solution:
Let's break down the conditions and relationships step by step: 

1. Parra and Quinn must work in the same zone.
2. Stuckey and Udall work in the same zone.
3. Either Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1, but not both.
4. Either Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2, but not both.
5. Given that more reps are in Zone 3, and Stuckey and Udall are together, they must be in Zone 3. 
6. Now, we can place the remaining reps. [REDACTED], or both must be in Zone 3 to satisfy the condition of more reps in Zone 3 than Zone 2. 
7. Therefore, the list of sales representatives working in Zone 3 is: [REDACTED], Stuckey, and Udall.
## Assistant 2:
Thought: We know that Stuckey and Udall work in Zone 3 together, and either Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1. This means that either Parra or Tiao must also be in Zone 3, alongside Quinn who works in the same zone as Parra. Therefore, the complete list of sales representatives working in Zone 3 could be Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, and Udall.
