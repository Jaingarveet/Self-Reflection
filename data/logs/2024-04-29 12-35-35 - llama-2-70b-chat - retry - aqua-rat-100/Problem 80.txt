## Assistant 2:
  The cost of each brown sharpener = 100/18 = 5.55
The cost of each white sharpener = 5.55 + 1 = 6.55
Let the number of brown sharpeners be x.
Then, the number of white sharpeners is 18 - x.
The total cost of brown sharpeners = x * 5.55 = 5.55x
The total cost of white sharpeners = (18 - x) * 6.55 = 6.55(18 - x)
The total cost of all sharpeners = 5.55x + 6.55(18 - x) = 100

Now, solving for x, we get:
5.55x + 6.55(18 - x) = 100
5.55x + 119 - 6.55x = 100
-1x = -119
x = 119

Therefore, Jack bought 119 brown sharpeners and 8 white sharpeners.
