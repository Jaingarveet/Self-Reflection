## Assistant 2:
  My apologies, I don't have any information to provide a reflection for this question. However, I can provide a solution to the question.

Let's say the number of boys who joined the group is 4x and the number of girls who joined the group is 3x.
We know that the total number of members in the group is 64 (boys) + 40 (girls) = 104.

After the membership drive, the ratio of boys to girls is still 4:3, so we can set up the equation:
4x + 3x = 104

Simplifying the equation:
7x = 104

Dividing both sides by 7:
x = 14

Now we know that the number of boys who joined the group is 4x = 4(14) = 56, and the number of girls who joined the group is 3x = 3(14) = 42.

Therefore, the total number of members in the group now is 64 + 56 + 40 + 42 = 288.

Action: Answer("B")
