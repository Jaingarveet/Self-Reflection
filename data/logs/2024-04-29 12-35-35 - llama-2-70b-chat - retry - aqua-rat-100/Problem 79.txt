## Assistant 2:
  I'm sorry, but since there is no reflection information provided, I cannot use my self-reflection to help me answer this question. However, I can give you a step-by-step guide on how to solve this problem:

Let's say each nephew receives x rupees.
Since there are 2 nephews, the total amount they receive is 2x rupees.

Each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, so each daughter receives 4x rupees.
Since there are 4 daughters, the total amount they receive is 4x rupees.

Each son receives five times as much as each nephew, so each son receives 5x rupees.
Since there are 5 sons, the total amount they receive is 5x rupees.

We know that the total amount of money available is Rs 8600, so the total amount received by all daughters, sons, and nephews should equal Rs 8600.

Now, we can set up the following equation:
4x + 5x + 2x = 8600

Simplifying the equation:
11x = 8600

Dividing both sides by 11:
x = 780

So, each daughter receives 4x = 4(780) = 3120 rupees.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: E
