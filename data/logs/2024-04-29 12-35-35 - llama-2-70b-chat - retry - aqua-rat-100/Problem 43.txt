## Assistant 2:
  The monthly salary S of a shop assistant is the sum of a fixed salary of $500 plus 5% of all monthly sales. We can represent this mathematically as:

S = 500 + (0.05) \* x

where x is the monthly sales.

We want the monthly salary to reach $1500, so we set up the equation:

500 + (0.05) \* x = 1500

To solve for x, we can first subtract 500 from both sides:

(0.05) \* x = 1000

Next, we can divide both sides by 0.05:

x = 1000 / 0.05

x = 20,000

Therefore, the monthly sales should be $20,000 so that the shop assistant's monthly salary reaches $1500.

Action: Answer("B")
