## Assistant 2:
  My apologies, I don't have any information to provide for reflection on this question. However, I can provide a solution to the question.

Let's first calculate the time taken to cover the quarter distance.
Quarter distance = Total distance / 4
Total distance = 100 miles/hour x 10 hours = 1000 miles
Quarter distance = 1000 miles / 4 = 250 miles

Time taken to cover quarter distance = Distance / Speed
= 250 miles / 75 miles/hour
= 3.33 hours

Now, let's calculate the time taken for the remaining distance.
Remaining distance = Total distance - Quarter distance
= 1000 miles - 250 miles
= 750 miles

Time taken to cover remaining distance = Distance / Speed
= 750 miles / 75 miles/hour
= 10 hours

Total journey duration = Time taken to cover quarter distance + Time taken to cover remaining distance
= 3.33 hours + 10 hours
= 13.33 hours

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 13.5 hours.
