## Assistant 2:
  My apologies, I don't have any information to provide for reflection on this question. However, I can provide a solution to the question.

Let X be the weight in tons of the heavy-duty truck.
The average weight of the 10 vehicles before adding the heavy-duty truck was 12.2 tons.
The average weight of the 11 vehicles after adding the heavy-duty truck is:
(12.2 + X) / 11

The question states that the average weight increased by 2.6 tons, so we can set up the equation:
(12.2 + X) / 11 = 12.2 + 2.6

Simplifying the equation:
X = 42.2

Therefore, the weight of the heavy-duty truck is 42.2 tons.

Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
