## Assistant 2:
  My apologies, I don't have any information to provide a reflection for this question. However, I can provide a solution to the question.

Let's break this question down step by step:

1. 10% of the chocolates are cocoa flavored.
2. 90% of the rest (which means 90% of the chocolates that are not cocoa flavored) are squashed.

Now, we need to find the percentage of chocolates that are both vanilla flavored and not squashed. To do this, we need to find the intersection of the two sets: vanilla flavored chocolates and non-squashed chocolates.

The set of vanilla flavored chocolates is 100% - 10% = 90%.
The set of non-squashed chocolates is 100% - 90% = 10%.

The intersection of these two sets is the percentage of chocolates that are both vanilla flavored and not squashed. To find this intersection, we multiply the two percentages:

90% x 10% = 9%

Therefore, the percentage of chocolates that are both vanilla flavored and not squashed is 9%.
