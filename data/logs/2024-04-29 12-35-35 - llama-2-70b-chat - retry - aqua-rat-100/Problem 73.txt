Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".

## Assistant 2:
  Let's consider the number of students in the school to be x.
Since 20% of the students took physics, the number of students who took physics is 0.2x.
Similarly, since 28% of the students took math, the number of students who took math is 0.28x.

We know that 0.2x and 0.28x are both integers, so we can write:

0.2x = integer1
0.28x = integer2

We can simplify the equation by multiplying both sides by 100:

2x = 100integer1
28x = 100integer2

Now, we can solve for x:

2x = 100integer1
28x = 100integer2

x = 50integer1
x = 35.714285714285714285714286integer2

Since x is a whole number, we can round up 35.714285714285714285714286 to 36.
Therefore, the least possible number of students in the school is 50 + 36 = 86.

Action: Answer("E") None of the above.
