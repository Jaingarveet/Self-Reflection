## Assistant 2:
  My apologies, I don't have any reflection information to help me answer this question. However, I can provide a solution to the problem:

The formula for calculating the amount owed after n years at a simple interest rate of p per annum is:
A = P(1 + p)^n

Where:
A = amount owed after n years
P = principal amount (initial investment or borrowed amount)
p = simple interest rate per annum
n = time in years

In this case, the principal amount (P) is Rs. 500, the simple interest rate (p) is 6% per annum, and the time (n) is 4 years.

Substituting the values, we get:
A = 500(1 + 0.06)^4
A = 500(1.06)^4
A = 500(1.264)
A = 632

Therefore, the amount Rahul will pay to clear the debt after 4 years is Rs. 632.

Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: C
