## Assistant 2:
  My apologies, I don't have any reflection information to provide for this question. However, I can offer a solution to the problem.
The sum of 5 consecutive two-digit odd numbers can be represented as:
n + (n + 2) + (n + 4) + (n + 6) + (n + 8)
where n is the first number.
We know that when divided by 10, the result is a perfect square.
Let's find the square root of the sum:

Square root (n + (n + 2) + (n + 4) + (n + 6) + (n + 8))
= Square root (5n + 20)
= 5 square root (n + 4)

Since the square root of 5 is irrational, the only way for 5 square root (n + 4) to be a perfect square is when n + 4 is a perfect square.

Let's find when n + 4 is a perfect square:
n + 4 = m^2
n = m^2 - 4

Since n is a two-digit odd number, m must be even.
m^2 - 4 must be odd.
The only even perfect square - 4 is 16, which means m = 4.

So, n = 4^2 - 4 = 16 - 4 = 12.
The first number is 12, and the next 4 consecutive two-digit odd numbers are 13, 15, 17, 19.

Action: Answer("B")
