## Assistant 2:
  My apologies, I don't have any information to provide for reflection on this question. However, I can provide a solution to the problem:

Let's assume the first train, Train A, leaves the station at time t. Then, Train B leaves the station at time t + 17 minutes.

Since both trains leave simultaneously, we can set up the equation:
t + 16 = t + 17

Subtracting t from both sides gives us:
16 = 17

This equation is not true, so we know that the trains will never leave the station simultaneously again.

Therefore, the answer is:
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
