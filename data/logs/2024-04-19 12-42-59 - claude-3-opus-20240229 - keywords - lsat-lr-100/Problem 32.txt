## User 2:
Topic: Law
Context: Editorial: This political party has repeatedly expressed the view that increasing spending on education is a worthy goal. On other occasions, however, the same party has claimed that the government should not increase spending on education. So this party's policy is clearly inconsistent.
Question: The argument in the editorial depends on assuming which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: It is inconsistent for a legislator both to claim that increasing spending on education is a worthy goal and to vote against increasing spending on education.
  B: A consistent course of action in educational policy is usually the course of action that will reduce spending on education in the long run.
  C: Even if a goal is a morally good one, one should not necessarily try to achieve it.
  D: A consistent political policy does not hold that an action that comprises a worthy goal should not be performed.
  E: Members of one political party never have inconsistent views on how to best approach a political issue.

## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
The key points in the editorial's argument are:
1) The party has expressed that increasing education spending is a worthy goal
2) The same party has also claimed the government should not increase education spending 
3) The editorial concludes the party's policy is inconsistent
The editorial is assuming that it is inconsistent to both:
a) Claim increasing education spending is a worthy goal, and 
b) Claim the government should not increase education spending
In other words, the editorial assumes a consistent policy would not hold that an action comprising a worthy goal (increasing education spending) should not be performed.
Looking at the answer choices:
A matches the key assumption - it states it is inconsistent to claim increasing education spending is worthy but then vote against actually increasing it.
B, C and E are not assumptions the editorial relies on. 
D is tricky as it is stated in the negative, but it captures the same idea as A - a consistent policy would not say a worthy goal should not be pursued.
Between A and D, A most directly matches the editorial's reasoning.
Action: Answer("A")
## Result:
Agent Answer: A
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
