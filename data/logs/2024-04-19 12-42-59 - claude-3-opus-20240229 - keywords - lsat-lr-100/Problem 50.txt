Topic: Law
Context: Cigarette companies claim that manufacturing both low-and high-nicotine cigarettes allows smokers to choose how much nicotine they want. However, a recent study has shown that the levels of nicotine found in the blood of smokers who smoke one pack of cigarettes per day are identical at the end of a day's worth of smoking, whatever the level of nicotine in the cigarettes they smoke.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain the finding of the nicotine study?
Choices:
  A: Blood cannot absorb more nicotine per day than that found in the smoke from a package of the lowest-nicotine cigarettes available.
  B: Smokers of the lowest-nicotine cigarettes available generally smoke more cigarettes per day than smokers of high-nicotine cigarettes.
  C: Most nicotine is absorbed into the blood of a smoker even if it is delivered in smaller quantities.
  D: The level of tar in cigarettes is higher in low-nicotine cigarettes than it is in some high-nicotine cigarettes.
  E: When taking in nicotine by smoking cigarettes is discontinued, the level of nicotine in the blood decreases steadily.

## Assistant 2:
Thought process:
The key to answering this question is finding the choice that best explains why smokers of low-nicotine and high-nicotine cigarettes end up with the same blood nicotine levels.
(A) suggests blood has a maximum nicotine absorption per day. But this doesn't explain equal levels between low and high nicotine cigarette smokers.
(B) states that smokers of low-nicotine cigarettes smoke more per day than smokers of high-nicotine ones. This would help equalize the daily nicotine intake between the groups, explaining the study results. 
(C) and (D) discuss nicotine and tar absorption/levels but don't address differences between low and high nicotine groups.
(E) is about nicotine levels after stopping smoking, which is not relevant.
Therefore, (B) is the best answer. If low-nicotine cigarette smokers smoke more cigarettes per day, it would tend to equalize the total daily nicotine intake between low and high nicotine cigarette smokers. This directly helps explain why the two groups were found to have similar blood nicotine levels.
Action: Answer("B")
