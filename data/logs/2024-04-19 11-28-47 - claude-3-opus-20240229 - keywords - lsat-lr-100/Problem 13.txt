Topic: Law
Context: Economics professor: Marty's Pizza and Checkers Pizza are the two major pizza parlors in our town. Marty's sold coupon books including coupons good for one large plain pizza at any local pizza parlor, at Marty's expense. But Checkers refused to accept these coupons, even though they were redeemed by all other local pizza parlors. Accepting them would have cost Checkers nothing and would have satisfied those of its potential customers who had purchased the coupon books. This shows that Checkers's motive in refusing to accept the coupons was simply to hurt Marty's Pizza.
Question: Which one of the following, if assumed, enables the economics professor's conclusion to be properly drawn?
Choices:
  A: Any company that refuses to accept coupons issued by a competitor when doing so would satisfy some of the company's potential customers is motivated solely by the desire to hurt that competitor.
  B: Any company that wishes to hurt a competitor by refusing to accept coupons issued by that competitor will refuse to accept them even when accepting them would cost nothing and would satisfy its potential customers.
  C: At least one company has refused to accept coupons issued by its major local competitor simply in order to hurt that competitor, even though those coupons were accepted by all other local competitors.
  D: Any company that accepts its major competitor's coupons helps its competitor by doing so, even if it also satisfies its own actual or potential customers.
  E: If accepting coupons issued by a competitor would not enable a company to satisfy its actual or potential customers, then that company's refusal to accept the coupons is motivated by the desire to satisfy customers.

## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
The key points in the professor's argument are:
1) Checkers refused to accept coupons that Marty's issued, even though all other local pizza parlors accepted them. 
2) Accepting the coupons would have cost Checkers nothing and satisfied some of its potential customers.
3) Therefore, Checkers' motive in refusing the coupons was simply to hurt Marty's Pizza.
To properly draw this conclusion, we need to assume a general principle that connects Checkers' specific actions to the motive of wanting to hurt Marty's.
Looking at the choices:
A) This is too broad. A company could have other motives for refusing competitor coupons besides just wanting to hurt the competitor. It assumes hurting the competitor is the sole motive.
B) This looks promising. It states that if a company wants to hurt a competitor by refusing their coupons, they will do so even when it costs them nothing and dissatisfies customers. This matches Checkers' behavior as described.
C) This just states that at least one company has behaved this way, but doesn't establish a general principle that would allow concluding Checkers' motive. It's too specific to another company.
D) This is about the consequences of accepting a competitor's coupons, not about the motives behind refusing them. It's not directly relevant.
E) This is the inverse of the professor's argument. The professor argues that since refusing the coupons did satisfy customers, the motive wasn't satisfying customers. This choice doesn't help establish the professor's conclusion.
Therefore, B is the best choice. It provides the missing assumption that connects Checkers' actions to the motive of wanting to hurt Marty's.
Action: Answer("B")
