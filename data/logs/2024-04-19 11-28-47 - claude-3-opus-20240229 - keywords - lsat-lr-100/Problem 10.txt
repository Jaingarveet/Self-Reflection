  C: If people have used your property without your permission, it is not wrong for you to use their property without their permission.
  D: It is permissible to treat people in a way that is siruilar to the way in which they have treated others.
  E: Using another person's property is wrong if the person is harmed by that use.

## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. Mike is trying to justify using Tom's computer without permission by pointing out that Tom used Mary's bicycle without her permission. 
2. Mike seems to be relying on a general principle rather than the specifics of computer or bicycle use. The principle is that if someone has used another person's property without permission, it's okay for that person to use the first person's property without permission in return.
3. Looking at the answer choices, C and D both capture this general principle of reciprocity - that it's acceptable to treat others how they have treated you or others. 
4. Between C and D, C is more directly applicable, as it specifically refers to using others' property without permission, which matches the example in the question.
5. The other choices are less relevant - A is too broad, B is unrelated to property use, and E focuses on harm rather than permission, which isn't the key issue in Mike's reasoning.
Therefore, the best answer is C - it articulates the general principle that Mike is using to justify his actions.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
