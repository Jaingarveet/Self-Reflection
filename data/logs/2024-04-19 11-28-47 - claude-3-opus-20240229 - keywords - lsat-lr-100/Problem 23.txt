Context: Teacher: Participating in organized competitive athletics may increase a child's strength and coordination. As critics point out, however, it also instills in those children who are not already well developed in these respects a feeling of inferiority that never really disappears. Yet, since research has shown that adults with feelings of inferiority become more successful than those free of such anxieties, funding for children's athletic programs should not be eliminated.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes the role played in the teacher's argument by the assertion that participating in organized competitive athletics may increase a child's strength and coordination?
Choices:
  A: It is mentioned as one possible reason for adopting a policy for which the teacher suggests an additional reason.
  B: It is a claim that the teacher attempts to refute with counterarguments.
  C: It is a hypothesis for which the teacher offers additional evidence.
  D: It is cited as an insufficient reason for eliminating funding for children's athletic programs.
  E: It is cited as an objection that has been raised to the position that the teacher is supporting.

## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The teacher's main argument is that funding for children's athletic programs should not be eliminated. 
2. The teacher acknowledges the critics' point that participating in competitive athletics can instill feelings of inferiority in some children.
3. However, the teacher counters this by saying research shows adults with feelings of inferiority become more successful. This is the teacher's main reason to support continued funding.
4. The statement that participating in athletics may increase a child's strength and coordination is mentioned at the beginning. 
5. This statement is not the teacher's main point, but rather a concession - the teacher is acknowledging a potential benefit of athletics before presenting the critics' counterargument.
6. After presenting the critics' view, the teacher argues against eliminating funding for a different reason (the research about adults with inferiority feelings being more successful).
Therefore, the role of the statement is that it is mentioned as one possible reason for adopting a policy (continuing athletic funding) for which the teacher suggests an additional reason (the research finding).
Action: Answer("A")
