## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The Lac Nichoutec Film Festival only shows Canadian films. 
2. This year, most (but not necessarily all) of the prize-winning films at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival also won prizes at international film festivals.
The question asks which statement must be true based on the given information.
A: [REDACTED]
B: [REDACTED] 
C: If most of the Lac Nichoutec prize winners also won at international festivals, then it logically follows that at least some Canadian films must have won prizes at international festivals this year. This statement must be true.
D: [REDACTED]
E: [REDACTED]
Therefore, the correct answer is C - Some of the films that won prizes at international film festivals this year were Canadian films.
The key insights are:
1) Recognizing that "most" means at least some, even if not all
2) Focusing only on what must be true, not what could possibly be true
3) Correctly linking the festival prize winners to Canadian films, based on the initial premise
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
