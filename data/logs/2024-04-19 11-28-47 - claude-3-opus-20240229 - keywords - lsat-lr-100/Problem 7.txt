Topic: Law
Context: Radio producer: Our failure to attract new listeners over the past several years has forced us to choose between devoting some airtime to other, more popular genres of music, and sticking with classical music that appeals only to our small but loyal audience. This audience, however loyal, did not generate enough advertising revenue for us to pay our bills, so if we appeal to them alone, our station risks going out of business. We should not take that risk. We should, therefore, devote some airtime to other, more popular genres of music.
Question: Which one of the following arguments is most similar in its pattern of reasoning to that used by the radio producer?
Choices:
  A: We should either buy blinds for the windows or make full-length curtains. Blinds would be very expensive to purchase. Thus, if cost is our greatest concern, we should make curtains.
  B: We should either make curtains for the windows or buy blinds. Since the windows are not standard sizes, if we buy blinds we will have to special order them. Since we do not have time to wait for special orders, we should make the curtains.
  C: For the living room windows, we can make curtains or valances or both. We want to have privacy; and while curtains provide privacy, valances do not. So we should make curtains but not valances.
  D: Since we have very little fabric, we will have to either buy more, or make valances instead of curtains. However, if we use this fabric to make valances, then we will have to buy blinds. Since it would be hard to buy fabric that matches what we already have, we should buy blinds.
  E: We should either buy blinds or make curtains for the windows. If we buy blinds but do not make valances, the windows will look bare. We should not have bare windows. So if we do not make the curtains, we should make the valances.

## Assistant 2:
Let's break this down step-by-step:
The radio producer's argument follows this pattern:
1. We have two options: A (devote airtime to other genres) or B (stick with classical only)
2. If we do B, there is a major risk (going out of business) 
3. We should not take that major risk
4. Therefore, we should do A
Now let's look at each answer choice:
A: This has a similar pattern:
1. Two options: A (buy blinds) or B (make curtains)
2. If we do A, there is a major issue (very expensive)
3. If cost is the greatest concern, we should avoid that major issue 
4. Therefore, we should do B
This matches the radio producer's reasoning well.
B, C, D, E: These don't follow the same pattern of presenting two options, identifying a major risk/issue with one option, stating that risk/issue should be avoided, and therefore concluding the other option should be taken.
Upon reflection, I see that identifying the key elements of the original argument and matching that pattern is crucial. I overlooked that before. The risk assessment and parallel structure between the two arguments is the key.
Action: Answer("A")
