## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The museum only displays 20th century works, either on loan from private collectors or from the museum's permanent collection.
2. Prints of all works in the permanent collection are available in the museum store. 
3. The museum store also sells prints of some works not in the permanent collection, like Hopper's Nighthawks.
4. Nighthawks is a 20th century work, since a print of it is sold in the store which only has prints of 20th century works.
5. However, we don't know if Nighthawks is actually displayed in the museum. It could be on loan and displayed, or not displayed at all.
Looking at the choices:
A is incorrect. Nighthawks shows the store sells prints of works beyond just loans and the permanent collection.
B looks correct. The store only sells prints of 20th century works, whether from the collection, loans, or neither. 
C is incorrect. Nighthawks shows not every print is of a displayed work.
D is unsupported. We don't know if Nighthawks is on loan to the museum.
E is also unsupported. Nighthawks may or may not be displayed.
Therefore, B is the best answer, as it must be true given the curator's statements.
Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: C
Score: 0
