Context: Ethicist: Marital vows often contain the promise to love "until death do us part." If "love" here refers to a feeling, then this promise makes no sense, for feelings are not within one's control, and a promise to do something not within one's control makes no sense. Thus, no one—including those making marital vows—should take "love" in this context to be referring to feelings.
Question: The ethicist's conclusion follows logically if which one of the following is assumed?
Choices:
  A: None of our feelings are within our control.
  B: People should not make promises to do something that is not within their control.
  C: "Love" can legitimately be taken to refer to something other than feelings.
  D: Promises should not be interpreted in such a way that they make no sense.
  E: Promises that cannot be kept do not make any sense.

## Assistant 2:
Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The ethicist argues that if "love" in wedding vows refers to a feeling, then the promise to love "until death do us part" makes no sense. This is because feelings are not within one's control.
2. The ethicist then concludes that no one should take "love" in this context to be referring to feelings. 
3. For this conclusion to follow logically, there must be an unstated premise or assumption that bridges the gap between the premise (promises to do something outside one's control make no sense) and the conclusion (love in wedding vows shouldn't refer to feelings).
4. Looking at the answer choices:
A) This is too broad. The argument doesn't require that none of our feelings are controllable, only that love in particular is not.
B) This fits as an unstated premise, but it's not sufficient by itself to reach the conclusion. It could still be the case that love refers to feelings and the vows just don't make sense.
C) If this is assumed, then the conclusion follows - there is another legitimate way to interpret love in the vows besides feelings. This looks promising.
D) This is essentially just restating the premise, not providing the missing link to the conclusion.
E) This is close, but the argument allows for the possibility that the vows could make sense if love referred to something besides feelings. It doesn't require that a promise must be possible to keep in order to make sense.
5. C is the best answer. If we assume that love can refer to something besides feelings, then it follows that wedding vows shouldn't take love to mean feelings, because then the vows would be a promise to do something uncontrollable, which the ethicist considers nonsensical.
Action: Answer("C")
