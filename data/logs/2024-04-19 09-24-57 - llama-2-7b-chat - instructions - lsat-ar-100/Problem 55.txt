  Topic: Law
Question: Which one of the following is an acceptable schedule of witnesses?

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand the mistake now. Let me analyze the problem again and find the correct solution.

The conditions given in the problem are:

1. Franco does not testify on the same day as Garcia.
2. Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
3. Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
4. Hong does not testify on Monday.
5. At least one witness testifies on Monday.

From the conditions, we can deduce that:

1. Franco testifies on Monday.
2. Hong testifies on Tuesday.
3. Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
4. Garcia testifies on either Tuesday or Wednesday.

Now, let's evaluate each of the given options:

A: Monday: Franco Tuesday: Hong and Iturbe Wednesday: Garcia and Jackson

This option violates condition 1, as Franco and Garcia testify on the same day (Tuesday).

B: Monday: Franco and Hong Tuesday: Iturbe and Jackson Wednesday: Garcia

This option violates condition 3, as Iturbe testifies on Wednesday, but there is no witness who testifies on Tuesday.

C: Monday: Garcia Tuesday: Franco and Iturbe Wednesday: Hong and Jackson

This option violates condition 4, as Garcia testifies on Tuesday, but there is no witness who testifies on Monday.

D: Monday: Garcia and Jackson Tuesday: Franco and Hong Wednesday: Iturbe

This option violates condition 1, as Garcia and Franco testify on the same day (Tuesday).

E: Monday: Garcia and Jackson Tuesday: Hong Wednesday: Franco and Iturbe

This option violates condition 3, as Iturbe testifies on Wednesday, but there is no witness who testifies on Tuesday.

Therefore, the only acceptable schedule of witnesses is:

Answer("E")

Monday: Garcia and Jackson
Tuesday: Franco and Hong
Wednesday: Iturbe

This schedule meets all the conditions given in the problem, and each witness testifies on the correct day.
## Result:
Agent Answer: E
Correct Answer: D
Score: 0
