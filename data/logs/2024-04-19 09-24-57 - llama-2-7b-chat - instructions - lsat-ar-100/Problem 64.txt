## Assistant 2:
  Thought: 
I previously answered this question incorrectly, so I need to reassess the problem and my solution.

Action: I will re-read the conditions given in the question and analyze them carefully.

Thought: Okay, I see that Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, and either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other, and Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

Action: Based on these conditions, I can conclude that Mahr and Stuckey do not work in the same sales zone. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) Stuckey works in Zone 2.

Reflection: I made a mistake in my initial answer, but I was able to identify the error and correct it through careful analysis of the conditions given in the question. This shows the importance of self-reflection in problem-solving and the value of carefully reviewing and analyzing information before making a decision.
