Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and after reviewing the problem, I realized my mistake. Here is my reflection:

I misunderstood the information provided and made an incorrect assumption about the timing of the house showings. I thought that the houses were being shown in a specific order, but upon further review, I see that the information does not provide any information about the order in which the houses are being shown.

To answer the question correctly, I will use the information provided to determine the possible combinations of when each house can be shown.

From the problem statement, we know that:

* J must be shown in the evening.
* K cannot be shown in the morning.
* L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.

Using these constraints, we can eliminate some of the options:

* Option A: K is shown in the evening. This is true, as we know that J must be shown in the evening, and K cannot be shown in the morning.
* Option B: L is shown in the afternoon. This is false, as L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown, and the afternoon is before the evening.
* Option C: L is shown in the evening. This is true, as we know that J must be shown in the evening, and L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
* Option D: M is shown in the morning. This is false, as K cannot be shown in the morning.
* Option E: M is shown in the afternoon. This is false, as L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown, and the afternoon is before the evening.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C): L is shown in the evening.
