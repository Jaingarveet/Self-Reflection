## Assistant 2:
  Thought: I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I need to reassess the problem.

The conditions given in the problem state that exactly two of the traditional pieces are performed consecutively, and the pianist who performs the second solo does not perform the fifth solo. This means that there must be at least three solos in total, as there must be two traditional pieces performed consecutively and one solo left for the fourth pianist.

Additionally, the problem states that no traditional piece is performed until Wayne performs at least one modern piece. This means that Wayne must perform at least one modern piece, and therefore there must be at least four solos in total.

Action: Answer("C")

Explanation: The minimum number of solos in which Wayne performs a traditional piece is two. This is because the third solo is a traditional piece, and the fourth solo must be either a traditional piece performed by Wayne or a modern piece performed by Zara. Therefore, there must be at least two traditional pieces performed by Wayne, and he must perform at least one modern piece.
## Result:
