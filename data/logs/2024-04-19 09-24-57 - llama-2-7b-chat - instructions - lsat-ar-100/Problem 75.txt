## Assistant 2:
  Thought: I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I need to reassess the problem.

Jiang and Lopez do not review any of the plays, and Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. This means that Lopez and Megregian do not review any of the plays that Jiang reviews.

Action: Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* Kramer and Lopez do not review any of the plays that Jiang reviews.
* Lopez and Megregian do not review any of the plays that Jiang reviews.
* O'Neill reviews Tamerlane with Kramer.

From this information, we can conclude that Jiang, Lopez, and O'Neill are the only students who review only Sunset.

Action: Answer("C")
