## Assistant 2:
  Thought: I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I realize that I made a mistake in my reasoning. I need to re-evaluate the problem and use the given conditions to determine the correct answer.

Action: I will re-read the problem and use the conditions provided to determine the answer.

Reflection: Okay, let me re-read the problem and use the conditions to determine the answer.

From the problem, we know that exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday). We also know that no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.

So, if no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then we can conclude that at least one batch of cookies must be made on Monday. This is because if no batches are made on Wednesday, then the only other possible days for a batch to be made are Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) At least two batches of cookies are made on Monday.

Action: I will select option (C) At least two batches of cookies are made on Monday as the correct answer.
