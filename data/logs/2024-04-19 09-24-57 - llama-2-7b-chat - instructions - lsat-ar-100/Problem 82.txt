Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.

There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

## Assistant 2:
  Topic: Law
Question: Which one of the following could be an accurate matching of the sales representatives to the sales zones in which they work?

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I realize now that I made a mistake in my reasoning. Here is my self-reflection:

* I misunderstood the condition that states that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. I thought that Parra and Tiao could both work in Zone 1, which led me to choose the incorrect answer.
* I also misunderstood the condition that states that either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. I thought that Tiao and Udall could both work in Zone 2, which led me to choose the incorrect answer.
* I did not consider the condition that states that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, which is crucial in determining the correct matching of sales representatives to sales zones.

To answer the question correctly, I will use the following reasoning:

* Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other, so they must work in Zone 1.
* Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other, so they must work in Zone 3.
* There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, so Mahr must work in Zone 3.
* Therefore, the correct matching of sales representatives to sales zones is:

Zone 1: Kim, Parra, Quinn
Zone 2: Stuckey, Udall
Zone 3: Mahr
