## Assistant 2:
  Topic: Law

Question: Which one of the following must be true?

Reflection:

Initial Answer: I previously answered this question incorrectly. I thought that option A, "Jiang reviews more of the plays than Lopez does," was the correct answer. However, upon further reflection, I realized that this is not the case.

Correct Answer: The correct answer is option B, "Megregian reviews more of the plays than Jiang does."

Explanation:

From the given information, we know that Kramer and Lopez each review fewer plays than Megregian. This means that Megregian must review at least two plays, and since neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any plays that Jiang reviews, it follows that Megregian must review at least one play that Jiang does not review. Therefore, Megregian reviews more plays than Jiang does.

Option A is incorrect because Lopez does not review any plays that Jiang reviews, so Jiang does not review more plays than Lopez does.

Option C is also incorrect because, as mentioned earlier, Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, so O'Neill does not review more plays than Kramer does.

Option D is incorrect because, as mentioned earlier, O'Neill does not review any plays that Jiang reviews, so Jiang does not review more plays than O'Neill does.

Option E is incorrect because, as mentioned earlier, Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, so O'Neill does not review more plays than Kramer does.

Therefore, the correct answer is option B, "Megregian reviews more of the plays than Jiang does."
