Context: A chemistry class has six lab sessions scheduled over three days—Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday—one session heing held each morning and one each afternoon. Each session will be led by a different lab assistant—Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, or Rebecca. The assignment of lab assistants to sessions is constrained as follows: Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day. Nessa must lead an afternoon session. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
Question: If Julio and Kevin both lead morning sessions, then any of the following could be true EXCEPT:
Choices:
  A: Lan's session meets Wednesday morning.
  B: Lan's session meets Thursday afternoon.
  C: Nessa's session meets Friday afternoon.
  D: Olivia's session meets Thursday morning.
  E: Olivia's session meets Friday morning.

## Assistant 2:
  Thought: I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I need to reassess the problem.

Action: I will re-evaluate the constraints given in the problem:

* Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
* Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
* Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
* Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.

Reflection: I realized that I misunderstood the constraint related to Kevin and Rebecca. They can only lead sessions that meet on the same day, not necessarily at the same time.

Now, let me re-evaluate the possible combinations of lab assistants leading sessions:

1. Julio and Kevin both lead morning sessions, so Lan's session cannot meet Wednesday morning (choice A).
2. Julio and Kevin both lead morning sessions, so Lan's session cannot meet Thursday afternoon (choice B).
3. Julio leads an earlier session than Olivia, so Olivia's session cannot meet Friday morning (choice D).
4. Nessa must lead an afternoon session, so her session cannot meet Friday morning (choice E).

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) Olivia's session meets Thursday morning.
