## Assistant 2:
  Thought: I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I need to reassess the problem.

Action: Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* The newspaper costs $4 on Sunday and $1 the rest of the days of the week.
* The hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week.
* The hotel pays $210 per week for newspapers.

From the information provided, we can deduce that the hotel buys 2 x 4 = 8 newspapers on Sunday.

For the remaining days of the week, the hotel buys 1/2 = 5 newspapers.

So, the total number of newspapers the hotel buys per week is 8 + 5 = 13.

Action: Answer("D")
