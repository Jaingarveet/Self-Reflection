Question: An athlete runs M miles in 4 hours, then rides a bike N miles in the same number of hours. Which of the following represents the average speed, in miles per hour, for these two activities combined?
Choices:
  A: M + N / 8
  B: 2M + N / 8
  C: M + N / 4
  D: M + 3N / 8
  E: M + N / 5

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly. My solution was:

A: M + N / 8

However, upon further reflection, I realized that my answer was incorrect. The correct solution is:

B: 2M + N / 8

Explanation:
The athlete runs M miles in 4 hours, which means they covered M miles in 4/1 = 4 hours.
Then, they ride a bike N miles in the same number of hours, which means they covered N miles in 4/2 = 2 hours.
To find the average speed for these two activities combined, we need to add the distance covered in each activity and divide by the total time taken:

M + N / 2 = (M + N) / 4

Therefore, the average speed for these two activities combined is:

B: 2M + N / 8

Answer: B
## Result:
Agent Answer: None
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
