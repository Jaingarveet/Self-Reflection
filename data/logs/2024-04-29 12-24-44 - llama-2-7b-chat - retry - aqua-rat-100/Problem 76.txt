## System:
You are an expert in Math.
Your task is to answer the following multiple-choice questions.
Think step-by-step to ensure you have the correct answer.
Then, answer the question using the following format 'Action: Answer("[choice]")'  
The parameter [choice] is the letter or number of the answer you want to select (e.g. "A", "B", "C", or "D")
For example, 'Answer("C")' will select the choice "C" as the best answer.
You MUST select one of the available choices; the answer CANNOT be "None of the Above".
Be concise in your response but include any essential information.

## Assistant 2:
  Thought: 
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand the mistake.
Action: Let's analyze the problem again.

The given equation is:
x = (n2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16) / (n+ 4√n+ 4)

We are given that n is such that 36 ≤ n ≤ 72.

Let's substitute n = 40, which is within the given range.

x = (402 + 2√(40)(40 + 4) + 16) / (40+ 4√(40)+ 4)

x = 160 / 48

x = 3.5

So, the correct answer is (B) 23 < x < 58.

Reflection:
I realized that I made a mistake in my previous answer by not paying close attention to the range of n. I also learned the importance of double-checking my work and being more careful in my calculations.
