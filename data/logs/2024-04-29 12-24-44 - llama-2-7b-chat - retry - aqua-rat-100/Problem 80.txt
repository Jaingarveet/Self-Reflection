## Assistant 2:
  Thought: 
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand that I need to pay more attention to the information given in the problem.
Action: Let's analyze the problem again.
Jack buys 18 sharpeners for Rs. 100, and he pays 1 rupee more for each white sharpeners than brown sharpeners. This means that if he buys x white sharpeners, he will pay Rs. 100 + (x - 1) for the brown sharpeners.
We know that the total cost of the sharpeners is Rs. 100, so we can set up the equation:
x + (x - 1) = 100

Simplifying the equation, we get:
2x = 100

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
x = 50

So, Jack buys 50 white sharpeners and 30 brown sharpeners.
Action: Answer("C")
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
