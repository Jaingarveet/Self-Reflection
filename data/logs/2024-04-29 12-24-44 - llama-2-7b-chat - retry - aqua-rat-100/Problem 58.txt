## Assistant 2:
  Thought: 
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand that Ball A makes 2 full rotations in 26 minutes, while Ball B makes 5 full rotations in 35 minutes. To find when they will be at the same starting point again, I need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 26 and 35.

Action: Answer("B")
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: A
Score: 0
