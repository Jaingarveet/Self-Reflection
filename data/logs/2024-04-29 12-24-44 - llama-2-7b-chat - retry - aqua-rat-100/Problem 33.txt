Question: A paper is in a square form whose one side is 20 cm. Two semi circles are drawn on its opposites as diameters. If these semi circles are cut down what is the area of the remaining paper?
Choices:
  A: 8.75
  B: 8.79
  C: 8.75
  D: 8.71
  E: 8.72

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I realized that I made a mistake in my calculation. I understand that the area of the remaining paper can be calculated by finding the area of the two semi-circles and subtracting it from the area of the original square paper.

To find the area of the semi-circles, I can use the formula: Area = πr^2, where r is the radius of the semi-circle. The radius of each semi-circle is half the diameter, so the radius of each semi-circle is 10 cm (since the diameter of each semi-circle is 20 cm).

The area of each semi-circle is:
Area = π(10)^2 = 80π

Now, to find the area of the remaining paper, I need to subtract the area of the semi-circles from the area of the original square paper. The area of the original square paper is:
Area = 20 cm x 20 cm = 400 cm^2

So, the area of the remaining paper is:
Area = 400 cm^2 - 80π = [REDACTED]

Therefore, the correct answer is [E: 8.72].
