Question: A square piece of cloth is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge to form a rectangular piece, which is then cut diagonally in half to create two triangles. If the area of each of the triangles is 70 square feet, what was the perimeter (in feet) of the original piece of square cloth?

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly. My solution was based on a misunderstanding of the problem. I realized my mistake and reflected on the problem to identify the correct solution.

To find the perimeter of the original square cloth, we need to find the perimeter of the rectangular piece that is formed by trimming the square on one edge. The perimeter of a rectangle is found by adding the lengths of all four sides.

So, the perimeter of the rectangular piece is 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 16 feet.

Since the rectangular piece is then cut diagonally in half to form two triangles, the perimeter of each triangle is half of the perimeter of the rectangular piece. Therefore, the perimeter of each triangle is 16/2 = 8 feet.

Since the area of each triangle is 70 square feet, we can set up the following equation:

Perimeter of triangle = Area of triangle
8 feet = 70 square feet

Solving for the perimeter of the original square cloth, we get:

Perimeter of original square cloth = 2 x 8 feet = 16 feet

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 58 feet.
