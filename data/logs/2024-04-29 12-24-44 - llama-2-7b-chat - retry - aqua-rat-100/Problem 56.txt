## Assistant 2:
  Thought: I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I need to reassess the problem.

Action: Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The man borrows Rs.360.
2. He pays it back in 12 monthly installments.
3. The installments are Rs.31.50 each.

To find the interest rate, we need to divide the total amount borrowed by the number of installments:

Interest rate = Total amount borrowed / Number of installments
= Rs.360 / 12
= 3%

Action: Answer("A: 1.5%")
