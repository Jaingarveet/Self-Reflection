Question: Mark told John "If you give me half your money I will have Rs.75. John said, "if you give me one third of your money, I will have Rs.75/-. How much money did John have ?

Action: Answer("C")

Explanation:

I previously answered this question incorrectly, and upon reflection, I realized that I made a mistake in my calculation. The correct answer is C: 28.

Here's how I arrived at the answer:

If Mark gives John half of his money, John will have Rs.75.

John said that if Mark gives him one third of his money, he will have Rs.75.

So, if John had Rs.75 initially, and Mark gave him one third of his money, John would have:

Rs.75 / 3 = Rs.25

Therefore, John had Rs.28 initially.
## Result:
Agent Answer: C
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
