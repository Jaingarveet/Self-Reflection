## Assistant 2:
  Thought: 
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand the mistake. To solve this problem, I will use the concept of relative speed, which is the speed at which the two cars are moving relative to each other.

Action: Answer("B")

Explanation:
The relative speed between the two cars is 13 - 12 = 1 mph.
Since the highway is 50 miles long, it will take the car traveling at 13 mph x 50/13 = 3.85 hours to cover the distance.
The car traveling at 12 mph will take 50/12 = 4.17 hours to cover the distance.
Therefore, the cars will meet after 3.85 - 4.17 = 0.32 hours or 20 minutes.

Note: I have corrected my previous answer and reflected on my mistake to ensure a more accurate solution.
## Result:
Agent Answer: B
Correct Answer: E
Score: 0
