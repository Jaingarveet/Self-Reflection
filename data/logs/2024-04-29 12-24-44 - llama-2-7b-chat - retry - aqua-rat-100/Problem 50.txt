Question: A ship went on a voyage. After it had traveled 180 miles a plane started with 10 times the speed of the ship. Find the distance when they meet from starting point.

E: 187

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly. My solution was based on a misunderstanding of the problem. I realized my mistake and reflected on the correct solution.

To find the distance when the ship and the plane meet, we need to use the formula:

Distance = Speed x Time

The ship traveled 180 miles, so its speed is 180/x, where x is the time it took the ship to travel that distance.

The plane started with 10 times the speed of the ship, so its initial speed is 10 x 180 = 1800 miles per hour.

The plane will meet the ship when it has traveled x hours, so the distance between them is:

Distance = Speed x Time = 1800 x x

To find the value of x, we can set up the equation:

1800 x x = 180

Solving for x, we get:

x = 10

So, the distance between the ship and the plane when they meet is:

Distance = 1800 x 10 = 18,000 miles

The correct answer is (B) 289.

I apologize for any confusion caused by my previous incorrect answer. Thank you for the opportunity to reflect and improve my understanding of the problem.
