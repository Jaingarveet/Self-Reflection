Explanation:

After reflecting on my previous answer, I realized that I made a mistake in my calculation. The correct ratio of zinc and copper in alloy Z is 59:91, which is option D.

Here's how I arrived at this answer:

Let's use the information given in the problem:

* Alloy X has a ratio of 6:9 (zinc:copper)
* Alloy Y has a ratio of 7:11 (zinc:copper)
* 40 grams of alloy X and 60 grams of alloy Y are melted and mixed to form alloy Z

To find the ratio of zinc and copper in alloy Z, we need to find the ratio of the total amount of zinc and copper in alloy Z to the total amount of zinc and copper in alloy X and alloy Y.

Let's first find the total amount of zinc and copper in alloy X and alloy Y:

Alloy X: 40 grams x 6/9 = 26 grams of zinc and 40 grams x 9/6 = 66 grams of copper
Alloy Y: 60 grams x 7/11 = 43 grams of zinc and 60 grams x 11/7 = 84 grams of copper

Now, let's find the total amount of zinc and copper in alloy Z:

Alloy Z: 40 grams + 60 grams = 100 grams

So, the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z is:

100 grams of alloy Z / (26 grams of zinc in alloy X + 43 grams of zinc in alloy Y) = 100 grams / (26 + 43) = 59:91

Therefore, the correct answer is option D: 59:91.
## Result:
Agent Answer: D
Correct Answer: B
Score: 0
