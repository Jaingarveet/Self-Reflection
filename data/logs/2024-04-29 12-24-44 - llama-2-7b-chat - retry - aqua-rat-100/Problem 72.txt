Question: Julie’s yard is rectangular. One side of the yard is 100 feet wide. The total area of the yard is 3,000 square feet. What is the length of the other side of the yard?
Choices:
  A: 30 feet

  E: 60 feet

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly. My solution was based on a misunderstanding of the problem. I realized my mistake and reflected on the problem, my solution, and the correct answer.

To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the area of a rectangular yard: Area = Length x Width.
We are given that the length of one side of the yard is 100 feet, and the total area of the yard is 3,000 square feet.

So, we can set up the equation:
Length = Area / Width

Substituting the values given in the problem, we get:
Length = 3000 / 100 = 30 feet

Therefore, the length of the other side of Julie’s yard is 30 feet.

Action: Answer("D")
