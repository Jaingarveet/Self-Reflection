Question: A man spends Rs. 3500 per month and saves 12 1/2% of his income. His monthly income is ?
Choices:
  A: Rs. 4400
  B: Rs. 4270
  C: Rs. 4000
  D: Rs. 3937.50
  E: None of these

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand the mistake. My solution was based on a misunderstanding of the problem. I will now use my self-reflection to answer the question correctly.

To find the man's monthly income, we need to calculate 12 1/2% of his monthly expenditure.

Monthly expenditure = Rs. 3500
12 1/2% of monthly expenditure = 0.125 x Rs. 3500 = Rs. 427.50

So, the man's monthly income is:

Monthly income = Rs. 3500 + Rs. 427.50 = Rs. 3937.50

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) Rs. 3937.50.
