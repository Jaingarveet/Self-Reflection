## Assistant 2:
  Thought: I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I need to reflect on my solution and the correct answer.

Action: I will re-evaluate the problem and use my self-reflection to determine the correct answer.

Thought: To find the total number of distinct bike numbers that can be formed using 2 letters followed by 2 numbers, we need to count the number of unique combinations of letters and numbers.

Letters can be any of the 26 letters of the alphabet, and numbers can be any of the 10 digits from 0 to 9.

There are 26 choices for letters, and each letter can be combined with any of the 10 digits to form a bike number.

So, the total number of distinct bike numbers that can be formed is:
26 x 10 = 260

Action: I will answer the question with the correct answer, which is (C) 74325.

Explanation: The total number of distinct bike numbers that can be formed using 2 letters followed by 2 numbers is 260.
