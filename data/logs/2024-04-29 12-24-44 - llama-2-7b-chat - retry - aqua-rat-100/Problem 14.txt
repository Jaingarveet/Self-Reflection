Question: If Raj was one-third as old as Rahim 5 years back and Raj is 17 years old now, How old is Rahim now?
Choices:
  A: 37
  B: 41
  C: 40
  D: 42
  E: 43

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly. My solution was based on a misunderstanding of the problem. I realized my mistake and reflected on the correct solution.

To solve this problem, we need to use the information given in the problem:

Raj was one-third as old as Rahim 5 years back.
Raj is 17 years old now.

So, Rahim's age 5 years ago was 17 / 3 = 5 years ago.

Now, Rahim's age is 17 + 5 = 22 years old.

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 42 years old.
