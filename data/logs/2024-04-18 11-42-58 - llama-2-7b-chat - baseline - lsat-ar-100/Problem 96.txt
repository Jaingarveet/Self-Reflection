Context: On each of exactly seven consecutive days (day 1 though day 7), a pet shop features exactly one of three breeds of kitten—Himalayan, Manx, Siamese—and exactly one of three breeds of puppy—Greyhound, Newfoundland, Rottweiler. The following conditions must apply: Greyhounds are featured on day 1. No breed is featured on any two consecutive days. Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7. Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1. Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.
Question: If Himalayans are not featured on day 2, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Manx are featured on day 3.
  B: Siamese are featured on day 4.
  C: Rottweilers are featured on day 5.
  D: Himalayans are featured on day 6.
  E: Greyhounds are featured on day 7.
## Assistant 2:
  Thought: Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* Greyhounds are featured on day 1.
* No breed is featured on any two consecutive days.
* Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.
* Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.

If Himalayans are not featured on day 2, we can conclude that:

* Manx are not featured on day 3 (as Himalayans are not featured on day 2, and Manx are not featured on any of the remaining days).
* Siamese are not featured on day 4 (as Himalayans are not featured on day 2, and Siamese are not featured on any of the remaining days).
* Rottweilers are not featured on day 5 (as Himalayans are not featured on day 2, and Rottweilers are not featured on any of the remaining days).
* Himalayans are featured on day 6 (as they are not featured on day 2, and they are featured on exactly three days).
* Greyhounds are not featured on day 7 (as they are featured on day 1).

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) Himalayans are featured on day 6.
