Choices:

A: oatmeal: Monday, Wednesday, Thursday peanut butter: Wednesday, Thursday, Friday sugar: Monday, Thursday, Friday

Explanation:

The bakery makes exactly three batches of each kind of cookie each week, from Monday to Friday. The conditions given in the question are:

* At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
* The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.

* Peanut butter: Wednesday, Thursday, Friday (the second batch is made on the same day as the first batch)
* Sugar: Monday, Thursday, Friday (the second batch is made on Thursday)

Therefore, the complete and accurate list of days on which the batches of each kind of cookie are made is:

A: oatmeal: Monday, Wednesday, Thursday peanut butter: Wednesday, Thursday, Friday sugar: Monday, Thursday, Friday
