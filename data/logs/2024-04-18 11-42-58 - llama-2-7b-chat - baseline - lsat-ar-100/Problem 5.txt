Topic: Law
Context: Exactly eight books—F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O—are placed on a bookcase with exactly three shelves—the top shelf, the middle shelf, and the bottom shelf. At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.
Question: Which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: O is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf M is placed on.
  B: K is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf G is placed on.
  C: I is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf F is placed on.
  D: G is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf O is placed on.
  E: F is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf L is placed on.
## Assistant 2:
  Thought: Let's analyze the information given in the question:

* More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
* I is placed on the middle shelf.
* K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
* O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
* F is placed on the same shelf as M.

Now, let's evaluate each of the options:

A: O is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf M is placed on.

Since M is placed on the bottom shelf, O cannot be placed on a higher shelf than M. Therefore, option A is false.

B: K is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf G is placed on.

Since G is placed on the middle shelf, K cannot be placed on a higher shelf than G. Therefore, option B is false.

C: I is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf F is placed on.

Since F is placed on the bottom shelf, I cannot be placed on a higher shelf than F. Therefore, option C is false.

D: G is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf O is placed on.

Since O is placed on the top shelf, G cannot be placed on a higher shelf than O. Therefore, option D is false.

E: F is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf L is placed on.

Since L is placed on the bottom shelf, F cannot be placed on a higher shelf than L. Therefore, option E is false.

Conclusion: None of the options are true.

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
