Topic: Law
Context: Exactly eight books—F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O—are placed on a bookcase with exactly three shelves—the top shelf, the middle shelf, and the bottom shelf. At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.
Question: If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: F and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  B: G and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  C: H and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  D: I and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  E: K and O are placed on the same shelf as each other.
## Assistant 2:
  Thought: Let's analyze the given information to determine the correct answer.

From the problem statement, we know that:

1. More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
2. I is placed on the middle shelf.
3. K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
4. O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
5. F is placed on the same shelf as M.

If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then we can deduce the following:

1. H must be placed on the bottom shelf.
2. L must be placed on the middle shelf.

Now, let's evaluate each of the given choices:

A: F and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Since F is placed on the same shelf as M, and M is not placed on the bottom shelf, we can conclude that F and G are not placed on the same shelf. Therefore, choice A is incorrect.

B: G and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Since H is placed on the bottom shelf, we can conclude that G and H are not placed on the same shelf. Therefore, choice B is incorrect.

C: H and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Since M is placed on the same shelf as F, and F is not placed on the bottom shelf, we can conclude that H and M are not placed on the same shelf. Therefore, choice C is incorrect.

D: I and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Since I is placed on the middle shelf, and G is not placed on the bottom shelf, we can conclude that I and G are not placed on the same shelf. Therefore, choice D is incorrect.

E: K and O are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Since O is placed on a higher shelf than L, and L is not placed on the bottom shelf, we can conclude that K and O are not placed on the same shelf. Therefore, choice E is incorrect.

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) I and G are not placed on the same shelf as each other.
