Context: A government needs to assign new ambassadors to Venezuela, Yemen, and Zambia. The candidates for these ambassadorships are Jaramillo, Kayne, Landon, Novetzke, and Ong. One ambassador will be assigned to each country, and no ambassador will be assigned to more than one country. The assignment of the ambassadors must meet the following constraints: Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships. If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne. If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen. If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
Question: If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Jaramillo is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela.
  B: Landon is assigned as ambassador to Zambia.
  C: Ong is assigned as ambassador to Zambia.
  D: Jaramillo is not assigned to an ambassadorship.
  E: Ong is not assigned to an ambassadorship.
## Assistant 2:
  Thought: Let's analyze the constraints given in the problem:

1. Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
2. If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne.
3. If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
4. If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.

Now, let's consider the possible assignments of ambassadors to the three countries:

1. Venezuela: Ong
2. Yemen: Kayne
3. Zambia: Landon

Now, let's analyze the constraints:

* If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Jaramillo cannot be assigned to an ambassadorship (Constraint 2).
* If Kayne is assigned to Yemen, then Novetzke cannot be assigned to an ambassadorship (Constraint 1).
* If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it cannot be Zambia (Constraint 4).

Now, let's evaluate the options:

A) Jaramillo is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela. This is not possible since Ong is already assigned to Venezuela.
B) Landon is assigned as ambassador to Zambia. This is not possible since Landon is not assigned to an ambassadorship.
C) Ong is assigned as ambassador to Zambia. This is not possible since Ong is already assigned to Venezuela.
D) Jaramillo is not assigned to an ambassadorship. This is not possible since Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
E) Ong is not assigned to an ambassadorship. This is not possible since Ong is already assigned to Venezuela.

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) Jaramillo is not assigned to an ambassadorship.
