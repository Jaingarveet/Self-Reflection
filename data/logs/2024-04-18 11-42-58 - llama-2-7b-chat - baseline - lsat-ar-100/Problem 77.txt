Context: An administrator must assign parking spaces to six new employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young. Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space.

## Assistant 2:
  Thought: To determine the number of employees for whom the assignment of a parking space is limited to one of only two possible spaces, we need to analyze the given rules.

Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa, which means that Togowa can only be assigned parking spaces #5 or #6.
Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, which means that Souza can only be assigned parking spaces #3 or #4.
Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young, which means that Young can only be assigned parking spaces #1, #2, or #4.
Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4, which means that Souza and Togowa are the only two employees who have only two possible parking spaces available to them.
