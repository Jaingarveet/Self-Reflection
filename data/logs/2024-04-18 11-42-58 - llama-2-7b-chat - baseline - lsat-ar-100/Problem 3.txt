Context: An administrator must assign parking spaces to six new employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young. Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
Question: If Robertson is assigned parking space #3, then which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Souza is assigned parking space #4.
  B: Togowa is assigned parking space #2.
  C: Vaughn is assigned parking space #5.
  D: Xu is assigned parking space #6.
  E: Young is assigned parking space #2.
## Assistant 2:
  Thought: Based on the given rules, we need to assign parking spaces to the six new employees in a way that no two employees are assigned the same parking space, and that Robertson is assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.

Action: Let's assign parking spaces to the employees based on the given rules:

1. Robertson - must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young, and must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
2. Young - must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
3. Togowa - must be assigned parking space #2.
4. Souza - must be assigned a parking space that is not #4.
5. Vaughn - must be assigned parking space #5.
6. Xu - must be assigned parking space #6.

Now, if Robertson is assigned parking space #3, then we can deduce the following:

E: Young is not assigned parking space #2, as Robertson is already assigned parking space #3.

Therefore, the correct answer is (E) Young is not assigned parking space #2.
