## Assistant 2:
  Thought: Let's analyze the given information to determine which option could be true.

J must be shown in the evening, so the first two houses (J and K) will be shown in the morning.
K cannot be shown in the morning, so K will be shown in the afternoon.
L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown. Since K is shown in the afternoon, L must be shown in the evening.

Now, let's consider the options:

A: K is shown at some time after J is shown. Since J is shown in the evening, K cannot be shown at some time after J is shown.

B: L is shown at some time after J is shown. Since J is shown in the evening and L must be shown in the evening, option B is true.

C: P is shown at some time after J is shown. Since J is shown in the evening, P cannot be shown at some time after J is shown.

D: Both N and O are shown at some time after M is shown. Since M is shown in the afternoon, neither N nor O can be shown at some time after M is shown.

E: Both N and P are shown at some time after K is shown. Since K is shown in the afternoon, neither N nor P can be shown at some time after K is shown.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) L is shown at some time after J is shown.
