Context: A shopping center has exactly seven spaces—space 1 through space 7—arranged in a straight row. Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
Question: Which one of the following, if substituted for the constraint that the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, would have the same effect in determining the locations of the businesses?
Choices:
  A: A restaurant must be in either space 3, space 4, or space 5.
  B: A restaurant must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  C: Either the toy store or the veterinarian must be somewhere between the two restaurants.
  D: No more than two businesses can separate the pharmacy and the restaurant nearest it.
  E: The optometrist cannot be next to the shoe store.
## Assistant 2:
  Thought: To determine the locations of the businesses in the shopping center, we need to find a constraint that will have the same effect as the constraint that the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.

Let's analyze each of the options:

A: A restaurant must be in either space 3, space 4, or space 5. This constraint does not have the same effect as the original constraint, as it does not ensure that the two restaurants are separated by at least two other businesses.

B: A restaurant must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. This constraint is similar to the original constraint, as it ensures that one of the restaurants is located near one of the other businesses. However, it does not guarantee that the two restaurants are separated by at least two other businesses.

C: Either the toy store or the veterinarian must be somewhere between the two restaurants. This constraint is also similar to the original constraint, as it ensures that one of the restaurants is located between the toy store and the veterinarian. However, it does not guarantee that the two restaurants are separated by at least two other businesses.

D: No more than two businesses can separate the pharmacy and the restaurant nearest it. This constraint is the same as the original constraint, as it ensures that the two restaurants are separated by at least two other businesses.

E: The optometrist cannot be next to the shoe store. This constraint does not have any effect on the locations of the other businesses in the shopping center, so it is not a valid option.

Therefore, the correct answer is (D): No more than two businesses can separate the pharmacy and the restaurant nearest it.
