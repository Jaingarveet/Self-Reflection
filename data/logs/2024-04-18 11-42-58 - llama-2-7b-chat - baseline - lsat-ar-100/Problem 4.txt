Context: A chemistry class has six lab sessions scheduled over three days—Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday—one session heing held each morning and one each afternoon. Each session will be led by a different lab assistant—Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, or Rebecca. The assignment of lab assistants to sessions is constrained as follows: Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day. Nessa must lead an afternoon session. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
Question: If Lan does not lead a Wednesday session, then which one of the following lab assistants must lead a Thursday session?
Choices:
  A: Rebecca
  B: Olivia
  C: Nessa
  D: Kevin
  E: Julio
## Assistant 2:
  Thought: Let's analyze the constraints given in the problem:

1. Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
2. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
3. Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
4. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.

Now, let's use the elimination method to find the answer.

Eliminate option E: Julio's session cannot meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's, as Olivia's session is on Friday, and Julio's session cannot meet on Friday.

Now, let's analyze the remaining options:

Option A: Rebecca can lead a Thursday session, as she is not assigned to lead a session on Wednesday.
Option B: Olivia can lead a Thursday session, as she is assigned to lead an afternoon session on Friday.
Option C: Nessa can lead a Thursday session, as she is assigned to lead an afternoon session.
Option D: Kevin cannot lead a Thursday session, as he is assigned to lead a session on Wednesday.

Therefore, the answer is Option B: Olivia.
## Result:
