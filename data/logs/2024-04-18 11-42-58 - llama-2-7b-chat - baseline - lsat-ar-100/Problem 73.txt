Context: For the school paper, five students—Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, Megregian, and O'Neill—each review one or more of exactly three plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation, but do not review any other plays. The following conditions must apply: Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.

## Assistant 2:
  Thought: Based on the given conditions, we need to determine which of the students review Undulation.

2. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play that Jiang reviews.

From these conditions, we can deduce the following:

* Megregian reviews at least one of Undulation, Sunset, or Tamerlane.
* Lopez does not review Undulation.
* O'Neill reviews Tamerlane.
* Jiang reviews Undulation.

Now, let's evaluate each of the choices:

A: Megregian does not review Undulation. - Incorrect. Megregian does review at least one of Undulation, Sunset, or Tamerlane.
