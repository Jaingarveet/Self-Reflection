Context: A software company employs exactly seven sales representatives—Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall—to work in its three sales zones—Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3. Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Question: Which one of the following could be a complete and accurate list of the sales representatives working in Zone 3?
Choices:
  A: Kim, Mahr
  B: Kim, Tiao
  C: Parra, Quinn
  D: Stuckey, Tiao, Udall
  E: Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Udall
## Assistant 2:
  Thought: To determine which sales representatives work in Zone 3, we need to analyze the conditions given in the problem.

Action: Let's use a step-by-step approach to answer the question:

1. Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
	* So, Parra and Tiao do not work in Zone 3.
2. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
	* So, Tiao and Udall work in Zone 3.
3. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
	* So, at least one of Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, and Udall works in Zone 3.

Now, let's evaluate each of the given choices:

A: Kim, Mahr - None of them work in Zone 3.
B: Kim, Tiao - Tiao does not work in Zone 1, so he must work in Zone 3.
C: Parra, Quinn - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone, so they must work in Zone 3.
D: Stuckey, Tiao, Udall - Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone, so they must work in Zone 3.
E: Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Udall - All of them work in Zone 3.

Action: The correct answer is (E) Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Udall.
## Result:
