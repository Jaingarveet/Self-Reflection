Context: A panel of five scientists will be formed. The panelists will be selected from among three botanists—F, G, and H—three chemists—K, L, and M—and three zoologists—P, Q, and R. Selection is governed by the following conditions: The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types. If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. F and K cannot both be selected. K and M cannot both be selected. If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
Question: Which one of the following is an acceptable selection of scientists for the panel?
Choices:
  A: F, G, K, P, Q
  B: G, H, K, L, M
  C: G, H, K, L, R
  D: H, K, M, P, R
  E: H, L, M, P, Q
## Assistant 2:
  Thought: To select an acceptable panel of scientists, we need to follow the conditions given in the problem.

Action: Let's analyze each choice:

A: F, G, K, P, Q - This choice violates the condition that at most one zoologist can be selected if more than one botanist is selected. Therefore, this choice is not acceptable.

B: G, H, K, L, M - This choice violates the condition that K and M cannot both be selected. Therefore, this choice is not acceptable.

C: G, H, K, L, R - This choice violates the condition that if M is selected, both P and R must be selected. Therefore, this choice is not acceptable.

D: H, K, M, P, R - This choice violates the condition that the panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types. Therefore, this choice is not acceptable.

E: H, L, M, P, Q - This choice violates the condition that if more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. Therefore, this choice is not acceptable.

Therefore, the only acceptable selection of scientists for the panel is:

Action: Answer("E")
