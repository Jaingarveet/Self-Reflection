Context: A loading dock consists of exactly six bays numbered 1 through 6 consecutively from one side of the dock to the other. Each bay is holding a different one of exactly six types of cargoâ€”fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles. The following apply: The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock. The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles. The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel. The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.

Choices:
  A: two
  B: three
  C: four

## Assistant 2:
  Great, let's analyze the information given in the question:

* The loading dock consists of 6 bays numbered consecutively from one side of the dock to the other.
* Each bay is holding a different one of exactly 6 types of cargo (fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles).
* The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
* The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
* The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
* The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.

Now, let's use this information to answer the question:

If bay 4 is holding produce, then we can determine the type of cargo that bay is holding completely as follows:

* Bay 4 is holding produce, so the bay next to it (bay 5) is holding textiles.
* Since the bay holding textiles has a higher number than the bay holding livestock, bay 5 is holding livestock.
* Since the bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding grain, bay 5 is holding grain.
* Therefore, the type of cargo that bay 4 is holding (produce) is completely determined as grain, livestock, and textiles.

So, the answer is (D) four.
