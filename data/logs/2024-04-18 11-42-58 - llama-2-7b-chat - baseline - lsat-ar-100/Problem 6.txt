Context: For the school paper, five students—Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, Megregian, and O'Neill—each review one or more of exactly three plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation, but do not review any other plays. The following conditions must apply: Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
Question: Which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Jiang reviews more of the plays than Lopez does.
  B: Megregian reviews more of the plays than Jiang does.
  C: Megregian reviews more of the plays than O'Neill does.
  D: O'Neill reviews more of the plays than Jiang does.
  E: O'Neill reviews more of the plays than Kramer does.
## Assistant 2:
  Thought: Based on the given conditions, we need to determine which student reviews which play.

Action: Let's analyze the information given in the question:

1. Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
2. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
3. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
4. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.

From these conditions, we can deduce the following:

* Megregian reviews more plays than Lopez and Kramer.
* Jiang reviews Tamerlane, and neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews it.
* O'Neill reviews Tamerlane with Kramer.
* Only two students review the same play, either Jiang and O'Neill or Megregian and Kramer.

Now, let's evaluate the options:

A: Jiang reviews more of the plays than Lopez does. - Incorrect, as Lopez reviews fewer plays than Megregian.
B: Megregian reviews more of the plays than Jiang does. - Incorrect, as Megregian reviews fewer plays than Jiang.
C: Megregian reviews more of the plays than O'Neill does. - Incorrect, as O'Neill reviews Tamerlane with Kramer.
D: O'Neill reviews more of the plays than Jiang does. - Incorrect, as Jiang reviews Tamerlane and O'Neill does not.
E: O'Neill reviews more of the plays than Kramer does. - Incorrect, as Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B): Megregian reviews more of the plays than Jiang does.
