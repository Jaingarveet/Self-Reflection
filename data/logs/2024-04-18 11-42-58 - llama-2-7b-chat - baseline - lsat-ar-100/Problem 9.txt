Topic: Law
Context: An administrator must assign parking spaces to six new employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young. Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
Question: If Young is assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Togowa is assigned parking space #1.
  B: Young is assigned parking space #2.
  C: Robertson is assigned parking space #3.
  D: Souza is assigned parking space #3.
  E: Vaughn is assigned parking space #4.
## Assistant 2:
  Thought: Based on the given rules, we need to assign parking spaces to the six new employees in a way that no two employees are assigned the same parking space and that Young is assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.

Action: Let's analyze the possible assignments of parking spaces to the six employees:

1. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young, so let's assign him parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
2. Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, so let's assign him parking space #5 or #6.
3. Togowa must be assigned a lower-numbered parking space than Young, so let's assign him parking space #1 or #2.
4. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, so let's assign him parking space #3 or #4.
5. Souza must be assigned a lower-numbered parking space than Xu, so let's assign him parking space #2 or #3.
6. Vaughn is not mentioned in the problem statement, so let's assume he is assigned parking space #5 or #6.

Now, let's check which one of the given options could be true:

Option A: Togowa is assigned parking space #1.
This is not possible since Togowa must be assigned a lower-numbered parking space than Young, and parking space #1 is the lowest-numbered parking space.

Option B: Young is assigned parking space #2.
This is possible since Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, and parking space #2 is a higher-numbered parking space.

Option C: Robertson is assigned parking space #3.
This is not possible since Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young, and parking space #3 is a lower-numbered parking space.

Option D: Souza is assigned parking space #3.
This is possible since Souza must be assigned a lower-numbered parking space than Xu, and parking space #3 is a lower-numbered parking space.

Option E: Vaughn is assigned parking space #4.
This is not possible since Vaughn is not mentioned in the problem statement, and parking space #4 is not assigned to any of the six employees.

Therefore, the correct answer is Option B: Young is assigned parking space #2.
