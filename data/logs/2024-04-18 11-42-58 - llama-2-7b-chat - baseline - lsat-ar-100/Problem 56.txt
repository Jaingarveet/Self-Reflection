Topic: Law
Context: A software company employs exactly seven sales representatives—Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall—to work in its three sales zones—Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3. Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Question: If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Kim works in Zone 2.
  B: Mahr works in Zone 2.
  C: Parra works in Zone 3.
  D: Tiao works in Zone 1.
  E: Udall works in Zone 3.
## Assistant 2:
  Thought: Based on the given conditions, we can determine the possible combinations of sales representatives working in each zone.

Zone 1: Parra or Tiao (but not both) works here. Since Parra and Tiao are the only two options for Zone 1, either of them could work in Zone 1.

Zone 2: Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works here. Since Tiao and Udall are the only two options for Zone 2, either of them could work in Zone 2.

Zone 3: There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

Now, let's analyze the given options:

Option A: Kim works in Zone 2. This is not possible since Kim is not listed as working in Zone 2.

Option B: Mahr works in Zone 2. This is not possible since Mahr is not listed as working in Zone 2.

Option C: Parra works in Zone 3. This is not possible since Parra works in Zone 1.

Option D: Tiao works in Zone 1. This is not possible since Tiao works in Zone 2.

Option E: Udall works in Zone 3. This is not possible since Udall works in Zone 2.

Action: Answer("E")
## Result:
Agent Answer: E
Correct Answer: E
Score: 1
