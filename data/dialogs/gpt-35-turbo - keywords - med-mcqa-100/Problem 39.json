Primordial prevention refers to the prevention of the emergence and establishment of risk factors in a population. It aims to prevent the development of risk factors that lead to the development of diseases.

Therefore, I need to choose the option that best describes the concept of primordial prevention.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
