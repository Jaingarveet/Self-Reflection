Agoraphobia is not the fear of heights, but rather the fear of situations where escape may be difficult or help may not be available in the event of a panic attack. This can include situations such as being in a crowded area, using public transportation, or being in an open space. Based on this, the correct answer to the question \"Agoraphobia is?\" is B: Fear of crowds."
