However, upon reflection, I realized that suxamethonium is actually an ultra-short-acting muscle relaxant, not a short-acting one. Suxamethonium works by depolarizing the neuromuscular junction, causing muscle relaxation. It has a very rapid onset of action, but its duration of action is very short. \nAction: Answer(\"B\") \nThe correct answer is B: Mivacurium. Mivacurium is a short-acting non-depolarizing muscle relaxant. It works by blocking the action of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction, causing muscle relaxation. Its onset of action is rapid, and its duration of action is short, making it a useful muscle relaxant for short procedures."
