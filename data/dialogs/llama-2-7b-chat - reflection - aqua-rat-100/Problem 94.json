Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

How many letters need to be distinct?\nChoices:\n  A: 74453\n  B: 64543\n  C: 74325\n  D: 65000\n  E: 97656\n\n Thought: To find the total number of distinct bike numbers that can be formed using 2 letters followed by 2 numbers, we need to count the number of possible combinations.\n\nLet's consider the letters of the alphabet as A, B, C, D, E, and F. Each letter can be used once or twice, so there are 5 letters in total.\n\nNow, let's count the number of possible combinations of 2 letters followed by 2 numbers:\n\n* AA: 2 combinations (A and B, A and E)\n* AB: 3 combinations (A and B, A and D, A and F)\n* AC: 3 combinations (A and C, A and D, A and E)\n* AD: 2 combinations (A and D, A and F)\n* AE: 2 combinations (A and E, A and F)\n* AF: 1 combination (A and F)\n* BA: 2 combinations (B and A, B and E)\n* BB: 2 combinations (B and B, B and F)\n* BC: 3 combinations (B and C, B and D, B and E)\n* BD: 2 combinations (B and D, B and F)\n* BE: 3 combinations (B and E, B and D, B and F)\n*BF: 2 combinations (B and F, B and E)\n\nTherefore, the total number of distinct bike numbers that can be formed using 2 letters followed by 2 numbers is:\n\n7 x 6 = 42\n\nSo, the answer is (D) 65000.\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: D\nError: You did not provide your answer in the correct format.\nYour answer must be stated as 'Action: Answer(\"[ANSWER_CHOICE]\")';\nwhere [ANSWER_CHOICE] is the letter of the correct answer choice."
