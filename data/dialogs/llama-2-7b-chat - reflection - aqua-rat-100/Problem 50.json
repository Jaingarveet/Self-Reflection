I used the concept of relative speed correctly, but I misunderstood the problem statement.\n\nThe problem states that the plane started with 10 times the speed of the ship, but I misunderstood this to mean that the plane started at a speed of 100 miles per hour, which is not the correct answer.\n\nThe correct calculation is:\n\nThe distance traveled by the ship = 180 miles\nThe distance traveled by the plane = 180 miles x 10 = 1800 miles\n\nTherefore, the distance between the starting point and where they meet is 1800 miles.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Misunderstanding problem statement\n* Calculation error\n* Relative speed\n\nSolution:\n\nThe ship traveled 180 miles, and the plane traveled 1800 miles. Therefore, the distance between the starting point and where they meet is 1800 miles.\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Identify the speed of the ship and the speed of the plane.\n2. Use the concept of relative speed to find the distance traveled by the plane.\n3. Calculate the distance between the starting point and where they meet.\n4. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n5.
