Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, so Arjun now has $30.\n\nNow, let's use the information that Sajal has $60 left, and Arjun has $30 to find the initial amounts of money each had:\n\nSajal had $60 - $30 = $30 initially.\nArjun had $30 initially.\n\nSo, the correct answer is (C) $34, $62.\n\nGreat job!\n\nHere are some tips to help you with similar problems in the future:\n\n1. Read the problem carefully and identify the key information.\n2. Break down the problem into smaller steps and work through each step systematically.\n3. Use the information provided in the problem to find the initial amounts of money each person had.\n4. Check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n5.
