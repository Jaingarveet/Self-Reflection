        "content": " Explanation:\nYou are correct that the sum of the ages of all the members of the club is 250, and that the ages are in A.P. with a common difference of 3 months. However, your method of solving the problem is not correct.\n\nYou started by letting the age of the nth member be x, and then calculated the age of the (n+1)th member as x + 3. This is correct. However, you did not continue the calculation correctly. Instead of combining like terms, you wrote:\n\nx + (x + 3) + (x + 6) + ... + (x + 250) = 250\n\nThis is not the correct formula for an A.P. The formula for an A.P. is:\n\na1 + a2 + ... + an = n(n + 1)(n + 2)/6\n\nYou should have substituted the values:\n\na1 = x, a2 = x + 3, a3 = x + 6, ..., an = x + 250\n\nAnd then solved for n.\n\nSo, the correct solution is:\n\nn = 18\n\nAnswer: B\n\nHowever, the correct answer is C. My apologies for the mistake. Thank you for pointing it out."
