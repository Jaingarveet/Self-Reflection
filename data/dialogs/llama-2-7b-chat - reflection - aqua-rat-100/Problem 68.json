If one of the integers is 350, what is the other?\nChoices:\n  A: 242\n  B: 308\n  C: 352\n  D: 412\n  E: 456\n\n  Great, let's solve this problem step by step!\n\nThe greatest common factor (GCF) of two positive integers is 11. So, we can divide both integers by their GCF to simplify the problem.\n\nLet's say the smaller integer is x. Then, the larger integer is 3x.\n\nThe least common multiple (LCM) of 3x and x is 7700.\n\nSo, we can write:\n\n3x × x = 7700\n\nNow, we can simplify this equation by multiplying both sides by 3:\n\nx × x = 23100\n\nNow, we can find the value of x by dividing both sides by 2:\n\nx = 11550\n\nNow, we can find the value of the other integer by using the fact that the GCF of 3x and x is 11:\n\n3x = 31550\n\nSo, the other integer is 31550.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: A"
