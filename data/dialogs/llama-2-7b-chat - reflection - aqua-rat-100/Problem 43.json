What should the monthly sales be so that her monthly salary reaches $1500?\nChoices:\n  A: $50000\n  B: $40000\n  C: $30000\n  D: $20000\n  E: None of these\n\n Thought: To find the monthly sales that will result in a monthly salary of $1500, we need to use the given formula:\n\nMonthly salary = fixed salary + (monthly sales x percentage)\n\nWe know the fixed salary is $500, and we want the monthly salary to be $1500. So, we can set up the equation:\n\n$500 + (monthly sales x 5%) = $1500\n\nNow, we need to solve for the monthly sales. We can do this by isolating the monthly sales term on one side of the equation:\n\n$500 + (monthly sales x 5%) = $1500\n\nSubtracting $500 from both sides gives us:\n\n$500 + (monthly sales x 5%) = $1000\n\nNow, we can divide both sides by 5% to find the monthly sales:\n\n$500 + (monthly sales x 5%) = $1000\n\n$500 + (monthly sales x 5%) / 5% = $1000\n\nMonthly sales = $20,000\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: D"
