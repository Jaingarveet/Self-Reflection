        "content": " Explanation:\nYou are correct! Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. First, we are told that 24% of all students at Daifu University are members of both the chess club and the swim team. This means that the number of students who are members of both clubs is 24% of the total number of students.\n2. Next, we are given that 20% of members of the swim team are not members of the chess club. This means that the number of students who are members of the swim team and are also members of the chess club is 20% of the total number of students.\n3. To find the percentage of students who are members of the swim team, we need to subtract the number of students who are members of both clubs from the total number of students. So, the percentage of students who are members of the swim team is:\n\n4% = 24% - 20%\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B) 30%. Well done!"
