Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

If a hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week and pays $210 per week for newspapers, how many newspapers does it buy on Monday?\nChoices:\n  A: 15\n  B: 30\n  C: 45\n  D: 60\n  E: 75\n\n  Great, let's solve this problem step by step!\n\nWe know that the newspaper costs $4 on Sunday and $1 the rest of the days of the week.\n\nIf a hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week, then it will order:\n\nSunday papers = 2 x (total papers per week - Sunday papers)\n= 2 x (7 - 4)\n= 2 x 3\n= 6 papers on Sunday\n\nNow, we know that the hotel pays $210 per week for newspapers. So, the total cost of newspapers for the week is:\n\nTotal cost = Number of papers x Cost per paper\n= 6 x $4\n= $24\n\nNow, we can find out how many papers the hotel buys on Monday:\n\nMonday papers = Total cost / Cost per paper\n= $24 / $1\n= 24 papers on Monday\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) 30.\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: A\nError: You did not provide your answer in the correct format.\nYour answer must be stated as 'Action: Answer(\"[ANSWER_CHOICE]\")';\nwhere [ANSWER_CHOICE] is the letter of the correct answer choice."
