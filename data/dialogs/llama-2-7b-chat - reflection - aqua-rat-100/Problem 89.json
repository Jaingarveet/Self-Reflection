        "content": " Explanation:\nYou are correct that to calculate the maximum distance we can travel with $8.50 on a cab, we need to find the distance we can travel with $8.50 before reaching the next quarter-mile boundary.\n\nYou calculated the distance correctly as follows:\n\nDistance = $8.50 / $3.50 = 2.5 quarter-miles\n\nHowever, the correct answer is (B) 12.75 miles.\n\nExplanation:\nThe cab charges $3.50 for the first quarter-mile and $0.10 for each additional quarter-mile. Since you can travel 2.5 quarter-miles with $8.50, you will have $8.50 - $3.50 = $5.00 left after paying for the first quarter-mile.\n\nThe next quarter-mile will cost $0.10, so you can travel an additional 0.25 quarter-miles (25% of 1 quarter-mile) with the remaining $5.00, which is equal to 0.25 x 1 quarter-mile = 0.25 miles.\n\nTherefore, the maximum distance you can travel with $8.50 on a cab is:\n\nDistance = 2.5 quarter-miles + 0.25 miles = 12.75 miles\n\nSo, the correct answer is (B) 12.75 miles.\n\nWell done!"
