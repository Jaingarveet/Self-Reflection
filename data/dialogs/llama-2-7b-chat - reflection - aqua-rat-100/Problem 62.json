Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "Topic: Math\nQuestion: On a normal day Bill usually averages about 15 mph when riding his bicycle. On a windy day, his speed is reduced by 4 mph. How far can Bill travel on a windy day in 21 minutes? Round to the nearest hundredth.\nChoices:\n  A: 2 miles\n  B: 2.25 miles\n  C: 3.25 miles\n  D: 3.85 miles\n  E: 2.85 miles\n\n Thought:\nBill's average speed on a normal day is 15 mph, and on a windy day, his speed is reduced by 4 mph. To find the distance traveled in 21 minutes, we need to calculate the total time taken to travel a certain distance at a reduced speed.\n\nAction:\nLet's first calculate the time taken to travel a distance of 1 mile at a reduced speed of 11 mph (15 mph - 4 mph).\n\nTime = Distance / Speed = 1 mile / 11 mph = 0.09 miles/minute\n\nNow, we know that Bill travels for 21 minutes, so the total distance traveled is:\n\nDistance = Time x Speed = 0.09 miles/minute x 21 minutes = 1.89 miles\n\nAction:\nNow, let's choose the correct answer from the options provided.\n\nAnswer: B: 2.25 miles\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B, 2.25 miles, as it is the closest estimate to the actual distance traveled by Bill in 21 minutes, which is 1.89 miles.\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: D\nError: You did not provide your answer in the correct format.\nYour answer must be stated as 'Action: Answer(\"[ANSWER_CHOICE]\")';\nwhere [ANSWER_CHOICE] is the letter of the correct answer choice."
