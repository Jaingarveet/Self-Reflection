Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

What is the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee that the yearly profit (revenue from sales minus production costs) will be at least $626,400 ?\nChoices:\n  A: 226\n  B: 230\n  C: 240\n  D: 260\n  E: 280\n\n  Great, let's solve this problem step by step!\n\nThe production cost per component is $110, and the company produces 420 units per month. So, the total production cost per month is:\n\n420 units x $110 per unit = $46,800 per month\n\nThe company sells all the components by the end of each month, so the total revenue per month is:\n\n420 units x selling price per unit = $46,800 per month\n\nTo guarantee a yearly profit of at least $626,400, we need to find the selling price per component that will result in a yearly revenue of at least:\n\n$626,400 = 12 x $51,300 (since there are 12 months in a year)\n\nNow, we can set up an equation based on the information given:\n\nRevenue per month = Production cost per month\n\nSo, we can solve for the selling price per component:\n\nSelling price per component = Revenue per month / Production cost per month\n\nSubstituting the values given in the question:\n\nSelling price per component = $46,800 / $110 per unit = 426\n\nSo, the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee a yearly profit of at least $626,400 is:\n\nAnswer: B - 230\n\nTherefore, the company should sell the components for at least $230 per unit to ensure a yearly profit of at least $626,400.\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: B\nError: You did not provide your answer in the correct format.\nYour answer must be stated as 'Action: Answer(\"[ANSWER_CHOICE]\")';\nwhere [ANSWER_CHOICE] is the letter of the correct answer choice."
