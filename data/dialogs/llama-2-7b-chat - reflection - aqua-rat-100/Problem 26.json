Since the wire is being rebent to form a square, the length and breadth of the square will be equal. Therefore, the length of each side of the square is half of the length of the original rectangle, which is 27 cm / 2 = 13.5 cm.\n\nSo, the correct answer is (C) 13.5 cm.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Misunderstanding the problem\n* Incorrect calculation\n* Lack of attention to detail\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Identify the problem and understand the given information.\n2. Determine the perimeter of the original rectangle.\n3. Calculate the length of each side of the square.\n4. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n5. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\n\nAdvice:\n\n* Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n* Break down complex problems into smaller, manageable steps.\n* Double-check your calculations and ensure accuracy.\n* Use visual aids, such as diagrams or drawings, to help with calculations and problem-solving."
