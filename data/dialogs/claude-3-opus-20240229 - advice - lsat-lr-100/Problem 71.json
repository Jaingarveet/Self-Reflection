The displayed works are either on loan from private collectors or part of the museum's permanent collection. \n3. Prints of all works in the permanent collection are sold in the museum store.\n4. The store also sells prints of some works not in the permanent collection, like Hopper's Nighthawks.\nNow let's consider each answer choice:\nA: This can't be concluded, as the store sells prints of some works (like Nighthawks) that may not be on display.\nB: This must be true. The museum only displays 20th century works, and the store only sells prints of displayed works or other 20th century works like Nighthawks. \nC: This can't be concluded. The store sells prints of all permanent collection works, but not necessarily all works on loan.\nD: This can't be concluded. Nighthawks is a 20th century work, but we don't know if it's currently on loan to the museum.\nE: This can't be concluded. Just because a print is sold doesn't mean the original isn't also displayed.\nTherefore, B is the only choice that must be true based solely on the information provided.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
