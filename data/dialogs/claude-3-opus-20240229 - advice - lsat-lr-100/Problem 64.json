Hence, shedding tears removes significant quantities of these hormones from the body. Therefore, crying must have the effect of reducing emotional stress.\nQuestion: The reasoning in the argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that the argument\nChoices:\n  A: overlooks the possibility that if crying has a tendency to reduce emotional stress, this tendency might arise because of something other than the shedding of tears\n  B: confuses a condition that is required for the production of a given phenomenon with a condition that in itself would be sufficient to cause the production of that phenomenon\n  C: fails to adequately address the possibility that, even if one phenomenon causally contributes to a second phenomenon, the second phenomenon may causally influence the first as well\n  D: fails to adequately distinguish between two distinct factors that are jointly responsible for causing a given phenomenon\n  E: takes for granted that because certain substances are present whenever a condition occurs, those substances are a cause of that condition\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n - Be cautious of arguments that assume causation based merely on correlation or co-occurrence.\n - Always consider alternative explanations for correlations, such as the possibility of a common cause.\n - Don't take for granted that because something is present when a condition occurs, it must be a cause of that condition.\n - Scrutinize the logical connection between an argument's premises and its conclusion.\n - Eliminate answer choices that identify flaws not present in the argument or that don't directly undermine the reasoning.\n"

But it fails to consider that the stress reduction could be due to something else about the act of crying besides the shedding of tears.\nLooking at the answer choices:\nA: This correctly identifies the flaw. The argument overlooks that crying may reduce stress for reasons other than shedding tears.\nB: The argument doesn't confuse a necessary and sufficient condition. It's not claiming tears are sufficient for stress reduction, only that they lead to it.\nC: The argument isn't concerned with stress also causing crying. This doesn't undermine the reasoning.\nD: The argument doesn't discuss multiple factors. It only focuses on one proposed cause.\nE: This matches the flaw in the argument. It assumes that because tears contain stress hormones, the shedding of tears must be the cause of stress reduction. But it doesn't adequately justify this causal link.\nBoth A and E identify the key flaw, but E most directly matches the argument's reasoning. The argument takes for granted that the presence of stress hormones in tears means shedding tears causes stress reduction.\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
