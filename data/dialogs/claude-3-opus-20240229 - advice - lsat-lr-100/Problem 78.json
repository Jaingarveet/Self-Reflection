Most Acme employees cannot afford housing within a 30-minute commute of Ocean View. So once the company has moved, most Acme employees will have a commute of more than 30 minutes.\nQuestion: The argument requires assuming which one of the following?\nChoices:\n  A: All Acme employees can afford housing within a 30-minute commute of Milltown.\n  B: The chairperson of Acme has good financial reasons for wanting to move the company to Ocean View.\n  C: None of Acme's employees except the chairperson are in favor of moving the company to Ocean View.\n  D: Currently, most Acme employees have a commute of less than 30 minutes.\n  E: Acme's move to Ocean View will not be accompanied by a significant pay raise for Acme employees.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n - Focus on the logical structure of the argument.\n - Don't bring in outside knowledge or make unsupported assumptions.\n - The correct answer choice will be a critical piece of information required for the conclusion to follow from the premises.\n - Eliminate answer choices that are irrelevant, already stated, or go beyond the scope of the argument.\n - Consider how the argument would be impacted if each answer choice were false.\n"

        "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\nThe argument's conclusion is that once Acme moves, most employees will have a commute over 30 minutes. \nThe premises supporting this are:\n1) Most employees can't afford housing within a 30-minute commute of the new location.\n2) Acme is moving from Milltown to Ocean View.\nA is not assumed by the argument. The current commute times in Milltown are not discussed.\nB is not assumed. The chairperson's financial reasons for the move are not relevant to the conclusion about commute times.\nC is not assumed. The argument does not make any claims about employee opinions on the move.\nD seems necessary for the argument to work. If most employees already had 30+ minute commutes, then the conclusion wouldn't represent a change from the current situation. So the argument requires assuming commutes are currently under 30 minutes for most employees.\nE is tempting but not necessarily assumed. Even with a big raise, housing near Ocean View could still be unaffordable. The argument only requires that housing ends up unaffordable, not that salaries remain the same.\nTherefore, D is the best answer. The argument relies on assuming that currently, most employees have under 30 minute commutes, in order to conclude the move will cause most to have 30+ minute commutes.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
