Thus, no one—including those making marital vows—should take \"love\" in this context to be referring to feelings.\nQuestion: The ethicist's conclusion follows logically if which one of the following is assumed?\nChoices:\n  A: None of our feelings are within our control.\n  B: People should not make promises to do something that is not within their control.\n  C: \"Love\" can legitimately be taken to refer to something other than feelings.\n  D: Promises should not be interpreted in such a way that they make no sense.\n  E: Promises that cannot be kept do not make any sense.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n - Always read arguments carefully and break them down into their component parts.\n - Identify both the explicit premises and the conclusion of the argument.\n - Look for unstated assumptions that are necessary for the conclusion to follow from the premises.\n - Be careful not to select an answer just because it is stated in the argument; it must be the key assumption.\n - Eliminate answer choices that are irrelevant or insufficient to make the conclusion follow logically.\n"

        "content": "Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:\nThe ethicist's argument can be summarized as:\n1. Marital vows often promise to love \"until death do us part\" \n2. If \"love\" refers to a feeling, this promise makes no sense, because feelings are not within one's control\n3. A promise to do something not within one's control makes no sense\nTherefore,\n4. No one should take \"love\" in marital vows to be referring to feelings\nThe question is asking what unstated assumption is necessary for the conclusion (4) to follow logically from the premises.\nLooking at the answer choices:\nA) This is too broad. The argument only requires that the feeling of love is outside our control, not all feelings.\nB) This is promising, as it directly supports the idea that promising to love (if love is a feeling) makes no sense. But it's not the only assumption needed.\nC) This looks correct. If \"love\" can refer to something controllable (like a commitment or action), then the ethicist's conclusion wouldn't necessarily follow. So the ethicist must be assuming \"love\" can only refer to the uncontrollable feeling for their argument to work.\nD) This is also assumed, but even if we accept it, the conclusion could still be false if \"love\" can refer to something other than feelings. So C is a more essential assumption.\nE) This is similar to B and D. It supports the argument but is not sufficient on its own to make the conclusion follow.\nTherefore, C is the most essential unstated assumption. The ethicist's conclusion only follows if we assume \"love\" cannot refer to anything except uncontrollable feelings.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
