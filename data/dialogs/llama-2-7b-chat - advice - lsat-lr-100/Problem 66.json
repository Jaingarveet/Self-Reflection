The verbiage is intended to make the instructions more precise, but greater precision is of little use if most jurors have difficulty understanding the instructions. Since it is more important for jurors to have a basic but adequate understanding of their role than it is for the details of that role to be precisely specified, jury instructions should be formulated in simple, easily comprehensible language.\nQuestion: Each of the following, if true, strengthens the lawyer's argumoot EXCEPT:\nChoices:\n  A: Most jurors are less likely to understand instructions given in convoluted, legalistic language than instructions given in simple, easily comprehensible language.\n  B: Most jurors do not have an adequate understanding of their role after being given jury instructions in convoluted, legalistic language.\n  C: Jury instructions formulated in simple, easily comprehensible language can adequately descrthe the role of the jurors.\n  D: The details of the role of the jurors cannot be specified with complete precision in simple, easily comprehensible language.\n  E: Jurors do not need to know the precise details of their role in order to have an adequate understanding of that role.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n"

Here is my self-reflection:\n\n* I initially chose answer (A) because I thought it was the most obvious choice, but upon further consideration, I realize that it is not the correct answer.\n* Answer (B) is the correct choice because it is the only option that accurately describes the situation. Most jurors do not have an adequate understanding of their role after being given jury instructions in convoluted, legalistic language.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B): Most jurors do not have an adequate understanding of their role after being given jury instructions in convoluted, legalistic language.\n\nAdvice: When answering multiple-choice questions, it is essential to carefully read and understand the question, and to select the answer that best fits the information provided. It is also helpful to reflect on your previous answers and adjust your selection based on new information or insights."
