The correct answer is (B) The intensity of the average tornado is greater now than it was in 1953.\n\nSelf-reflection: I mistakenly chose (A) The factors affecting the creation of tornadoes were not well known to meteorologists before 1953. However, upon further analysis, I understand that the question is actually asking about the change in the intensity of tornadoes over time, rather than the lack of knowledge about tornado creation. The passage mentions that the number of tornadoes recorded annually has more than tripled since 1953, which suggests that the intensity of tornadoes has increased. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) The intensity of the average tornado is greater now than it was in 1953.\n\nAnswer: Action(\"B\")"
