The argument is not about the likelihood of cocker spaniels straying from their owners, but rather the likelihood of a stray cocker spaniel belonging to someone in the Flynn Heights neighborhood. Therefore, the most useful piece of information to know in order to evaluate the argument is:\n\nC: whether the city's animal control officers find more stray dogs in and around Flynn Heights than in any other part of the city.\n\nThis information would help determine the likelihood that a stray cocker spaniel found in Flynn Heights actually belongs to someone in that neighborhood. If animal control officers find more stray dogs in Flynn Heights than in any other part of the city, it is more likely that the stray cocker spaniel belongs to someone in that neighborhood.\n\nI hope this answer is correct, and I will make sure to carefully evaluate the argument using the correct information."
