Since then the rate has been once every hour. The less frequently cabin air is replenished in a plane in flight, the higher the level of carbon dioxide in that plane and the easier it is for airborne illnesses to be spread.\nQuestion: Which one of the following is most strongly supported by the information above?\nChoices:\n  A: In 1985 there was a loosening of regulations concerning cabin air in commercial airline flights.\n  B: People who fly today are more likely to contract airborne illnesses than were people who flew prior to 1985.\n  C: Low levels of carbon dioxide in cabin air make it impossible for airborne illnesses to spread.\n  D: In 1980 the rate at which the cabin air was replenished in commercial airliners was sufficient to protect passengers from the effects of carbon dioxide buildup.\n  E: In 1980 the level of carbon dioxide in the cabin air on a two-hour commercial airline flight was lower than it is today on a similar flight.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n"

Here is my self-reflection:\n\n* I misunderstood the information provided and thought that the rate of cabin air replenishment had changed in 1985, when in fact, it has remained the same since then.\n* I overlooked the fact that the level of carbon dioxide in the cabin air increases with the frequency of replenishment, which means that the lower the frequency, the higher the level of carbon dioxide.\n* I did not consider the fact that the level of carbon dioxide in the cabin air on a two-hour flight today is likely higher than it was in 1980, due to the increased number of passengers and the longer flight duration.\n\nBased on my self-reflection, the correct answer is (B) People who fly today are more likely to contract airborne illnesses than were people who flew prior to 1985. The information provided suggests that the lower the frequency of cabin air replenishment, the higher the level of carbon dioxide, which makes it easier for airborne illnesses to spread. Therefore, people who fly today, with lower frequencies of cabin air replenishment, are more likely to be exposed to higher levels of carbon dioxide and are more likely to contract airborne illnesses.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
