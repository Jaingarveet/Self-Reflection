This assumption is not supported by evidence, as many technological advancements are made with the intention of benefiting society as a whole.\n\nTo address this flaw, I considered alternative perspectives on the motivations of those responsible for technological advances. I realized that while personal gain is often a factor, it is not the only motivation. Many individuals and organizations are driven by a desire to improve people's lives, solve complex problems, or address social issues.\n\nTherefore, the argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it oversimplifies the complex motivations of those responsible for technological advances. The correct answer is (C) fails to consider the possibility that actions motivated by a desire for personal gain often do not result in personal gain.\n\nAny information that I am not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED]."
