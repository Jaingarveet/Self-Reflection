We can use the given conditions to narrow down the options.\n\nFrom condition (1), we know that G must be in the front of team 1. From condition (2), we know that K must be in the middle. From condition (3), we know that L must be on team 1. From condition (4), we know that P cannot be in the same team as N. From condition (5), we know that P cannot be in the same team as Q. From condition (6), we know that if H is in team 2, Q is in the middle of team 1.\n\nNow, let's consider each option:\n\nA: K and L - This option violates condition (4) since K and N are in the same team.\nB: K and P - This option violates condition (5) since P and Q are in the same team.\nC: L and N - This option satisfies all conditions. L is on team 1, and N is not in the same team as P.\nD: L and Q - This option violates condition (6) since Q is in the middle of team 1, and L is not in team 2.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
