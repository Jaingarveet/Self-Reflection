G or H must be in the front if they are playing.\n2. K must be in the middle.\n3. L must be on team 1.\n4. P and K cannot be on the same team as N.\n5. P and Q cannot be on the same team.\n6. If H is in team 2, Q is in the middle of team 1.\n\nFrom the given choices, only choice C meets all the conditions:\n\n* Before: L (condition 3)\n* Middle: Q (condition 6)\n* After: G (condition 1)\n\nIn this arrangement, K is in the middle of team 2, which satisfies condition 2. P is not on the same team as N or Q, which satisfies conditions 4 and 5. H is in team 2, which satisfies condition 6. Therefore, choice C is the only acceptable arrangement for team 1 if H is in team 2."
