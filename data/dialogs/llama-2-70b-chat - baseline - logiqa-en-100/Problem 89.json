(1) Dr.Zhang is only responsible for treating male patients.(2) Dr.Li can only be responsible for the treatment of 1 patient.(3) If a doctor is responsible for treating a child patient, then he must be responsible for the treatment of an adult patient of the same sex as the child.\nQuestion: Based on the above conditions, which of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Doctor F is responsible for treatment.\n  C: J is treated by Dr.Zhang.\n  B: C is treated by Dr.Liu.\n  D: H is treated by Dr.Wang.\n"

Therefore, this choice is false.\n\nC: J is treated by Dr. Zhang.\n\nSince Dr. Zhang must treat J, this choice is true.\n\nB: C is treated by Dr. Liu.\n\nSince Dr. Liu must treat either C or I, and Dr. Zhang must treat J, this choice is true.\n\nD: H is treated by Dr. Wang.\n\nSince Dr. Wang must treat an adult patient of the same sex as J, and Dr. Li must treat either G or H, this choice is false.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C: J is treated by Dr. Zhang.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
