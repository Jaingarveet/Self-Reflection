A maximum of 2 people are selected.\n\nFrom 1, we know that either B or Ding is selected.\n\nFrom 2, we know that if E is selected, then A and B are also selected. So, if E is not selected, then A and B cannot be selected.\n\nFrom 3, we know that only two people can be selected.\n\nNow, let's consider the options:\n\nA. A: If A is selected, then B cannot be selected as only two people can be selected. This violates condition 2, so A cannot be selected.\n\nB. B: If B is selected, then A cannot be selected, as only two people can be selected. This violates condition 2, so B cannot be selected.\n\nC. C: If C is selected, then neither A nor B can be selected, as only two people can be selected. This violates condition 1, so C cannot be selected.\n\nD. Ding: If Ding is selected, then A and B cannot be selected, as only two people can be selected. This violates condition 2, so Ding cannot be selected.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
