        "content": "  Answer(\"C\")\n\nExplanation:\nThe fact that the clay layer contains high concentrations of elements such as iridium and platinum, which are peculiar to meteorites and only exist in trace amounts on the surface, supports the research finding that the meteorites found in the area are about 200 million years old and were probably traces of flying objects when a huge meteorite hit the present province of Quebec, Canada.\n\nTherefore, option C is the best answer.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the formation of the rock after the accumulation layer of the deep seabed in the ancient times exposed above the ground does not necessarily support the finding that the meteorites are 200 million years old and were formed as a result of a meteorite impact.\n\nOption B is also incorrect because the extinction of ammonite and other species in the late Paleozoic Triassic period does not have a direct relationship with the age and origin of the meteorites found in the area.\n\nOption D is incorrect because, while it is true that there have been many incidents of meteorite impacting the earth in ancient times, this information does not directly support the specific research findings about the meteorites found in the area."
