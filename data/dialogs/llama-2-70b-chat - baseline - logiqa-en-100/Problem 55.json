P\n\nExplanation:\n\nConditions (1) and (6) require that G must be in front and H must be in team 2. Condition (2) requires K to be in the middle. Condition (3) requires L to be on team 1, which means L cannot be on team 2. Condition (4) requires P and N to be on different teams, so P must be on team 2. Condition (5) requires Q to be on team 1, which means Q cannot be on team 2 with P. Therefore, the only possible arrangement that satisfies all the conditions is:\n\nBefore? G Middle? Q After? P\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
