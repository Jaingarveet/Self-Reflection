The premises \"A microorganism in Weiming Lake usually breeds above freezing\" and \"It is winter now and the lake water has frozen\" logically entail the conclusion \"if there is indeed the kind of microorganism we studied in Weiming Lake, they will not reproduce now.\"\n\nTherefore, the best answer is:\nAction: Answer(\"A\")\n\nExplanation:\nThe conclusion of the argument cannot be untrue if the premises are true.
