Most people think that advertisers do whatever they can to attract customers.But advertisers are not always like this.Recently, in order to expand sales, a family magazine called \"Bay\" was renamed \"Inferno\", which mainly published violent and pornographic content.As a result, some perennial advertisers from the original \"Bay\" magazine refused to renew the contract and turned to other publications.This shows that these advertisers not only consider economic benefits, but also take into account their ethical responsibilities.\nQuestion: If the following items are true, they can weaken the above argument, except\nChoices:\n  A: The violent and pornographic content published in Purgatory magazine is more moderate in similar magazines.\n  B: Magazines that publish violent and pornographic content usually sell well, but have low credibility.\n  C: The above-mentioned advertisers who refused to renew their contracts mainly promoted household goods.\n  D: The advertising cost of the purgatory magazine after the name change is several times higher than before the name change.\n"

        "content": "  Answer: \"D\"\n\nThe argument claims that advertisers consider ethical responsibilities, not just economic benefits. However, choice D states that the advertising cost of Purgatory magazine after the name change is several times higher than before. \n\nThis suggests that at least some advertisers are willing to pay more to advertise in a magazine with violent and pornographic content, even if they previously refused to renew their contracts due to ethical concerns. \n\nThis information weakens the argument that advertisers prioritize ethical responsibilities over economic benefits, as it appears that some advertisers are willing to compromise their ethical principles for higher exposure."
