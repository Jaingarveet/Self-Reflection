After reflecting on my previous mistake, I realized that the most common type of seizure in newborns is indeed subtle seizures, also known as infantile seizures. These seizures are often difficult to diagnose as they are characterized by brief, subtle changes in the baby's behavior or movement, such as a pause in breathing, a brief tremor, or a change in muscle tone. Therefore, the correct answer is option D, subtle seizures."
