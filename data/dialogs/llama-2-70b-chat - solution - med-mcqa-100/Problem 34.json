Identify the type of hypersensitivity reaction that spring catarrh is.\nAllergic rhinitis is a type of type I hypersensitivity reaction.\n\n2. Look up the characteristics of type II hypersensitivity reactions.\nType II hypersensitivity reactions are characterized by the production of antibodies (IgG and IgM) against a specific antigen. They also involve the activation of complement and the destruction of cells that display the antigen on their surface.\n\n3. Match the characteristics of spring catarrh to the characteristics of type II hypersensitivity reactions.\nSpring catarrh does not involve the production of antibodies or the activation of complement. It is a type of type I hypersensitivity reaction, not type II.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C."
