Therefore, the correct answer is D: Blastomycosis.\n\nReflection:\nMy previous answer was incorrect, and I realize now that I should have recognized that Gilchrist's disease is a synonym for blastomycosis. I was overthinking the question and considered other fungal infections that are less commonly associated with skin lesions. I should have focused more on the characteristic symptoms of blastomycosis, which include skin lesions, respiratory symptoms, and other systemic symptoms. This mistake has taught me to pay closer attention to the given information and to prioritize the most relevant details when answering a question."
