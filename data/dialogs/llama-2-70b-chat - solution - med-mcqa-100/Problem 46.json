I mistakenly chose membranous GN, which is characterized by thickening of the glomerular basement membrane and the presence of immune complexes, instead of membranoproliferative GN (MPGN), which is characterized by the presence of crescent-shaped deposits in the glomeruli.\n\nIn order to avoid making the same mistake again, I took the time to carefully review the features of each type of glomerulonephritis before answering the question. I realized that MPGN is the correct answer because it is characterized by the presence of crescent-shaped deposits in the glomeruli, which is the key feature described in the question.\n\nI learned that it is important to carefully review the information provided in the question and to consider all the possible options before making a decision. I also learned that it is important to have a systematic approach to problem-solving, and to take the time to review the relevant information before answering a question. This will help me to avoid making the same mistake in the future."
