        "content": "  Action: Answer(\"B\")\n\nThe correct answer is Pilocarpine. Pilocarpine works by increasing the outflow of aqueous humor through the trabecular meshwork, which is the primary mechanism by which it lowers intraocular pressure. The other options, Timolol, Brimonidine, and Brinzolamide, work by reducing the production of aqueous humor, not by increasing its outflow.\n\nI previously answered this question incorrectly because I did not carefully read the question and consider the mechanism of action of each medication. I should have known that Pilocarpine works by increasing the outflow of aqueous humor through the trabecular meshwork, not by reducing its production."
