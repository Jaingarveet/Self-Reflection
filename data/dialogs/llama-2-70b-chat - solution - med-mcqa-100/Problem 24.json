Propylthiouracil is not safe to use during pregnancy due to the risk of congenital malformations. I121 is not a commonly used antithyroid drug, and its safety during pregnancy has not been well-established. Carbimazole has a higher risk of adverse effects compared to methimazole and is not the preferred choice for pregnant women. Therefore, the correct answer is C: Methimazole."
