Only Canadian films are shown at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival.\n2. Most of the films that won prizes at that festival also won prizes at international film festivals.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that all films shown at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival are Canadian.\nFrom statement 2, we know that most of the films that won prizes at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival also won prizes at international film festivals.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the choices:\n\nA: This year, most of the Canadian films that were shown at international film festivals won prizes at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival.\nThis choice is incorrect because the statement only mentions that most of the films that won prizes at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival also won prizes at international film festivals. It doesn't necessarily mean that most of the Canadian films shown at international film festivals won prizes at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival.\n\nB: Most of the Canadian Films produced this year were shown at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival.\nThis choice is incorrect because the statement only mentions that only Canadian films are shown at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival, not that most of the Canadian films produced this year were shown at the festival.\n\nC: Some of the films that won prizes at international film festivals this year were Canadian films.\nThis choice is correct. Since most of the films that won prizes at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival also won prizes at international film festivals, and all films shown at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival are Canadian, it follows that some of the films that won prizes at international film festivals this year were Canadian films.\n\nD: This year, not every film that won a prize at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival was also shown at an international film festival.\nThis choice is incorrect because the statement only mentions that most of the films that won prizes at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival also won prizes at international film festivals. It doesn't necessarily mean that not every film that won a prize at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival was also shown at an international film festival.\n\nE: This year, at least one Film that won a prize at an international Film festival was not shown at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival.\nThis choice is incorrect because the statement only mentions that most of the films that won prizes at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival also won prizes at international film festivals. It doesn't necessarily mean that at least one film that won a prize at an international film festival was not shown at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: Some of the films that won prizes at international film festivals this year were Canadian films.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
