However, it is clear that one must mine the full implications of interrelated ideas to make intellectual progress, and for this, thinkers need intellectual discipline. Therefore, this argument for freedom of thought fails.\nQuestion: The conclusion drawn by the professor follows logically if which one of the following is assumed?\nChoices:\n  A: Thinkers who limit their line of thought to a particular orthodoxy are hindered in their intellectual progress.\n  B: Thinkers can mine the full implications of interrelated ideas only in the context of a society that values intellectual progress.\n  C: In societies that protect freedom of thought, thinkers invariably lack intellectual discipline.\n  D: Freedom of thought engenders creativity, which aids the discovery of truth.\n  E: Without intellectual discipline, thinkers can have no freedom of thought.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n1.

The conclusion drawn by the professor does not necessarily follow logically from any of the given choices.\nThe professor argues that freedom of thought is not a precondition for intellectual progress because thinkers need intellectual discipline to mine the full implications of interrelated ideas. However, this does not imply that thinkers who have freedom of thought lack intellectual discipline or that societies that protect freedom of thought do not value intellectual progress.\nTherefore, the correct answer is E: Without intellectual discipline, thinkers can have no freedom of thought. This choice states the assumption that thinkers need intellectual discipline to have freedom of thought, which supports the professor's conclusion.\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
