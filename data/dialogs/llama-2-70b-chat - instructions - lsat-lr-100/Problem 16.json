Read the question carefully and understand the problem.\nThe question asks which statement must also be true if the given statements are true.\n2. Identify the key information provided in the question.\nThe key information includes the current population of Florida panthers (70-100), the minimum population required for self-sustainability (250), and the fact that the current habitat cannot support any more panthers.\n3. Analyze the given statements and identify the logical connections between them.\nStatement 1: The current population of Florida panthers is 70-100.\nStatement 2: The population must reach 250 to be self-sustaining.\nStatement 3: The current habitat cannot support any more panthers.\nThe logical connection between the statements is that the current population is not self-sustaining because it is less than the required population of 250, and the current habitat cannot support any more panthers.\n4. Apply the principles of logic to determine the correct answer choice.\nThe correct answer choice must logically follow from the given statements.\nThe only answer choice that logically follows from the given statements is:\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")\n\nThe explanation for this answer is that if the population must reach 250 to be self-sustaining, and the current habitat cannot support any more panthers, then the population will not be self-sustaining unless Florida panthers acquire a larger habitat.\n\n5. Check your answer to ensure it is correctly formatted.\nThe answer should be in the format \"Action: Answer(\"[choice]\")\".\nThe answer is correctly formatted as \"Action: Answer(\"C\")\".\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nAction: Answer(\"C\")\n\nThe correct answer is:\nC: Unless Florida panthers acquire a larger habitat, their population will not be self-sustaining."
