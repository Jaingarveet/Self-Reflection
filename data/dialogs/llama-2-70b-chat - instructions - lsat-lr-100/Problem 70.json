The correct answer is choice B: it treats a change that is required for the virtual elimination of society's most vexing social ills as a change that will guarantee the virtual elimination of those ills.\n\nThe argument assumes that by making certain fundamental changes in government, we would virtually eliminate our most vexing social ills. However, this conclusion relies on the assumption that government can be trusted to act in the interest of the public, which may not always be the case. The argument jumps from requiring a change to guaranteeing the virtual elimination of social ills, which is an overly optimistic assumption.\n\nTherefore, choice B accurately expresses a flaw in the argument's reasoning. The argument oversimplifies the complexity of social ills and assumes that a single change in government will be sufficient to eliminate them entirely, which is an unrealistic expectation.\n\nIn conclusion, the correct answer is choice B, as it highlights the flawed assumption that a single change in government will guarantee the virtual elimination of society's most vexing social ills."
