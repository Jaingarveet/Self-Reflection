He has solved a smaller percentage of the cases assigned to him in the last 3 years—only 1 out of 25—than any other detective on the police force.\nQuestion: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument above?\nChoices:\n  A: Because the police chief regards Carl as the most capable detective, she assigns him only the most difficult cases, ones that others have failed to solve.\n  B: Before he became a detective, Carl was a neighborhood police officer and was highly respected by the residents of the neighborhood he patrolled.\n  C: Detectives on the police force on which Carl serves are provided with extensive resources, including the use of a large computer database, to help them solve crimes.\n  D: Carl was previously a detective in a police department in another city, and in the 4 years he spent there, he solved only 1 out of 30 crimes.\n  E: Many of the officers in the police department in which Carl serves were hired or promoted within the last 5 years.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n\n1.

        "content": "  Action: Answer(\"D\")\n\nExplanation:\nThe argument presented in the question suggests that Carl is an incompetent detective because he has solved a smaller percentage of cases than any other detective on the police force. However, choice D reveals that Carl's poor performance is not unique to his current position. He also solved only 1 out of 30 crimes in the 4 years he spent as a detective in another city. This information weakens the argument that Carl's poor performance is due to his incompetence as a detective. Instead, it suggests that Carl may have a consistent track record of poor performance, regardless of the resources available to him or the difficulty of the cases he is assigned. Therefore, choice D most seriously weakens the argument above.\n\nReflection:\nIn my previous response, I incorrectly answered this question. I chose answer A, which suggests that the police chief's regard for Carl as the most capable detective and her assignment of him only the most difficult cases weakens the argument that Carl is an incompetent detective. However, this answer choice does not address the fact that Carl has a consistent track record of poor performance, both in his current position and in his previous role as a detective in another city. Choice D, on the other hand, directly addresses this issue and provides a more convincing explanation for Carl's poor performance. Therefore, I have revised my answer to choice D."
