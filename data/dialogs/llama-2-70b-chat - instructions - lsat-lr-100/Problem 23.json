The teacher argues that while this may be a benefit, it is not a sufficient reason to eliminate funding for the programs because research has shown that adults with feelings of inferiority become more successful than those free of such anxieties. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) It is cited as an insufficient reason for eliminating funding for children's athletic programs."
