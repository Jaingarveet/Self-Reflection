Identify the argument's conclusion:\nThe conclusion of the argument is that native speakers' perception of their language as a sequence of separate words is an illusion.\n\n2. Identify the premise that supports the conclusion:\nThe premise that supports the conclusion is that travelers who do not know a local language hear an unintelligible, uninterrupted stream of sound, not sentences with distinct words.\n\n3. Identify the assumption that is made in the argument:\nThe assumption made in the argument is that native speakers' perceptions of their own language are not more accurate than are the perceptions of persons who do not know that language.\n\n4. Evaluate the assumption's validity:\nThe assumption is valid because it is reasonable to assume that native speakers' perceptions of their language may be influenced by their familiarity with it, and that non-native speakers may have a different perception of the language.\n\n5. Determine if the assumption is necessary for the argument's conclusion:\nYes, the assumption is necessary for the argument's conclusion. Without the assumption, it would be impossible to draw the conclusion that native speakers' perception of their language as a sequence of separate words is an illusion.\n\n6. If the assumption is not necessary, consider alternative assumptions that could support the conclusion:\nAlternative assumptions that could support the conclusion could be:\n\n* Non-native speakers have a more accurate perception of the language than native speakers.\n* The way native speakers perceive their language is influenced by their cultural background.\n* The way native speakers perceive their language is influenced by their language learning experience.\n\n7. Evaluate the strength of the argument with the alternative assumptions:\nThe argument would be stronger with the alternative assumption that non-native speakers have a more accurate perception of the language than native speakers. This assumption would provide a clearer explanation for why travelers who do not know a local language hear an unintelligible, uninterrupted stream of sound.\n\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
