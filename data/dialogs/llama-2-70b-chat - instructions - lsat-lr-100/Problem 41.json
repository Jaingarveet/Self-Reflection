Let's evaluate the argument again, taking into account the points I mentioned in my reflection.\n\nThe argument states that Professor Riley's testimony should not be the sole basis for concluding that the university president's speech was inflammatory, as Riley has a long-standing feud with the president. The argument then concludes that unless there are independent reasons to deem the president's speech inflammatory, it is not true that her speech was inappropriate.\n\nThe flaw in the argument lies in its failure to adequately address the possibility that inflammatory speeches may be appropriate for some audiences. The argument assumes that inflammatory speeches are inherently inappropriate, and that Riley's claim that the president's speech was inflammatory is sufficient to deem it inappropriate. However, this assumption does not take into account the context and purpose of the speech.\n\nThe argument also fails to consider the possibility that Riley's animosity toward the university president is well-founded. If Riley has legitimate reasons for criticizing the president, then her testimony should not be dismissed solely based on her personal feud with the president.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is (B) fails to adequately address the possibility that inflammatory speeches may be appropriate for some audiences and (E) fails to adequately address the possibility that Riley's animosity toward the university president is well founded.\n\nAction: Answer(\"BE\")"
