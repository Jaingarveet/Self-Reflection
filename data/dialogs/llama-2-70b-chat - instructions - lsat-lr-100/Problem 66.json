The verbiage is intended to make the instructions more precise, but greater precision is of little use if most jurors have difficulty understanding the instructions. Since it is more important for jurors to have a basic but adequate understanding of their role than it is for the details of that role to be precisely specified, jury instructions should be formulated in simple, easily comprehensible language.\nQuestion: Each of the following, if true, strengthens the lawyer's argumoot EXCEPT:\nChoices:\n  A: Most jurors are less likely to understand instructions given in convoluted, legalistic language than instructions given in simple, easily comprehensible language.\n  B: Most jurors do not have an adequate understanding of their role after being given jury instructions in convoluted, legalistic language.\n  C: Jury instructions formulated in simple, easily comprehensible language can adequately descrthe the role of the jurors.\n  D: The details of the role of the jurors cannot be specified with complete precision in simple, easily comprehensible language.\n  E: Jurors do not need to know the precise details of their role in order to have an adequate understanding of that role.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n1.

        "content": "  Sure, I'll be happy to help!\n\nAction: Answer(\"E\")\n\nHere's my reasoning:\n\nThe lawyer's argument is that jury instructions should be formulated in simple, easily comprehensible language because it is more important for jurors to have a basic but adequate understanding of their role than it is for the details of that role to be precisely specified.\n\nThe correct answer, E, states that jurors do not need to know the precise details of their role in order to have an adequate understanding of that role. This answer choice strengthens the lawyer's argument by providing a reason why simple, easily comprehensible language is sufficient for jury instructions. It suggests that the details of the role of the jurors are not as important as having a basic understanding of that role, which supports the lawyer's claim that jury instructions should be formulated in simple language.\n\nThe other answer choices do not strengthen the lawyer's argument. Answer choice A states that most jurors are less likely to understand instructions given in convoluted, legalistic language than instructions given in simple, easily comprehensible language. While this may be true, it does not directly support the lawyer's argument that jury instructions should be formulated in simple language.\n\nAnswer choice B states that most jurors do not have an adequate understanding of their role after being given jury instructions in convoluted, legalistic language. This answer choice actually weakens the lawyer's argument because it suggests that the current method of giving jury instructions in convoluted language is not effective, which would support the need for a change to simple language.\n\nAnswer choice C states that jury instructions formulated in simple, easily comprehensible language can adequately describe the role of the jurors. While this may be true, it does not directly address the lawyer's argument that the details of the role of the jurors cannot be specified with complete precision in simple language.\n\nAnswer choice D states that the details of the role of the jurors cannot be specified with complete precision in simple, easily comprehensible language. This answer choice actually strengthens the lawyer's argument by suggesting that simple language may not be sufficient to fully describe the role of the jurors, which supports the need for simple language that provides a basic but adequate understanding of that role.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is E, which states that jurors do not need to know the precise details of their role in order to have an adequate understanding of that role. This answer choice strengthens the lawyer's argument by providing a reason why simple, easily comprehensible language is sufficient for jury instructions."
