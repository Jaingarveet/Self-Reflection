Here's my answer:\n\nTopic: Law\nContext: Rossi: It is undemocratic for people to live under a government in which their interests are not represented.

Match the implied view with the correct answer choice.\n\nMain issue in the debate:\nThe main issue in the debate is whether children should have the right to vote.\n\nAnalysis of each speaker's statement:\nRossi: Rossi argues that children should have the right to vote because their interests are not always represented by their parents. This implies that Rossi believes children have rights that must be respected by any political authority that rules over them.\nSmith: Smith argues that children cannot be given the responsibility of voting because their conceptions of what can or should be done are too simple, and their time horizons are radically different from those of adults. This implies that Smith believes children are not yet capable of fully participating in the democratic process.\n\nInferred views:\nRossi: B - Children have rights that must be respected by any political authority that rules over them.\nSmith: D - If there are any limitations on full democracy that result from denying the vote to children, such limitations must be accepted.\n\nMatching the implied views with the correct answer choice:\nB - Children have rights that must be respected by any political authority that rules over them.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B - Children have rights that must be respected by any political authority that rules over them. This answer choice aligns with Rossi's view that children have rights that must be respected, and it also acknowledges that children's interests are not always represented by their parents.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions."
