By understanding why the memory lapse occurred, the pianist can better prepare for future performances.\n  B: A salesperson should understand that the commission earned is not the only reward of making a sale. Salespeople should also take satisfaction from the fact that successful sales reflect well on their personalities.\n  C: Compassion is valuable not only for the wonderful feelings it brings, but also for the opportunities it affords to enrich the lives of other people.\n  D: While some of the value of competition comes from the pleasure of winning, the primary reward of competition is competition itself.\n  E: Even people who dread public speaking should accept invitations to speak before large groups. People will admire their courage and they will experience the fulfillment of having attempted something that is difficult for them.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n1.

However, upon reflection, I realize that this option does not conform to the principle stated in the question. The principle suggests that challenge can be a source of self-knowledge, and that we can gain insights into our weaknesses by paying attention to how we react to challenge.\n\nOption A, on the other hand, closely conforms to this principle. It suggests that a concert pianist should not have an entirely negative view of a memory lapse during a difficult performance. By understanding why the memory lapse occurred, the pianist can better prepare for future performances. This option emphasizes the importance of learning from challenges and using them as opportunities for growth and improvement. Therefore, I have changed my answer to option A."
