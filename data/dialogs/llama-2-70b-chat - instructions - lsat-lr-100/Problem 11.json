Evaluate the strength of the evidence provided to support the main cause-and-effect relationship.\n4. If necessary, revise the argument to address any weaknesses in the evidence or reasoning.\n\nAnswer: C\n\nExplanation:\nThe argument's reasoning is questionable because it overlooks the fact that many technological innovations other than the personal automobile have had some effect on the way people live. The argument assumes that the personal automobile is the sole cause of the observed effect, which is the widespread use of large parking lots and scattered residential areas. However, other technological innovations, such as public transportation, bicycles, or even delivery services, could have also contributed to the observed effect. Therefore, the argument's reasoning is flawed, and the conclusion that the personal automobile is the sole cause of the observed effect is not well-supported.\n\nAlternative causes that may have contributed to the observed effect include:\n\n* Public transportation: The availability and accessibility of public transportation could have influenced the way people live and work, potentially reducing the need for personal automobiles.\n* Bicycles: The use of bicycles as a mode of transportation could have also influenced the way people live and work, potentially reducing the need for personal automobiles.\n* Delivery services: The availability of delivery services, such as food delivery or package delivery, could have reduced the need for personal automobiles, as people may not need to travel as much for daily errands.\n\nThe evidence provided to support the main cause-and-effect relationship is weak, as it does not consider alternative causes that may have contributed to the observed effect. To revise the argument, the author could consider alternative causes and evaluate their impact on the observed effect. Additionally, the author could provide more evidence to support the main cause-and-effect relationship, such as statistical data or expert opinions.\n\nIn conclusion, the argument's reasoning is questionable because it overlooks alternative causes that may have contributed to the observed effect. To strengthen the argument, the author should consider alternative causes and provide more evidence to support the main cause-and-effect relationship."
