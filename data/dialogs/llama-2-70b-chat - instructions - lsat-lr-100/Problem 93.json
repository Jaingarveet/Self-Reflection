Choose the answer that logically follows from the information provided.\n\nMy previous answer was incorrect because I failed to consider the context of the passage. I mistakenly chose option A, assuming that everyone suspects self-righteous people of being unethical. However, the passage only suggests that Ellsworth is self-righteous and easily offended, not that everyone suspects him of being unethical.\n\nUpon further reflection, I realize that the correct answer is option E: Everyone expects self-righteous people to be easily offended. The passage states that Ellsworth is self-righteous and easily offended, which suggests that people who know him expect him to be easily offended. Therefore, option E logically follows from the information provided in the passage.\n\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
