Evaluate the argument based on its logical coherence and consistency with established principles or rules.\n4. Consider alternative perspectives or counterarguments that may be relevant to the issue at hand.\n5. Choose the answer that most accurately describes the argument being made.\n\nAnswer: A\n\nRossi's argument appeals to the general principle of democracy, which holds that all people should have an equal say in the government that represents their interests. Rossi argues that children are not adequately represented by their parents and should, therefore, have the right to vote. This argument relies on the idea that children have unique interests that may not align with those of their parents and that they should have a say in the government that affects their lives.\n\nRossi's argument does not deny Smith's good faith (choice B), nor does it rely solely on evaluating the predictable consequences of a proposal (choice C). While Rossi does mention the impact of governmental deficits on future generations, this is not the primary focus of his argument. Instead, his argument is based on the principle of democracy and the idea that all people should have an equal say in their government.\n\nNor does Rossi's argument substitute description for giving a rationale for a policy (choice D). Instead, he provides a clear rationale for why children should have the right to vote, based on their unique interests and the undemocratic nature of being governed without representation.\n\nFinally, Rossi's argument does not employ a term on two different occasions in different senses (choice E).\n\nTherefore, the best answer is A: Rossi's argument makes an appeal to a general principle."
