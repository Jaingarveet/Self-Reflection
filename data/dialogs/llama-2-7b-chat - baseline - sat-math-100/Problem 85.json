The equation states that $C$ is equal to $\\frac{5}{9}$ times the difference between $F$ and $32$.\n\nNow, let's consider the statements:\n\nI. A temperature increase of 1 degree Fahrenheit is equivalent to a temperature increase of $\\frac{5}{9}$ degree Celsius.\n\nFrom the equation, we can see that for every 1 degree increase in $F$, $C$ increases by $\\frac{5}{9}$ degrees. Therefore, statement I must be true.\n\nII. A temperature increase of 1 degree Celsius is equivalent to a temperature increase of 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nWe can calculate the value of $\\frac{5}{9}$ by dividing the number of degrees Celsius by the number of degrees Fahrenheit:\n\n$\\frac{5}{9} = \\frac{1}{1.8}$\n\nTherefore, statement II must be false.\n\nIII. A temperature increase of $\\frac{5}{9}$ degree Fahrenheit is equivalent to a temperature increase of 1 degree Celsius.\n\nFrom the equation, we can see that for every $\\frac{5}{9}$ degree increase in $F$, $C$ increases by 1 degree. Therefore, statement III must be true.\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
