Identify the constant term of the polynomial: $f(0) = 3$.\n2. Identify the degree of the polynomial: The degree of the polynomial is 1, since the highest power of $x$ is 1.\n3. Determine the factors of the polynomial: A polynomial of degree 1 can be factored as $x - r$, where $r$ is a constant.\n\nUsing these steps, we can determine that the factor of $f(x)$ must be $x - 2$.\n\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
