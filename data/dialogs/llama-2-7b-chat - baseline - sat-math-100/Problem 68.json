        "content": "  Great, let's solve this problem step by step!\n\nThe equation given is:\n\n$$0.10x + 0.20y = 0.18(x + y)$$\n\nWe are given that Clayton uses 100 milliliters of the $20 \\%$ by mass saline solution. To find out how much of the $10 \\%$ by mass saline solution he must use, we can substitute the value of $y$ in terms of $x$.\n\nFrom the equation, we have:\n\n$$0.10x + 0.20y = 0.18(x + y)$$\n\nRearranging the equation to isolate $x$, we get:\n\n$$0.10x = 0.18(x + y) - 0.20y$$\n\nNow, we can substitute the value of $y$ in terms of $x$, which we are given:\n\n$$0.10x = 0.18x + 0.20y - 0.20y$$\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n$$0.10x = 0.18x$$\n\nNow, we can solve for $x$ by dividing both sides of the equation by $0.10$:\n\n$$x = 0.18x / 0.10$$\n\nNow, we are given that Clayton uses 100 milliliters of the $20 \\%$ by mass saline solution. We can substitute this value of $y$ in terms of $x$:\n\n$$y = 100 / 0.20 = 500$$\n\nNow, we can use the value of $x$ we just found to solve for the amount of the $10 \\%$ by mass saline solution that Clayton must use:\n\n$$x = 0.18x / 0.10 = 180$$\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C): 500 milliliters of the $10 \\%$ by mass saline solution."
