This does not provide a representative sample of the entire population of employees.\n\nOption B is also not appropriate because it involves selecting 10 employees from each store at random, which may not be representative of the entire population of employees.\n\nOption C is also not appropriate because it involves surveying a limited number of employees (25 highest-paid and 25 lowest-paid) instead of a random sample of all employees.\n\nOption D is also not appropriate because it involves using a website for employees to express their opinions, which may not be a reliable or representative method of sampling.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate sampling method is option B, which involves selecting 10 employees from each store at random and then surveying each employee selected. This method will provide a more representative sample of the entire population of employees.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
