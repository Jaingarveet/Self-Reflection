        "content": " Thought:\nThe area of a rectangle can be calculated using the formula: Area = Length x Width.\nIf the length of the rectangle is increased by 10%, then the new length is:\nLength = Old length x 1.10\n\nIf the width of the rectangle is decreased by $p$%, then the new width is:\nWidth = Old width x (1 - $p$/100)\n\nThe area of the rectangle before the alterations is:\nArea = Length x Width = Old length x Old width\n\nThe area of the rectangle after the alterations is:\nArea = Length x Width = New length x New width\n\nThe question states that the area of the rectangle after the alterations is decreased by 12%. This means that the new area is:\nNew area = Old area x (1 - 0.12) = Old area x 0.88\n\nWe are given that the old area is 100 square units. Therefore, the new area is:\nNew area = 100 x 0.88 = 88 square units\n\nNow, we need to find the value of $p$ that will give us an area of 88 square units after the alterations.\n\nArea = Length x Width = New length x New width\n\nNew length = Old length x 1.10 = 1.10 x Old length\nNew width = Old width x (1 - $p$/100) = Old width x (1 - $p$/100)\n\nSubstituting the values, we get:\n\nNew area = (1.10 x Old length) x (Old width x (1 - $p$/100))\n= 1.10 x Old area x (1 - $p$/100)\n\nWe are given that the area after the alterations is 88 square units, so we can set up the equation:\n1.10 x Old area x (1 - $p$/100) = 88\n\nSolving for $p$, we get:\n$p$ = (88 / 1.10) - (Old area / Old length)\n= (88 / 1.10) - (100 / Old length)\n= 6.67%\n\nTherefore, the value of $p$ that will give us an area of 88 square units after the alterations is 6.67%.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
