        "content": "  Great, let's solve this problem step by step!\n\nWe are given the following information:\n\n* The quantity of a product supplied (S(P)) = $\\frac{1}{2} P + 40$\n* The quantity of the product demanded (D(P)) = $220 - P$\n* A sheet of graphene weighing one ounce can cover up to 7 football fields\n\nNow, we need to find out how many acres a certain amount of graphene can cover. Let's use the information given in the question:\n\n* The area of a football field is approximately $1 \\frac{1}{3}$ acres\n\nSo, we can calculate the area of one football field as follows:\n\nArea of one football field = $1 \\frac{1}{3}$ acres\n\nNow, let's find out how many acres 48 ounces of graphene can cover:\n\n48 ounces of graphene = ? acres\n\nWe are given that a sheet of graphene weighing one ounce can cover up to 7 football fields. So, we can calculate the area of one ounce of graphene as follows:\n\nArea of one ounce of graphene = 7 football fields\n\nNow, we can convert the area of one ounce of graphene to acres:\n\nArea of one ounce of graphene in acres = $7 \\times \\frac{1}{3}$ acres/football field = 2.33 acres/ounce\n\nNow, we have the information we need to find out how many acres 48 ounces of graphene can cover:\n\n48 ounces of graphene = ? acres\n\n48 ounces = 48 $\\times$ 2.33 acres/ounce = 1,104 acres\n\nSo, 48 ounces of graphene can cover approximately 1,104 acres.\n\nNow, let's choose the correct answer from the options given in the question:\n\nB) 350 acres is the closest answer to the actual value of 1,104 acres.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B) 350 acres."
