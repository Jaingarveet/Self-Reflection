So, the total amount of solution he has is 5 milliliters + (n-3) milliliters, where n is the number of students.\n\nNow, if he wants to give each student 4 milliliters of solution, he will need an additional 21 milliliters. So, the total amount of solution he needs is 5 milliliters + (n-3) milliliters + 21 milliliters = 26 milliliters.\n\nSince he has 5 milliliters left over after giving 3 milliliters to each student, he must have had a total of 26 milliliters - 5 milliliters = 21 milliliters of solution to start with.\n\nTherefore, the number of students in the class is 21.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
