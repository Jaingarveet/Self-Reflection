        "content": "  Great, let's solve this problem!\n\nWe are given that Keith modeled the growth of a tree population by estimating the number of pollen grains per square centimeter that were deposited each year within layers of a lake's sediment. The number of pollen grains per square centimeter is given by $P(t)$, where $t$ is the number of years after the first year the grains were deposited.\n\nWe are also given that the number of pollen grains per square centimeter increased by $1\\%$ each year after the first year.\n\nSo, we can write the function $P(t)$ as:\n\n$$P(t) = 310 + 310 \\times 1.01^t$$\n\nNow, we have to choose the correct function from the options given.\n\nOption A: $P(t)=310^{t}$\n\nThis function does not match the given information. The number of pollen grains per square centimeter does not increase exponentially with time.\n\nOption B: $P(t)=310^{1.01 t}$\n\nThis function matches the given information. The number of pollen grains per square centimeter increases by $1\\%$ each year after the first year.\n\nOption C: $P(t)=310(0.99)^{t}$\n\nThis function does not match the given information. The number of pollen grains per square centimeter does not decrease exponentially with time.\n\nOption D: $P(t)=310(1.01)^{t}$\n\nThis function matches the given information. The number of pollen grains per square centimeter increases by $1\\%$ each year after the first year.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
