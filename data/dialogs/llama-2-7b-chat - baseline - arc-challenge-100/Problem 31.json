It is essential to know the accurate information about the Sun to understand its nature and behavior.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")\n\nThe statement \"It is near the end of its life cycle\" is the most accurate about the Sun. The Sun is expected to exhaust its fuel supply in about 5 billion years, after which it will expand into a red giant and eventually become a white dwarf. This means that the Sun is not infinite in its energy supply and will eventually run out of fuel."
