        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: A computer game publisher has recently released its latest adventure game. The game's inventive puzzles and compelling plot induce even casual players to become preoccupied with completing it. The game can be purchased from retail outlets or rented for two-day intervals. The publisher offers a rebate equal to the cost of one rental for renters who go on to purchase the game, saving them a significant portion of the purchase price. Since the rate of sales now meets expectations and rentals are exceeding expectations, the publisher predicts that soon sales of the game will also exceed expectations.\nQuestion: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to justify the publisher's prediction?\nChoices:\n  A: The game can be purchased directly from the publisher as well as from retailers.\n  B: It takes several weeks for most players to complete the game.\n  C: The publisher's games are among the most popular computer games on the market.\n  D: Most people who complete the game do not play it extensively afterward.\n  E: Some people buy and complete the game and then give it away to a friend.\n"
