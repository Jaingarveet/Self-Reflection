Therefore, if Green Island increases productivity by 20%, it will not go bankrupt. However, it is not necessarily true that if Green Island cannot achieve its goal of increasing productivity by 20%, it will go bankrupt. Option A is incorrect. Option C is also incorrect because the statement clearly states that Green Island must increase productivity by 10% to prevent bankruptcy. Option D is incorrect because the statement says that if Green Island can increase productivity by 10%, then it can achieve the goal of increasing productivity by 20%."
