E or F has one person to participate, but not both .One of J or K will participate, but not both.If J participates, then G participates.Unless F participates, M does not participate.\nQuestion: Which two of the following players will be selected by the coach to make the four-person team the only choice?\nChoices:\n  A: F and H\n  C: G and M\n  B: G and J\n  D: H and M\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\nThe problem requires selecting four players from a group of seven players. \nE or F has one person to participate, but not both. \nOne of J or K will participate, but not both. \nIf J participates, then G participates. \nUnless F participates, M does not participate. \nIf E is selected, then F cannot be selected. If F is selected, then E cannot be selected. So, either E or F will be selected, but not both. \nIf J is selected, then G must be selected. If K is selected, then G cannot be selected. So, either J or K will be selected, but not both. \nIf M is not selected, then F cannot be selected. So, if M is not selected, then E will be selected. \nTherefore, the possible combinations are:\n- E, G, J, and F\n- E, G, J, and K\n- F, G, J, and M\n- F, G, K, and M\nThe only combination that satisfies all the conditions is F, G, J, and M.\n"
