If there are 6 inches of space between each pair of pickets, which of the following represents the length of fence in feet?\nChoices:\n  A: 13x/2\n  B: 13x/2 - 6\n  C: 13x/24\n  D: (13x+1)/24\n  E: (13x-12)/24\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI made an error in my calculation of the total length of the fence. I correctly identified that each picket plus space is 13/2 inches wide, but I failed to account for the fact that there is no space after the last picket. So my formula included an extra 6 inches of length.\n"
