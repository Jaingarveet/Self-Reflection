Most Acme employees cannot afford housing within a 30-minute commute of Ocean View. So once the company has moved, most Acme employees will have a commute of more than 30 minutes.\nQuestion: The argument requires assuming which one of the following?\nChoices:\n  A: All Acme employees can afford housing within a 30-minute commute of Milltown.\n  B: The chairperson of Acme has good financial reasons for wanting to move the company to Ocean View.\n  C: None of Acme's employees except the chairperson are in favor of moving the company to Ocean View.\n  D: Currently, most Acme employees have a commute of less than 30 minutes.\n  E: Acme's move to Ocean View will not be accompanied by a significant pay raise for Acme employees.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI focused too narrowly on the commute times mentioned in the argument and failed to consider the underlying reason why the commute times would increase for most employees after the move. The argument implicitly assumes that there will not be a significant pay raise to offset the increased housing costs near Ocean View.\n"

        "content": "You're right, I need to think more carefully about the underlying assumptions in the argument.\nThe key points are:\n1) Most Acme employees cannot afford housing within a 30-minute commute of Ocean View. \n2) After the move, most employees will have a commute over 30 minutes.\nThe argument assumes that employees' inability to afford housing near Ocean View is what will cause their commutes to increase. It relies on the unstated assumption that there will not be a significant pay raise to allow employees to afford housing closer to the new location.\nIf employees did get a large enough pay raise, they could potentially afford to live near Ocean View, and their commutes would not necessarily increase. But the argument only makes sense if we assume pay will remain largely the same after the move.\nThe other answer choices focus on irrelevant factors or make claims not supported by the passage. \nTherefore, the argument requires assuming choice E: Acme's move to Ocean View will not be accompanied by a significant pay raise for Acme employees.\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
