At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.\nQuestion: If G is placed on the top shelf, then which one of the following could be a complete and accurate list of the books placed on the middle shelf?\nChoices:\n  A: H, I\n  B: I, L\n  C: H, I, L\n  D: I, K, L\n  E: F, I, M\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI made an error in my reasoning about the placement of the books on the shelves. Specifically, I incorrectly assumed that since more books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, there must be 2 books on the top, 2-3 in the middle, and 3-4 on the bottom. However, this distribution is not the only possibility that satisfies the given conditions. My reasoning led me to incorrectly eliminate answer choice [REDACTED].\n"

More books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.\n3. I is on the middle shelf.\n4. K is on a higher shelf than F.\n5. O is on a higher shelf than L.\n6. F and M are on the same shelf.\n7. G is on the top shelf.\nFrom the reflection, I see that I shouldn't make assumptions about the exact number of books on each shelf. Multiple distributions could work as long as there are at least 2 per shelf and more on the bottom than the top.\nWith G on the top shelf, there are 2-3 possible books left for the middle shelf to satisfy the conditions.\nLooking at the answer choices:\nA. H, I - Possible, satisfies conditions\nB. I, L - Not possible, O must be higher than L\nC. H, I, L - Not possible, O must be higher than L\nD. I, K, L - Not possible, K must be higher than F, which is not on the middle shelf\nE. F, I, M - Not possible, F and M must be on the same shelf as each other, but can't be on the middle shelf with I\nTherefore, the only possible answer is A: H, I\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
