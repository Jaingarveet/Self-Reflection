Each solo will be either a modern piece or a traditional piece. The choice of pianist and type of piece for the solos must conform to the following conditions: The third solo is a traditional piece. Exactly two of the traditional pieces are performed consecutively. In the fourth solo, either Wayne performs a traditional piece or Zara performs a modern piece. The pianist who performs the second solo does not perform the fifth solo. No traditional piece is performed until Wayne performs at least one modem piece.\nQuestion: What is the minimum number of solos in which Wayne performs a traditional piece?\nChoices:\n  A: zero\n  B: one\n  C: two\n  D: three\n  E: four\n"

Wayne performs a modern piece first, followed by Zara performing a traditional piece. In this case, the third solo must be a traditional piece, and the fourth solo must be a modern piece performed by Zara. This means Wayne will not perform a traditional piece in the first four solos.\n2. Zara performs a modern piece first, followed by Wayne performing a traditional piece. In this case, the third solo must be a traditional piece, and the fourth solo must be a modern piece performed by Wayne. This means Wayne will perform a traditional piece in the third solo.\n\nIn either case, Wayne will perform a traditional piece at most in the third solo. Therefore, the minimum number of solos in which Wayne performs a traditional piece is three.\n\nAnswer: C"
