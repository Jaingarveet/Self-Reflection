Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.\nQuestion: Which one of the following, if substituted for the constraint that the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, would have the same effect in determining the locations of the businesses?\nChoices:\n  A: A restaurant must be in either space 3, space 4, or space 5.\n  B: A restaurant must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.\n  C: Either the toy store or the veterinarian must be somewhere between the two restaurants.\n  D: No more than two businesses can separate the pharmacy and the restaurant nearest it.\n  E: The optometrist cannot be next to the shoe store.\n"

        "content": "  Answer: \"C\"\n\nEither the toy store or the veterinarian must be somewhere between the two restaurants. This constraint has the same effect as the original constraint that the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. It ensures that there is at least one business between the two restaurants and, therefore, the two restaurants cannot be adjacent to each other.\n\nHere's how the businesses could be arranged to satisfy all the constraints:\n\nSpace 1: Pharmacy\nSpace 2: Optometrist\nSpace 3: Restaurant 1\nSpace 4: Toy Store\nSpace 5: Restaurant 2\nSpace 6: Veterinarian\nSpace 7: Shoe Store\n\nIn this arrangement, the pharmacy is at one end of the row, and one of the restaurants (Restaurant 1) is at the other end. The two restaurants are separated by three other businesses (Optometrist, Toy Store, and Veterinarian). The pharmacy is next to the optometrist, and the toy store is not next to the veterinarian. All the constraints are satisfied."
