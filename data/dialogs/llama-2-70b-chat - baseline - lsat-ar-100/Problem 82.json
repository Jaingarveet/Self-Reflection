Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.

        "content": "  Answer: C\n\nExplanation:\nThe question provides us with five conditions that must be met when matching the sales representatives to the sales zones. Let's break down each condition and see how they can be satisfied:\n\n1. Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.\n2. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.\n3. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.\n4. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.\n5. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each choice to see which one satisfies all the conditions:\n\nA: Zone 1: Kim, Parra Zone 2: Stuckey, Udall Zone 3: Mahr, Quinn, Tiao\nThis choice violates condition 1, as both Parra and Tiao are assigned to Zone 1.\n\nB: Zone 1: Kim, Tiao Zone 2: Stuckey, Udall Zone 3: Mahr, Parra, Quinn\nThis choice violates condition 2, as both Tiao and Udall are assigned to Zone 2.\n\nC: Zone 1: Parra, Quinn Zone 2: Kim, Udall Zone 3: Mahr, Stuckey, Tiao\nThis choice satisfies all the conditions. Parra or Tiao (but not both) work in Zone 1. Tiao or Udall (but not both) work in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work together in Zone 1. Stuckey and Udall work together in Zone 2. There are more representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.\n\nD: Zone 1: Stuckey, Udall Zone 2: Kim, Tiao Zone 3: Mahr, Parra, Quinn\nThis choice violates condition 3, as Parra and Quinn are not working together in the same sales zone.\n\nE: Zone 1: Tiao Zone 2: Kim, Parra, Quinn Zone 3: Stuckey, Udall\nThis choice violates condition 4, as Stuckey and Udall are not working together in the same sales zone.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C."
