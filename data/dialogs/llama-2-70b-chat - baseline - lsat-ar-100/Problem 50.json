The following conditions must apply: Greyhounds are featured on day 1. No breed is featured on any two consecutive days. Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7. Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1. Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.\nQuestion: Which one of the following could be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Greyhounds and Siamese are both featured on day 2.\n  B: Greyhounds and Himalayans are both featured on day 7.\n  C: Rottweilers and Himalayans are both featured on day 4.\n  D: Rottweilers and Manx are both featured on day 5.\n  E: Newfoundlands and Manx are both featured on day 6.\n"

Since Himalayans are featured on exactly three days and not on day 1, they must be featured on day 4. Therefore, option C is correct.\n\nOption A is incorrect because Greyhounds are featured on day 1, and no breed can be featured on two consecutive days.\n\nOption B is incorrect because Himalayans are not featured on day 7.\n\nOption D is incorrect because Rottweilers are not featured on day 7 and cannot be featured on any day that features Himalayans.\n\nOption E is incorrect because Newfoundlands and Manx cannot both be featured on day 6, as stated in the question."
