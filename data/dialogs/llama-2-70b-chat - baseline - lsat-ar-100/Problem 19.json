Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.\nQuestion: If Helen, Kyle, and Lenore, not necessarily in that order, give the three morning reports, which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Helen gives a report on Monday.\n  B: Irving gives a report on Monday.\n  C: Irving gives a report on Wednesday.\n  D: Kyle gives a report on Tuesday.\n  E: Kyle gives a report on Wednesday.\n"

Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\nB: Irving gives a report on Monday.\nAs mentioned above, George can only give a report on Tuesday. Therefore, Irving cannot give a report on Monday. Hence, this option is incorrect.\n\nC: Irving gives a report on Wednesday.\nThis option is possible. If Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Wednesday. Therefore, this option is correct.\n\nD: Kyle gives a report on Tuesday.\nSince George can only give a report on Tuesday, Kyle cannot give a report on Tuesday. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\nE: Kyle gives a report on Wednesday.\nThis option is possible. If Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then Kyle can give a report on Wednesday.
