The candidates for these ambassadorships are Jaramillo, Kayne, Landon, Novetzke, and Ong. One ambassador will be assigned to each country, and no ambassador will be assigned to more than one country. The assignment of the ambassadors must meet the following constraints: Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships. If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne. If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen. If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.\nQuestion: The pair of candidates who are not assigned to ambassadorships could be\nChoices:\n  A: Jaramillo and Novetzke\n  B: Jaramillo and Ong\n  C: Kayne and Landon\n  D: Kayne and Novetzke\n  E: Landon and Ong\n"
