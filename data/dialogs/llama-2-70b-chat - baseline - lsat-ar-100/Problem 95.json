Each bay is holding a different one of exactly six types of cargoâ€”fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles. The following apply: The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock. The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles. The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel. The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.\nQuestion: Which one of the following lists could accurately identify the cargo held in each of the loading dock's first three bays, listed in order from bay 1 to bay 3?\nChoices:\n  A: fuel, machinery, textiles\n  B: grain, machinery, fuel\n  C: machinery, livestock, fuel\n  D: machinery, textiles, fuel\n  E: machinery, textiles, produce\n"
