Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.\nQuestion: If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then which one of the following could be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Kim works in Zone 2.\n  B: Mahr works in Zone 2.\n  C: Parra works in Zone 3.\n  D: Tiao works in Zone 1.\n  E: Udall works in Zone 3.\n"

Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.\n2. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.\n3. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.\n4. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.\n\nFrom condition 1, we know that if Parra works in Zone 1, then Tiao cannot work in Zone 1. Similarly, if Tiao works in Zone 1, then Parra cannot work in Zone 1.\n\nFrom condition 2, we know that if Tiao works in Zone 2, then Udall cannot work in Zone 2. Similarly, if Udall works in Zone 2, then Tiao cannot work in Zone 2.\n\nFrom condition 3, we know that Parra and Quinn work together in either Zone 1, Zone 2, or Zone 3.\n\nFrom condition 4, we know that Stuckey and Udall work together in either Zone 1, Zone 2, or Zone 3.\n\nNow, let's consider the options:\n\nA: Kim works in Zone 2.\nThis is possible, but it doesn't help us determine the truth of any other statement.\n\nB: Mahr works in Zone 2.\nThis is also possible, but like option A, it doesn't help us determine the truth of any other statement.\n\nC: Parra works in Zone 3.\nIf Parra works in Zone 3, then Tiao must work in Zone 1 (due to condition 1). But this contradicts the given condition that more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3. Therefore, this option is false.\n\nD: Tiao works in Zone 1.\nIf Tiao works in Zone 1, then Parra cannot work in Zone 1 (due to condition 1). This means Parra must work in Zone 3, and Quinn must work in Zone 2 (due to condition 3). But this contradicts the given condition that more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3. Therefore, this option is false.\n\nE: Udall works in Zone 3.\nIf Udall works in Zone 3, then Stuckey must work in Zone 2 (due to condition 4). But this contradicts the given condition that more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3. Therefore, this option is false.\n\nBased on our analysis, we can conclude that none of the options (A, B, C, D, or E) could be true if more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3. Therefore, the answer is \"None of the above.\"\n\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
