        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: On the first day of a two-day study for a cycling magazine, four riders—Reynaldo, Seamus, Theresa, and Yuki—will each test one of four bicycles—F, G, H, and J. Each rider will then test a different one of the bicycles on the second day. Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day. The assignment of riders to bicycles is subject to the following conditions: Reynaldo cannot test F. Yuki cannot test J. Theresa must be one of the testers for H. The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.\nQuestion: If Theresa tests J on the first day, then which one of the following could be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Reynaldo tests G on the second day.\n  B: Seamus tests H on the first day.\n  C: Yuki tests H on the second day.\n  D: Seamus is one of the testers for J.\n  E: Theresa is one of the testers for G.\n"

        "content": "  Answer: C\n\nTheresa tests J on the first day; therefore, Yuki must test H on the first day, as Yuki cannot test J. According to the condition, the bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day, so Seamus tests H on the second day. Therefore, option C, \"Yuki tests H on the second day,\" is correct.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nOption A: Reynaldo cannot test G on the second day because Theresa must test H, and Yuki must test J.\n\nOption B: Seamus cannot test H on the first day because Yuki tests H on the first day.\n\nOption D: Seamus cannot be one of the testers for J because Yuki tests J on the first day, and Seamus tests H on the second day.\n\nOption E: Theresa cannot be one of the testers for G because Theresa tests J on the first day."
