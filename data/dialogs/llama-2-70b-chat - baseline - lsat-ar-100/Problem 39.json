Therefore, option A, which includes only one Russian novel, is not feasible.\nOption B includes two French plays, which violates the rule that no more than four French works are selected. Therefore, option B is not feasible.\nOption C includes one Russian novel and one Russian play. However, if both French plays are selected, then the Russian play cannot be selected, which contradicts the fact that we have selected one Russian play. Therefore, option C is not feasible.\nOption D includes one Russian novel and two French plays. This option meets all the requirements, as we have selected at least three novels, no more than four French works, and at least as many French novels as Russian novels. Therefore, option D is feasible.\nOption E includes two Russian novels and one French play. This option violates the rule that no more than four French works are selected. Therefore, option E is not feasible.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
