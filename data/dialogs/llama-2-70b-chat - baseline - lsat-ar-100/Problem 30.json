        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: During a recital, two pianists—Wayne and Zara—will perform solos. There will be five solos altogether, performed one immediately after another. Each solo will be either a modern piece or a traditional piece. The choice of pianist and type of piece for the solos must conform to the following conditions: The third solo is a traditional piece. Exactly two of the traditional pieces are performed consecutively. In the fourth solo, either Wayne performs a traditional piece or Zara performs a modern piece. The pianist who performs the second solo does not perform the fifth solo. No traditional piece is performed until Wayne performs at least one modem piece.\nQuestion: If the pianist who performs the first solo also performs the second solo, then which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Zara performs the first solo.\n  B: Wayne performs the third solo.\n  C: Zara performs the fifth solo.\n  D: The second solo is a traditional piece.\n  E: The fourth solo is a modem piece.\n"

The first and second solos are performed by the same pianist.\n2. Since the third solo is a traditional piece, and no traditional piece is performed until Wayne performs at least one modern piece, Wayne must perform a modern piece before the third solo.\n3. Therefore, the second solo must be a modern piece.\n4. Since exactly two traditional pieces are performed consecutively, the fourth solo must be a traditional piece.\n5. The pianist who performs the second solo does not perform the fifth solo, so Zara must perform the fifth solo.\n\nThus, the answer is \"D\" - The second solo is a traditional piece."
