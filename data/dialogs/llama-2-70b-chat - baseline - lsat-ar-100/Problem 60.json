We need to find an order that satisfies all the given conditions.\n\n* Greyhounds are featured on day 1, so the first day's breed is fixed.\n* No breed is featured on any two consecutive days, so we need to alternate between the three breeds of kittens.\n* Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1. They must be featured on days 2, 4, and 6.\n* Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans. They can be featured on days 3, 5, and 7.\n* Siamese and Manx breeds need to be featured on the remaining days.\n\nLet's analyze the choices:\n\n* Choice A: Himalayan, Manx, Siamese, Himalayan, Manx, Himalayan, Siamese. This order does not satisfy the condition that Himalayans are not featured on day 1. Eliminate.\n* Choice B: Manx, Himalayan, Siamese, Himalayan, Manx, Himalayan, Manx.
