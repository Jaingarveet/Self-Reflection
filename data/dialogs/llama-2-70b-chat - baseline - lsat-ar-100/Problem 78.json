Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.\nQuestion: If George, Nina, and Robert give reports and they do so on different days from one another, which one of the following could be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Helen gives a report on Wednesday.\n  B: Nina gives a report on Monday.\n  C: Nina gives a report on Tuesday.\n  D: Olivia gives a report on Monday.\n  E: Robert gives a report on Wednesday.\n"

        "content": "  Thought: \nThis is a classic logic puzzle. Let's break it down step by step.\nWe know that exactly six students will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. This means that two students will give reports each day, one in the morning and one in the afternoon.\nTuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. So, if George gives a report, it must be on Tuesday.\nNeither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. This means that if Olivia gives a report, it must be in the morning, and if Robert gives a report, it must be in the afternoon.\nIf Nina gives a report, then on the next day, Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. This means that if Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday. If Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Wednesday.\nNow, let's consider the given options:\nOption A: Helen gives a report on Wednesday.\nIf Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday. This means that Helen cannot give a report on Wednesday. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\nOption B: Nina gives a report on Monday.\nAs discussed above, if Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday. This means that Nina cannot give a report on Tuesday. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\nOption C: Nina gives a report on Tuesday.\nThis option is correct. If Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then George must give a report on Tuesday as well, since Tuesday is the only day he can give a report. Therefore, Nina and George can give reports on different days from each other.\n\nOption D: Olivia gives a report on Monday.\nAs discussed above, neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. Therefore, if Olivia gives a report on Monday, it must be in the morning. However, this means that Robert cannot give a report on Monday, since he must give a report in the afternoon. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\nOption E: Robert gives a report on Wednesday.\nIf Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Wednesday. This means that Robert cannot give a report on Wednesday. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
