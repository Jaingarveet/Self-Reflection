Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.\nQuestion: If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then which one of the following could be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Kim works in Zone 2.\n  B: Mahr works in Zone 1.\n  C: Parra works in Zone 3.\n  D: Stuckey works in Zone 2.\n  E: Tiao works in Zone 1.\n"

Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.\n2. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.\n3. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.\n4. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.\n5. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.\nFrom condition 1, we know that either Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1. Let's assume that Parra works in Zone 1.\nFrom condition 2, we know that Tiao cannot work in Zone 2. Therefore, Udall works in Zone 2.\nFrom condition 3, we know that Quinn works in the same sales zone as Parra, which means Quinn works in Zone 1.\nFrom condition 4, we know that Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone. Since Udall works in Zone 2, Stuckey must work in Zone 2 as well.\nFrom condition 5, we know that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, we can conclude that Mahr and Kim work in Zone 3.\nNow, let's evaluate the answer choices:\nA: Kim works in Zone 2. This is false, since we've deduced that Kim works in Zone 3.\nB: Mahr works in Zone 1. This is false, since we've deduced that Mahr works in Zone 3.\nC: Parra works in Zone 3. This is false, since we've deduced that Parra works in Zone 1.\nD: Stuckey works in Zone 2. This is true, since we've deduced that Stuckey works in Zone 2.\nE: Tiao works in Zone 1. This is false, since we've deduced that Parra works in Zone 1.\nTherefore, the answer is D: Stuckey works in Zone 2.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
