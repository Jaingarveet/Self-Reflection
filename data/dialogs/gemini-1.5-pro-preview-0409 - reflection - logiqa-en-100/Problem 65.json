Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "Explanation:\nI focused on finding an option that explained the lack of observed effect from strict drunk driving investigations. While option B seemed plausible, it didn't fully address the core issue. I failed to consider the context of where these investigations were taking place, which is crucial to understanding the apparent inconsistency.\nError Keywords:\n - Misinterpretation\n - Missing context\n - Ignoring information\nSolution:\nThe key to resolving the inconsistency lies in understanding where the investigations are focused. Option A reveals that these investigations are primarily in urban areas. This implies that the data from cities with strict drunk driving investigations might be skewed towards areas with inherently higher accident rates due to factors like traffic density. Therefore, the similar accident rates between cities with and without strict investigations might not be a direct reflection of the effectiveness of the policy itself. \nInstructions:\n1. Identify the apparent inconsistency or paradox in the problem.\n2. Carefully analyze each answer choice in the context of the given information.\n3. Pay close attention to any details or conditions mentioned in the context.\n4. Look for an option that provides a logical explanation for the inconsistency, considering all relevant factors.\n5. Avoid jumping to conclusions based on partial information or assumptions.\nAdvice:\n - Always consider the broader context when analyzing a problem.\n - Pay attention to details and qualifying information provided in the context.\n - Look for hidden assumptions or biases that might influence your interpretation.\n - Consider multiple perspectives and possibilities before drawing conclusions.\n - Be mindful of the limitations of the given information and avoid making generalizations. \n"
