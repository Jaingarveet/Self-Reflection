Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

I failed to consider the possibility of I and E being located between G and F.\n**Error Keywords:**\n*   Logic error\n*   Assumption error\n*   Ordering error\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n1.  **G is northernmost:** The order starts with G.\n2.  **F is south of G:** From (3), F must come after G. Order is now GF.\n3.  **H is south of F:** From (1), H must come after F. Order is now GFH.\n4.  **I and E are adjacent:** From (2), I and E are together. They can be placed in three positions:\n    *   **South of H:** GFHI, GFHIE (two possibilities as I and E can switch)\n    *   **Between G and F:** GIFH, GIEFH (two possibilities as I and E can switch)\n**Instructions for Future:**\n1.  **Analyze each statement individually:** Break down the given information into separate facts.\n2.  **Consider all possibilities:** Don't make assumptions about the order or placement of elements unless explicitly stated.\n3.  **Systematically explore placements:** Try placing the remaining elements in all possible valid positions.\n4.  **Count distinct arrangements:** Ensure each arrangement is unique and adheres to all given conditions.\n**General Advice for Similar Problems:**\n*   **Visualize the problem:** Draw diagrams or use objects to represent the elements and their relationships.\n*   **Work systematically:** Avoid jumping to conclusions and explore all possibilities in an organized manner.\n*   **Check for consistency:** Ensure your solution satisfies all the given conditions and constraints.\n*   **Practice similar problems:** The more you practice, the better you become at identifying potential pitfalls and applying logical reasoning. \n"
