Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "## Reflection on Logic Problem\n**Explanation of Incorrect Answer:**\nMy error stemmed from misinterpreting the given information and incorrectly ordering the stations. I assumed \"adjacent\" meant directly next to each other, leading to an incorrect sequence.\n**Error Keywords:**\n*   Misinterpretation\n*   Logical reasoning error\n*   Ordering error\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n1.  **Analyze Clues:** We know:\n    *   West to East order.\n    *   Fuyi is between Haoyun (West) and Huyao (East) and next to Huyao.\n    *   Jiushang is East of and next to Haoyun.\n    *   Jiushang is also next to Yinling.\n2.  **Establish Order:**\n    *   Haoyun is the westernmost as Fuyi is East of it.\n    *   Jiushang is next to Haoyun (East).\n    *   Yinling is next to Jiushang (unknown direction yet).\n    *   Fuyi is next to Huyao, and we know Huyao is East of Fuyi, so Huyao is the easternmost.\n3.  **Deduce Conclusion:** Since Huyao is the easternmost, the answer is **A: Huyao is standing on the east side.**\n**Instructions for Future Problems:**\n1.  **Carefully analyze each statement** and its implications.\n2.  **Draw a diagram or map** to visualize the relationships.\n3.  **Consider all possibilities** before establishing order.\n4.  **Pay attention to keywords** like \"adjacent\" and their exact meaning.\n5.  **Double-check the logic** and ensure conclusions are supported by the given information.\n**General Advice for Similar Problems:**\n*   **Avoid assumptions** and stick to the given information.\n*   **Break down complex statements** into smaller parts.\n*   **Look for relationships and connections** between elements.\n*   **Use visualization tools** to aid understanding.\n*   **Practice logical reasoning** with various problems. \n"
