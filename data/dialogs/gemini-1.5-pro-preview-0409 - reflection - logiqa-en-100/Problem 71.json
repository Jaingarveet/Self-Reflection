Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

Option D provides a reason for disapproval but doesn't explain the contradiction between approval and action.\n**Error Keywords:**\n*   Misinterpretation of question\n*   Focusing on disapproval instead of discrepancy\n*   Ignoring relevant information in answer choices\n## Step-by-Step Solution\n1.  **Analyze the Discrepancy:** The problem highlights a contradiction: people favor the idea of college student nannies but wouldn't hire them.\n2.  **Evaluate Answer Choices:** We need an option that explains this gap between attitude and action.\n3.  **Option C Analysis:** This option reveals that while many favor the idea, their reasoning is based on the benefit for the students, not the quality of service. This explains why they wouldn't hire them â€“ they don't believe they'd get better service.\n## Instructions for Future Similar Problems\n1.  **Identify the core contradiction or discrepancy** the question asks about.\n2.  **Focus on options that directly address this discrepancy**, not just related issues.\n3.  **Analyze how each option explains the gap** between attitude and action, belief and behavior, etc.\n4.  **Choose the option that provides the most logical and direct explanation** for the discrepancy.\n## General Advice for Similar Problems\n*   **Read the question and answer choices carefully** to fully grasp the nuances of the problem.\n*   **Pay attention to keywords** that highlight the specific issue to be addressed.\n*   **Don't get sidetracked by plausible but irrelevant information**; stay focused on the core problem.\n*   **Consider the context and underlying assumptions** of the situation described.\n*   **Think critically about each option** and its implications for the given scenario. \n"
