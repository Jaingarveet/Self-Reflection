Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "## Reflection on Incorrect Answer\n**Explanation:** I incorrectly focused on the content of option C regarding visual experience and mirages, failing to analyze its relevance to the core argument about the external world's existence. The key was to identify the option that **doesn't challenge** the given argument.\n**Error Keywords:**\n*   Misinterpretation \n*   Irrelevant focus\n*   Ignoring context\n## Step-by-Step Solution\n1.  **Analyze the Argument:** The argument claims the external world exists because visual experiences (e.g., seeing buildings, crowds, stars) are caused by external light sources. It also mentions shared experiences and book knowledge as supporting evidence.\n2.  **Evaluate Each Option:**\n    *   **A:** This challenges the argument by pointing out circular reasoning – assuming the external world to prove its existence.\n    *   **B:** This questions the assumption of shared visual experiences, thus challenging the argument.\n    *   **C:** This discusses the reliability of visual experiences and the nature of mirages but doesn't directly challenge the existence of the external world.\n    *   **D:** This supports the argument by highlighting the practical success of natural science, which relies on the existence of an external world.\n3.  **Identify the Non-Challenging Option:** Option D supports the argument, while A and B directly challenge it. Option C, although discussing visual perception, doesn't directly address the core claim of the external world's existence.\n## Future Instructions\n1.  **Identify the core claim of the argument.**\n2.  **Analyze each option in relation to the core claim.**\n3.  **Focus on whether the option supports, challenges, or is irrelevant to the core claim.**\n4.  **Choose the option that does not challenge or cast doubt on the argument.**\n## General Advice\n*   **Read the question and context carefully.**\n*   **Focus on the logical structure and reasoning of the argument.**\n*   **Distinguish between supporting evidence, challenges, and irrelevant information.**\n*   **Consider different perspectives and potential counterarguments.** \n*   **Avoid focusing on specific details that don't directly address the main point.** \n"
