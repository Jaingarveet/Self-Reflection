Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "## Reflection on Logic Problem\n**Explanation of Incorrect Answer:**\nMy reasoning was flawed in assuming the country could find a balance between economic development and social stability. I focused on the immediate impact of social security contributions on competitiveness but failed to consider the long-term consequences of neglecting social security.\n**Error Keywords:**\n*   Misinterpretation of long-term consequences\n*   Overlooking potential instability\n*   Incomplete analysis of options\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n1.  **Analyze the conflict:** The context presents a situation where social security contributions are necessary for stability but negatively impact company competitiveness, hindering economic development.\n2.  **Evaluate options based on the conflict:**\n    *   Option A is incorrect because it assumes no middle ground exists.\n    *   Option B is partially correct but doesn't address the core issue of social stability.\n    *   **Option C is the correct answer** because neglecting social security would lead to instability, while prioritizing it hinders economic development. The context doesn't offer a solution to this dilemma.\n    *   Option D is incorrect because it downplays the severity of the situation, implying only a minor impact on economic development.\n**Instructions for Future Similar Problems:**\n1.  **Identify the core conflict or dilemma presented in the context.**\n2.  **Analyze each option based on how it addresses or resolves the conflict.**\n3.  **Consider both the immediate and long-term consequences of each option.**\n4.  **Choose the option that most accurately reflects the implications of the presented situation, even if it's not an ideal outcome.**\n**General Advice for Logic Problems:**\n*   **Read the problem and context carefully, ensuring full comprehension.**\n*   **Avoid making assumptions or drawing conclusions not explicitly supported by the information provided.**\n*   **Consider all possible interpretations and implications of the context.**\n*   **Evaluate each option objectively based on the information given.**\n*   **Be aware of common logical fallacies and avoid them in your reasoning.** \n"
