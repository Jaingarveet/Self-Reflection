Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "## Reflection on Incorrect Answer\n**Explanation:** My reasoning was flawed in assuming that if Wang Wu's bonus is higher than Li Si's, it automatically guarantees Zhang Shan's bonus is higher than Miao Xiaoqin's. This assumption overlooks the possibility that Miao Xiaoqin's bonus could still be higher than Zhang Shan's, even if Wang Wu has the highest bonus.\n**Error Keywords:**\n*   Logical fallacy\n*   Assumption error\n*   Transitivity error \n## Step-by-Step Solution\n1. **Analyze the given information:** We know Zhang Shan > Li Si and Wang Wu > Miao Xiaoqin.\n2. **Identify the goal:** Find the scenario that does NOT guarantee Zhang Shan > Miao Xiaoqin.\n3. **Evaluate each option:**\n    *   **A:** If Wang Wu > Li Si, it does NOT necessarily mean Zhang Shan > Miao Xiaoqin. Miao Xiaoqin could still have a bonus between Zhang Shan and Li Si. \n    *   **B:** If Li Si > Miao Xiaoqin, then Zhang Shan > Li Si > Miao Xiaoqin, thus Zhang Shan > Miao Xiaoqin. This option fits the initial statement.\n    *   **C:** If Li Si > Wang Wu, we lack a clear comparison between Zhang Shan and Miao Xiaoqin. This option could potentially contradict the initial statement.\n    *   **D:** If Li Si = Wang Wu, then Wang Wu > Miao Xiaoqin implies Li Si > Miao Xiaoqin, leading to Zhang Shan > Miao Xiaoqin. This option fits the initial statement.\n4. **Choose the exception:** Option A is the only scenario that doesn't guarantee the initial statement. \n## Instructions for Future Similar Problems\n1. **Identify the given relationships:** Clearly understand the established comparisons between individuals.\n2. **Focus on the goal:** Determine what needs to be disproven or what exception needs to be found.\n3. **Analyze each option independently:** Avoid making assumptions or transitive inferences that are not explicitly stated.\n4. **Consider all possibilities:** Don't overlook scenarios that might seem unlikely but are still possible.\n5. **Choose the option that breaks the logic:** Select the scenario that contradicts or doesn't guarantee the initial statement.\n## General Advice for Logic Problems\n*   **Read carefully:** Understand the context and the relationships between different elements.\n*   **Avoid assumptions:** Base your reasoning only on the information provided.\n*   **Consider all options:** Don't jump to conclusions or eliminate possibilities prematurely.\n*   **Think step-by-step:** Break down complex problems into smaller, more manageable parts.\n*   **Check for logical fallacies:** Be aware of common errors in reasoning, such as assuming transitivity when it doesn't apply. \n"
