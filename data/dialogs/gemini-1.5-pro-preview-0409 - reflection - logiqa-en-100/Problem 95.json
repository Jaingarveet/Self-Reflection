Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

I failed to grasp the underlying message about collective effort and unity.\n**Error Keywords:**\n*   Misinterpretation \n*   Focus on literal meaning\n*   Ignoring figurative language \n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n1.  **Analyze the context:** Premier Wen uses multiplication and division as metaphors.\n2.  **Interpret the metaphors:** \n    *   Multiplication: Small problems become big when applied to a large population.\n    *   Division: Large totals become small when distributed among a large population.\n3.  **Identify the underlying message:** Collective effort (everyone contributing) can overcome large challenges or achieve significant goals.\n4.  **Connect to answer choices:** Option D, \"Everyone collects firewood and the flame is high,\" best reflects the idea of collective effort leading to success.\n**Instructions for Future:**\n1.  **Read the entire passage carefully:** Pay attention to the context and any figurative language used.\n2.  **Identify the main point:** Look beyond the literal meaning and consider the underlying message.\n3.  **Analyze answer choices in relation to the main point:** Choose the option that best reflects the core message of the passage.\n**General Advice:**\n*   **Be aware of figurative language:** Metaphors, similes, and other figures of speech can convey deeper meanings.\n*   **Consider multiple interpretations:** Don't jump to conclusions based on the literal meaning alone.\n*   **Think about the author's intent:** What message are they trying to convey? \n*   **Develop cultural awareness:** Understanding cultural references and context is crucial for accurate interpretation. \n"
