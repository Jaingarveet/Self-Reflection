Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

The correct structure should be \"All B are A, C is not A, therefore C is not B\".\nError Keywords:\n - Logical reasoning error\n - Implication direction error\n - Negation error\nSolution:\nThe given argument states: All landscape rooms (B) can see the landscape (A), Li Wenbing's family (C) can't see the landscape (not A), therefore, Li Wenbing's family is not a landscape room (not B).\nOption D follows the correct structure: Anyone who meets the basic conditions (B) can apply for a small loan (A), Sun Wen did not apply for a small loan (not A), therefore, Sun Wen did not meet the basic conditions (not B).\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the subject, predicate, and direction of implication in the original argument.\n2. Look for an option with the same subject-predicate relationship and implication direction.\n3. Pay close attention to negations and ensure they align correctly.\n4. Verify that the conclusion logically follows from the premises in the chosen option.\nAdvice:\n - Carefully analyze the logical structure of the given argument, including the direction of implication.\n - Pay attention to negations and their impact on the argument's validity.\n - Consider all options and eliminate those that do not match the logical structure or direction of implication.\n - Focus on understanding the reasoning process rather than just matching patterns. \n - Practice with various logical reasoning problems to improve your skills in identifying valid arguments. \n"
