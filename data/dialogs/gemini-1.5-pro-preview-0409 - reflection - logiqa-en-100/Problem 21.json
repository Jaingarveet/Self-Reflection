Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

At present, part of the orbit of Comet 1996D3 is far from the sun, but recently it can be found to emit flickering light through the solar telescope.In the past, people never observed such flashes of comets far away from the sun, so this flicker must be an unusual scene.Xiao Wang? Normally people don't observe comets far away from the sun.The 1996D3 comet flicker light discovered this time was obtained by continuous and careful tracking observation.\nQuestion: Which of the following most accurately summarizes the method Xiao Wang used to refute Xiao Chen's views?\nChoices:\n  A: Point out that the key concepts used by Xiao Chen are ambiguous.\n  B: pointed out that Xiao Chen's argument is clearly lacking in persuasion.\n  C: pointed out that Xiao Chen's arguments contradict themselves.\n  D: Disagree with Xiao Chen's conclusion, and put forward another explanation for Xiao Chen's argument.E.Agree with Xiao Chen's conclusion, but put forward another explanation for Xiao Chen's argument.\n\nThought:\nXiao Wang refutes Xiao Chen by providing an alternative explanation for the comet's flickering, not by attacking the logic or clarity of Xiao Chen's argument. \nAction: Answer(\"D\") \n\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: B"

        "content": "## Reflection on Incorrect Answer\n**Explanation:** I misinterpreted the nature of Xiao Wang's refutation. I focused on the alternative explanation provided by Xiao Wang and categorized it as a direct refutation of Xiao Chen's conclusion. However, the core of Xiao Wang's argument lies in highlighting the lack of evidence supporting Xiao Chen's claim of \"unusual scene\" due to the limitations of past observations.\n**Error Keywords:**\n*   Misinterpretation \n*   Focus on alternative explanation\n*   Ignoring the core argument\n## Step-by-Step Solution\n1.  **Analyze Xiao Chen's Argument:** Xiao Chen claims the comet's flickering is unusual because such phenomena were not observed in the past.\n2.  **Analyze Xiao Wang's Response:** Xiao Wang points out that past observations were limited, implying the lack of evidence for Xiao Chen's claim of unusualness.\n3.  **Identify the Refutation Method:** Xiao Wang weakens Xiao Chen's argument by highlighting the lack of supporting evidence, not by directly contradicting the conclusion or providing an alternative explanation.\n## Instructions for Future Similar Problems\n1.  **Identify the core argument of each person.**\n2.  **Analyze how each person responds to the other's argument.**\n3.  **Focus on the logical reasoning and evidence used, not just the conclusions or alternative explanations.**\n4.  **Categorize the refutation method based on how it weakens the original argument (e.g., attacking logic, evidence, or assumptions).**\n## General Advice for Similar Problems\n*   **Pay close attention to the structure and nuances of arguments.**\n*   **Distinguish between conclusions, evidence, and assumptions.**\n*   **Identify the different methods of refutation (e.g., attacking logic, evidence, or assumptions).**\n*   **Consider the context and limitations of the information presented.** \n"
