Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

I also misinterpreted statement (4) as providing less information than it actually did.\n**Error Keywords:**\n*   Misinterpretation of conditional statement\n*   Overlooking possibilities\n*   Focusing on irrelevant information\n## Step-by-Step Solution\n1.  **Analyze Statements:**\n    *   (1) Li is in Tianshu.\n    *   (2) Zhao is not in Tianshu (due to 1).\n    *   (3) Liu and Zhao are in the same unit (not Tianshu due to 2).\n    *   (4) If Zhang is in Tianxuan, then Wang is also in Tianxuan (contrapositive: if Wang is NOT in Tianxuan, then Zhang is NOT in Tianxuan).\n2.  **Evaluate Options:**\n    *   A: Li and Liu cannot be together (Li is in Tianshu, Liu is not).\n    *   B: This option is uncertain based on the given information.\n    *   **C: This option contradicts statement (3) as Liu and Zhao must be together.** \n    *   D: This option is possible if Wang is in Tianxuan (forcing Zhang out due to 4) and Zhao & Liu are in Tianji.\n3.  **Conclusion:** Option D is the only one that doesn't contradict any of the given statements and is therefore a possible correct answer. \n## Instructions for Future Similar Problems\n1.  **Carefully analyze each statement, identifying the information it provides and any constraints it imposes.**\n2.  **Pay close attention to conditional statements and consider their contrapositives.**\n3.  **Consider all possibilities that do not contradict the given information.**\n4.  **Eliminate options that directly contradict any of the statements.**\n5.  **Choose the option that remains possible based on the analysis.**\n## General Advice\n*   **Break down complex logical problems into smaller, manageable pieces.**\n*   **Focus on the relationships between individuals or elements based on the given statements.**\n*   **Be aware of common logical fallacies and avoid making assumptions not supported by the information provided.**\n*   **Practice with various logic problems to improve your reasoning and analytical skills.** \n"
