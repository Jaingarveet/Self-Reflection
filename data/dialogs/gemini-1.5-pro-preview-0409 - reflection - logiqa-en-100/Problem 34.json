Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "## Reflection on Incorrect Answer\n**Explanation:** My error stemmed from misinterpreting the logical relationship between the original statement and option B. I focused on the negative framing of the original statement (\"Do not do...\"), failing to recognize the positive implication within option B (\"If you want, then give...\").\n**Error Keywords:**\n*   Logical reasoning error\n*   Misinterpretation of implication\n*   Negation bias\n## Step-by-Step Solution\n1.  **Analyze the original statement:** Confucius advises against doing things to others that you wouldn't want done to yourself. This implies a principle of empathy and reciprocity.\n2.  **Evaluate option B:** \"If you want, then give it to others.\" This statement suggests a positive action (giving) based on one's own desires. \n3.  **Compare the statements:** While the original statement focuses on avoiding negative actions, option B promotes positive actions based on personal desires. This positive action doesn't necessarily contradict the principle of avoiding unwanted actions towards others. \n4.  **Identify the discrepancy:** Option B doesn't directly address the concept of considering others' desires before acting, which is the core message of the original statement.\n## Instructions for Future Problem Solving\n1.  **Identify the core message:**  Carefully analyze the original statement to understand its central theme and implications.\n2.  **Analyze each option:** Evaluate each option independently, focusing on its logical relationship to the original statement.\n3.  **Consider different perspectives:**  Think about both the positive and negative implications of the original statement and each option.\n4.  **Look for contradictions or inconsistencies:** Identify any options that contradict or deviate from the core message of the original statement.\n## General Advice for Similar Problems\n*   **Practice active reading:** Pay close attention to the wording and structure of logical statements.\n*   **Identify logical relationships:** Understand different types of logical connections, such as implications, contradictions, and equivalences.\n*   **Consider multiple interpretations:** Be aware of potential biases and avoid jumping to conclusions.\n*   **Break down complex statements:** Analyze complex statements step-by-step to understand their components and logical flow. \n*   **Practice with various examples:**  Engage with different types of logic problems to improve your reasoning skills. \n"
