Let's analyze each option:\n*   Proline and Lysine: Both require aminoacyl-tRNA for incorporation into polypeptide chains during translation.\n*   Hydroxylysine: This is a post-translationally modified form of lysine, meaning it's modified after being incorporated into a protein. Thus, it doesn't require aminoacyl-tRNA directly.\n*   Methionine: It's the start codon for protein synthesis and requires aminoacyl-tRNA.\nAction: Answer(\"C\") \n"
