Here is my reflection:\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Acids\n* Pepsin\n* Digestive juices\n\nAfter reviewing the question, I understand that the correct answer is (C) the breakdown of food substances by digestive juices. This is a physical change that occurs during the process of digestion, as the digestive juices break down the food into smaller molecules that can be absorbed by the body.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) the breakdown of food substances by digestive juices."
