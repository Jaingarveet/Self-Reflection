What then is the length of the space shuttle?\nChoices:\n  A: 50 m\n  B: 75 m\n  C: 100 m\n  D: 125 m\n  E: 150 m\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI correctly calculated the speed of the space shuttle and the distance it covers in 5 seconds. However, I made an error in calculating the length of the space shuttle. I added the distance covered in 5 seconds to the distance traveled in 40 seconds instead of adding it to the length of the space shuttle.\n"
