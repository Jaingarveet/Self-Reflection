The primary modality of treatment is :\nChoices:\n  A: Radiotherapy\n  B: Chemotherapy\n  C: Surgery\n  D: Suppoive treatment\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI incorrectly assumed that the presence of two tumor nodules automatically meant stage III or IV disease where surgery would not be the primary treatment. However, I failed to consider that both nodules are in the same lung and could potentially be resected together if there is no distant spread.\n"
