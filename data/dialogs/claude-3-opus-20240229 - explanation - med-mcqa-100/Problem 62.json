While the isthmus is indeed narrow, I failed to consider that the interstitial portion, which passes through the uterine wall, is even narrower. My knowledge gap was in the relative sizes of the different segments of the uterine tube.\n"

Let's think through this step-by-step:\nThe uterine tube has four main segments:\n1. Infundibulum - the funnel-shaped distal end near the ovary\n2. Ampulla - the widest and longest part \n3. Isthmus - the narrow portion proximal to the ampulla\n4. Interstitial - the segment that passes through the uterine wall to enter the uterine cavity\nThe interstitial portion has the smallest diameter as it traverses the muscular uterine wall. It is narrower than the isthmus.\nTherefore, the narrowest part of the uterine tube is the interstitial portion.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
