From the explanation, I know that spring catarrh involves a Type I (IgE-mediated) hypersensitivity reaction. This is consistent with it being an allergic condition.\n3. The explanation also points out that I was incorrect about the involvement of a Type IV hypersensitivity reaction. So spring catarrh does not involve Type IV hypersensitivity.\n4. None of the other types of hypersensitivity reactions (II, III, or V) are mentioned as being involved.\n5. Therefore, the correct answer must only include Type I hypersensitivity, without any other types.\n6. Looking at the answer choices, only choice A fits this criteria, as it only lists one type (Type I).\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
