My reasoning about the liver being a good site for transplantation was sound, but I failed to distinguish between the liver parenchyma and the portal vein that supplies it. The key fact I was missing is that the cells are introduced into the portal vein, not directly into the liver tissue.\n"

Islet cells are normally found in the pancreas, where they produce insulin. \n2. In patients with diabetes, these cells are dysfunctional or destroyed.\n3. Islet cell transplantation aims to restore insulin production by introducing healthy islet cells.\n4. The transplanted cells need a good blood supply to survive and function.\n5. The portal vein carries blood from the intestines to the liver.\n6. By injecting the islet cells into the portal vein, they will be carried to and dispersed throughout the liver.\n7. The highly vascularized liver provides an ideal environment for the islet cells to engraft and function.\nTherefore, the correct answer is that in islet cell transplantation, the cells are injected into the portal vein, not directly into the liver tissue, skin, or pelvis.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
