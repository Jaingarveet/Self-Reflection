        "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n1. The axillary artery is divided into three parts based on its relationship to the pectoralis minor muscle. The second part lies deep to the pectoralis minor.\n2. If the second part is obstructed, blood supply to the upper limb must come from anastomoses proximal and distal to the obstruction.\n3. Looking at the choices, the suprascapular artery and the deep branch of transverse cervical artery arise proximal to the second part of the axillary artery. \n4. The subscapular artery arises from the third part of axillary artery, distal to the obstruction. It anastomoses with the suprascapular and transverse cervical arteries.\n5. Therefore, the anastomosis between the suprascapular & deep branch of transverse cervical arteries proximally, and the subscapular artery distally, will maintain blood supply to the upper limb if the second part of the axillary artery is obstructed.\n6. This matches with choice A.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
