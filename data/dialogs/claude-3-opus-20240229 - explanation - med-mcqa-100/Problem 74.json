There is no change in voice of the patient. Which of the following nerve is most likely injured during surgery?\nChoices:\n  A: Vagus nerve\n  B: Glossopharyngeal nerve\n  C: SLN nerve\n  D: RLN nerve\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI incorrectly focused on the glossopharyngeal nerve's role in the swallowing reflex and overlooked the importance of the superior laryngeal nerve (SLN) in protecting the airway during swallowing. While the glossopharyngeal nerve is crucial for initiating the swallowing reflex, the SLN plays a vital role in preventing aspiration by causing the larynx to close during swallowing.\n"

        "content": "Let's think through this step-by-step:\n1. The patient underwent lateral skull base surgery and now has recurrent aspirations, suggesting a problem with the swallowing mechanism.\n2. The voice is unchanged, indicating the recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) is likely intact, as RLN injury would cause hoarseness or voice changes. So we can rule out choice D.\n3. The glossopharyngeal nerve initiates the swallowing reflex, but injury to it alone would not typically cause aspiration. It's more involved in the oral phase of swallowing.\n4. The vagus nerve contains both the superior laryngeal nerve (SLN) and RLN branches. While the RLN controls vocal cord movement, the SLN provides sensory innervation to the larynx and is crucial for airway protection during swallowing.\n5. SLN injury can impair the closure of the larynx during swallowing, leading to aspiration without affecting voice.\nTherefore, the most likely nerve injured during the lateral skull base surgery, causing aspiration without voice changes, is the superior laryngeal nerve (SLN).\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
