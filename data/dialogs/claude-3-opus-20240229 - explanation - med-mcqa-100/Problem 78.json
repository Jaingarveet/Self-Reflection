As I reflect on my previous incorrect answer, I realize I need to trace the facial artery more distally to its terminal branches to determine what it anastomoses with.\n3. The facial artery passes deep to the zygomaticus major and minor muscles and ascends along the side of the nose. \n4. Near the medial angle of the eye, the facial artery terminates by anastomosing with the dorsal nasal branch of the ophthalmic artery.\n5. The ophthalmic artery is a branch of the internal carotid artery that supplies the eye and other orbital structures.\nTherefore, the correct answer is that the facial artery terminates by anastomosing with a branch of the ophthalmic artery.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
