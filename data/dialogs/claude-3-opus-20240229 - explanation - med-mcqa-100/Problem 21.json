However, it is actually Plasmodium malariae, the parasite responsible for quartan malaria, that has a greater affinity for older, senescent red blood cells. My knowledge gap was in the specific red blood cell preferences of different malaria parasites.\n"

Let's think through this step-by-step:\n- Senescent red blood cells are older red blood cells nearing the end of their lifespan.\n- Different species of Plasmodium parasites that cause malaria have varying preferences for which red blood cells they invade. \n- Plasmodium vivax and ovale tend to infect younger red blood cells.\n- Plasmodium falciparum can infect red blood cells of all ages.\n- However, it is Plasmodium malariae, the parasite causing quartan malaria, that has the greatest affinity for senescent, older red blood cells.\nTherefore, the correct answer is that senescent red blood cells are mainly attacked in quartan malaria, caused by Plasmodium malariae.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
