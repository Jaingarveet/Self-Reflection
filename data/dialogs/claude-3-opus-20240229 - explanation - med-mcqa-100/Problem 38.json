While posterior urethral valves can cause urinary obstruction, the \"cobra head\" sign is actually more characteristic of ureteroceles. I confused the radiologic appearance of these two conditions.\n"

        "content": "You're right, I made an error in my previous attempt at this question. Let me think through it again carefully.\nThe \"cobra head\" sign refers to the appearance on imaging studies like a voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG). It describes the way a ureterocele can look - the dilated distal ureter behind the obstructing ureterocele in the bladder has a cobra head-like appearance.\nRectoceles are herniation of the rectum into the vagina and would not have this appearance. Posterior urethral valves can cause urinary obstruction but do not typically demonstrate a \"cobra head\" sign. And bladder tumors would have a mass in the bladder but not this specific dilated distal ureteral appearance.\nTherefore, the correct answer must be:\nAction: Answer(\"B\")\nThe \"cobra head\" sign is characteristically seen with ureteroceles on imaging studies like a VCUG. Thank you for prompting me to reconsider and correct my previous error."
