I thought that CT scan was the most appropriate choice, but I failed to consider the fact that UGI series is more commonly used as a first-line imaging modality for pyloric stenosis. UGI series is a better choice because it can show the narrowing of the pylorus and rule out other conditions such as ulcers or tumors. It is also less invasive and less expensive than other imaging modalities. Therefore, the correct answer is B: UGI series."
