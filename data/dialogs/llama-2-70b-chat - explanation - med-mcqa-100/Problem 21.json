However, \"senescent RBCs\" actually refers to red blood cells that are near the end of their lifespan and are more prone to being attacked by the immune system.\n\nThe correct answer is C: Falciparum malaria, as this species of malaria parasite is known to attack and infect senescent red blood cells.\n\nI have taken the time to reflect on my mistake and have reviewed the relevant information to ensure that I understand the concept correctly. I am confident that my answer this time is correct."
