        "content": "  Action: Answer(\"B\")\n\nExplanation:\nI incorrectly answered the question because I overlooked the possibility of placenta previa, which can also cause an unstable lie. I focused too much on the patient's history of previous normal deliveries, which led me to dismiss option B (placenta previa). However, placenta previa can occur in any pregnancy, regardless of the patient's history. Therefore, it is important to consider all options carefully and not make assumptions based on the patient's history.\n\nOn reflection, I realized that option B (placenta previa) is a possible cause of an unstable lie at 34 weeks in a multigravida patient, and it should have been my first choice. I should have considered the patient's symptoms and the possibility of placenta previa, rather than relying solely on her history of previous normal deliveries.\n\nIn conclusion, I have learned to be more thorough in my assessment and consider all options carefully, rather than making assumptions based on the patient's history. This will help me provide better care for my patients and avoid similar mistakes in the future."
