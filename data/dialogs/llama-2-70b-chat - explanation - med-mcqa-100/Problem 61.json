However, newborns have a different pattern of seizure activity, and the most common type of seizure in this age group is actually subtle seizures. Subtle seizures are characterized by a brief, subtle change in the newborn's behavior or movement, such as a pause in breathing, a brief tremor, or a change in muscle tone. They can be easily missed, and it is important for healthcare providers to be vigilant in monitoring newborns for these types of seizures."
