I knew that sugilation had something to do with the appearance of blood in the skin, but I didn't know the correct term. After reviewing the information, I realized that sugilation refers to the bluish discoloration of the skin that occurs when blood pools in the skin due to gravity. This discoloration can be seen in the skin of a deceased person, especially in the face and extremities. Therefore, the correct answer is \"C: Algor mortis.\" I will make sure to remember this distinction in the future."
