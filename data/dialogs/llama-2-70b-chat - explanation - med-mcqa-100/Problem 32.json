Rhinoscleroma is a chronic granulomatous disease that affects the nasal passages and can cause nasal obstruction and discharge, which may be blood-tinged. The biopsy finding of a granuloma with multinucleated giant cells is consistent with Rhinoscleroma.\n\nI was previously unfamiliar with the term \"Rhinoscleroma,\" which led to my incorrect diagnosis. However, upon reflection, I have learned that it is a rare condition that can cause nasal symptoms and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of nasal granulomas.\n\nI also realize that I should have been more thorough in my initial response and provided more information about Rhinoscleroma, such as its etiology, symptoms, and treatment options.\n\nIn summary, my diagnosis for the 60-year-old male with right-sided nasal obstruction and nasal discharge, which sometimes is blood-tinged, is Rhinoscleroma."
