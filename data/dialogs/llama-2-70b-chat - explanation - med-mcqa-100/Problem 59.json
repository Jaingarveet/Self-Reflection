I mistakenly believed that situs inversus was a feature of Kaagener's syndrome. However, situs inversus is actually a congenital condition where organs are reversed or mirrored from their normal positions in the body. It can occur independently or as part of other genetic syndromes, but it is not a feature of Kaagener's syndrome.\n\nKaagener's syndrome, also known as ciliary dyskinesia, is a rare genetic disorder that affects the structure and function of cilia, which are tiny hair-like structures found in various parts of the body, including the respiratory and digestive systems. The main features of Kaagener's syndrome include ciliary dyskinesia, bronchiectasis, and pancreatic insufficiency. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) Situs inversus."
