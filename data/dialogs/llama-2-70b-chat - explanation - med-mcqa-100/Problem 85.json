I knew that keratoderma blenorrhagica is a condition that affects people with psoriasis, but I mistakenly thought it was a symptom of psoriatic arthritis, rather than reactive arthritis.\n\nHowever, after reflecting on the problem and the correct answer, I realized that keratoderma blenorrhagica is actually associated with reactive arthritis, which is a type of arthritis that develops in response to an infection. People with psoriasis are at increased risk of developing reactive arthritis, and keratoderma blenorrhagica is a common symptom of this condition.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer for the question \"Keratoderma blenorrhagica is seen in:\" is option C, Reactive arthritis. I have learned from my mistake and will be more careful in my analysis of similar questions in the future."
