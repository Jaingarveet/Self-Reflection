I was not familiar with the term \"duct papilloma\" and its association with nipple discharge. However, after reflecting on the problem and the correct answer, I realized that duct papilloma is indeed the most common cause of blood discharge from the nipple. It is a benign tumor that arises from the lactiferous ducts and can cause nipple discharge, which may be clear, yellowish, or blood-stained. Duct carcinoma, chronic cystic mastitis, and cystosarcoma phyllodes can also cause nipple discharge, but they are less common causes compared to duct papilloma. Therefore, the correct answer is B: Duct papilloma."
