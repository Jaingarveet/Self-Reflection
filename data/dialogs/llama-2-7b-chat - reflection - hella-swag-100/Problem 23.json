Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

[step] Treating the ink stain immediately will make removing the stain much easier. If the ink stain is recent and hasn't set into the material, blot the ink stain with a cloth or paper towel before using any cleaning method.\nChoices:\n  A: [substeps] The ink stain is shallow and should be gradually removed. Blotting towels and paper towels will not get the ink stain out.\n  B: [title] Place a first-aid kit inside a size-appropriate bag. [step] If ink stain removers are not readily available on shelves, store your cheap silk dress inside a larger bag or in a bag with an elastic top.\n  C: [substeps] If you have any paper towels you can use, as well as the paper towel, blotting on the stain. The blot won't remove the ink stain, but it will prevent the ink from collecting.\n  D: Blotting the stain will absorb the excess ink from the dress so that the stain is easier to remove.
