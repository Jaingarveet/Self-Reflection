[step] The type of tip you choose will change the style of the frosting. For example, a wilton 2d closed star tip creates a ruffled appearance in the frosting.\nChoices:\n  A: A trough tip is best for decorating tall pipe cupcakes. [substeps] The tip, although relatively chewy, may be more stiff.\n  B: If you prefer a slightly more conspicuous overall appearance, you can have multiple different cupcake designs in one shot before using one cupcake. [substeps] The width of the top of one cupcake corresponds to the width of the other cupcake base.\n  C: Whereas a wilton 1 m open star tip will give you a smoother look. However, the choice is up to you! [substeps] You can also use a coupler, which allows you to change out the frosting tip without having to use a new piping bag.\n  D: For a french flair, use a lighter variety with a larger tip. Start at the bottom, then work your way up to the top.\n\n Thought: \nThe most likely completion to the text is option B: \"If you prefer a slightly more conspicuous overall appearance, you can have multiple different cupcake designs in one shot before using one cupcake.\"\n\nExplanation: The text describes the different types of frosting tips and their effects on the appearance of the frosting.
