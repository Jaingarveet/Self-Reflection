[step] You will need six to eight sheets of craft paper to make the dreidels. Pick craft paper that has an interesting design, such as hebrew letters, or a plain design if you are planning on decorating the dreidels later.\nChoices:\n  A: Go for paper that is thick and durable as you will be gluing them together. [substeps] You can also use colored craft paper in a certain color scheme, such as blue and yellow, if you do not plan on decorating them later.\n  B: [substeps] Choose paper that has no patterns or embellishments. You want the paper to be smooth and no hairs or wrinkles are present.\n  C: [substeps] Craft paper typically comes in multiple shapes and colors. If your craft paper has one shape, like blossoms, flowers, animals, and designs, choose an array to paint the dreidels on.\n  D: You may wish to make your garland smaller based on how strong the paper is, or you may use more narrow representations such as images, writing utensils or sequins. [substeps] If you plan on making the garland from scratch, craft paper is preferred.\n\n Thought: The most likely completion to the text is B: Choose paper that has no patterns or embellishments.\n\nThe text states that the paper should be smooth and free of hairs or wrinkles, which suggests that paper with patterns or embellishments may not be suitable for the project.
