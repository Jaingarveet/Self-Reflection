Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

Here's a breakdown of why you chose the correct answer:\n\nYou recognized that the text describes the classic pasteurella infection discharge in rabbits as a thick, creamy white discharge from the nostrils. You then eliminated options A and C, which do not match this description. You also eliminated option B, which mentions a yellow or reddish colored discharge that does not appear bloody, warm to the touch, or foul smelling. This leaves option D, which mentions the discharge can be anything from watery to white to yellow, but does not provide any specific information about the color or consistency of the discharge.\n\nOverall, your reasoning and decision-making were spot on, and you correctly identified the most likely completion to the text. Great job!"
