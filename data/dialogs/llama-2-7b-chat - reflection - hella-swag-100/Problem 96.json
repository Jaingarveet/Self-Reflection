Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

[step] Biennials should be planted in the late spring or early summer to avoid early flowering from exposure to cold temperatures. If the plants flower during the first year, it is likely because they were exposed to frost.\nChoices:\n  A: [substeps] While waiting to plant, store the vegetable seeds in bags in a warm, dry location. In colder climates, you can get a head start by planting the seeds indoors, and then moving them outside when the weather improves.\n  B: Varieties that do not flower then will flower later. [substeps] Before planting your vegetables in april or june, begin checking them every second day to make sure the soil is even.\n  C: During the growing season, using a frost rake every six to seven weeks is ideal. [substeps] Rows should be spaced with patches of grass spaced about two or three feet apart, and that grass should fall between 12-12 inches (30-61 cm) in length.\n  D: [substeps] If your plants are grown in the late spring or summer, wait for a temperature that's between 30 and 35 degrees fahrenheit (4 to 5 degrees celsius) for the ripen phase to improve growth.
