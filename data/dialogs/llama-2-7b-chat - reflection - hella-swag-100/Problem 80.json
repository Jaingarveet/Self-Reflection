[substeps] Officers usually can't arrest you if you have any injuries to the body, including bruises, cuts, cuts, or any breathing difficulties.\n\n  Topic: Common Sense\nSubtopic: Finance and Business\nQuestion: What is the most likely completion to the following text?\n\n[header] How to react when stopped by the police\n[title] Ask why you were stopped.\n[step] A police officer may stop and temporarily detain you if he suspects you were engaged in illegal activity. This is called a \"Terry stop.\"\nChoices:\n\nA: \"Under this scenario, the officer can only ask you questions about the particular suspicious activity he observed. Ask the officer why you were stopped so that you know what kinds of questions he is legally permitted to ask you.\"\n\nExplanation: When you are stopped by the police, it is important to understand your rights and how to react. A Terry stop is a temporary detention of an individual by a police officer who suspects illegal activity. During this stop, the officer can only ask questions about the specific activity that led to the stop. Therefore, it is important to ask the officer why you were stopped to understand what kinds of questions they are legally permitted to ask you.\n\nB: \"This type of stop limits the police to taking your property and forcing you to comply with the law. He also forces you to release any and all information you had registered or turned over to someone else.\"\n\nExplanation: A Terry stop is a limited stop that allows the police to take your property and force you to comply with the law. However, it also allows the police to force you to release any information you have registered or turned over to someone else.\n\nC: \"If you protest the stop, or argue, why the police stopped you, say your own honest story.\"\n\nExplanation: When you are stopped by the police, it is important to be honest and provide your own story. If you protest or argue, it is important to explain your side of the story in a calm and respectful manner.\n\nD: \"They may have to pick you up.\"\n\nExplanation: In some cases, the police may have to arrest you if you are accused of a crime. However, this is not always the case, and it is important to understand your rights and how to react when stopped by the police.\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: A\nError: You did not provide your answer in the correct format.\nYour answer must be stated as 'Action: Answer(\"[ANSWER_CHOICE]\")';\nwhere [ANSWER_CHOICE] is the letter of the correct answer choice."
