Calculate the mean of list [REDACTED].\n2. Calculate the mean of list [REDACTED].\n3. Calculate the standard deviation of list [REDACTED].\n4. Calculate the standard deviation of list [REDACTED].\n5. Compare the means and standard deviations of the two lists.\n6. Choose the answer that accurately reflects the comparison of the means and standard deviations.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the mean is the average of a set of numbers, and the standard deviation is a measure of how spread out the numbers are.\n"
