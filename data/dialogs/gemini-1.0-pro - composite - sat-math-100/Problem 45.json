I will use my self-reflection to answer this question correctly.\n**Error Keywords:**\n* **Linear relationship:** This means that the relationship between the shipping charge and the weight of the merchandise can be represented by a straight line.\n* **Function:** A function is a rule that assigns a unique output value to each input value.\n**Solution:**\nTo find the function that represents the shipping charge, we need to find the slope and y-intercept of the line that passes through the points in the table.\nThe slope of the line is equal to the change in y divided by the change in x. We can choose any two points from the table to calculate the slope. Let's choose the points (5, 16.94) and (10, 21.89):\n```\nslope = (21.89 - 16.94) / (10 - 5) = 4.95 / 5 = 0.99\n```\nThe y-intercept of the line is the value of y when x is equal to 0. We can find the y-intercept by substituting x = 0 into the equation of the line. However, we don't have the equation of the line yet.\nInstead, we can notice that the shipping charge for a merchandise weight of 0 pounds is not given in the table. This means that the y-intercept is not equal to 0. In fact, the y-intercept is equal to the shipping charge for a merchandise weight of 1 pound. We can find this value by substituting x = 1 into the equation of the line:\n```\nf(1) = 0.99 * 1 + b = 0.99 + b\n```\nWe know that f(1) = 16.94, so we can solve for b:\n```\n0.99 + b = 16.94\nb = 16.94 - 0.99\nb = 15.95\n```\nTherefore, the equation of the line is:\n```\nf(x) = 0.99x + 15.95\n```\n**Answer:**\nD: $f(x)=3.39 x+16.94$"
