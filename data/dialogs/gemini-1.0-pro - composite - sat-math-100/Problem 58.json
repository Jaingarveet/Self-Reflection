Identify the solution point $(x,y)$.\n2. Substitute the solution point into each inequality.\n3. Simplify each inequality to determine the conditions on $a$ and $b$.\n4. Compare the conditions on $a$ and $b$ to determine their relative values.\n5. Choose the answer that reflects the correct relationship between $a$ and $b$.\nAdvice:\n - Always consider the solution point in the context of the entire problem.\n - Pay attention to the relative values of variables, not just their individual signs.\n - Carefully interpret the conditions imposed by inequalities.\n - Double-check your reasoning and conclusions before selecting an answer.\n - Remember that the solution point must satisfy all inequalities in the system.\n"
