Some values of $x$ and $f(x)$ are shown in the table above. Which of the following must be a factor of $f(x)$ ?\nChoices:\n  A: $x-2$\n  B: $x-3$\n  C: $x-4$\n  D: $x-5$\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI incorrectly assumed that the function $f(x)$ was defined by a polynomial. \nThe gap in my knowledge was not in the concept of factors but in the understanding of the problem statement. \nI did not recognize that the function $f(x)$ could be any function, not necessarily a polynomial.\nError Keywords:\n - Misunderstanding the problem statement\n - Incorrect assumption about the function type\n - Ignoring the possibility of non-polynomial functions\nSolution:\nThe function $f(x)$ is defined by a polynomial.\nThe table shows that $f(4)=0$.\nTherefore, [REDACTED] must be a factor of $f(x)$.\nInstructions:\n1. Read the problem statement carefully and understand the context.\n2. Identify the type of function $f(x)$ is defined as.\n3. Analyze the given information about the function $f(x)$.\n4. Look for patterns or relationships in the given information.\n5. Use the given information to identify potential factors of $f(x)$.\n6. Verify that the identified factors are indeed factors of $f(x)$.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the problem statement carefully and understand the context.\n - Do not make assumptions about the problem or the information provided.\n - Consider all possibilities and explore different approaches.\n - Be open to different types of functions and mathematical concepts.\n - Double-check your understanding and reasoning before reaching a conclusion.\n"
