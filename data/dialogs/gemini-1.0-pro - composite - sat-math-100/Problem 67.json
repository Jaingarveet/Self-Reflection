Identify the center of the circle.\n2. Calculate the radius of the circle using the distance formula.\n3. Substitute the center and radius into the equation of a circle.\n4. Simplify the equation.\n5. Choose the answer that matches your calculated equation.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always identify the key elements of the problem, such as the center and radius of the circle.\n - Always use the correct formulas and equations.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the equation of a circle with center $(h,k)$ and radius $r$ is $(x-h)^2+(y-k)^2=r^2$.\n"
