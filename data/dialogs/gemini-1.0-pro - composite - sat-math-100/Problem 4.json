Therefore, we have:\n```\n0 = (32 - k) / (k - 2)\n```\nSolving for k, we get:\n```\nk = 32\n```\n**Instructions:**\n* Carefully read the question and identify the key information.\n* Apply the relevant formula or concept to solve the problem.\n* Check your answer to ensure it is consistent with the given information.\n**Advice:**\n* Pay attention to details and avoid making careless mistakes.\n* Double-check your calculations and reasoning.\n* Learn from your mistakes and use them to improve your understanding.\n**Action:** Answer(\"D\")"
