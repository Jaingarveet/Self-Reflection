Identify the type of glycolysis being asked about (anaerobic or aerobic).\n2. Recall the end products of anaerobic glycolysis.\n3. Double-check that the end products are specific to anaerobic glycolysis.\n4. Choose the answer that matches the correct end products.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your answer against your knowledge of the topic.\n - Remember that anaerobic glycolysis and aerobic glycolysis have different end products.\n"
