Identify the growth rate per year.\n2. Identify the number of years.\n3. Multiply the growth rate per year by the number of years.\n4. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n5. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n6. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\n\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them.\n - Always pay attention to the units of measurement in the question and answer choices.\n"
