X; Production Department? F, I, W; Sales Department? G, H, Y\n\nHowever, this choice is still incorrect because H and Y are not in the same department.\nTherefore, I must have made a mistake in my reasoning.\n\nLet's go back to the point where I allocated W to the production department.\nIf W is allocated to the production department, then X cannot be allocated to the sales department because there would be no spot left for W in the production department (condition 3).\nTherefore, X must be allocated to the public relations department.\n\nIf X is allocated to the public relations department, then the remaining spot in the public relations department must be filled by W.\nTherefore, the public relations department consists of H, Y, and W.\n\nSince F is in the production department, the remaining spots in the production department must be filled by G and I.\nHowever, G cannot be in the production department because of condition (2).\nTherefore, the production department consists of F, H, and Y (since H and Y must be in the same department).\n\nSince G is not in the production department, G must be in the sales department.\nThe remaining spots in the sales department must be filled by I and W (if W is not in the public relations department).\nHowever, W is already in the public relations department.\nTherefore, the sales department consists of G, I, and another employee who cannot be F, G, H, Y, or W.\nThe only remaining employee is X.\n\nTherefore, the final distribution of these 7 employees is:\nPublic Relations Department: H, Y, W\nProduction Department: F, H, Y\nSales Department: G, I, X\n\nThe only choice that matches this distribution is:\nA: Public Relations Department?
