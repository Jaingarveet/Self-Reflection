Most people think that advertisers do whatever they can to attract customers.But advertisers are not always like this.Recently, in order to expand sales, a family magazine called \"Bay\" was renamed \"Inferno\", which mainly published violent and pornographic content.As a result, some perennial advertisers from the original \"Bay\" magazine refused to renew the contract and turned to other publications.This shows that these advertisers not only consider economic benefits, but also take into account their ethical responsibilities.\nQuestion: If the following items are true, they can weaken the above argument, except\nChoices:\n  A: The violent and pornographic content published in Purgatory magazine is more moderate in similar magazines.\n  B: Magazines that publish violent and pornographic content usually sell well, but have low credibility.\n  C: The above-mentioned advertisers who refused to renew their contracts mainly promoted household goods.\n  D: The advertising cost of the purgatory magazine after the name change is several times higher than before the name change.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nNo reflection information provided.\n"

However, it doesn't explain why the advertisers left \"Inferno,\" so it doesn't weaken the argument.\n\nOption C: This option provides information about the type of goods the advertisers promote, but it doesn't explain why they left \"Inferno,\" so it doesn't weaken the argument.\n\nOption D: This option suggests that the advertising cost of \"Inferno\" increased significantly after the name change. This could provide an economic reason for the advertisers' decision, which would weaken the argument that they left due to ethical concerns.\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
