The finance department is on the next floor of the planning department.\n3. The administration department is above the planning department but below the human resources department.\n\nLet's try to arrange the departments based on this information.\n\nSince the finance department is next to the planning department, they must be on consecutive floors. The administration department is above the planning department, so it cannot be on the first floor. The human resources department is above the administration department, so it cannot be on the first or second floor.\n\nUsing this information, we can eliminate options C and D because they both have the sales department on the first floor, which would mean it is adjacent to the human resources department, violating the first condition.\n\nNow let's consider options A and B. In option A, the sales department is on the top floor, which means it is not adjacent to the human resources department, satisfying the first condition. The finance department is next to the planning department, satisfying the second condition. The administration department is above the planning department but below the human resources department, satisfying the third condition.\n\nIn option B, the sales department is on the fifth floor, which means it is adjacent to the human resources department, violating the first condition.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option A.\n\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
