Specifically, I overlooked condition (4) that neither P nor K can be in the same team as N, and condition (5) that P cannot be in the same team as Q.\n\nSolution:\nIf H is in Team 2, then Q must be in the middle of Team 1 (condition 6). Since neither P nor K can be in the same team as N (condition 4), and P cannot be in the same team as Q (condition 5), then N must be in the front of Team 1, and P cannot be in Team 1 at all. Since L must be on Team 1 (condition 3), and K must be in the middle if he is scheduled to play (condition 2), then L must be in the back of Team 1. Therefore, the acceptable arrangement for Team 1 is:\n\nFront: N\nMiddle: Q\nBack: L\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
