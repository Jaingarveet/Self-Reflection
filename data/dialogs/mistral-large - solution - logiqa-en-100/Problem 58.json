The assertion is that rising land prices are the chief culprit in soaring housing prices. To doubt this assertion, we need to find evidence that contradicts it or casts doubt on it.\n\nChoice A shows that housing prices increased significantly more than land prices in Shanghai, but the absolute increase in land prices is not provided. This choice does not necessarily doubt the assertion, as the increase in land prices could still be a significant factor in the increase in housing prices.\n\nChoice B shows that housing prices increased significantly more than land prices in Beijing, but the absolute increase in land prices is very small. This choice casts doubt on the assertion that rising land prices are the chief culprit in soaring housing prices, as the increase in land prices is minimal compared to the increase in housing prices.\n\nChoice C is an opinion that supports the assertion. This choice does not doubt the assertion, as it provides a rationale for why rising land prices could lead to soaring housing prices.\n\nChoice D is an opinion that provides an alternative explanation for soaring housing prices. This choice does not necessarily doubt the assertion, as it does not directly contradict it.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
