        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Economics professor: Marty's Pizza and Checkers Pizza are the two major pizza parlors in our town. Marty's sold coupon books including coupons good for one large plain pizza at any local pizza parlor, at Marty's expense. But Checkers refused to accept these coupons, even though they were redeemed by all other local pizza parlors. Accepting them would have cost Checkers nothing and would have satisfied those of its potential customers who had purchased the coupon books. This shows that Checkers's motive in refusing to accept the coupons was simply to hurt Marty's Pizza.\nQuestion: Which one of the following, if assumed, enables the economics professor's conclusion to be properly drawn?\nChoices:\n  A: Any company that refuses to accept coupons issued by a competitor when doing so would satisfy some of the company's potential customers is motivated solely by the desire to hurt that competitor.\n  B: Any company that wishes to hurt a competitor by refusing to accept coupons issued by that competitor will refuse to accept them even when accepting them would cost nothing and would satisfy its potential customers.\n  C: At least one company has refused to accept coupons issued by its major local competitor simply in order to hurt that competitor, even though those coupons were accepted by all other local competitors.\n  D: Any company that accepts its major competitor's coupons helps its competitor by doing so, even if it also satisfies its own actual or potential customers.\n  E: If accepting coupons issued by a competitor would not enable a company to satisfy its actual or potential customers, then that company's refusal to accept the coupons is motivated by the desire to satisfy customers.\n\nTo determine which assumption enables the professor's conclusion, let's break down the argument:\nPremise 1: Marty's Pizza sold coupon books for one large plain pizza, redeemable at any local pizza parlor.\nPremise 2: Checkers Pizza refused to accept these coupons, even though all other local pizza parlors accepted them.\nPremise 3: Accepting the coupons would have cost Checkers nothing and satisfied its potential customers who purchased the coupon books.\nConclusion: Checkers's motive in refusing the coupons was simply to hurt Marty's Pizza.\nThe correct assumption should bridge the gap between the premises and the conclusion, specifically addressing Checkers's motive.\nChoice A is too broad, as it assumes any company refusing competitor coupons is solely motivated by hurting the competitor.\nChoice B is the correct assumption. If a company wants to hurt a competitor by refusing their coupons, they will do so even when accepting them would cost nothing and satisfy potential customers. This directly supports the professor's conclusion about Checkers's motive.\nChoice C provides an example but doesn't necessarily apply to Checkers's specific situation and motive.\nChoice D focuses on the effect of accepting coupons rather than the motive behind refusing them.\nChoice E is irrelevant, as the premise states that accepting the coupons would have satisfied Checkers's potential customers.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: A"

        "content": "Explanation:\nI incorrectly assumed that choice B was the correct answer because it seemed to directly address Checkers's motive for refusing the coupons. However, upon further reflection, I realize that choice B is too specific and doesn't necessarily apply to all situations where a company refuses a competitor's coupons.\nError Keywords:\n - Overly specific assumption\n - Misinterpreting the argument's scope\n - Focusing on irrelevant details\n - Not considering the broader implications\nSolution:\nThe economics professor's argument can be broken down as follows:\nPremise 1: Marty's Pizza sold coupon books for one large plain pizza, redeemable at any local pizza parlor.\nPremise 2: Checkers Pizza refused to accept these coupons, even though all other local pizza parlors accepted them.\nPremise 3: Accepting the coupons would have cost Checkers nothing and satisfied its potential customers who purchased the coupon books.\nConclusion: Checkers's motive in refusing the coupons was simply to hurt Marty's Pizza.\nTo properly draw the conclusion, we need an assumption that connects the premises to the conclusion. Choice A provides this connection by stating that any company refusing competitor coupons when doing so would satisfy potential customers is motivated solely by the desire to hurt that competitor. This assumption allows us to infer Checkers's motive based on the given premises.\nInstructions:\n1. Read the argument carefully and identify the premises and conclusion.\n2. Look for the gap between the premises and the conclusion.\n3. Evaluate each answer choice to determine which one, if assumed, would bridge the gap and enable the conclusion to be properly drawn.\n4. Choose the answer that provides the necessary assumption without being too specific or irrelevant to the argument.\n5. Double-check that the chosen answer, when combined with the premises, logically leads to the conclusion.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the argument carefully and identify the premises and conclusion.\n - Look for the gap between the premises and the conclusion, and focus on finding the assumption that bridges this gap.\n - Be cautious of answer choices that are too specific or irrelevant to the argument's scope.\n - Consider the broader implications of each answer choice and how they relate to the argument as a whole.\n - Double-check your reasoning to ensure that the chosen answer, when combined with the premises, logically leads to the conclusion."
