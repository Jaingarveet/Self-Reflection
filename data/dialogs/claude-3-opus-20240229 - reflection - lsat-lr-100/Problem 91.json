Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6.

        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: People who are allergic to cats are actually allergic to certain proteins found in the animals' skin secretions and saliva; which particular proteins are responsible, however, varies from allergy sufferer to allergy sufferer. Since all cats shed skin and spread saliva around their environment, there is no such thing as a cat incapable of provoking allergic reactions, although it is common for a given cat to cause an allergic reaction in some-but not all-people who are allergic to cats.\nQuestion: Which one of the following statements is most strongly supported by the information above?\nChoices:\n  A: Any particular individual will be allergic to some breeds of cat but not to others.\n  B: No cat is capable of causing an allergic reaction in all types of allergy sufferers.\n  C: Not all cats are identical with respect to the proteins contained in their skin secretions and saliva.\n  D: The allergic reactions of some people who are allergic to cats are more intense than the allergic reactions of other allergy sufferers.\n  E: There is no way to predict whether a given cat will produce an allergic reaction in a particular allergy sufferer.\n\nLet's analyze the choices one by one:\nA: The passage does not suggest that individuals are allergic to specific breeds. It states that the proteins causing allergies vary from person to person.\nB: This is strongly supported. The passage states that a cat may cause allergies in some people but not all, implying no cat causes allergies in everyone.\nC: While this may be true, the passage does not directly state or imply that cats differ in their allergy-causing proteins.\nD: The passage does not compare the intensity of allergic reactions between individuals.\nE: While the passage suggests variability in allergic reactions, it does not state that there is no way to predict them.\nChoice B is most strongly supported by the information provided. The passage clearly states that a cat may cause allergies in some allergy sufferers but not others, meaning no single cat causes allergies in all sufferers.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: C"

        "content": "Explanation:\nI misinterpreted the passage and focused too much on the variability in allergic reactions between individuals. While the passage does support that no cat causes allergies in all sufferers (Choice B), it more directly states that the specific proteins responsible for allergies vary from person to person. This implies that cats must differ in the proteins they produce (Choice C), otherwise the reactions would be the same for everyone. I failed to make this logical connection from the information given.\nError Keywords:\n - Misinterpretation of passage\n - Failure to make logical inference \n - Focusing on secondary information\n - Overlooking key details\nSolution:\nThe passage states that the particular proteins responsible for cat allergies \"varies from allergy sufferer to allergy sufferer.\" For the proteins to vary between sufferers, the proteins themselves must differ between cats. If all cats had identical proteins, the allergic reaction would be the same for everyone. Therefore, the passage implies that not all cats have the same proteins in their skin secretions and saliva (Choice C). While the passage also supports that no cat causes allergies in everyone (Choice B), this is a secondary point compared to the direct implication about differing proteins.\nInstructions:\n1. Read the passage carefully, focusing on the key details and facts presented.\n2. Analyze each answer choice to determine if it is directly supported by the passage.\n3. Look for answer choices that can be logically inferred from the given information, even if not explicitly stated.\n4. Eliminate answer choices that are not supported or are only tangentially related.\n5. Select the answer choice that has the strongest and most direct support from the passage.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the passage closely, highlighting or noting the key facts and details.\n - Focus on what the passage directly states or implies, not just what it suggests or assumes.\n - Look for logical connections and inferences that can be drawn from the given information.\n - Be careful not to choose answers that are only partially supported or are based on information not in the passage.\n - Eliminate answers that are not supported, even if they could be true, and select the one with the strongest direct evidence."
