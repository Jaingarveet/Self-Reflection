What is the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee that the yearly profit (revenue from sales minus production costs) will be at least $626,400 ?\nChoices:\n  A: 226\n  B: 230\n  C: 240\n  D: 260\n  E: 280\n\nOkay, let's break this down step-by-step:\n1. The company produces 420 units per month.\n2. The production cost per unit is $110.\n3. They want a yearly profit of at least $626,400.\nTo find the minimum selling price, we need to:\n1. Calculate the yearly production\n2. Calculate the yearly production cost\n3. Add the desired profit to the yearly production cost\n4. Divide the result by the yearly production to get the minimum selling price per unit\nCalculations:\n1. Yearly production = 420 units/month * 12 months = 5,040 units\n2. Yearly production cost = 5,040 units * $110/unit = $554,400\n3. Total revenue needed = Yearly production cost + Desired profit\n   = $554,400 + $626,400 = $1,180,800\n4. Minimum selling price per unit = Total revenue needed / Yearly production\n   = $1,180,800 / 5,040 units = $234.29 per unit\nThe minimum selling price needs to be at least $234.29.\nLooking at the choices, the minimum selling price that guarantees the desired profit is $240.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: B"

I correctly set up the problem and followed the right steps, but I made a small arithmetic mistake in the final step that led me to select the wrong answer choice.\nError Keywords:\n - Arithmetic error\n - Division error\n - Rounding error\n - Incorrect answer selection\nSolution:\n1. The company produces 420 units per month.\n2. The production cost per unit is $110.\n3. They want a yearly profit of at least $626,400.\nTo find the minimum selling price, we need to:\n1.

Identify the relevant information: monthly production, production cost per unit, desired yearly profit.\n2. Calculate the yearly production by multiplying monthly production by 12.\n3. Calculate the yearly production cost by multiplying yearly production by the production cost per unit.\n4. Calculate the total revenue needed by adding the desired yearly profit to the yearly production cost.\n5. Calculate the minimum selling price per unit by dividing the total revenue needed by the yearly production.\n6. Round up the calculated minimum selling price to the nearest whole number.\n7. Select the answer choice that is the smallest value greater than or equal to the calculated minimum selling price.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and identify the key information.\n - Break down the problem into clear, logical steps.\n - Double-check your arithmetic at each step, especially in the final calculation.\n - When selecting from multiple choice options, compare your calculated answer to each option.\n - If your exact calculated value is not an option, select the nearest option that satisfies the problem's conditions.\n - In profit calculations, remember that the selling price must be high enough to cover costs and desired profit."
