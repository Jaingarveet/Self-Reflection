If these semi circles are cut down what is the area of the remaining paper?\nChoices:\n  A: 8.75\n  B: 8.79\n  C: 8.75\n  D: 8.71\n  E: 8.72\n\nLet's approach this step-by-step:\n1) The paper is a square with side length 20 cm. The area of the square is:\n   \n   Area of square = side × side = 20 × 20 = 400 cm²\n2) Two semicircles are cut out from this square. The diameter of each semicircle is equal to the side of the square, which is 20 cm.

        "content": "Explanation:\nI made an error in my calculation of the remaining area of the paper. I correctly calculated the area of the square and the area of the two semicircles that were cut out. However, when subtracting the area of the semicircles from the area of the square, I forgot to convert the result from square centimeters to square meters. This led me to choose an incorrect answer that was off by a factor of 100.\nError Keywords:\n - Unit conversion error\n - Calculation error\n - Arithmetic error\n - Incorrect result interpretation\nSolution:\n1) The paper is a square with side length 20 cm. The area of the square is:\n   \n   Area of square = side × side = 20 × 20 = 400 cm²\n2) Two semicircles are cut out from this square.

Identify the shape of the paper and its dimensions.\n2. Calculate the area of the paper.\n3. Identify the shape and dimensions of the pieces being cut out.\n4. Calculate the area of the pieces being cut out.\n5. Subtract the area of the cut-out pieces from the area of the paper to find the remaining area.\n6. If necessary, convert the remaining area to the appropriate units to match the answer choices.\n7. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand what is being asked.\n - Identify the shapes involved and their dimensions.\n - Use the appropriate formulas to calculate areas.\n - Pay close attention to the units and convert if necessary.\n - Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n - Carefully compare your result to the answer choices before selecting your answer."
