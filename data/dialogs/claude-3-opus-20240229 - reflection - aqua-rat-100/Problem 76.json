When I substituted n=72 into the expression, I miscalculated 4*√72, which should be approximately 33.9, not 34. This small error propagated through my calculation, leading me to incorrectly conclude that the upper bound for x was 63.64, when in fact it should have been slightly lower.\nError Keywords:\n - Calculation error\n - Square root approximation error\n - Upper bound calculation error\nSolution:\nLet's recalculate the upper bound for x when n=72:\nx = (72^2 + 2*72*√72 + 8*72 + 16) / (72 + 4*√72 + 4)\n  = (5184 + 1224 + 576 + 16) / (72 + 33.9 + 4)\n  = 7000 / 109.9\n  = 63.69\nSo the correct range for x when 36 ≤ n ≤ 72 is:\n31.75 < x < 63.69\nLooking at the choices again, the only one that fits this range is D: 28 < x < 60.\nInstructions:\n1.
