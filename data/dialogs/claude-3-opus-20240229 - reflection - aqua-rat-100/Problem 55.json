Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "Topic: Math\nQuestion: If a man rows at the rate of 4 kmph in still water and his rate against the current is 2 kmph, then the man's rate along the current is:\nChoices:\n  A: 15 kmph\n  B: 6 kmph\n  C: 12 kmph\n  D: 14 kmph\n  E: 6 kmph\n\nLet's approach this step-by-step:\n1. Let the speed of the current be x kmph.\n2. The man's speed in still water is given as 4 kmph.\n3. His speed against the current is given as 2 kmph.\nWe know that when rowing against the current, the effective speed is the difference between the rowing speed and the current speed. So:\n4. Man's speed against current = Man's speed in still water - Current speed\n   2 = 4 - x\n   x = 4 - 2 = 2\nSo, the speed of the current is 2 kmph.\nNow, when rowing along the current, the effective speed is the sum of the rowing speed and the current speed. So:\n5. Man's speed along current = Man's speed in still water + Current speed\n                             = 4 + 2 = 6\nTherefore, the man's speed along the current is 6 kmph.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: E"

        "content": "Explanation:\nI correctly solved the problem and arrived at the right answer of 6 kmph for the man's speed along the current. However, I selected the wrong multiple choice option. The correct answer was listed as both choice B and choice E, but I only selected B and failed to notice that E was also correct.\nError Keywords:\n - Inattention to detail\n - Incomplete answer checking\n - Duplicate correct answer\nSolution:\n1. Let the speed of the current be x kmph.\n2. The man's speed in still water is given as 4 kmph.\n3. His speed against the current is given as 2 kmph.\n4. Man's speed against current = Man's speed in still water - Current speed\n   2 = 4 - x\n   x = 4 - 2 = 2\n   So, the speed of the current is 2 kmph.\n5. Man's speed along current = Man's speed in still water + Current speed \n                             = 4 + 2 = 6\nTherefore, the man's speed along the current is 6 kmph.\nBoth choice B and choice E are 6 kmph, so either B or E is correct.\nInstructions:\n1. Read the question carefully and identify the given information.\n2. Assign variables to unknown quantities.\n3. Set up equations based on the relationships described in the problem.\n4. Solve the equations step-by-step to find the unknown quantities.\n5. Use the solved quantities to calculate the final answer.\n6. Carefully review all the answer choices.\n7. Select all answer choices that match the calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question and answer choices thoroughly. \n - Be aware that there may be multiple correct answer choices.\n - Solve the problem first, then compare your answer to all choices.\n - Select an answer only after checking it matches your solution.\n - If multiple choices match your answer, select them all.\n - Don't assume there is only one right answer without checking."
