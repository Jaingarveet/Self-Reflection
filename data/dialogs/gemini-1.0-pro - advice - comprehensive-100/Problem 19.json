However, upon further reflection, I realized that my answer was based on a misunderstanding of the context. The statement \"money is like dung\" is a metaphor, not a literal statement of fact. Therefore, it cannot be considered false in the same way that a factual statement can be false.\nInstead, the correct answer is option D: \"The words 'Money is like dung' and 'Friends are worth a thousand dollars' are either true or false.\" This is because both statements are subjective and open to interpretation. The truth value of each statement depends on the individual's perspective and values.\nI have learned from this mistake and will be more careful in the future to consider the context and nature of the statements involved in a logical argument. I will also be more mindful of the possibility of metaphorical or subjective statements that may not be amenable to a simple true/false analysis.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
