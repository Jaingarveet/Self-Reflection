This assumption was not explicitly stated in the argument and was not necessary for the argument to be valid.\nThought:\nThe argument states that most Acme employees cannot afford housing within a 30-minute commute of Ocean View. This implies that most Acme employees currently have a commute of less than 30 minutes. Therefore, the argument requires assuming that most Acme employees currently have a commute of less than 30 minutes.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
