This is supported by the fact that both males and females can be affected, and the disease can be passed down from either parent.\n**Reflection:**\n* I need to be more careful in reading the question and answer choices.\n* I should not make assumptions based on limited information.\n* I need to review the inheritance patterns of genetic disorders to ensure accurate responses.\n## Applying Self-Reflection to Current Question\n**Current Question:** What is the mode of inheritance for Hypophosphatemic Vitamin D Resistant Rickets (HVDRR)?\n**Answer Choices:**\n* A: AR\n* B: AD\n* C: XD\n* D: XR\n**Applying Reflection:**\n* I will not assume an X-linked inheritance pattern based on the presence of \"X\" in the answer choices.\n* I will recall that HVDRR is an autosomal dominant disorder.\n**Therefore, the correct answer is:**\n**Action: Answer(\"B\")** \n"
