K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.\nQuestion: If G is placed on the top shelf, then which one of the following could be a complete and accurate list of the books placed on the middle shelf?\nChoices:\n  A: H, I\n  B: I, L\n  C: H, I, L\n  D: I, K, L\n  E: F, I, M\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n- Pay close attention to the wording of each condition and its implications.\n- Avoid making assumptions that are not explicitly stated in the conditions.\n- Consider all possible scenarios and eliminate those that do not meet all requirements.\n- Be systematic in your analysis and reasoning to avoid overlooking any possibilities.\n- Double-check your conclusions to ensure they are consistent with all the given information.\n"

This means that the complete and accurate list of the books placed on the middle shelf could be either:\n**A: H, I**\n**B: I, L**\nAction: Answer(\"A\") or Answer(\"B\")"
