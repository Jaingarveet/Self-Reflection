I only considered the time it takes to travel 700m high.\nTo solve this problem correctly, I need to consider both the time it takes to travel 700m high and the time it takes to pass a point.\nThe time it takes to travel 700m high is 40 seconds.\nThe time it takes to pass a point is 5 seconds.\nTherefore, the total time it takes for the space shuttle to travel 700m high and pass a point is 40 + 5 = 45 seconds.\nThe speed of the space shuttle is 700m / 45 seconds = 15.56 m/s.\nThe length of the space shuttle is the distance it travels in 5 seconds.\nThe distance the space shuttle travels in 5 seconds is 15.56 m/s * 5 seconds = 77.8 m.\nTherefore, the length of the space shuttle is 77.8 m.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
