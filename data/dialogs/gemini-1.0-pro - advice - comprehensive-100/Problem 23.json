Each rider will then test a different one of the bicycles on the second day. Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day. The assignment of riders to bicycles is subject to the following conditions: Reynaldo cannot test F. Yuki cannot test J. Theresa must be one of the testers for H. The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.\nQuestion: Any of the following could be true EXCEPT:\nChoices:\n  A: Reynaldo tests J on the first day.\n  B: Reynaldo tests J on the second day.\n  C: Seamus tests H on the first day.\n  D: Yuki tests H on the first day.\n  E: Yuki tests H on the second day.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n- Pay close attention to all details and constraints in the problem statement.\n- Systematically analyze each option against all constraints to avoid overlooking any violations.\n- Consider creating a table or diagram to visualize the constraints and options.\n- Double-check your analysis to ensure accuracy.\n"
