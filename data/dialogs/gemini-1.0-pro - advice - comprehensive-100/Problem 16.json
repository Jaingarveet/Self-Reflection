I focused too much on the fact that there were 3 tall men and 2 doctors, and I did not pay enough attention to the other clues. For example, I did not consider the fact that Liu Dawei and Li Qiang are the same height, or that Li Qiang and Wang Wei are not both tall.\nTo answer this question correctly, I need to carefully consider all the information provided and use logic to eliminate the options that are not possible.\nHere is my step-by-step solution:\n1. We know that there are 3 tall men, 2 doctors, and 1 handsome man.\n2. We also know that Wang Wei and Wu Gang are both doctors.\n3. Liu Dawei and Li Qiang are the same height.\n4. Li Qiang and Wang Wei are not both tall.\nBased on this information, we can eliminate the following options:\n* **A: Liu Dawei** cannot be the answer because he is not tall.\n* **B: Li Qiang** cannot be the answer because he is not tall.\n* **D: Wang Wei** cannot be the answer because he is not handsome.\nThis leaves us with only one option:\n* **C: Wu Gang** is the only man who meets all of Li Na's requirements. He is tall, handsome, and a doctor.\nTherefore, the answer to the question is **C: Wu Gang**.\nI am confident that this answer is correct because I have carefully considered all the information provided and used logic to eliminate the options that are not possible."
