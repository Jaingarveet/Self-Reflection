I also made a mistake in my calculations.\nTo solve this problem correctly, I need to remember that the slope of a line passing through the origin is always zero. This means that the equation of the line can be written as $y = mx$, where $m$ is the slope.\nSubstituting the coordinates of the two points into this equation, we get:\n$k = 2m$\n$32 = km$\nDividing the second equation by the first equation, we get:\n$16 = k$\nTherefore, the value of $k$ that makes the line pass through the origin is 16.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
