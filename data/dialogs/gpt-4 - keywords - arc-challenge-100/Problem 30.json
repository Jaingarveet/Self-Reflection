This process is known as deposition, which is a type of phase transition. However, deposition is not an option in the choices. The closest option to deposition is sublimation, but sublimation is the transition from solid to gas, not gas to solid. Therefore, the correct answer should be the process where gas turns into a solid or liquid, which is condensation.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
