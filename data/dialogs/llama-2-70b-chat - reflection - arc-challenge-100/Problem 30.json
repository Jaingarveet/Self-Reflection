Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

I thought that the water vapor in the air would condense into liquid water, not realizing that it would actually sublimate (change directly from a gas to a solid) and form frost.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Misunderstanding of condensation\n* Sublimation vs. condensation\n* Water vapor vs. liquid water\n\nSolution:\nWhen moist air comes in contact with a cold surface in the winter, the water vapor in the air changes directly from a gas to a solid, forming frost. This process is called sublimation.\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Recognize that frost forms when moist air meets a cold surface.\n2. Understand that the water vapor in the air sublimates (changes directly from a gas to a solid) to form frost.\n3. Identify the correct answer, \"B: It has sublimated.\"\n\nAdvice:\n\n* Pay attention to the specific process described in the question.\n* Understand the difference between condensation and sublimation.\n* Be careful not to confuse liquid water with water vapor.\n* Double-check your answer by reviewing the process described in the question."
