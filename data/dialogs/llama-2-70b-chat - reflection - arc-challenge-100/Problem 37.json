Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

I thought the question was asking for an example of animal instinct, whereas it was actually asking for an exception.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Misunderstanding the question stem\n* Failure to carefully read the options\n\nSolution:\n\n1. Reread the question stem and ensure understanding.\n2. Carefully read each option and determine if it is an example of animal instinct.\n3. Identify the option that is not an example of animal instinct.\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Read the question stem carefully and ensure understanding.\n2.

Select the remaining option as the answer.\n\nAdvice:\n\n* Always read the question stem carefully and ensure understanding.\n* Evaluate each option carefully and avoid making assumptions.\n* Use the process of elimination to narrow down the options.\n* Double-check your answer to ensure it is correct.\n\nIn this case, the correct answer is \"C: hunting skills\" because hunting skills are not an example of animal instinct. Migrating, hibernating, and building nests are all examples of animal instincts."
