Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "  Explanation:\nI incorrectly answered the question because I confused thermal energy with chemical energy. Thermal energy is a type of kinetic energy, not potential energy. Chemical energy is the potential energy stored in the bonds of atoms and molecules.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Confusion\n* Misclassification\n* Energy types\n\nSolution:\nElisa was classifying types of energy as either potential or kinetic.\nPotential energy is the energy an object has due to its position or state.\nChemical energy is a type of potential energy.\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Review the types of energy: kinetic, potential, sound, radiant, thermal, chemical.\n2. Understand the definition of potential energy: energy an object has due to its position or state.\n3. Identify the type of energy that is stored in the bonds of atoms and molecules: chemical energy.\n4. Choose the answer that matches the correct type of energy: D - chemical energy.\n\nAdvice:\n\n* Always review and understand the concepts before answering a question.\n* Be careful when distinguishing between similar terms, such as thermal and chemical energy.\n* Use a systematic approach to identify the correct answer.\n* Double-check your answer by reviewing the question and the options.\n* Practice, practice, practice to build your knowledge and confidence."
