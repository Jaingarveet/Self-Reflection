Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

However, the question was asking about the physical properties of a small, solid sample of aluminum and a large, liquid sample of aluminum.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Misunderstanding of the term \"sample\"\n* Misconception about the properties of matter\n\nSolution:\nA small, solid sample of aluminum and a large, liquid sample of aluminum both have a definite volume.\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Read the question carefully and understand the terms used.\n2. Identify the physical properties of a small, solid sample of aluminum and a large, liquid sample of aluminum.\n3. Determine which property is common to both samples.\n4. Choose the correct answer based on your analysis.\n\nAdvice:\n\n* Always read the question carefully and understand the terms used.\n* Make sure you understand the properties of matter and their differences in different states.\n* Double-check your answer by reviewing the properties of the samples in question.\n* Remember that a sample can refer to a small portion of a substance, not necessarily the number of atoms it contains."
