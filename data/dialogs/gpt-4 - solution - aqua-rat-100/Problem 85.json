If you walk 10 steps and stop, you reach to the ground in 20 minutes. What is the speed of the elevator?\nChoices:\n  A: 1 step/minute\n  B: 2 step/minute\n  C: 3 step/minute\n  D: 4 step/minute\n  E: None of the above\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\nIn the first scenario, you walk 20 steps and then stop, and the elevator takes 10 minutes to reach the bottom. This means that the remaining steps the elevator travels alone are covered in 10 minutes.\nIn the second scenario, you walk 10 steps and then stop, and the elevator takes 20 minutes to reach the bottom. This means that the remaining steps the elevator travels alone are covered in 20 minutes.\nSince the number of steps you walk changes but the time it takes for the elevator to cover the remaining steps does not, the speed of the elevator is 1 step per minute.\n"
