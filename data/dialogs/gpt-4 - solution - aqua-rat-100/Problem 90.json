If a hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week and pays $210 per week for newspapers, how many newspapers does it buy on Monday?\nChoices:\n  A: 15\n  B: 30\n  C: 45\n  D: 60\n  E: 75\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\nLet's denote the number of newspapers the hotel buys on Monday (and the rest of the weekdays) as x. Then, the hotel buys 2x newspapers on Sunday. \nThe total cost for the newspapers is $210. We know that the cost for the Sunday newspapers is 2x * $4 = $8x and the cost for the newspapers for the rest of the week (Monday to Saturday) is 6x * $1 = $6x. \nSo, we can set up the equation: $8x (for Sunday) + $6x (for Monday to Saturday) = $210. \nFirst, combine like terms: 8x + 6x = 14x.\nThen, divide both sides of the equation by 14 to solve for x: 210 / 14 = [REDACTED].\nSo, the hotel buys [REDACTED] newspapers on Monday.\nAction: Answer(\"[REDACTED]\")\n"
