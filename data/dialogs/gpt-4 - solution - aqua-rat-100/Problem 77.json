So, the 5 consecutive odd numbers would be n-4, n-2, n, n+2, n+4. The sum of these numbers is 5n. This sum divided by 10 should be a perfect square. So, 5n/10 = n/2 should be a perfect square. \nLet's check the options:\n[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]/2 = 23.5, not a perfect square.\n[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]/2 = 45.5, not a perfect square.\n[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]/2 = 20.5, not a perfect square.\n[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]/2 = 33.5, not a perfect square.\n[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] is not an odd number.\nI made a mistake in my calculations. The correct calculation for option [REDACTED] should be:\nFor [REDACTED], the numbers would be 37, 39, [REDACTED], 43, 45. The sum is 205, divided by 10 is 20.5, which is not a perfect square. However, the sum should be divided by 10 to become a perfect square. So, the sum should be 200, not 205. This means the middle number should be 200/5 = 40, not [REDACTED]. So, I made a mistake in my calculations. The correct answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED].\n"
