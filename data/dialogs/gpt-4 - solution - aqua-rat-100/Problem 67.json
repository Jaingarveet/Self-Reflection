Two baguettes contain the same amount of falafel as how many pita breads?\nChoices:\n  A: 12/25\n  B: 3/2\n  C: 3\n  D: 2\n  E: 25/3\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\nFirst, we can set up ratios to represent the relationships between the different types of breads. \nFrom the first sentence, we know that 6 pita breads = [REDACTED] rolls. So, 1 roll = [REDACTED] pita breads.\nFrom the second sentence, we know that [REDACTED] rolls = 5 baguettes. So, 1 baguette = [REDACTED]/5 rolls.\nWe want to find out how many pita breads are in [REDACTED] baguettes. \nSo, [REDACTED] baguettes = [REDACTED] * ([REDACTED]/5 rolls) = 6/5 rolls.\nAnd since 1 roll = [REDACTED] pita breads, 6/5 rolls = 6/5 * [REDACTED] pita breads = 18/5 = [REDACTED].6 pita breads.\nTherefore, [REDACTED] baguettes contain the same amount of falafel as [REDACTED] pita breads.\n"
