Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

Each witness testifies on exactly one day of the hearing. The schedule must meet the following conditions: Franco does not testify on the same day that Garcia testifies. Iturbe testifies on Wednesday. Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday. Hong does not testify on Monday. At least one witness testifies on Monday.\nQuestion: If Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong, which one of the following must be true of the schedule?\nChoices:\n  A: Franco is scheduled to testify on Wednesday.\n  B: Garcia is scheduled to testify on Monday.\n  C: Garcia is scheduled to testify on Wednesday.\n  D: Hong is scheduled to testify on Tuesday.\n  E: Iturbe is the only witness scheduled to testify on Wednesday.\n\nThought:\n*   We know Iturbe testifies on Wednesday and exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.\n*   Since Franco and Hong testify on the same day, and Hong doesn't testify on Monday, they both must testify on Tuesday.\n*   This leaves Garcia and Jackson. Garcia cannot testify with Franco, so Garcia must testify on Monday, leaving Jackson for Wednesday with Iturbe.\nAction: Answer(\"C\") \n\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: D"

        "content": "## Reflection on Incorrect Answer\n**Explanation:** My error stemmed from misinterpreting the constraint \"exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.\" I incorrectly assumed this meant only two witnesses could testify on Tuesday, overlooking the possibility of additional witnesses on Wednesday.\n**Error Keywords:**\n*   Misinterpretation \n*   Assumption error\n*   Constraint violation\n## Step-by-Step Solution\n1.  **Iturbe on Wednesday:** We know Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.\n2.  **Franco and Hong together:** Since Franco and Hong testify on the same day and Hong cannot be on Monday, they must both be on Tuesday.\n3.  **Two on Tuesday fulfilled:** With Franco and Hong on Tuesday, the \"exactly two\" condition for Tuesday is fulfilled. \n4.  **Garcia cannot be with Franco:** Garcia cannot be with Franco, so Garcia must be on Monday (fulfilling the \"at least one witness on Monday\" condition).\n5.  **Jackson on Wednesday:** This leaves Jackson for Wednesday, meaning Iturbe is not the only one on Wednesday.\nTherefore, **Hong must be on Tuesday (Answer D)**. \n## Instructions for Future Similar Problems\n1.  **Identify all constraints:** List all conditions and limitations explicitly stated in the problem.\n2.  **Start with fixed elements:** Begin with information that is definitively placed (like Iturbe on Wednesday).\n3.  **Apply constraints sequentially:** Address each constraint one by one, ensuring each step adheres to all previous conditions.\n4.  **Consider all possibilities:** Don't assume limitations beyond what is explicitly stated (like the \"exactly two\" misinterpretation).\n5.  **Review the final schedule:** Ensure the final arrangement satisfies all given conditions.\n## General Advice for Similar Problems\n*   **Read carefully:** Pay close attention to the wording of each constraint to avoid misinterpretations.\n*   **Be methodical:** Approach the problem systematically, avoiding assumptions and leaps of logic.\n*   **Visualize:** Consider using diagrams or tables to track the placement of elements and visualize the remaining options.\n*   **Check for contradictions:** Ensure no step contradicts a previous condition or established fact. \n*   **Practice:** The more you encounter such problems, the better you'll become at identifying potential pitfalls and applying constraints accurately. \n"
