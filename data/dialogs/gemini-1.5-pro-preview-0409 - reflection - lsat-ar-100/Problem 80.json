Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.

        "content": "## Reflection on Incorrect Answer\n**Explanation:** My error stemmed from misinterpreting the \"greater than\" symbol (>) in the context of parking space numbers. I incorrectly assumed it meant \"assigned a parking space to the right of\" when it actually meant \"assigned a higher-numbered parking space.\"\n**Error Keywords:**\n*   Logical reasoning error\n*   Misinterpretation of symbols \n*   Ordering/comparison error\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n1. **Young > Togowa:** Young must have a higher-numbered space than Togowa.\n2. **Xu > Souza:** Xu must have a higher-numbered space than Souza.\n3. **Robertson > Young:** Robertson must have a higher-numbered space than Young.\n4. **Robertson in #1-#4:** Robertson must be assigned one of the first four spaces.\nAnalyzing options with the correct interpretation:\n*   **A:** Violates Robertson > Young.\n*   **B:** Violates Robertson > Young and Robertson's parking space assignment.\n*   **C:** Violates Robertson > Young.\n*   **D:** Violates Robertson > Young.\n*   **E:**  **Satisfies all conditions.** \n**Instructions for Future Problems:**\n1. **Carefully read and understand the problem:** Pay close attention to the meaning of symbols and keywords.\n2. **Identify all constraints and conditions:** List all the rules and requirements that must be met.\n3. **Analyze each option systematically:** Check each option against all the conditions to ensure it satisfies every requirement.\n4. **Consider alternative interpretations:** If stuck, think about different ways to interpret the language or symbols used in the problem.\n5. **Double-check your reasoning:** Review your thought process and ensure your logic is sound.\n**General Advice for Similar Problems:**\n*   **Break down complex problems:** Divide the problem into smaller, more manageable parts.\n*   **Focus on the details:** Pay attention to specific wording and symbols, as they can significantly impact the solution.\n*   **Think step-by-step:** Avoid jumping to conclusions and work through the problem logically.\n*   **Learn from mistakes:** Analyze your errors to understand where you went wrong and how to avoid similar mistakes in the future. \n*   **Practice regularly:** The more you practice solving problems, the better you will become at identifying and avoiding potential pitfalls. \n"
