Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

Each witness testifies on exactly one day of the hearing. The schedule must meet the following conditions: Franco does not testify on the same day that Garcia testifies. Iturbe testifies on Wednesday. Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday. Hong does not testify on Monday. At least one witness testifies on Monday.\nQuestion: Which one of the following CANNOT be true of the schedule?\nChoices:\n  A: Franco is the only witness scheduled to testify on Monday.\n  B: Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Iturbe.\n  C: Garcia and Hong are both scheduled to testify on Tuesday.\n  D: Garcia is the only witness scheduled to testify on Monday and Hong is one of two witnesses scheduled to testify on Wednesday.\n  E: Jackson is scheduled to testify on Tuesday and two witnesses are scheduled to testify on Monday.\n\nThought:\n*   Iturbe testifies on Wednesday, so options A and C are possible.\n*   Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday, so option E is possible.\n*   If Garcia is the only witness on Monday (option D), then Hong must testify on Tuesday with Jackson, but this contradicts the condition that Franco does not testify on the same day as Garcia. \n*   Therefore, option D cannot be true.\nAction: Answer(\"D\") \n\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: E"

        "content": "## Reflection on Incorrect Answer\n**Explanation:** My reasoning was flawed because I focused on eliminating options based on individual conditions without considering the combined implications of all conditions. I failed to recognize that option E creates a conflict with the requirement of having at least one witness on Monday.\n**Error Keywords:**\n*   Logic error\n*   Reasoning error\n*   Failure to consider all conditions\n## Step-by-Step Solution\n1. **Analyze Conditions:** We know Iturbe is on Wednesday, two witnesses are on Tuesday, Hong is not on Monday, and Franco and Garcia are on different days.\n2. **Evaluate Option E:** If Jackson is on Tuesday and two witnesses are on Monday, then Franco, Garcia, and Hong must be on Monday. This contradicts the condition that Hong cannot be on Monday.\n3. **Conclusion:** Therefore, option E cannot be true. \n## Instructions for Future Problem Solving\n1. **List all conditions:** Clearly write down all given conditions and constraints.\n2. **Analyze each option:** Evaluate each option against all conditions, not just individual ones.\n3. **Consider combinations:** Think about how the conditions interact and create limitations.\n4. **Look for contradictions:** Identify any scenarios that violate the given conditions.\n5. **Eliminate impossible options:** Rule out options that create contradictions.\n## General Advice for Similar Problems\n*   **Read carefully:** Ensure you understand all aspects of the problem and the conditions.\n*   **Think holistically:** Consider the combined effect of all conditions, not just individual ones.\n*   **Visualize:** Use diagrams or tables to represent the problem and explore possibilities.\n*   **Test assumptions:** Don't make assumptions without verifying them against the given information.\n*   **Check for consistency:** Ensure your solution satisfies all conditions and constraints. \n"
