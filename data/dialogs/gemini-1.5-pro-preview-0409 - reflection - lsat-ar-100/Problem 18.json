Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Of the eight students—George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert—in a seminar, exactly six will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.\nQuestion: Which one of the following could be the schedule of the students' reports?\nChoices:\n  A: Mon. morning: Helen; Mon. afternoon: Robert Tues. morning: Olivia; Tues. afternoon: Irving Wed. morning: Lenore; Wed. afternoon: Kyle\n  B: Mon. morning: Irving; Mon. afternoon: Olivia Tues. morning: Helen; Tues. afternoon: Kyle Wed. morning: Nina; Wed. afternoon: Lenore\n  C: Mon. morning: Lenore; Mon. afternoon: Helen Tues. morning: George; Tues. afternoon: Kyle Wed. morning: Robert; Wed. afternoon: Irving\n  D: Mon. morning: Nina; Mon. afternoon: Helen Tues. morning: Robert; Tues. afternoon: Irving Wed. morning: Olivia; Wed. afternoon: Lenore\n  E: Mon. morning: Olivia; Mon. afternoon: Nina Tues. morning: Irving; Tues. afternoon: Helen Wed. morning: Kyle; Wed. afternoon: George\n\nThought:\n*   George must present on Tuesday, eliminating options A, B, and D.\n*   Robert cannot present in the afternoon, eliminating option C. \nAction: Answer(\"E\") \n\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: C"

        "content": "## Reflection on Incorrect Answer\n**Explanation:** My error stemmed from misinterpreting the constraint regarding Nina's report. I focused on eliminating options based on the restrictions for George and Robert but failed to fully consider the implications of Nina's condition.\n**Error Keywords:**\n*   Logical reasoning error\n*   Conditional statement misinterpretation \n*   Failure to consider all constraints\n## Step-by-Step Solution\n1. **George on Tuesday:** Eliminate options A, B, and D as they don't have George presenting on Tuesday.\n2. **Nina's condition:** Analyze the remaining options (C and E) in light of Nina's condition. \n    *   Option C has no conflict. \n    *   Option E has Nina presenting on Monday afternoon, which would require both Helen and Irving to present on Tuesday, violating the condition of only two presentations per day. \n3. **Robert's restriction:** Option C satisfies the condition of Robert not presenting in the afternoon.\nTherefore, the correct schedule is **Option C**.\n## Instructions for Future Problem Solving\n1. **Identify all constraints:** Carefully read and list all conditions and restrictions mentioned in the problem.\n2. **Eliminate options:** Systematically eliminate options that violate any of the listed constraints.\n3. **Analyze remaining options:** For the remaining options, carefully analyze how each constraint applies and ensure all conditions are met.\n4. **Consider conditional statements:** Pay close attention to conditional statements and their implications on the schedule.\n5. **Double-check:** Before finalizing the answer, review the chosen option against all constraints to ensure it satisfies all conditions.\n## General Advice for Similar Problems\n*   **Break down complex problems:** Divide the problem into smaller, manageable parts based on individual constraints.\n*   **Focus on one constraint at a time:** Analyze how each constraint affects the possible solutions before moving on to the next.\n*   **Visualize the problem:** Consider creating a table or diagram to represent the schedule and constraints visually.\n*   **Practice logical reasoning:** Regularly engage in problems that involve logical reasoning and deduction to improve your skills.\n*   **Learn from mistakes:** Reflect on errors and identify areas for improvement to avoid similar mistakes in the future. \n"
