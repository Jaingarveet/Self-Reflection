Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Exactly eight books—F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O—are placed on a bookcase with exactly three shelves—the top shelf, the middle shelf, and the bottom shelf. At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.\nQuestion: Which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: O is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf M is placed on.\n  B: K is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf G is placed on.\n  C: I is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf F is placed on.\n  D: G is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf O is placed on.\n  E: F is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf L is placed on.\n\nThought:\n*   We know there are 3 shelves: Top, Middle, Bottom. \n*   More books are on the Bottom shelf than the Top shelf.\n*   I is on the Middle shelf.\n*   K is above F.\n*   O is above L.\n*   F and M are on the same shelf.\nAnalysis:\n*   **A:** We don't know O's exact position relative to M. \n*   **B:** We don't know G's exact position relative to K.\n*   **C:** Since I is on the Middle shelf, and K is above F, F cannot be on the Top shelf (as that would leave no room for K above it). So, F must be on the Bottom or Middle shelf, both below I. \n*   **D:** We don't know G's exact position relative to O.\n*   **E:** Since O is above L, and F is on the same shelf as M, and there are more books on the Bottom shelf than the Top, F and M must be on the Bottom shelf, placing them above L.\nAction: Answer(\"E\") \n\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: A"

        "content": "## Reflection on Incorrect Answer\n**Explanation:** My error stemmed from misinterpreting the constraint \"More books are on the Bottom shelf than the Top shelf.\" I focused on the number of books per shelf rather than the relative positions of books. This led me to incorrectly place F and M on the bottom shelf, influencing my conclusion about the positions of O and L.\n**Error Keywords:**\n*   Misinterpretation \n*   Constraint misunderstanding\n*   Logical reasoning error\n## Step-by-Step Solution\n1.  **Analyze Constraints:**\n    *   Three shelves: Top, Middle, Bottom.\n    *   I is on the Middle shelf.\n    *   K is above F.\n    *   O is above L.\n    *   F and M are on the same shelf.\n2.  **Deduce Shelf Placement:**\n    *   Since K is above F and I is on the Middle shelf, F cannot be on the Top shelf. Therefore, F and M must be on the **Bottom shelf**.\n    *   Since O is above L and F/M are on the Bottom shelf, O and L must be on the **Top or Middle shelf**.\n3.  **Evaluate Options:**\n    *   **A: O is above M:** This is **TRUE** as O is either on the Top or Middle shelf, both above the Bottom shelf where M is located. \n    *   **B, C, D, E:** These options involve relationships we cannot definitively determine based on the given constraints.\n## Instructions for Future Problem Solving\n1.  **Carefully analyze each constraint and its implications.**\n2.  **Focus on the relative positions of items rather than just the quantity.**\n3.  **Use a process of elimination to rule out options that contradict the constraints.**\n4.  **Pay close attention to wording and avoid making assumptions.**\n5.  **Draw diagrams or use visualization to clarify the relationships between items.**\n## General Advice for Similar Problems\n*   **Break down complex problems into smaller, manageable steps.**\n*   **Identify the key information and relationships between elements.**\n*   **Use logical reasoning and deduction to draw conclusions.**\n*   **Consider all possibilities before making a final decision.**\n*   **Practice similar problems to improve your skills and understanding.** \n"
