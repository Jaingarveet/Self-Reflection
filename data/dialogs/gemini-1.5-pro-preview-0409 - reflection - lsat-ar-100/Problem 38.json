Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Exactly eight books—F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O—are placed on a bookcase with exactly three shelves—the top shelf, the middle shelf, and the bottom shelf. At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.\nQuestion: If G is placed on the top shelf, then which one of the following could be a complete and accurate list of the books placed on the middle shelf?\nChoices:\n  A: H, I\n  B: I, L\n  C: H, I, L\n  D: I, K, L\n  E: F, I, M\n\nThought:\n*   G is on the top shelf, so the top shelf cannot have more than 2 books (due to the \"more books on bottom than top\" rule).\n*   F and M must be together, and they cannot be on the top shelf with G.\n*   K must be above F, so K cannot be on the middle shelf with F and M (if they were there).\n*   This leaves only H, I, and L as possibilities for the middle shelf. \nAction: Answer(\"C\") \n\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: D"

        "content": "## Reflection on Incorrect Answer\n**Explanation:** My error was assuming that because F and M were together, they could not be on the middle shelf with K above them. I neglected the possibility of F and M being on the bottom shelf with K on the middle shelf.\n**Error Keywords:**\n*   Logic error\n*   Assumption error\n*   Placement constraint misinterpretation \n## Step-by-Step Solution\n1.  **Top Shelf:** G is placed here, leaving space for only one more book due to the constraint.\n2.  **Middle Shelf:** I is placed here. We need to find two more books that can fit.\n3.  **Bottom Shelf:** This shelf must have more books than the top shelf, so at least 3 books will be placed here.\n4.  **Analyzing Remaining Books:**\n    *   F and M must be together.\n    *   K must be above F.\n    *   O must be above L.\n5.  **Possible Arrangements:**\n    *   **Top Shelf:** G, H  \n    *   **Middle Shelf:** I, K, L \n    *   **Bottom Shelf:** F, M, O \nThis arrangement satisfies all conditions. \n## Instructions for Future Similar Problems\n1.  **Identify Constraints:** List all conditions and restrictions given in the problem.\n2.  **Start with Fixed Placements:** Place the books with specific shelf assignments first.\n3.  **Analyze Remaining Books:** Group books that must be together and consider their placement restrictions relative to others.\n4.  **Consider Shelf Capacity:** Remember the constraint about the number of books on each shelf.\n5.  **Explore Possibilities:** Try different arrangements that satisfy all conditions.\n6.  **Eliminate Invalid Options:** Rule out choices that violate any of the constraints.\n7.  **Verify the Solution:** Double-check that the final arrangement satisfies all conditions.\n## General Advice for Similar Problems\n*   **Read Carefully:** Pay close attention to each constraint and avoid making assumptions.\n*   **Visualize:**  Try drawing a diagram or using a table to represent the shelves and book placements.\n*   **Be Systematic:** Work through the problem step-by-step, considering all possibilities.\n*   **Check for Consistency:** Ensure that the final solution does not contradict any of the given conditions. \n*   **Practice:** The more you practice solving logic puzzles, the better you will become at identifying patterns and avoiding errors. \n"
