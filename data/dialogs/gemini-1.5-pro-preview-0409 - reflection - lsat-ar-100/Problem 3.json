Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: An administrator must assign parking spaces to six new employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young. Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.\nQuestion: If Robertson is assigned parking space #3, then which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Souza is assigned parking space #4.\n  B: Togowa is assigned parking space #2.\n  C: Vaughn is assigned parking space #5.\n  D: Xu is assigned parking space #6.\n  E: Young is assigned parking space #2.\n\nThought:\n*   Robertson is in #3, so Young must be in #4, #5, or #6 (Robertson > Young).\n*   This leaves #1, #2, and one of #4, #5, or #6 for Souza, Togowa, Xu, and Vaughn.\n*   We know Xu > Souza, but this doesn't give us a definite placement. \n*   We also know Young > Togowa, but since Young is in #4, #5, or #6, Togowa could be in any of the remaining spots (#1, #2, or the one left by Young).\nTherefore, none of the options must be true. However, the system requires selecting one of the available choices. Based on the information, the most likely scenario is:\n*   Young gets #4 (closest to Robertson)\n*   Xu gets #6 (highest available, satisfying Xu > Souza)\n*   Togowa gets #2 (remaining spot, satisfying Young > Togowa)\nAction: Answer(\"B\") \n\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: E"

        "content": "## Reflection on Incorrect Answer\n**Explanation:** My reasoning was flawed because I focused on the most likely scenario rather than the absolute certainty required by the word \"must.\" While my deductions were logical, they didn't account for all possible valid arrangements.\n**Error Keywords:**\n*   Logic error\n*   Assumption error\n*   Misinterpretation of \"must\"\n## Step-by-Step Solution\n1.  **Robertson in #3:** This implies Young must be in #4, #5, or #6 (Robertson > Young).\n2.  **Remaining spaces:** This leaves #1, #2, and one of #4, #5, or #6 for Souza, Togowa, Xu, and Vaughn.\n3.  **Xu and Souza:** The rule Xu > Souza doesn't provide specific placement yet.\n4.  **Young and Togowa:** Since Young > Togowa and Young is in #4, #5, or #6, Togowa can be in #1 or #2.\n5.  **Crucial deduction:**  **If Togowa is in #1, then Young MUST be in #2** to satisfy Young > Togowa. This is the only option that guarantees a \"must be true\" condition.\n## Instructions for Future\n1.  **Identify fixed placements:** Start with rules that directly assign spaces (like Robertson).\n2.  **Analyze relative placements:** Deduce the order of other employees based on given rules (Young > Togowa, Xu > Souza).\n3.  **Consider all possibilities:** Don't focus on the most likely scenario; explore all valid arrangements.\n4.  **Focus on \"must\":**  Identify the option that holds true in every possible valid arrangement, not just the most likely one.\n## General Advice\n*   **Read carefully:** Pay close attention to keywords like \"must,\" \"could,\" or \"cannot.\"\n*   **Logic over assumptions:** Base deductions on given rules, not assumptions about likelihood.\n*   **Consider all cases:** Explore all valid scenarios before drawing conclusions.\n*   **Review and revise:** Double-check your reasoning and ensure it aligns with the question's requirements. \n"
