Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: A panel of five scientists will be formed. The panelists will be selected from among three botanists—F, G, and H—three chemists—K, L, and M—and three zoologists—P, Q, and R. Selection is governed by the following conditions: The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types. If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. F and K cannot both be selected. K and M cannot both be selected. If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.\nQuestion: If M is the only chemist selected for the panel, which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: F and G are both selected.\n  B: G and H are both selected.\n  C: H and P are both selected.\n  D: F, G, and H are all selected.\n  E: P, Q, and R are all selected.\n\nThought:\nWe know M is selected and is the only chemist.\nThe rule \"If M is selected, both P and R must be selected\" applies. So, P and R are on the panel.\nWe need at least one botanist, but the rule \"If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected\" restricts us as we already have two zoologists (P and R).\nTherefore, only one botanist can be selected. \nAction: Answer(\"C\") \n\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: E"

        "content": "## Reflection on Incorrect Answer\n**Explanation:** My error stemmed from misinterpreting the restriction on the number of botanists and zoologists. I incorrectly assumed that having two zoologists (P and R) automatically limited the selection to only one botanist. \n**Error Keywords:**\n*   Misinterpretation \n*   Logical reasoning error\n*   Conditional statement misapplication\n## Step-by-Step Solution\n1.  **M is selected:** This triggers the rule \"If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.\" So, P and R are on the panel.\n2.  **Zoologist requirement fulfilled:** With P and R, we have satisfied the need for at least one zoologist.\n3.  **Botanist requirement:** We still need at least one botanist. The restriction \"If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected\" is no longer relevant as we already have two zoologists. \n4.  **No restrictions on botanists:** Since the limiting condition doesn't apply, we can select any number of botanists (one, two, or three) to fulfill the requirement of having at least one botanist.\n5.  **Conclusion:**  Therefore, with M, P, and R confirmed, we can also have all three botanists (F, G, and H) on the panel. This satisfies all conditions.\n## Instructions for Future Similar Problems\n1.  **Identify the given conditions and rules carefully.**\n2.  **Analyze each rule's implications and triggers.**\n3.  **Pay close attention to the wording of conditional statements.**\n4.  **Consider all possible scenarios and eliminate those that violate the rules.**\n5.  **Don't make assumptions based on partial information; ensure all conditions are met.**\n## General Advice\n*   **Practice logical reasoning and problem-solving skills.**\n*   **Break down complex problems into smaller, manageable steps.**\n*   **Double-check your reasoning and conclusions.**\n*   **Be aware of common logical fallacies and avoid them.** \n*   **Review and learn from mistakes to improve future performance.** \n"
