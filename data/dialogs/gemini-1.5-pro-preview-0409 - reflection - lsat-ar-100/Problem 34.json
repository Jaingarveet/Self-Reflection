Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: A panel of five scientists will be formed. The panelists will be selected from among three botanists—F, G, and H—three chemists—K, L, and M—and three zoologists—P, Q, and R. Selection is governed by the following conditions: The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types. If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. F and K cannot both be selected. K and M cannot both be selected. If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.\nQuestion: If P is the only zoologist selected, which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: If K is selected, G cannot be selected.\n  B: If L is selected, F cannot be selected.\n  C: If exactly one chemist is selected, it must be K.\n  D: If exactly two chemists are selected, F cannot be selected.\n  E: If exactly two chemists are selected, G cannot be selected.\n\nThought:\n*  P being the only zoologist triggers the condition \"at most one zoologist is selected,\" meaning we must have more than one botanist. \n*  This eliminates options focusing on chemists (C, D, E) as they don't relate to the botanist selection.\n*  We need to analyze the remaining options concerning F and G with K and L.\n*  The condition \"F and K cannot both be selected\" is relevant here. \n*  Option A aligns with this condition, stating if K is chosen, G cannot be. \n*  Option B talks about L and F, which have no restrictions together, making it incorrect.\nAction: Answer(\"A\") \n\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: D"

        "content": "## Reflection on Incorrect Answer\n**Explanation:** My reasoning was flawed in focusing solely on the \"more than one botanist\" condition triggered by P being the only zoologist. While this narrowed down the options, I failed to consider the implications of having exactly two chemists in conjunction with the given restrictions.\n**Error Keywords:**\n*   Logic error\n*   Condition oversight\n*   Incomplete analysis \n## Step-by-Step Solution\n1.  **P is the only zoologist:** This implies we need **more than one botanist** (F, G, or H) due to the given condition.\n2.  **Analyze options related to two chemists:** Since options C, D, and E deal with scenarios involving exactly two chemists, we need to explore their implications.\n3.  **Consider restrictions with two chemists:**\n    *   If K and L are chosen (two chemists), then M cannot be chosen (due to the K-M restriction).\n    *   With M not chosen, the condition \"If M is selected, both P and R must be selected\" is not activated. \n    *   This allows P to be the only zoologist, satisfying the initial condition.\n    *   However, choosing K restricts F from being chosen (F-K restriction). \n4.  **Conclusion:** If exactly two chemists are selected (specifically K and L), then F cannot be selected. This aligns with option D. \n## Instructions for Future Problem Solving\n1.  **Identify triggered conditions:** Analyze how the given information activates specific conditions in the problem.\n2.  **Consider all relevant conditions:** Don't focus on just one triggered condition while neglecting others that might be applicable.\n3.  **Explore different scenarios:** Analyze the implications of each option by considering various possible combinations of scientists based on the given restrictions.\n4.  **Eliminate options logically:** Rule out options that contradict the given conditions or lead to impossible scenarios.\n5.  **Verify the remaining option:** Ensure the chosen option satisfies all conditions and aligns with the given information.\n## General Advice for Similar Problems\n*   **Read the problem carefully:** Understand all conditions and restrictions before attempting to solve.\n*   **Break down complex problems:** Divide the problem into smaller parts and analyze each part step-by-step.\n*   **Consider all possibilities:** Don't jump to conclusions; explore different scenarios before choosing an answer.\n*   **Use logical reasoning:** Apply the given conditions and restrictions to eliminate options and arrive at the correct answer.\n*   **Review your solution:** Double-check your reasoning and ensure it aligns with all aspects of the problem. \n"
