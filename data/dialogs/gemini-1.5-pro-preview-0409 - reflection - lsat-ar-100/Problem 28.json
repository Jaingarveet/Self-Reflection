Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: A panel of five scientists will be formed. The panelists will be selected from among three botanists—F, G, and H—three chemists—K, L, and M—and three zoologists—P, Q, and R. Selection is governed by the following conditions: The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types. If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. F and K cannot both be selected. K and M cannot both be selected. If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.\nQuestion: If four of the scientists selected are F, L, Q, and R, which one of the following must be the fifth scientist selected?\nChoices:\n  A: G\n  B: H\n  C: K\n  D: M\n  E: P\n\nThought:\n*  We know F, L, Q, and R are selected. We need one more, and it must be a chemist (since K and M are the only chemists left).\n*  F is already selected, so we cannot choose K (due to the restriction \"F and K cannot both be selected\").\n*  Therefore, the fifth scientist must be M.\n*  The condition \"If M is selected, both P and R must be selected\" is also satisfied as R is already chosen. \nAction: Answer(\"D\") \n\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: E"

        "content": "## Reflection on Incorrect Answer\n**Explanation:** My reasoning was flawed because I focused on fulfilling the requirement of having one scientist from each category without thoroughly considering all the given conditions. I overlooked the condition \"If M is selected, both P and R must be selected,\" which implies that if R is selected (as in this case), then M must also be selected.  This oversight led me to incorrectly conclude that K was not a possibility and M was the only option.\n**Error Keywords:**\n*   Misinterpretation of conditions\n*   Overlooking implications\n*   Incomplete analysis\n## Step-by-Step Solution\n1.  **Analyze the given information:** We know F, L, Q, and R are selected. We need one more scientist, and it must be either a botanist (G or H) or a zoologist (P) to fulfill the requirement of having at least one from each category.\n2.  **Consider the condition related to M:** Since R is already selected, the condition \"If M is selected, both P and R must be selected\" implies that M cannot be the fifth scientist. If M were chosen, then P would also have to be included, exceeding the limit of five scientists.\n3.  **Evaluate remaining options:** With M ruled out, the only remaining option to fulfill the requirement of having at least one scientist from each category is to choose P, the zoologist. \n4.  **Verify the solution:** Choosing P satisfies all the given conditions: \n    *   There is at least one scientist from each category (F - botanist, L - chemist, Q and P - zoologists).\n    *   The restriction \"If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected\" is not violated as there is only one botanist (F) selected.\n    *   The restrictions related to K and M are irrelevant as neither is being selected.\nTherefore, the fifth scientist must be **P**.\n## Instructions for Future Problem Solving\n1.  **Carefully read and understand all the given conditions and restrictions.**\n2.  **Analyze the implications of each condition and how they interact with each other.**\n3.  **Consider all possible scenarios and eliminate options that violate any of the conditions.**\n4.  **Verify the chosen solution by ensuring it satisfies all the given conditions.**\n## General Advice for Similar Problems\n*   **Pay close attention to detail and avoid making assumptions.**\n*   **Break down complex problems into smaller, manageable steps.**\n*   **Consider all possible interpretations of the conditions and their consequences.**\n*   **Develop a systematic approach to analyze problems and evaluate options.**\n*   **Practice solving similar problems to improve your analytical and logical reasoning skills.** \n"
