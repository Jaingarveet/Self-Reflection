Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: A shopping center has exactly seven spaces—space 1 through space 7—arranged in a straight row. Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.\nQuestion: If the veterinarian is in space 5, which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: The optometrist is in space 2.\n  B: The pharmacy is in space 7.\n  C: A restaurant is in space 4.\n  D: The shoe store is in space 6.\n  E: The toy store is in space 3.\n\nThought:\n*  Veterinarian is in space 5, so options involving spaces 1, 2, and 7 are unlikely.\n*  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, eliminating option E.\n*  The pharmacy needs to be next to the veterinarian or optometrist, making option B likely.\n*  Option C is not guaranteed as the restaurant could be in space 1 with the other at space 7.\n*  Option D has no constraints to confirm its validity. \nAction: Answer(\"B\") \n\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: C"

        "content": "## Reflection on Incorrect Answer\n**Explanation:** My reasoning focused on eliminating options based on the veterinarian's placement and the constraint regarding the toy store. However, I failed to fully consider the implications of the restaurant placement restrictions and their impact on the remaining spaces.\n**Error Keywords:**\n*   Logic error\n*   Constraint misinterpretation \n*   Incomplete analysis\n## Step-by-Step Solution\n1.  **Veterinarian in space 5:** This leaves spaces 1-4 and 6-7 for the remaining businesses.\n2.  **Restaurant placement:** One restaurant must be at an end (space 1 or 7), and they must have at least two spaces between them. \n3.  **Impact on remaining spaces:** With the veterinarian in space 5, placing a restaurant at either end (space 1 or 7) forces the other restaurant to be in space 4 to maintain the required separation.\nTherefore, regardless of the other placements, a restaurant **must** be in space 4.\n## Instructions for Future Problem Solving\n1.  **Identify fixed elements:** Begin by noting the placement of any businesses with fixed positions.\n2.  **Analyze constraints:** Carefully consider each constraint and its implications for the remaining businesses.\n3.  **Visualize the scenario:** Draw a diagram or mentally map the spaces to better understand the spatial relationships and limitations.\n4.  **Consider all possibilities:** Explore different placement options while adhering to the constraints.\n5.  **Focus on \"must be true\":** Eliminate options that are not guaranteed by the constraints, even if they seem likely.\n## General Advice for Similar Problems\n*   **Break down complex constraints:** Divide complex restrictions into smaller, easier-to-analyze parts.\n*   **Pay attention to wording:**  Distinguish between \"must,\" \"could,\" and \"cannot\" to understand the certainty of each condition.\n*   **Think step-by-step:** Avoid jumping to conclusions and carefully consider each deduction.\n*   **Review and revise:** Double-check your reasoning and ensure you haven't overlooked any possibilities or contradictions. \n"
