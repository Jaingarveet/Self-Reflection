Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Of the eight students—George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert—in a seminar, exactly six will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.\nQuestion: Which one of the following is a pair of students who, if they give reports on the same day as each other, must give reports on Wednesday?\nChoices:\n  A: George and Lenore\n  B: Helen and Nina\n  C: Irving and Robert\n  D: Kyle and Nina\n  E: Olivia and Kyle\n\nThought:\n*   George must present on Tuesday, so he cannot be paired with anyone on Wednesday. Eliminate A.\n*   If Nina presents, Helen and Irving present the next day. This means Nina cannot present on Wednesday. Eliminate B and D.\n*   Olivia cannot present in the afternoon, and Wednesday only has afternoon slots available. Eliminate E.\n*   The remaining option is Irving and Robert, and there are no restrictions preventing them from presenting together on Wednesday.\nAction: Answer(\"C\") \n\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: B"

        "content": "## Reflection on Incorrect Answer\n**Explanation:** My reasoning was flawed because I misinterpreted the constraint related to Nina's presentation. I assumed it meant Nina couldn't present on Wednesday, but it actually implies she can only present on Monday or Tuesday for the subsequent condition (Helen and Irving presenting the next day) to be possible. This oversight led me to eliminate the correct answer.\n**Error Keywords:**\n*   Misinterpretation \n*   Logical Error\n*   Constraint Misunderstanding\n## Step-by-Step Solution\n1. **Analyze Constraints:**\n    *   George presents on Tuesday (eliminate options involving George for Wednesday).\n    *   Olivia and Robert cannot present in the afternoon (eliminate options involving them for Wednesday as it only has afternoon slots).\n    *   If Nina presents, Helen and Irving present the next day (Nina can only present on Monday or Tuesday).\n2. **Evaluate Remaining Options:**\n    *   Option B (Helen and Nina) is the only one that satisfies the constraints. If Nina presents on Tuesday, Helen and Irving must present on Wednesday.\n## Instructions for Future Problem Solving\n1. **Carefully analyze each constraint and its implications.**\n2. **Pay attention to conditional statements and their triggers.**\n3. **Consider all possible scenarios and eliminate options that violate constraints.**\n4. **Don't make assumptions or jump to conclusions based on partial understanding.**\n5. **Double-check your reasoning and ensure it aligns with all given information.**\n## General Advice for Similar Problems\n*   **Break down complex problems into smaller parts.**\n*   **Focus on understanding the relationships between different elements.**\n*   **Use a systematic approach to eliminate options and identify the correct answer.**\n*   **Practice logical reasoning and critical thinking skills.**\n*   **Learn from mistakes and refine your problem-solving strategies.** \n"
