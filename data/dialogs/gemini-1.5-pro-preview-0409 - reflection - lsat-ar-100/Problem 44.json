Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: On each of exactly seven consecutive days (day 1 though day 7), a pet shop features exactly one of three breeds of kitten—Himalayan, Manx, Siamese—and exactly one of three breeds of puppy—Greyhound, Newfoundland, Rottweiler. The following conditions must apply: Greyhounds are featured on day 1. No breed is featured on any two consecutive days. Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7. Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1. Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.\nQuestion: If Himalayans are not featured on day 7, which one of the following could be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Greyhounds are featured on days 3 and 5.\n  B: Newfoundlands are featured on day 3.\n  C: Rottweilers are featured on day 6.\n  D: Rottweilers are featured only on day 3.\n  E: Rottweilers are featured on exactly three days.\n\nThought:\n*  Himalayans are on days 2, 4, and 6 (not 1, not 7, exactly 3 days).\n*  Rottweilers cannot be on days 2, 4, 6 (no Himalayans), or 7 (given). So, only on days 1, 3, 5.\n*  Greyhounds are on day 1 (given), so not on day 7. \nAnalysis:\n*  A: Impossible, Greyhounds cannot be on day 7 if on day 1.\n*  B: Possible, doesn't contradict any rules.\n*  C: Possible, Rottweilers can be on day 6.\n*  D: Impossible, Rottweilers cannot be on day 7, so they must be on at least 2 days.\n*  E: Impossible, Rottweilers can only be on days 1, 3, 5 (3 days max, but we know they aren't on day 1).\nAction: Answer(\"B\") \n\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: D"

        "content": "## Reflection on Incorrect Answer\n**Explanation:** My error stemmed from misinterpreting the constraints on the Rottweiler breed. I incorrectly assumed they could only be on days 1, 3, and 5, leading me to eliminate option D.\n**Error Keywords:**\n*   Misinterpretation \n*   Constraint violation\n*   Logical error\n## Step-by-Step Solution\n1. **Himalayan Placement:** Based on the information, Himalayans must be on days 2, 4, and 6.\n2. **Rottweiler Restrictions:** Rottweilers cannot be on days 2, 4, 6 (due to Himalayans), or 7 (given). This leaves days 1, 3, and 5 as possibilities.\n3. **Greyhound Placement:** Greyhounds are on day 1, so they cannot be on day 7.\n4. **Analyzing Options:**\n    *   A: Impossible, as Greyhounds cannot be on both days 1 and 7.\n    *   B: Possible, but doesn't necessarily have to be true.\n    *   C: Possible, as Rottweilers can be on day 6.\n    *   **D: Possible and could be true, as Rottweilers can be on days 3 and 5 (and not on 1 due to Greyhounds).**\n    *   E: Impossible, as Rottweilers can only be on at most two days (3 and 5) given the other constraints.\nTherefore, the correct answer is **D: Rottweilers are featured only on day 3**. \n## Instructions for Future Problem Solving\n1. **Identify all given constraints and rules carefully.**\n2. **Create a timeline or table to visualize the problem.**\n3. **Place the elements with the most restrictions first.**\n4. **Eliminate options that violate the constraints.**\n5. **Consider remaining possibilities and choose the one that could be true.**\n## General Advice for Similar Problems\n*   **Pay close attention to wording and avoid making assumptions.**\n*   **Break down complex problems into smaller steps.**\n*   **Use visualization tools like timelines or tables.**\n*   **Double-check your reasoning and eliminate options systematically.**\n*   **Practice similar problems to improve logical reasoning skills.** \n"
