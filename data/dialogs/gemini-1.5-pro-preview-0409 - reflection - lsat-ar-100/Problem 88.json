Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Exactly eight books—F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O—are placed on a bookcase with exactly three shelves—the top shelf, the middle shelf, and the bottom shelf. At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.\nQuestion: It is fully determined which of the shelves each of the books is placed on if which one of the following is true?\nChoices:\n  A: I and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  B: K and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  C: L and F are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  D: M and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  E: H and O are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n\nThought:\nWe need to analyze each option to see which one definitively places all books on specific shelves.\n**A: I and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.**\nThis would mean I, M, and F are on the middle shelf. We still don't know the exact placement of K, G, H, O, and L. \n**B: K and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.**\nThis doesn't give us enough information to determine the placement of the remaining books.\n**C: L and F are placed on the same shelf as each other.**\nThis would mean L, F, and M are on the same shelf. Since O must be above L, it must be on the middle shelf with I.  K must be above F, so it's either on the middle or top shelf.  This still leaves possibilities for the placement of G and H.\n**D: M and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.**\nThis would mean M, F, and H are on the same shelf. Since K must be above F, it's either on the middle or top shelf. We still don't know the exact placement of G, O, and L.\n**E: H and O are placed on the same shelf as each other.**\nSince O must be above L, L must be on the bottom shelf. F cannot be on the top shelf (as it's below K), so F and M must be on the bottom shelf with L. This leaves K and G for the middle shelf with I, and H and O for the top shelf.

        "content": "## Reflection on Incorrect Answer\n**Explanation:**\nMy error stemmed from overlooking the implications of placing I and M on the same shelf and focusing too much on the placement of O and L. I failed to recognize that fixing I and M restricts the placement of other books due to the given conditions, leading to a unique arrangement.\n**Error Keywords:**\n*   Logic error\n*   Inference error\n*   Overlooking constraints\n## Step-by-Step Solution with Correct Answer\n1.  **Analyze Option A:** If I and M are on the same shelf, then F must also be on that shelf (middle shelf due to I's placement).\n2.  **Consider K:** K must be above F, so it can only be on the top shelf.\n3.  **Consider O and L:** O must be above L. Since the middle and top shelves are occupied, L must be on the bottom shelf, and O must be on the middle shelf with I, M, and F.\n4.  **Remaining Books:** This leaves only G and H. Since the bottom shelf needs at least two books, both G and H must be placed there.\nTherefore, option A uniquely determines the placement of all books:\n*   **Top Shelf:** K\n*   **Middle Shelf:** I, M, F, O\n*   **Bottom Shelf:** G, H, L \n## Instructions for Future Problem Solving\n1.  **Analyze each option carefully:** Consider the implications of each option on the placement of all books, not just a few.\n2.  **Focus on the given conditions:** Use the given conditions to eliminate possibilities and narrow down placements.\n3.  **Work step-by-step:**  Don't jump to conclusions; systematically analyze the placement of each book based on the given conditions and the chosen option.\n4.  **Visualize the shelves:**  Drawing a diagram of the shelves and placing books as you analyze can help visualize the arrangement and avoid errors.\n## General Advice for Similar Problems\n*   **Pay attention to detail:** Small details in the problem statement can have significant implications for the solution.\n*   **Think critically:** Don't just accept information at face value; analyze its consequences and connections to other facts.\n*   **Consider all possibilities:** Explore different options and their implications before settling on an answer.\n*   **Practice logical reasoning:** Regularly engage in activities that challenge your logical thinking skills. \n"
