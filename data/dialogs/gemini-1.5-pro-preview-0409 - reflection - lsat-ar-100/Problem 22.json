Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: A panel of five scientists will be formed. The panelists will be selected from among three botanists—F, G, and H—three chemists—K, L, and M—and three zoologists—P, Q, and R. Selection is governed by the following conditions: The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types. If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. F and K cannot both be selected. K and M cannot both be selected. If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.\nQuestion: If both G and H are among the scientists selected, then the panel must include either\nChoices:\n  A: F or else K\n  B: F or else M\n  C: K or else M\n  D: M or else Q\n  E: P or else Q\n\nThought:\n*  The prompt states that if more than one botanist is selected (G and H in this case), then at most one zoologist can be selected. This eliminates options D and E.\n*  The prompt also states that F and K cannot both be selected, so option A is not necessarily true. \n*  Finally, the prompt states that if M is selected, both P and R must be selected. However, since we already have two botanists (G and H), we can't have two zoologists (P and R). This eliminates option B.\n*  Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the panel must include either K or M, as they are the remaining chemist options.\nAction: Answer(\"C\") \n\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: A"

        "content": "## Reflection on Incorrect Answer\n**Explanation:** My reasoning was flawed because I misinterpreted the \"or else\" condition in the question and the implications of selecting G and H. I focused too much on eliminating options based on individual constraints rather than considering the combined effect of multiple conditions.\n**Error Keywords:**\n*   Misinterpretation of logical connectors (\"or else\")\n*   Overlooking combined effects of multiple conditions\n*   Focusing on elimination rather than positive inference\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n1.  **G and H are selected:** This implies we have two botanists, so we can have at most one zoologist (from the second condition).\n2.  **F and K cannot both be selected:** This means if F is on the panel, K cannot be, and vice versa.\n3.  **M with P and R:**  Since we can have at most one zoologist, selecting M is impossible because it requires both P and R.\n4.  **Remaining options:** We need one chemist. Since M is out, the only remaining options are K and F (one of them must be present).\nTherefore, the panel must include either F or K.\n**Instructions for Future:**\n1.  **Carefully analyze \"or else\" conditions:** Understand that it implies one of the options must be true, not necessarily both being mutually exclusive.\n2.  **Consider combined effects:** Analyze how multiple conditions interact and restrict the possible selections.\n3.  **Focus on positive inference:** Instead of just eliminating options, actively reason which options must be true based on the given conditions.\n4.  **Review all conditions before finalizing the answer:** Ensure you haven't overlooked any constraints or their implications.\n**General Advice for Similar Problems:**\n*   **Break down complex logical statements:** Analyze each part of the statement and its implications.\n*   **Create a possibility tree or table:** This can help visualize the different combinations and their validity based on the conditions.\n*   **Practice with similar logic puzzles:** Improve your ability to reason through complex constraints and identify the correct solution. \n*   **Double-check your reasoning:** Ensure you haven't made any assumptions or overlooked any details. \n"
