A guy is playing the drums. The guy stops and opens his mouth. the guy\nChoices:\n  A: places the sticks on the drum.\n  B: stops drumming and shakes his head and smiles.\n  C: writes on a napkin for two minutes.\n  D: starts playing so hard his fingers are starting to bleed.\n\nThought:\nThe text describes a guy playing the drums and then stopping. The most likely completion would be something that follows logically from this action.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")\n\nExplanation:\nThe guy stops drumming and shakes his head and smiles. This is a likely completion because it suggests that the guy has finished playing the drums and is reacting to his performance. The other options do not follow logically from the text. For example, placing the sticks on the drum would not necessarily follow from stopping, and writing on a napkin for two minutes is unrelated to playing the drums. Starting to play so hard that his fingers bleed is also unlikely because it suggests that the guy did not stop playing the drums, which contradicts the text.\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: A"
