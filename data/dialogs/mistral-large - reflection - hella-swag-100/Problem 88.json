[step] If you have a low sex drive, or if your sex drive has declined with age, you might want to give it a boost with some extra testosterone. In addition to increased libido, testosterone supplements can help you avoid unwanted erections and maintain erections when aroused.\nChoices:\n  A: A healthy body needs more testosterone in order to maintain erections. Some women who are female or older do not maintain regular erections until all their testosterone has been expended, so other people may need testosterone anyway.\n  B: [substeps] Be honest with yourself if you want to lower your testosterone. Taking testosterone supplements can lead to a reduction in your sex drive.\n  C: [title] Distinguish between testosterone and regular erections. [step] Studies have shown that women with low testosterone are able to have slightly lower levels of sexual function after sex, which is because the hormone changes are carried out through pleasure.\n  D: [title] Ask yourself if you want a healthier body. [step] Men who suffer from low testosterone may experience increased body fat and larger breasts.\n\nThought:\nThe text is discussing the potential benefits of taking testosterone supplements for improving sexual function, specifically for men who have a low sex drive or have experienced a decline in sex drive with age. The text also mentions that testosterone supplements can help maintain erections when aroused.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because it suggests that all women need testosterone to maintain erections, which is not accurate. Additionally, it implies that all testosterone must be expended before a woman can maintain an erection, which is also not true.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because it contradicts the information in the original text, which states that testosterone supplements can increase libido, not decrease it.\n\nChoice C is incorrect because it discusses the relationship between testosterone and sexual function in women, which is not relevant to the original text.\n\nChoice D is incorrect because it discusses the potential negative effects of low testosterone on body composition, which is not directly related to the topic of sexual function.\n\nAction: Answer(\"A\")\n\n(Note: Although choice A is not entirely accurate, it is the most relevant to the topic of the original text and does not directly contradict any of the information provided.)\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: D"
