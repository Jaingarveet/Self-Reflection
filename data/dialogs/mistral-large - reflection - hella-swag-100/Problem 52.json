[substeps] If you like a band or musician, but everyone else thinks they are bad or weird, then you should stand up for your views.\n  C: [substeps] Never allow the messenger back into your life. If you are in a relationship with someone but they are choosing to change with you, leave the conversation.\n  D: You don't have to assume how you will feel. What's more, you probably know a bit more about people who just want to blend in with their surroundings.\n\nThought:\nThe text is about being independent and not conforming to the crowd.\nOption A warns against being influenced by others' opinions on music and trends, which aligns with the text's message.\nOption B suggests doing research and standing up for one's views, which is also consistent with the text's message.\nOption C seems unrelated to the topic of being indie.\nOption D is vague and does not provide clear advice related to the topic.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: B"
