To ease the itchiness of chilblains without scratching, apply some calamine lotion or witch hazel onto your chilblains using a cotton ball.\nChoices:\n  A: This will leave your chilblains feeling soft and soothing. [substeps] Do not use witch hazel or similar products if you have sensitive skin.\n  B: Let it sit on the itchy rash for up to 5 minutes. [substeps] You can also purchase witch hazel at a pharmacy or physician's office.\n  C: Both work well, so use whichever you have on hand. [substeps] Don't rub the lotion or witch hazel into your chilblains.\n  D: Repeat this cycle every day for up to three days until the itch is gone. [substeps] If you are not used to scratching or do not want to seek medical treatment for an itch, ask your doctor to prescribe.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n1.

It offers relevant and practical advice by instructing users not to rub the lotion or witch hazel into the chilblains. This is important because rubbing the affected area could aggravate the skin further and potentially spread the rash.\n\nChoice D is misleading and unnecessary. It suggests a specific duration and cycle for treatment, which is not mentioned in the original text, and advises seeking medical treatment for an itch, diverging from the self-care approach of the original text.\n\nAnswer: C provides the most suitable and relevant completion to the text.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
