Recognize the phrase \"and the victor has been declared\" as a cue that the competition has ended, and winners have been announced. \n4. Interpret the completion options in light of this context: \n   - [REDACTED]: High jumps and clapping are unrelated to the described event. \n   - [REDACTED]: The declaration of a victor and posing with medals align with a concluded competition. \n   - [REDACTED]: Shaking hands and saluting are not common practices after winning a competition. \n   - [REDACTED]: Bowing and the placement of the barbell on shoulders are unrelated to the conclusion of the event. \n5. Choose the completion that best fits the context and provides a logical ending to the text.\n"
