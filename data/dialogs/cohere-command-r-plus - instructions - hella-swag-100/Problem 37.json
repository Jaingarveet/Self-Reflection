[step] That's easier said than done, especially if you're subbing for someone, but being late throws you off balance. It flusters you.\nChoices:\n  A: Many schools assign teachers and students to class at that time. Being too late gives the bus driver extra time to reschedule.\n  B: Having sit-down comfort is key to keeping your focus sharp. [title] Grab an umbrella if it's sunny.\n  C: When you're running around like a chicken with its head cut off, you're not thinking clearly and not totally focused. Many, many school bus accidents happen in the school parking lot.\n  D: So find ways to be consistent about staying on time. Practice counting times out loud so that you're not distracted.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n1. Read and understand the header, title, and step provided in the text.\n2. Identify the topic and theme of the text, which is maintaining focus while driving a school bus.\n3. Recognize that the correct completion should provide practical advice or insights related to maintaining focus.\n4. Evaluate each choice:\n   - Choice [REDACTED] talks about school schedules and rescheduling, which is irrelevant to the topic of focus.\n   - Choice [REDACTED] suggests grabbing an umbrella, which is random and unrelated to focus or being on time.\n   - Choice [REDACTED] discusses the consequences of being late and running around frantically, connecting it to a lack of focus and potential accidents.\n   - Choice [REDACTED] offers advice on being consistent with time, but it doesn't explain why it's crucial or provide new insights.\n5. Select Choice [REDACTED] as it directly addresses the topic of focus and provides a compelling reason for the previous step's advice.\n"
