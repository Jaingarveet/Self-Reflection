To solve this problem, I will use the concept of relative speed, which is the speed at which the two cars are moving relative to each other.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")\n\nExplanation:\nThe relative speed between the two cars is 13 - 12 = 1 mph.\nSince the highway is 50 miles long, it will take the car traveling at 13 mph x 50/13 = 3.85 hours to cover the distance.\nThe car traveling at 12 mph will take 50/12 = 4.17 hours to cover the distance.\nTherefore, the cars will meet after 3.85 - 4.17 = 0.32 hours or 20 minutes.\n\nNote: I have corrected my previous answer and reflected on my mistake to ensure a more accurate solution."
