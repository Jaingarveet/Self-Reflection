Upon reflection, I realized that I made a mistake in my reasoning. Here is my corrected solution:\n\nThe requirements given in the problem are:\n\n1. Among the 4 men, there are 3 tall men, 2 doctors, and 1 is handsome.\n2. Wang Wei and Wu Gang are both doctors.\n3. Liu Dawei and Li Qiang are the same height.\n4. Li Qiang and Wang Wei are not all tall.\n\nFrom these requirements, we can deduce that the only man who meets all the conditions is:\n\nB: Li Qiang\n\nExplanation:\nLi Qiang is the only man who meets all the conditions given in the problem. He is tall (as he and Liu Dawei are the same height), a doctor (as he and Wang Wei are both doctors), and handsome (as he is the only one described as handsome).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) Li Qiang."
