However, upon further review, I realized that Levodopa does not act by decreasing brain cholinergic activity. In fact, Levodopa is an indirect dopaminergic agonist that increases dopamine levels in the brain, which can help alleviate symptoms of Parkinson's disease.\n\nThe correct answer is option C: Selegiline, which acts by inhibiting the breakdown of dopamine in the brain, leading to increased levels of dopamine and a decrease in cholinergic activity.\n\nAction: I will select option C: Selegiline as the correct answer.\n\nAnswer: C"
