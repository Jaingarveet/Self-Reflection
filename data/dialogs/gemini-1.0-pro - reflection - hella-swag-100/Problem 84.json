Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6.

[step] You can slice in rounds or lengths; the preference is yours but round slices tend to be easier to handle. [title] Soak in salted water for 10 minutes.\nChoices:\n  A: [step] This is to insure that they don't taste salty. [title] Carefully pour the chicken stock over the eggplant slices.\n  B: [step] Remove the eggplant from the water and allow to sit in the salted water for 30 minutes. Then remove from the water and wring out the excess liquid.\n  C: [step] The cooking time varies; you can cover the dish with something like a lid or spread olive oil over the top; however, for this recipe , 2 to 3 minutes of added cooking time should be fine. [title] Drain the eggplant in a colander.\n  D: [substeps] Drain after 10 minutes and leave to one side for later use. [title] Beat the egg with a quarter teaspoon of fine salt.\n\nThought: \nThe text describes how to make eggplant fritters.\nThe next step should be related to preparing the eggplant slices.\nOption B describes soaking the eggplant slices in salted water for 30 minutes, then removing them from the water and wringing out the excess liquid. This is a common step in preparing eggplant to remove bitterness and excess moisture.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: D"

However, the correct answer is to drain the eggplant after 10 minutes and leave it to one side for later use. This is because the eggplant needs to be patted dry before being coated in the egg mixture.\nError Keywords:\n- Assumption error\n- Incomplete information processing\n- Lack of attention to detail\nSolution:\n1. Read the entire text carefully and identify the current step in the recipe.\n2. Analyze the available options and consider which one logically follows the current step.\n3.
