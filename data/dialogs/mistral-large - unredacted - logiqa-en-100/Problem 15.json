Identify the premise and the conclusion.\n2. Determine if the premise provides a necessary or a sufficient condition for the conclusion.\n3. Consider if there are any other possible conditions that could lead to the conclusion.\n4. Evaluate the likelihood of the conclusion being true based on the premise.\n5. Choose the answer that matches your evaluation.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your logical reasoning and final answer.\n - Remember that a necessary condition is a requirement for the conclusion to be true, while a sufficient condition guarantees the conclusion to be true.\n - Consider all possible conditions that could lead to the conclusion, not just the ones mentioned in the premise.\n"
