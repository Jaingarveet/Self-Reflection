Identify the inference being made in the question.\n2. Identify the assumptions that are given in the question.\n3. Determine which assumption contradicts the inference.\n4. Read each answer choice carefully and evaluate whether it contradicts the inference.\n5. Choose the answer that does not contradict the inference.\n\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always identify the inference being made in the question.\n - Always identify the assumptions that are given in the question.\n - Always determine which assumption contradicts the inference.\n - Always read each answer choice carefully and evaluate whether it contradicts the inference.\n - Always choose the answer that does not contradict the inference.\n - Remember that assumptions are not necessarily true, but are used to make an inference.\n - Remember that the correct answer may not contradict the inference, but rather be consistent with it.\n"
