Identify the conditional statement in the problem.\n2. Identify the contrapositive of the conditional statement.\n3. Use the contrapositive to determine the logical implication of the statement.\n4. Choose the answer that matches the logical implication of the statement.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always identify the conditional statement in the problem.\n - Always identify the contrapositive of the conditional statement.\n - Always use the contrapositive to determine the logical implication of the statement.\n - Never assume that the converse of the conditional statement is true.\n - Always double-check your answer to ensure that it matches the logical implication of the statement.\n"
