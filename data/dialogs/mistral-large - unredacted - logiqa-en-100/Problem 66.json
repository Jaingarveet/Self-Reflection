(1) F is adjacent to H and is on the north side of H.(2) I and E are adjacent.(3) G is somewhere in the north of F.\nQuestion: If it is found that G is the northernmost island, how many possible arrangements are there for this group of islands?\nChoices:\n  A: 2\n  B: 3\n  C: 4\n  D: 5\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI incorrectly answered the question because I did not consider all possible arrangements based on the given information.\n\nError Keywords:\n - Incomplete analysis\n - Missing arrangements\n - Logic error\n\nSolution:\nFrom the given information, we know that F is north of H, I and E are adjacent, and G is north of F and is the northernmost island.\nWe can represent the possible arrangements as follows:\n\n1. G - F - H - I - E\n2. G - F - H - E - I\n3. G - F - I - E - H\n4. G - I - F - H - E\n\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the given information about the arrangement of the islands.\n2. Draw a diagram or use symbols to represent the possible arrangements based on the given information.\n3. Consider all possible arrangements that satisfy the given conditions.\n4. Count the number of unique arrangements.\n5. Choose the answer that matches the number of unique arrangements.\n\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Consider all possible arrangements that satisfy the given conditions.\n - Use diagrams or symbols to help visualize the problem and possible solutions.\n - Be systematic in your approach to ensure that you consider all possible arrangements.\n"
