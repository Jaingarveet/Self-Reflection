City E, City F, Lake G, Mountain H, Mountain I, Lake J Taking into account factors such as time, funding, plateau environment, and physical condition of the personnel, (1) at least one of Lake G and Lake J should be visited.(2) If you don't go to E city or F city, you can't go to G lake.(3) If you don't go to E city, you can't go to H mountain.(4) Only when I cross the I peak can I reach Lake J.\nQuestion: If this team does not go to I Peak due to climate reasons, which of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: The group went to E city and J lake\n  B: The group went to city E instead of city F\n  C: The group went to visit G Lake and H Mountain\n  D: The group went to F city and G lake tour\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI incorrectly answered the question because I did not follow the correct format for providing my answer.\n\nError Keywords:\n - Format error\n - Answer format error\n - Incorrect answer format\n\nSolution:\nGiven that the team does not go to I Peak, they cannot reach Lake J (rule 4).\nSince they cannot go to Lake J, they must go to Lake G (rule 1).\nIf they go to Lake G, they must go to either City E or City F (rule 2).\nIf they go to City E, they must go to Mountain H (rule 3).\nHowever, going to City E and Mountain H is not a requirement if they go to City F and Lake G.\nTherefore, the group went to City F and Lake G.\n\nInstructions:\n1. Read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n2. Identify the given rules and constraints.\n3. Use logical reasoning to deduce the possible outcomes based on the given rules and constraints.\n4. Eliminate the answer choices that are not possible based on your deductions.\n5. Choose the answer that matches your deduced outcome.\n6. State your answer in the correct format: \"Action: Answer([ANSWER\\_CHOICE])\".\n\nAdvice:\n\n* Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n* Always follow the correct format for providing your answer.\n* Always use logical reasoning to deduce the possible outcomes based on the given rules and constraints.\n* Always eliminate the answer choices that are not possible based on your deductions.\n* Always choose the answer that matches your deduced outcome.\n* Always double-check your answer before submitting it.\n"
