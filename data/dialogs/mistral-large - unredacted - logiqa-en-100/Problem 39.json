Similarly, I assumed that since robot No.2 picked up blue balls instead of red balls, it must be able to recognize shapes, but it could also be unable to recognize colors.\n\nError Keywords:\n- Incorrect assumption\n- Misinterpretation of information\n- Lack of consideration of all possibilities\n\nSolution:\nThe laboratory has three types of robots, A, B, and C.\nType A can recognize colors, type B can recognize shapes, and type C can neither recognize colors nor shapes.\nRobot No.1 picked up red squares instead of red balls, which means it either cannot recognize shapes or cannot recognize colors. Therefore, it cannot be type B, but it could be type A or type C.\nRobot No.2 picked up blue balls instead of red balls, which means it either cannot recognize colors or cannot recognize shapes. Therefore, it cannot be type A, but it could be type B or type C.\nThe only option that must be true based on the information given is that robot No.1 is not type B and robot No.2 is not type A.\n\nInstructions:\n1. Read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n2. Identify the three types of robots and their abilities.\n3. Analyze the results of the experiment and what they imply about each robot's abilities.\n4. Consider all possibilities and do not make assumptions about the robots' abilities based on their mistakes.\n5. Eliminate answer choices that cannot be true based on the information given.\n6. Choose the answer that must be true based on the information given.\n\nAdvice:\n- Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n- Always consider all possibilities and do not make assumptions.\n- Always eliminate answer choices that cannot be true based on the information given.\n- Always choose the answer that must be true based on the information given.\n- Always double-check your reasoning and final answer.\n"
