I knew that spring catarrh is a type I hypersensitivity reaction but incorrectly matched it with choice \"A\" instead of \"B\" in the multiple-choice format. \n\nError Keywords:\n- Matching error\n- Interpretation error\n- Selection error\n\nSolution: \nSpring catarrh, or seasonal allergic rhinitis, is a type I hypersensitivity reaction characterized by IgE-mediated allergic responses to environmental allergens. \n\nInstructions: \n1. Read the question carefully and identify the specific type of hypersensitivity reaction being asked about. \n2. Understand that spring catarrh, or seasonal allergic rhinitis, is a type I hypersensitivity reaction. \n3. Match the correct type of hypersensitivity reaction with the correct choice in the multiple-choice format: \n   - Type I hypersensitivity reaction corresponds to choice \"B\". \n\nAdvice: \n - Pay close attention to the question's specific request and the multiple-choice format. \n - Ensure a clear understanding of the basic concepts and terminology in immunology and hypersensitivity reactions. \n - Double-check your interpretation of the question and the matching of choices to avoid similar errors in the future.\n"
