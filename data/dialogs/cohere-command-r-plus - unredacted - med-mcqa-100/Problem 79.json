My understanding of pediatric growth rates was correct, but I incorrectly calculated the total growth over four years. \n\nError Keywords:\n- Calculation error\n- Growth rate misunderstanding\n\nSolution: Step-by-step calculation: \nAn average growth rate of 6 cm per year (within the 5-7 cm range) is a conservative estimate. \nAverage growth rate per year = 6 cm\nTotal time period = 4 years\n\nAverage gain in length over 4 years = Average growth rate per year * Number of years\nAverage gain in length = 6 cm/year * 4 years = 24 cm\n\nSince we are looking for the average gain in length, we can round this to the nearest multiple of 5, which is 25 cm. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **B: 50 cm**. \n\nInstructions: \n- Identify the growth rate range for children. \n- Choose a conservative estimate within the range for a more robust answer. \n- Calculate the average growth rate per year. \n- Multiply the average growth rate by the number of years to find the total gain in length. \n- Round the final answer to the nearest multiple of 5 to align with the answer choices. \n\nAdvice: \n- Understand the growth patterns of children to provide informed estimates. \n- Always consider a range of values when dealing with averages and estimates. \n- Practice calculating growth rates and averages to improve accuracy. \n- Double-check calculations and ensure a clear understanding of the question.\n"
