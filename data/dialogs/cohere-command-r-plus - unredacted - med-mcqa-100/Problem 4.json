However, I provided the minimum daily dosage recommendation by the WHO, rather than the specific dosage prescribed by the MCH program. \n\nError Keywords:\n- Dosage error\n- Specific guidelines error\n- MCH program error\n\nSolution: The correct answer is A: 100 mg iron + 500 mcg folic acid. \n\nStep-by-step reasoning: \n1. The question specifically asks about the dosage under the MCH program, not the general guidelines. \n2. The MCH program is a comprehensive healthcare program for mothers and children, and it provides specific guidelines for iron and folic acid supplementation during pregnancy. \n3. The MCH program guidelines recommend a daily dosage of 100 mg of iron and 500 mcg of folic acid for pregnant women to prevent anemia and ensure adequate neural tube development in the fetus. \n4. This dosage is in line with the upper limit of the WHO's recommended range and is specifically tailored to the needs of pregnant women and their developing fetuses. \n\nInstructions to get the correct answer: \n1. Read the question carefully and identify the specific program mentioned (MCH). \n2. Understand that the question asks for the daily dosage of iron and folic acid tablets given to mothers under this specific program. \n3. Recall or research the specific guidelines of the MCH program regarding iron and folic acid supplementation. \n4. Compare the choices to the specific dosage recommendations of the MCH program. \n5. Do not rely solely on general guidelines, such as those provided by the WHO, as programs and organizations may have their own tailored recommendations. \n\nGeneral advice: \n - Familiarize yourself with specific healthcare programs and their guidelines, especially those related to maternal and child health. \n - Understand that general recommendations may differ from specific program guidelines, and always prioritize the latter when answering questions about specific programs. \n - Keep up to date with any changes or updates to program guidelines, as they may be revised periodically based on new research or recommendations. \n - Always read the question carefully to identify any specific programs or guidelines being referenced. \n - When in doubt, cross-reference your answer with multiple reliable sources to ensure accuracy.\n"
