The correct answer, \"hemorrhage,\" is a major concern due to the rich vascular supply of the pancreas and the potential for damage to nearby blood vessels. \n\nError Keywords:\n- Overgeneralization\n- Lack of anatomical context\n\nSolution:\nCyst-gastrostomy is a surgical procedure used to treat pancreatic cysts or pseudocysts. While infection, obstruction, and fistula formation are potential complications, the major concern specific to this procedure is hemorrhage. The pancreas has a rich vascular supply, and there is a significant risk of bleeding during the operation or as a postoperative complication. \n\nInstructions:\n1. Understand the context: Cyst-gastrostomy is a procedure for pancreatic cysts/pseudocysts.\n2. Consider anatomical context: Recognize the rich vascular supply of the pancreas.\n3. Evaluate complications: Infection, obstruction, and fistula are general surgical risks, but hemorrhage is a major concern due to the anatomy.\n4. Choose the answer: D - Hemorrhage is the major complication to consider for this specific procedure.\n\nAdvice:\n- Consider the anatomical context and unique characteristics of the surgical site when evaluating potential complications. \n- Recognize that while general surgical complications are important, certain procedures carry specific risks due to the anatomy involved. \n- Always review potential complications for each procedure, especially those related to the unique aspects of the anatomy being operated on.\n"
