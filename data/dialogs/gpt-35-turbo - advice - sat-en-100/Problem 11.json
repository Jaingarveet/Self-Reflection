        "content": "Topic: English\nContext: Honey bees are hosts to the pathogenic large ectoparasitic mite Varroa destructor (Varroa mites). These mites feed on bee hemolymph (blood) and can  kill bees directly or by increasing their susceptibilityto secondary infection with fungi, bacteria or viruses. Little is known about the natural defenses that keep the mite infections under control.Pyrethrums are a group of flowering plants which include Chrysanthemum coccineum, Chrysanthemumcinerariifolium, Chrysanthemum marschalli, and related species. These plants produce potent insecticides with anti-mite activity. The naturally occurring insecticides are known as pyrethrums. A synonym for the naturally occurring pyrethrums is 15 pyrethrin and synthetic analogues of pyrethrums are known as pyrethroids. In fact, the human mite infestation known as scabies (Sarcoptes scabiei) is treated with a topical pyrethrum cream.We suspect that the bees of commercial bee 20 colonies which are fed mono-crops are nutritionally deficient. In particular, we postulate that the problem is a diet deficient in anti-mite toxins: pyrethrums, and possibly other nutrients which are inherent in such plants. Without, at least, intermittent feeding on25 the pyrethrum producing plants, bee colonies are susceptible to mite infestations which can become fatal either directly or due to a secondary infection of immunocompromised or nutritionally deficient bees. This secondary infection can be viral, bacterial or 30 fungal and may be due to one or more pathogens. In addition, immunocompromised or nutritionally deficient bees may be further weakened when commercially produced insecticides are introduced into their hives by bee keepers in an effort to fight35 mite infestation. We further postulate that the proper dosage necessary to prevent mite infestation may be better left to the bees, who may seek out or avoid pyrethrum containing plants depending on the amount necessary to defend against mites and the40 amount already consumed by the bees, which in higher doses could be potentially toxic to them. This hypothesis can best be tested by a trial wherein a small number of commercial honey bee colonies are offered a number of pyrethrum45 producing plants, as well as a typical bee food source such as clover, while controls are offered only the clover. Mites could then be introduced to each hive with note made as to the choice of the bees, and the effects of the mite parasites on the experimental50 colonies versus control colonies.It might be beneficial to test wild-type honey bee colonies in this manner as well, in case there could be some genetic difference between them that affects the bees' preferences for pyrethrum producing flowers.Pathogen Occurrence in Honey Bee Colonies With and Without Colony Collapse Disorder\\begin{center}\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}\\hline& \\multicolumn{2}{|c|}{$\\begin{array}{c}\\text { Percent of colonies affected by } \\\\\\text { pathogen }\\end{array}$} \\\\\\hlinePathogen & $\\begin{array}{c}\\text { Colonies with } \\\\ \\text { colony collapse } \\\\ \\text { disorder (\\%) }\\end{array}$ & $\\begin{array}{c}\\text { Colonies without } \\\\ \\text { colony collapse } \\\\ \\text { disorder (\\%) }\\end{array}$ \\\\\\hlineViruses & 83 & 5 \\\\IAPV & 100 & 76 \\\\KBV & 90 & 48 \\\\\\hlineFungi & 100 & 81 \\\\Nosema apis & 77 & 0 \\\\Nosema ceranae & All four pathogens &  \\\\\\hline\\end{tabular}\\end{center}Adapted from Diana L.
