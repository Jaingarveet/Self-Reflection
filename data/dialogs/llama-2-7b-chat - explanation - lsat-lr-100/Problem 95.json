Yet many successful retailers excel in just one of the areas and meet competitors' standards for the other. Hence, a retailer's success need not depend on excellence in both areas.\nQuestion: The structure of the reasoning in the argument above is most parallel to that in which one of the following?\nChoices:\n  A: Runners who have only average speed and endurance are unlikely to win long-distance races. Some long-distance champions, however, win by being above average in speed or endurance only; therefore, being above average in both speed and endurance is not necessary.\n  B: Bicyclists who have only average speed are unlikely to win short races, but in a long-distance race such bicyclists can win if they have better-built bicycles than average and better endurance than average. Therefore, most bicycle races are not won by bicyclists with above-average speed.\n  C: Excellence in a particular swimming stroke is not always necessary in order for a swimmer to win a race that requires each swimmer to use several different strokes in sequence, and many swimmers win these races without being the best at any of the strokes. Therefore, anyone who does excel at all the strokes is almost certain to win.\n  D: Apples that are neither especially firm nor especially flavorful are unsuitable for baking; yet while flavor is essential for both baking and eating, many flavorful apples that are soft are suitable for eating. Hence, the apples that are best for eating need not be both firm and flavorful.\n  E: Most plants that are neither ornamental nor edible are useless and are thus classified as weeds; yet many such plants are useful for purposes other than food or ornamentation, and are thus not classified as weeds. Hence, not all inedible and non-ornamental plants are weeds.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\n"

Therefore, most bicycle races are not won by bicyclists with above-average speed.\n\nThe argument in the passage is similar to the one in option B in that both involve a comparison between two different scenarios:\n\n* In option B, the comparison is between short and long-distance races, and the argument is that bicyclists with only average speed can win long-distance races if they have better-built bicycles and better endurance than average.\n* In the passage, the comparison is between retailers who excel in convenience and those who excel in variety of merchandise, and the argument is that a retailer's success need not depend on excellence in both areas.\n\nBoth arguments use the same structure, with a contrast between two scenarios, followed by a conclusion that the second scenario is possible even if the first scenario is not. Therefore, the answer is option B."
