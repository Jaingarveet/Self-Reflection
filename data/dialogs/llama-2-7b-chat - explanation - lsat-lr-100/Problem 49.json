Similar strategies can be used to break other habits. But since such strategies involve deception, individuals cannot easily adopt them unless a doctor or some other third party provides the warning.\nQuestion: Which one of the following is an assumption on which the argument depends?\nChoices:\n  A: People tend to believe whatever doctors tell them.\n  B: Most of the techniques that help people quit smoking can also help people break other habits.\n  C: The more the relevant danger is exaggerated, the more likely one is to break one's habit.\n  D: People generally do not find it easy to deceive themselves.\n  E: A doctor is justified in deceiving a patient whenever doing so is likely to make the patient healthier.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nThe argument depends on the assumption that people cannot easily adopt strategies that involve deception unless a doctor or some other third party provides the warning. This assumption is best represented by option [REDACTED]: [REDACTED]\n\nThe argument suggests that individuals are unlikely to use exaggerated warnings from doctors to quit smoking unless they are already inclined to believe that smoking is dangerous. This implies that people are not naturally inclined to deceive themselves, and therefore would not be likely to use deception as a strategy to break their habits without external influence.\n\nOption [REDACTED] is incorrect because while people may tend to believe whatever doctors tell them, the argument is not based on this assumption.\n\nOption [REDACTED] is incorrect because while some techniques for quitting smoking may also help with other habits, the argument is not focused on this point.\n\nOption [REDACTED] is incorrect because while exaggerating the dangers of smoking may make it more likely for someone to quit, it is not the assumption that is being made in the argument.\n\nOption [REDACTED] is incorrect because while a doctor may be justified in deceiving a patient in certain circumstances, this is not the assumption being made in the argument.\n"
