However, the company obtained the evidence by illegally recording Ellison's conversations. Therefore, although the company may demand that he immediately cease, it cannot justifiably take any punitive measures against him.\nQuestion: Which one of the following judgments best illustrates the principle illustrated by the argument above?\nChoices:\n  A: After Price confessed to having stolen money from Long over a period of several years, Long began stealing from Price. Despite Price's guilt, Long was not justified in taking illegal action against him.\n  B: Shakila's secretary has admitted that he is illegally receiving cable television without paying for it. Shakila would not be justified in reporting him, though, since she once did the same thing.\n  C: After Takashi told Sarah's parents that he had seen her at the movies on Tuesday, Sarah confessed to sneaking out that day. On Monday, however, Takashi had violated the local curfew for minors. Hence Sarah's parents cannot justifiably punish her in this case.\n  D: After a conservation officer discovered them, Kuttner admitted that he had set the illegal animal traps on his land. But, because she was trespassing at the time, the conservation officer cannot justifiably punish Kuttner in this case.\n  E: Ramirez was forced by the discovery of new evidence to admit that she lied about her role in managing the chief of staff's financial affairs. Nevertheless, the board of directors cannot justifiably take action against Ramirez, because in past instances it has pardoned others guilty of similar improprieties.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\n"

        "content": "  Topic: Law\nQuestion: Which one of the following judgments best illustrates the principle illustrated by the argument above?\n\nReflection:\nAfter reevaluating the question, I realized that the correct answer is (E) Ramirez was forced by the discovery of new evidence to admit that she lied about her role in managing the chief of staff's financial affairs. Nevertheless, the board of directors cannot justifiably take action against Ramirez, because in past instances it has pardoned others guilty of similar improprieties.\n\nExplanation:\nThe argument above highlights the principle that justifiable punitive measures can only be taken against someone who has engaged in illegal activities, and not against someone who has been wronged by illegal means. In this case, the company obtained the evidence of Ellison's illegal transactions by illegally recording his conversations. Therefore, the company cannot justifiably take punitive measures against Ellison.\n\nThe other options do not illustrate this principle:\n\n(A) does not relate to the principle of justifiable punishment, as it involves a different scenario where one person is punishing another for a different wrongdoing.\n\n(B) is irrelevant, as it involves a different scenario where one person is not punishing another, but rather reporting them for an illegal act.\n\n(C) is also irrelevant, as it involves a different scenario where one person is punishing another for a different wrongdoing.\n\n(D) is incorrect, as the conservation officer in this scenario is not punishing Kuttner, but rather discovering and reporting his illegal activity.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (E), which illustrates the principle that justifiable punitive measures can only be taken against someone who has engaged in illegal activities, and not against someone who has been wronged by illegal means."
