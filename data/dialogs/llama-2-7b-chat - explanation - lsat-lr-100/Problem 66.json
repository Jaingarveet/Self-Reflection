The verbiage is intended to make the instructions more precise, but greater precision is of little use if most jurors have difficulty understanding the instructions. Since it is more important for jurors to have a basic but adequate understanding of their role than it is for the details of that role to be precisely specified, jury instructions should be formulated in simple, easily comprehensible language.\nQuestion: Each of the following, if true, strengthens the lawyer's argumoot EXCEPT:\nChoices:\n  A: Most jurors are less likely to understand instructions given in convoluted, legalistic language than instructions given in simple, easily comprehensible language.\n  B: Most jurors do not have an adequate understanding of their role after being given jury instructions in convoluted, legalistic language.\n  C: Jury instructions formulated in simple, easily comprehensible language can adequately descrthe the role of the jurors.\n  D: The details of the role of the jurors cannot be specified with complete precision in simple, easily comprehensible language.\n  E: Jurors do not need to know the precise details of their role in order to have an adequate understanding of that role.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\n"

Here is my revised reflection:\n\nI previously answered choice B, \"Most jurors do not have an adequate understanding of their role after being given jury instructions in convoluted, legalistic language.\" However, upon further reflection, I realize that this answer is incorrect. While it is true that many jurors may struggle to understand complex legal language, it is still possible to provide clear and concise instructions that adequately describe the role of the jurors without using overly technical language.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is choice E, \"Jurors do not need to know the precise details of their role in order to have an adequate understanding of that role.\" Jurors can still understand their basic responsibilities and duties without needing to know every nuance of the law.\n\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
