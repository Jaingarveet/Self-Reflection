However, this reasoning may be flawed because it assumes that the presence of hormones in tears is the sole cause of emotional stress, rather than one of many factors. It is possible that other factors, such as the body's natural response to stress or the emotional support of social interactions, play a more significant role in reducing emotional stress.\n\nCorrect Answer: C - fails to adequately address the possibility that, even if one phenomenon causally contributes to a second phenomenon, the second phenomenon may causally influence the first as well\n\nExplanation:\nThe argument assumes a linear causal relationship between crying and emotional stress, where the removal of hormones from the body through tears is the sole cause of reduced emotional stress. However, this oversimplifies the complex interplay of factors that contribute to emotional stress and the potential feedback loops between these factors. It is possible that emotional stress can influence the production of hormones in tears, creating a feedback loop where emotional stress and hormone levels are interdependent. Therefore, the argument fails to adequately address this complexity and the potential influence of emotional stress on hormone production."
