The correct answer is (D) presents no reason why Bruch Industries would not want its membership in the trade group to be known.\n\nExplanation:\nThe journalist's argument is based on the assumption that Bruch Industries is not listed on the document, which implies that it is not a member of the trade group. However, the journalist does not provide any evidence to support this assumption. In fact, the representative of the trade group confirmed that every company listed in the document does indeed belong to the trade group, including Bruch Industries. Therefore, there is no reason to believe that Bruch Industries would not want its membership in the trade group to be known.\n\n[REDACTED]"
