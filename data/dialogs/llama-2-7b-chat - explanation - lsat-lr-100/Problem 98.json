This can be seen from the fact that those responsible for technological advances are almost without exception motivated by considerations of personal gain rather than societal benefit in that they strive to develop commercially viable technology.\nQuestion: The argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it\nChoices:\n  A: contains a premise that cannot possibly be true\n  B: takes for granted that technology beneficial to society as a whole cannot be commercially viable\n  C: fails to consider the possibility that actions motivated by a desire for personal gain often do not result in personal gain\n  D: takes for granted that an action is unlikely to produce a certain outcome unless it is motivated by a desire to produce that outcome\n  E: draws a conclusion about the practical consequences of people's actions on the basis of theoretical views about what people should or should not do\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nThe argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it assumes that an action is unlikely to produce a certain outcome unless it is motivated by a desire to produce that outcome. This is the correct answer, as the argument's conclusion that technological advancements are rarely beneficial to society as a whole is based on the assumption that personal gain is the primary motivator for technological innovation, which may not always be true.\n\nThe other options are not the correct reasons for why the argument is vulnerable to criticism:\n\nOption [REDACTED] is incorrect because the argument does not contain a premise that cannot possibly be true. While it is true that some technological advancements may have unintended consequences, this is not a reason to criticize the argument.\n\nOption [REDACTED] is incorrect because the argument does not take for granted that technology beneficial to society as a whole cannot be commercially viable. The argument assumes that personal gain is the primary motivator for technological innovation, but this does not necessarily mean that technologically beneficial advancements cannot also be commercially viable.\n\nOption [REDACTED] is incorrect because the argument does not fail to consider the possibility that actions motivated by a desire for personal gain often do not result in personal gain. While it is true that some actions motivated by personal gain may not lead to the desired outcome, this is not a reason to criticize the argument.\n\nOption [REDACTED] is incorrect because the argument does not draw a conclusion about the practical consequences of people's actions on the basis of theoretical views about what people should or should not do. The argument's conclusion is based on the assumption that personal gain is the primary motivator for technological innovation, which may or may not be true.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) The argument assumes that an action is unlikely to produce a certain outcome unless it is motivated by a desire to produce that outcome.\n"
