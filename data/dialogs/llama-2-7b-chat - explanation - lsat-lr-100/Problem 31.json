Although new recycling projects could greatly reduce this amount, these projects would actually be counterproductive to the goal of minimizing the overall amount of environmental damage.\nQuestion: Which one of the following, if true, would most help to resolve the apparent inconsistency in the mayor's claims about new recycling projects?\nChoices:\n  A: The vehicles that pick up materials for recycling create less pollution than would be caused by incinerating those materials.\n  B: The great costs of new recycling projects would prevent other pollution-reducing projects from being undertaken.\n  C: The mayor's city has nearly exhausted its landfill space and therefore must incinerate much of its garbage.\n  D: More recycling would give industries in the mayor's city a greater incentive to use recycled materials in their manufacturing processes.\n  E: People who recycle feel less justified in consuming more than they need than do people who do not recycle.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nThe correct answer is (B) [REDACTED]\n\nThe passage states that the mayor's goal is to minimize overall environmental damage, but the new recycling projects would be counterproductive to this goal. The statement \"The great costs of new recycling projects would prevent other pollution-reducing projects from being undertaken\" explains why this is the case. If the city is investing a significant amount of resources in new recycling projects, it may not have the budget or resources to undertake other pollution-reducing projects that could be more effective in minimizing environmental damage.\n\nThe other options do not address the inconsistency in the mayor's claims:\n\n* (A) The vehicles that pick up materials for recycling create less pollution than would be caused by incinerating those materials is irrelevant to the mayor's goal of minimizing overall environmental damage.\n* (D) More recycling would give industries in the mayor's city a greater incentive to use recycled materials in their manufacturing processes is also irrelevant, as it does not address the issue of disposing of waste.\n* (E) People who recycle feel less justified in consuming more than they need is a psychological effect that does not directly address the mayor's goal of minimizing overall environmental damage.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) [REDACTED]\n"
