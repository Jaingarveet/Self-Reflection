The same bacteria also show a strong resistance to antibiotics. This suggests that the bacteria's exposure to the heavy metals in the sewage sludge has somehow promoted their resistance to antibiotics.\nQuestion: Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the microbiologist's argument?\nChoices:\n  A: Most bacteria that are not resistant to antibiotics are not resistant to heavy-metal poisoning either.\n  B: Bacteria that live in sewage sludge that is free of heavy metals, but is in other respects similar to normal sewage, are generally resistant to neither heavy-metal poisoning nor antibiotics.\n  C: Antibiotic resistance of bacteria that survive in sewage sludge in which heavy metals are concentrated contributes to their resistance to heavy-metal poisoning.\n  D: Sewage sludge that contains high concentrations of heavy metals almost always contains significant concentrations of antibiotics.\n  E: Many kinds of bacteria that do not live in sewage sludge are resistant to both heavy-metal poisoning and antibiotics.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\n"

I realized that the correct answer is (C) Antibiotic resistance of bacteria that survive in sewage sludge in which heavy metals are concentrated contributes to their resistance to heavy-metal poisoning.\n\nExplanation:\nThe microbiologist's argument is that the bacteria that survive in sewage sludge have evolved the unusual ability to resist heavy-metal poisoning due to their exposure to heavy metals in the sewage sludge. Option (C) supports this argument by suggesting that the bacteria's exposure to antibiotics in the sewage sludge contributes to their resistance to heavy-metal poisoning. This means that the bacteria's exposure to both heavy metals and antibiotics in the sewage sludge has promoted their resistance to both. Therefore, option (C) most strengthens the microbiologist's argument.\n\n[REDACTED]"
