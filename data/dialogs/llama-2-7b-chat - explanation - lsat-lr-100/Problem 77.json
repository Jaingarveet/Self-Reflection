        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Counselor: Many people assume that personal conflicts are inevitable, but that assumption is just not so. Personal conflicts arise primarily because people are being irrational. For instance, people often find it easier to ascribe bad qualities to a person than good ones-even when there is more evidence of the latter. If someone suspects that a friend is unreliable, for example, a single instance may turn this suspicion into a feeling of certainty, whereas a belief that someone is reliable is normally built up only after many years of personal interaction.\nQuestion: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main conclusion drawn in the argument?\nChoices:\n  A: Many people assume that personal conflicts are inevitable.\n  B: Even when there is more evidence of good qualities than of bad ones, people find it easier to ascribe bad qualities than good ones.\n  C: It is irrational to allow a single instance to turn one's suspicion that a friend is unreliable into a feeling of certainty.\n  D: Personal conflicts are not inevitable.\n  E: Unlike a suspicion that a friend is unreliable, a belief that someone is reliable is normally built up only after many years of personal interaction.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nThe main conclusion drawn in the argument is that people find it easier to ascribe bad qualities to a person than good ones, even when there is more evidence of the latter. This is the best answer choice because the argument highlights how people tend to be more quick to attribute negative qualities to someone than positive ones, even when the evidence suggests otherwise.\n\nThe other answer choices do not accurately express the main conclusion of the argument:\n\nA) Many people assume that personal conflicts are inevitable: This is not the main conclusion of the argument, as the author argues that personal conflicts are not inevitable.\n\nB) Even when there is more evidence of good qualities than of bad ones, people find it easier to ascribe bad qualities than good ones: This is the correct answer choice, as the argument highlights how people tend to be more quick to attribute negative qualities to someone than positive ones, even when the evidence suggests otherwise.\n\nC) It is irrational to allow a single instance to turn one's suspicion that a friend is unreliable into a feeling of certainty: This answer choice is not related to the main conclusion of the argument, as the author is not discussing the rationality of suspicions or feelings of certainty.\n\nE) Unlike a suspicion that a friend is unreliable, a belief that someone is reliable is normally built up only after many years of personal interaction: This answer choice is also not related to the main conclusion of the argument, as the author is not discussing the time it takes to build up beliefs about someone's reliability.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) [REDACTED]\n"

The main conclusion of the argument is that people tend to attribute negative qualities to someone more easily than positive qualities, even when there is more evidence of the latter. This is best answered by choice (B) Even when there is more evidence of good qualities than of bad ones, people find it easier to ascribe bad qualities than good ones.\n\nI made the mistake of overlooking the key point of the argument, which is the tendency of people to be more quick to attribute negative qualities to someone than positive ones, even when the evidence suggests otherwise.
