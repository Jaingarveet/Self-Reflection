Hence, the primary goal of movie executives is to maximize the number of people who see a film. However, it is not the primary goal of television executives to maximize the number of viewers for their shows.\nQuestion: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain the difference between the goals of movie executives and those of television executives?\nChoices:\n  A: More people are willing to see a film more than once than are willing to watch a television show more than once.\n  B: There is no analog in television to the large profits that owners of movie theaters make by selling refreshments to their customers.\n  C: The average cost of producing an hour of film is much greater than the average cost of producing an hour of television.\n  D: Television shows make their profits from sponsors, who are chiefly concerned with the purchasing power of the people who watch a television show.\n  E: Over half of the most popular television shows are shows that viewers do not have to pay to watch.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nThe correct answer is (D) [REDACTED]\n\nThe difference in the goals of movie executives and television executives can be attributed to the difference in revenue streams. Movie executives primarily rely on ticket sales to generate profits, which requires a large audience. In contrast, television executives rely on advertising revenue, which is generated through sponsorships. Sponsors are primarily concerned with the purchasing power of the people who watch a television show, which means they are more interested in attracting a loyal audience rather than maximizing the number of viewers. Therefore, the primary goal of television executives is not to maximize the number of viewers but to create engaging content that attracts a loyal audience.\n\nKeywords:\n\n* Revenue streams\n* Ticket sales\n* Advertising revenue\n* Sponsorships\n* Purchasing power\n* Loyal audience\n"
