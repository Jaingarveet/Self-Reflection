Here's my revised answer:\n\nThe argument is flawed in that it:\n\nE: fails to adequately address the possibility that Riley's animosity toward the university president is well founded.\n\nThe argument assumes that just because Riley has a long-standing feud with the president, her claim that the president's speech was inflammatory must be false. However, this assumption ignores the possibility that Riley's animosity towards the president may be based on legitimate reasons. Therefore, we should not dismiss Riley's claim solely on the basis of her feud with the president.\n\nIn conclusion, the argument fails to provide adequate reasons to support its conclusion that the president's speech was not inappropriate. Therefore, the correct answer is (E) fails to adequately address the possibility that Riley's animosity toward the university president is well founded."
