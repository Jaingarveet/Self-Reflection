        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: An administrator must assign parking spaces to six new employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young. Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.\nQuestion: For how many of the six new employees is the assignment of a parking space limited to one of only two possible spaces?\nChoices:\n  A: none\n  B: two\n  C: three\n  D: four\n  E: five\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\n## Reflection on Incorrect Answer\n**Explanation:** My error stemmed from overlooking the constraints placed on Souza and Togowa by the given rules. While I correctly identified Young's limitation to two spaces (#2 or #3), I failed to recognize that Souza and Togowa were also restricted in their possible assignments due to their relationships with Xu and Young, respectively.\n**Error Keywords:**\n*   Logic error\n*   Constraint oversight\n*   Relationship misinterpretation \n## Step-by-Step Solution\n1. **Robertson's Constraint:** Robertson must be in one of #1-4. This leaves #5 and #6 for the remaining employees.\n2. **Young's Constraint:** Young must be higher than Togowa and lower than Robertson. Since Robertson is limited to #1-4, Young can only be in **#2 or #3**.\n3. **Xu's Constraint:** Xu must be higher than Souza. This means Souza cannot be in #6 (as there's no higher space) and is limited to **#1-5**.\n4. **Togowa's Constraint:** Togowa must be lower than Young. Since Young can only be in #2 or #3, Togowa is limited to **#1 or #2**.\n5. **Souza and Xu's Remaining Options:** With Togowa and Young potentially occupying #1 and #2, and Robertson occupying one of #1-4, Souza is further restricted to **#4 or #5**. Consequently, Xu can only be in **#5 or #6**.\nTherefore, four employees (Young, Togowa, Souza, and Xu) have only two possible parking space assignments each. \n## Instructions for Future Problem Solving\n1. **Identify all individual constraints:**  List each employee and their specific limitations based on the given rules.\n2. **Analyze relationships between constraints:**  Understand how the limitations of one employee impact the options for others.\n3. **Eliminate impossible options:**  Cross out parking spaces that become unavailable due to the established constraints.\n4. **Iteratively refine possibilities:**  As you determine limitations for one employee, revisit the options for others to see if their possibilities are further reduced.\n5. **Count employees with only two options:**  Once all constraints are applied, identify the number of employees with only two remaining parking space possibilities.\n## General Advice for Similar Problems\n*   **Visualize the problem:**  Consider using diagrams or tables to represent the relationships and constraints between elements.\n*   **Work systematically:**  Avoid jumping to conclusions and instead follow a logical step-by-step process.\n*   **Consider all possibilities:**  Don't overlook any potential scenarios or constraints, even if they seem unlikely at first.\n*   **Review and revise:**  Double-check your reasoning and ensure you haven't missed any crucial details or made any logical errors.\n"
