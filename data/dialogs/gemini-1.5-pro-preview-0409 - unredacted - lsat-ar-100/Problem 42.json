        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: A panel of five scientists will be formed. The panelists will be selected from among three botanists—F, G, and H—three chemists—K, L, and M—and three zoologists—P, Q, and R. Selection is governed by the following conditions: The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types. If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. F and K cannot both be selected. K and M cannot both be selected. If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.\nQuestion: Which one of the following is an acceptable selection of scientists for the panel?\nChoices:\n  A: F, G, K, P, Q\n  B: G, H, K, L, M\n  C: G, H, K, L, R\n  D: H, K, M, P, R\n  E: H, L, M, P, Q\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\n## Reflection on Incorrect Answer\n**Explanation:** My error stemmed from misinterpreting the second rule regarding the selection of botanists and zoologists. I incorrectly assumed that having more than one botanist automatically limited the panel to only one zoologist. \n**Error Keywords:**\n*   Misinterpretation \n*   Logical Error\n*   Conditional Rule Misunderstanding\n## Step-by-Step Solution\n1.  **Eliminate options without representation from each category:** This correctly eliminates options A and E.\n2.  **Analyze remaining options based on botanist/zoologist rule:** \n    *   Option B does not violate the rule as it has only one zoologist (R).\n    *   Option C and D both satisfy this rule. \n3.  **Apply the rule concerning M, P, and R:**\n    *   Option C does not include M, so this rule is irrelevant.\n    *   Option D includes M but does not include both P and R, violating the rule.\n4.  **Verify remaining option against all rules:** Option C satisfies all conditions with one botanist (H), two chemists (K and L), and one zoologist (R).\n## Instructions for Future Problem Solving\n1.  **Carefully read and understand all given conditions/rules.**\n2.  **Break down complex rules into simpler components.**\n3.  **Apply each rule systematically to eliminate options.**\n4.  **Double-check remaining options against all rules before finalizing the answer.**\n5.  **Pay close attention to the logical connections between rules.** \n## General Advice for Similar Problems\n*   **Focus on accuracy over speed.**\n*   **Don't make assumptions or jump to conclusions.**\n*   **Consider all possibilities before eliminating options.**\n*   **Practice with similar logic-based problems to improve comprehension and reasoning skills.** \n*   **If unsure, try rephrasing the rules in your own words for better understanding.**\n"
