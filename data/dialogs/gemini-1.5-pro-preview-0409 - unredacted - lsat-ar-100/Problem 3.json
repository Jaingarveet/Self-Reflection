        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: An administrator must assign parking spaces to six new employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young. Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.\nQuestion: If Robertson is assigned parking space #3, then which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Souza is assigned parking space #4.\n  B: Togowa is assigned parking space #2.\n  C: Vaughn is assigned parking space #5.\n  D: Xu is assigned parking space #6.\n  E: Young is assigned parking space #2.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\n## Reflection on Incorrect Answer\n**Explanation:** My reasoning was flawed because I focused on the most likely scenario rather than the absolute certainty required by the word \"must.\" While my deductions were logical, they didn't account for all possible valid arrangements.\n**Error Keywords:**\n*   Logic error\n*   Assumption error\n*   Misinterpretation of \"must\"\n## Step-by-Step Solution\n1.  **Robertson in #3:** This implies Young must be in #4, #5, or #6 (Robertson > Young).\n2.  **Remaining spaces:** This leaves #1, #2, and one of #4, #5, or #6 for Souza, Togowa, Xu, and Vaughn.\n3.  **Xu and Souza:** The rule Xu > Souza doesn't provide specific placement yet.\n4.  **Young and Togowa:** Since Young > Togowa and Young is in #4, #5, or #6, Togowa can be in #1 or #2.\n5.  **Crucial deduction:**  **If Togowa is in #1, then Young MUST be in #2** to satisfy Young > Togowa. This is the only option that guarantees a \"must be true\" condition.\n## Instructions for Future\n1.  **Identify fixed placements:** Start with rules that directly assign spaces (like Robertson).\n2.  **Analyze relative placements:** Deduce the order of other employees based on given rules (Young > Togowa, Xu > Souza).\n3.  **Consider all possibilities:** Don't focus on the most likely scenario; explore all valid arrangements.\n4.  **Focus on \"must\":**  Identify the option that holds true in every possible valid arrangement, not just the most likely one.\n## General Advice\n*   **Read carefully:** Pay close attention to keywords like \"must,\" \"could,\" or \"cannot.\"\n*   **Logic over assumptions:** Base deductions on given rules, not assumptions about likelihood.\n*   **Consider all cases:** Explore all valid scenarios before drawing conclusions.\n*   **Review and revise:** Double-check your reasoning and ensure it aligns with the question's requirements.\n"
