        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: An administrator must assign parking spaces to six new employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young. Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.\nQuestion: Which one of the following could be the assignment of parking spaces to the new employees?\nChoices:\n  A: #1: Young; #2: Souza; #3: Vaughn; #4: Robertson; #5: Togowa; #6: Xu\n  B: #1: Vaughn; #2: Togowa; #3: Young; #4: Souza; #5: Robertson; #6: Xu\n  C: #1: Togowa; #2: Young; #3: Xu; #4: Robertson; #5: Souza; #6: Vaughn\n  D: #1: Togowa; #2: Robertson; #3: Young; #4: Souza; #5: Vaughn; #6: Xu\n  E: #1: Souza; #2: Togowa; #3: Young; #4: Robertson; #5: Xu; #6: Vaughn\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\n## Reflection on Incorrect Answer\n**Explanation:** My error stemmed from misinterpreting the \"greater than\" symbol (>) in the context of parking space numbers. I incorrectly assumed it meant \"assigned a parking space to the right of\" when it actually meant \"assigned a higher-numbered parking space.\"\n**Error Keywords:**\n*   Logical reasoning error\n*   Misinterpretation of symbols \n*   Ordering/comparison error\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n1. **Young > Togowa:** Young must have a higher-numbered space than Togowa.\n2. **Xu > Souza:** Xu must have a higher-numbered space than Souza.\n3. **Robertson > Young:** Robertson must have a higher-numbered space than Young.\n4. **Robertson in #1-#4:** Robertson must be assigned one of the first four spaces.\nAnalyzing options with the correct interpretation:\n*   **A:** Violates Robertson > Young.\n*   **B:** Violates Robertson > Young and Robertson's parking space assignment.\n*   **C:** Violates Robertson > Young.\n*   **D:** Violates Robertson > Young.\n*   **E:**  **Satisfies all conditions.** \n**Instructions for Future Problems:**\n1. **Carefully read and understand the problem:** Pay close attention to the meaning of symbols and keywords.\n2. **Identify all constraints and conditions:** List all the rules and requirements that must be met.\n3. **Analyze each option systematically:** Check each option against all the conditions to ensure it satisfies every requirement.\n4. **Consider alternative interpretations:** If stuck, think about different ways to interpret the language or symbols used in the problem.\n5. **Double-check your reasoning:** Review your thought process and ensure your logic is sound.\n**General Advice for Similar Problems:**\n*   **Break down complex problems:** Divide the problem into smaller, more manageable parts.\n*   **Focus on the details:** Pay attention to specific wording and symbols, as they can significantly impact the solution.\n*   **Think step-by-step:** Avoid jumping to conclusions and work through the problem logically.\n*   **Learn from mistakes:** Analyze your errors to understand where you went wrong and how to avoid similar mistakes in the future. \n*   **Practice regularly:** The more you practice solving problems, the better you will become at identifying and avoiding potential pitfalls.\n"
