        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Exactly eight books—F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O—are placed on a bookcase with exactly three shelves—the top shelf, the middle shelf, and the bottom shelf. At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.\nQuestion: If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: F and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  B: G and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  C: H and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  D: I and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  E: K and O are placed on the same shelf as each other.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\n## Reflection on Incorrect Answer\n**Explanation:** My error stemmed from a misinterpretation of the constraint \"More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.\" I focused on filling the bottom shelf with two books to satisfy this condition without considering the possibility of three books on the middle shelf.\n**Error Keywords:**\n*   Misinterpretation \n*   Constraint violation\n*   Logical reasoning error\n## Step-by-Step Solution\n1. **Analyze Constraints:**\n    *   L is above H.\n    *   I is on the middle shelf.\n    *   K is above F.\n    *   O is above L.\n    *   F and M are on the same shelf.\n    *   Bottom shelf has more books than the top shelf.\n2. **Deductions:**\n    *   O must be on the top shelf (above L).\n    *   L and K cannot be on the bottom shelf (above H and F respectively).\n3. **Placement:**\n    *   **Top Shelf:** O \n    *   **Middle Shelf:** I \n    *   **Bottom Shelf:** (at least 2 books)\n4. **Filling Shelves:**\n    *   Since L and K are not on the bottom shelf, and it needs at least 2 books, F and M must be there.\n    *   This leaves H and G for the middle shelf with I.\n5. **Conclusion:** H and M are on the same shelf (middle).\n## Instructions for Future Problem Solving\n1. **Carefully analyze each constraint and its implications.**\n2. **Draw a diagram or use a table to visualize the relationships.**\n3. **Start with the most restrictive constraints and work from there.**\n4. **Consider all possibilities before making assumptions.**\n5. **Double-check your solution against all the given conditions.**\n## General Advice for Similar Problems\n*   **Break down complex problems into smaller, manageable steps.**\n*   **Pay close attention to wording and avoid misinterpretations.**\n*   **Use logic and reasoning to eliminate possibilities.**\n*   **Don't jump to conclusions; consider all options systematically.**\n*   **Practice similar problems to improve your logical reasoning skills.**\n"
