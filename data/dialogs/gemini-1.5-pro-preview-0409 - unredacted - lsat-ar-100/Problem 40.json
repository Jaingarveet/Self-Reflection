        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: A shopping center has exactly seven spaces—space 1 through space 7—arranged in a straight row. Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.\nQuestion: If the shoe store is in space 2, which one of the following could be true?\nChoices:\n  A: The optometrist is in space 5.\n  B: The pharmacy is in space 1.\n  C: A restaurant is in space 3.\n  D: The toy store is in space 6.\n  E: The veterinarian is in space 4.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\n## Reflection on Incorrect Answer\n**Explanation:** My error stemmed from focusing too much on satisfying the constraints related to the pharmacy and restaurants, while neglecting the constraint about the toy store not being next to the veterinarian. This oversight led me to choose an option that violated that specific constraint.\n**Error Keywords:**\n* Constraint violation\n* Oversight\n* Focus on specific constraints\n* Neglecting other constraints\n## Step-by-Step Solution\n1. **Analyze Constraints:**\n    * Pharmacy at one end (space 1 or 7)\n    * Restaurants at opposite ends with at least 2 spaces between them.\n    * Pharmacy next to optometrist or veterinarian.\n    * Toy store not next to veterinarian.\n2. **Shoe Store in Space 2:** This eliminates options involving space 2.\n3. **Pharmacy Placement:** Option B (space 1) is possible. This forces a restaurant in space 7 due to the separation constraint.\n4. **Eliminate Options:** Options C and D are eliminated due to the restaurant placement.\n5. **Remaining Options:** A and E remain.\n6. **Analyze Option A:**\n    * Optometrist in space 5.\n    * This allows for the veterinarian in space 4 (next to the pharmacy) and the toy store in space 3 (not next to the veterinarian). \n    * **This option satisfies all constraints.**\n7. **Analyze Option E:**\n    * Veterinarian in space 4.\n    * This would require the toy store to be in space 1 (next to the pharmacy) which violates the constraint of not being next to the veterinarian.\n    * **This option violates a constraint.**\nTherefore, the correct answer is **A: The optometrist is in space 5.** \n## Instructions for Future Problem Solving\n1. **List all constraints explicitly.**\n2. **Eliminate options that directly violate constraints.**\n3. **Consider the remaining options one by one.**\n4. **For each option, check if it satisfies ALL constraints.**\n5. **If an option violates even one constraint, eliminate it.**\n6. **Choose the option that satisfies all constraints.**\n## General Advice for Similar Problems\n* **Read and understand all constraints carefully before attempting a solution.**\n* **Focus on each constraint individually, but don't neglect the others.**\n* **Consider all possible scenarios and eliminate options that violate any constraint.**\n* **Work systematically and step-by-step to avoid oversights.**\n* **Double-check your reasoning and ensure the chosen option satisfies all conditions.**\n"
