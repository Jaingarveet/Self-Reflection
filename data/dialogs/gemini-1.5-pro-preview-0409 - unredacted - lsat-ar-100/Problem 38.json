        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Exactly eight books—F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O—are placed on a bookcase with exactly three shelves—the top shelf, the middle shelf, and the bottom shelf. At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.\nQuestion: If G is placed on the top shelf, then which one of the following could be a complete and accurate list of the books placed on the middle shelf?\nChoices:\n  A: H, I\n  B: I, L\n  C: H, I, L\n  D: I, K, L\n  E: F, I, M\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\n## Reflection on Incorrect Answer\n**Explanation:** My error was assuming that because F and M were together, they could not be on the middle shelf with K above them. I neglected the possibility of F and M being on the bottom shelf with K on the middle shelf.\n**Error Keywords:**\n*   Logic error\n*   Assumption error\n*   Placement constraint misinterpretation \n## Step-by-Step Solution\n1.  **Top Shelf:** G is placed here, leaving space for only one more book due to the constraint.\n2.  **Middle Shelf:** I is placed here. We need to find two more books that can fit.\n3.  **Bottom Shelf:** This shelf must have more books than the top shelf, so at least 3 books will be placed here.\n4.  **Analyzing Remaining Books:**\n    *   F and M must be together.\n    *   K must be above F.\n    *   O must be above L.\n5.  **Possible Arrangements:**\n    *   **Top Shelf:** G, H  \n    *   **Middle Shelf:** I, K, L \n    *   **Bottom Shelf:** F, M, O \nThis arrangement satisfies all conditions. \n## Instructions for Future Similar Problems\n1.  **Identify Constraints:** List all conditions and restrictions given in the problem.\n2.  **Start with Fixed Placements:** Place the books with specific shelf assignments first.\n3.  **Analyze Remaining Books:** Group books that must be together and consider their placement restrictions relative to others.\n4.  **Consider Shelf Capacity:** Remember the constraint about the number of books on each shelf.\n5.  **Explore Possibilities:** Try different arrangements that satisfy all conditions.\n6.  **Eliminate Invalid Options:** Rule out choices that violate any of the constraints.\n7.  **Verify the Solution:** Double-check that the final arrangement satisfies all conditions.\n## General Advice for Similar Problems\n*   **Read Carefully:** Pay close attention to each constraint and avoid making assumptions.\n*   **Visualize:**  Try drawing a diagram or using a table to represent the shelves and book placements.\n*   **Be Systematic:** Work through the problem step-by-step, considering all possibilities.\n*   **Check for Consistency:** Ensure that the final solution does not contradict any of the given conditions. \n*   **Practice:** The more you practice solving logic puzzles, the better you will become at identifying patterns and avoiding errors.\n"
