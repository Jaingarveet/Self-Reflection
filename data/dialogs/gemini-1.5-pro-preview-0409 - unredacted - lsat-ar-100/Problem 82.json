Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.\nQuestion: Which one of the following could be an accurate matching of the sales representatives to the sales zones in which they work?\nChoices:\n  A: Zone 1: Kim, Parra Zone 2: Stuckey, Udall Zone 3: Mahr, Quinn, Tiao\n  B: Zone 1: Kim, Tiao Zone 2: Stuckey, Udall Zone 3: Mahr, Parra, Quinn\n  C: Zone 1: Parra, Quinn Zone 2: Kim, Udall Zone 3: Mahr, Stuckey, Tiao\n  D: Zone 1: Stuckey, Udall Zone 2: Kim, Tiao Zone 3: Mahr, Parra, Quinn\n  E: Zone 1: Tiao Zone 2: Kim, Parra, Quinn Zone 3: Stuckey, Udall\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\n## Reflection on Incorrect Answer\n**Explanation:** My error stemmed from misinterpreting the constraint \"There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.\" I incorrectly assumed this meant Zone 3 must have at least 3 representatives, leading me to eliminate option B.\n**Error Keywords:**\n*   Misinterpretation \n*   Constraint violation\n*   Logical reasoning error\n## Step-by-Step Solution\n1. **Parra and Quinn together:** This eliminates options A and C.\n2. **Stuckey and Udall together:** This eliminates option D.\n3. **Zone 3 has more representatives than Zone 2:** This is satisfied by both options B and E.\n4. **Remaining constraints:**\n    *   Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) in Zone 1.\n    *   Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) in Zone 2.\n5. **Option E violates the constraint** as it places Tiao in Zone 1 and Udall in Zone 3, meaning neither is in Zone 2.\n6. **Therefore, the correct answer is B**, which satisfies all constraints.\n## Instructions for Future Problem Solving\n1. **Carefully analyze each constraint** and its implications.\n2. **Eliminate options that violate any constraint.**\n3. **Pay close attention to numerical constraints** and their possible interpretations.\n4. **Consider all remaining options** against the remaining constraints.\n5. **Choose the option that satisfies all constraints.**\n## General Advice for Similar Problems\n*   **Read the problem and constraints multiple times** to ensure full understanding.\n*   **Break down complex constraints into simpler parts** for easier analysis.\n*   **Consider all possible interpretations of constraints** before eliminating options.\n*   **Use a systematic approach** to eliminate options and reach the correct answer.\n*   **Practice similar problems** to improve logical reasoning and problem-solving skills.\n"
