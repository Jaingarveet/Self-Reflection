        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Exactly eight books—F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O—are placed on a bookcase with exactly three shelves—the top shelf, the middle shelf, and the bottom shelf. At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.\nQuestion: It is fully determined which of the shelves each of the books is placed on if which one of the following is true?\nChoices:\n  A: I and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  B: K and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  C: L and F are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  D: M and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  E: H and O are placed on the same shelf as each other.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\n## Reflection on Incorrect Answer\n**Explanation:**\nMy error stemmed from overlooking the implications of placing I and M on the same shelf and focusing too much on the placement of O and L. I failed to recognize that fixing I and M restricts the placement of other books due to the given conditions, leading to a unique arrangement.\n**Error Keywords:**\n*   Logic error\n*   Inference error\n*   Overlooking constraints\n## Step-by-Step Solution with Correct Answer\n1.  **Analyze Option A:** If I and M are on the same shelf, then F must also be on that shelf (middle shelf due to I's placement).\n2.  **Consider K:** K must be above F, so it can only be on the top shelf.\n3.  **Consider O and L:** O must be above L. Since the middle and top shelves are occupied, L must be on the bottom shelf, and O must be on the middle shelf with I, M, and F.\n4.  **Remaining Books:** This leaves only G and H. Since the bottom shelf needs at least two books, both G and H must be placed there.\nTherefore, option A uniquely determines the placement of all books:\n*   **Top Shelf:** K\n*   **Middle Shelf:** I, M, F, O\n*   **Bottom Shelf:** G, H, L \n## Instructions for Future Problem Solving\n1.  **Analyze each option carefully:** Consider the implications of each option on the placement of all books, not just a few.\n2.  **Focus on the given conditions:** Use the given conditions to eliminate possibilities and narrow down placements.\n3.  **Work step-by-step:**  Don't jump to conclusions; systematically analyze the placement of each book based on the given conditions and the chosen option.\n4.  **Visualize the shelves:**  Drawing a diagram of the shelves and placing books as you analyze can help visualize the arrangement and avoid errors.\n## General Advice for Similar Problems\n*   **Pay attention to detail:** Small details in the problem statement can have significant implications for the solution.\n*   **Think critically:** Don't just accept information at face value; analyze its consequences and connections to other facts.\n*   **Consider all possibilities:** Explore different options and their implications before settling on an answer.\n*   **Practice logical reasoning:** Regularly engage in activities that challenge your logical thinking skills.\n"
