        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: A shopping center has exactly seven spaces—space 1 through space 7—arranged in a straight row. Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.\nQuestion: If the veterinarian is in space 5, which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: The optometrist is in space 2.\n  B: The pharmacy is in space 7.\n  C: A restaurant is in space 4.\n  D: The shoe store is in space 6.\n  E: The toy store is in space 3.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\n## Reflection on Incorrect Answer\n**Explanation:** My reasoning focused on eliminating options based on the veterinarian's placement and the constraint regarding the toy store. However, I failed to fully consider the implications of the restaurant placement restrictions and their impact on the remaining spaces.\n**Error Keywords:**\n*   Logic error\n*   Constraint misinterpretation \n*   Incomplete analysis\n## Step-by-Step Solution\n1.  **Veterinarian in space 5:** This leaves spaces 1-4 and 6-7 for the remaining businesses.\n2.  **Restaurant placement:** One restaurant must be at an end (space 1 or 7), and they must have at least two spaces between them. \n3.  **Impact on remaining spaces:** With the veterinarian in space 5, placing a restaurant at either end (space 1 or 7) forces the other restaurant to be in space 4 to maintain the required separation.\nTherefore, regardless of the other placements, a restaurant **must** be in space 4.\n## Instructions for Future Problem Solving\n1.  **Identify fixed elements:** Begin by noting the placement of any businesses with fixed positions.\n2.  **Analyze constraints:** Carefully consider each constraint and its implications for the remaining businesses.\n3.  **Visualize the scenario:** Draw a diagram or mentally map the spaces to better understand the spatial relationships and limitations.\n4.  **Consider all possibilities:** Explore different placement options while adhering to the constraints.\n5.  **Focus on \"must be true\":** Eliminate options that are not guaranteed by the constraints, even if they seem likely.\n## General Advice for Similar Problems\n*   **Break down complex constraints:** Divide complex restrictions into smaller, easier-to-analyze parts.\n*   **Pay attention to wording:**  Distinguish between \"must,\" \"could,\" and \"cannot\" to understand the certainty of each condition.\n*   **Think step-by-step:** Avoid jumping to conclusions and carefully consider each deduction.\n*   **Review and revise:** Double-check your reasoning and ensure you haven't overlooked any possibilities or contradictions.\n"
