        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Exactly eight books—F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O—are placed on a bookcase with exactly three shelves—the top shelf, the middle shelf, and the bottom shelf. At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.\nQuestion: Which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: O is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf M is placed on.\n  B: K is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf G is placed on.\n  C: I is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf F is placed on.\n  D: G is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf O is placed on.\n  E: F is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf L is placed on.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\n## Reflection on Incorrect Answer\n**Explanation:** My error stemmed from misinterpreting the constraint \"More books are on the Bottom shelf than the Top shelf.\" I focused on the number of books per shelf rather than the relative positions of books. This led me to incorrectly place F and M on the bottom shelf, influencing my conclusion about the positions of O and L.\n**Error Keywords:**\n*   Misinterpretation \n*   Constraint misunderstanding\n*   Logical reasoning error\n## Step-by-Step Solution\n1.  **Analyze Constraints:**\n    *   Three shelves: Top, Middle, Bottom.\n    *   I is on the Middle shelf.\n    *   K is above F.\n    *   O is above L.\n    *   F and M are on the same shelf.\n2.  **Deduce Shelf Placement:**\n    *   Since K is above F and I is on the Middle shelf, F cannot be on the Top shelf. Therefore, F and M must be on the **Bottom shelf**.\n    *   Since O is above L and F/M are on the Bottom shelf, O and L must be on the **Top or Middle shelf**.\n3.  **Evaluate Options:**\n    *   **A: O is above M:** This is **TRUE** as O is either on the Top or Middle shelf, both above the Bottom shelf where M is located. \n    *   **B, C, D, E:** These options involve relationships we cannot definitively determine based on the given constraints.\n## Instructions for Future Problem Solving\n1.  **Carefully analyze each constraint and its implications.**\n2.  **Focus on the relative positions of items rather than just the quantity.**\n3.  **Use a process of elimination to rule out options that contradict the constraints.**\n4.  **Pay close attention to wording and avoid making assumptions.**\n5.  **Draw diagrams or use visualization to clarify the relationships between items.**\n## General Advice for Similar Problems\n*   **Break down complex problems into smaller, manageable steps.**\n*   **Identify the key information and relationships between elements.**\n*   **Use logical reasoning and deduction to draw conclusions.**\n*   **Consider all possibilities before making a final decision.**\n*   **Practice similar problems to improve your skills and understanding.**\n"
