Option B aligns with this idea by suggesting that the reader should stop caring about work/colleagues criticism and might feel more relaxed in the short term.\n\nOption A does not align with the text's main idea. It suggests acting as if one doesn't need the money, which may not necessarily address the issue of pressure employment.\n\nOption C suggests looking back on the future, which is not related to the context of the text.\n\nOption D suggests giving notice to someone who deserves it, which may not be a healthy or productive solution to dealing with extreme pressure employment."
