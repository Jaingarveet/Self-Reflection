For example, misreading condition (2) as \"going to E or F city requires going to G lake\" instead of the actual meaning.\n* **Overlooking Constraints:** I might have overlooked the constraint of not visiting I Peak and its implications on reaching Lake J (condition 4).\n* **Missing Logical Connections:** I might have missed the connection between not visiting I Peak and the impossibility of visiting Lake J, leading to incorrect deductions about the visited locations.\n**Improved Approach:**\n1. **Carefully Analyze Conditionals:** I will pay close attention to the direction and implications of each \"if-then\" statement, ensuring I understand the exact conditions and consequences.\n2. **Consider All Constraints:** I will take into account all given constraints, including the restriction on visiting I Peak, and analyze their impact on the possible itineraries.\n3. **Map Out Logical Connections:** I will create a clear map of the logical connections between visiting different locations, considering the dependencies and restrictions imposed by the conditions.\n**Applying the Improved Approach to the Current Question:**\nGiven that the team cannot visit I Peak, we know from condition (4) that they **cannot visit Lake J**. This immediately eliminates options A and D.\nNow, analyzing the remaining options:\n* **Option B:** We don't have enough information to determine if they went to E city instead of F city. \n* **Option C:** Since they cannot visit Lake J, condition (1) mandates they must visit Lake G. However, we have no information confirming or denying their visit to Mountain H.\nTherefore, the only option that must be true is visiting Lake G. \n**Action: Answer(\"C\")** \n"
