The argument focuses on the change in commute times for Acme employees due to the relocation. \n**Key Takeaway:**\nTo strengthen the argument, we need to assume that the current commute situation is significantly different from the anticipated situation after the move.\n**Applying the Learning:**\nLet's analyze each option:\n*   **A:** This is irrelevant to the change in commute times caused by the relocation.\n*   **B:** The chairperson's financial reasons for the move do not impact employee commute times.\n*   **C:** Employee opinions on the move do not affect the factual outcome of commute times.\n*   **D:** This option directly addresses the change in commute times, assuming that the current situation is favorable (less than 30-minute commutes) and will worsen after the move.\n*   **E:** Salary changes, while potentially relevant to employee well-being, do not directly impact commute times.\nTherefore, the assumption that strengthens the argument is that the current commute situation is significantly better than the anticipated situation after the move.\n**Action: Answer(\"D\")** \n"
