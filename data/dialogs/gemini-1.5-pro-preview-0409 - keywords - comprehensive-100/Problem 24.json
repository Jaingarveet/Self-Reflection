George must present on Tuesday, and Nina presenting on Monday allows Helen and Irving to present on Tuesday and Wednesday, respectively.\n* **B: Irving, Robert, and Helen:** This option is **not possible** because Robert cannot give an afternoon report, and with this schedule, he would have to present in the afternoon on Tuesday.\n* **C: Nina, Helen, and Olivia:** This option is **not possible** because if Nina presents on Monday, both Helen and Irving must present on Tuesday, leaving no space for Olivia.\n* **D: Olivia, Robert, and Irving:** This option is **not possible** because both Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports, and this schedule would require them to do so.\n* **E: Robert, George, and Helen:** This option is **not possible** because Robert cannot give an afternoon report, and with this schedule, he would have to present in the afternoon on Monday.\nTherefore, considering the constraints and analyzing each option, the only valid combination for the morning reports is:\n**Action: Answer(\"A\")** \n"
