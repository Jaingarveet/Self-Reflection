Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.\nQuestion: If the shoe store is in space 2, which one of the following could be true?\nChoices:\n  A: The optometrist is in space 5.\n  B: The pharmacy is in space 1.\n  C: A restaurant is in space 3.\n  D: The toy store is in space 6.\n  E: The veterinarian is in space 4.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nError Keywords:\n"

Here's my approach:\n**Key Constraints:**\n*   Pharmacy at one end, restaurant at the other.\n*   Restaurants separated by at least two businesses.\n*   Pharmacy next to optometrist or veterinarian.\n*   Toy store not next to veterinarian.\n*   Shoe store is in space 2 (new information).\n**Analysis:**\n1. **Space 1 or 7 must be a Pharmacy:** This leaves the other end for a restaurant.\n2. **Spaces 3 and 6 cannot be restaurants:** Due to the separation rule.\n3. **Space 1 or 3 must be Optometrist or Veterinarian:**  To be next to the pharmacy.\n**Evaluation of Choices:**\n*   **A: Optometrist in space 5:** Possible, as it doesn't violate any constraints.\n*   **B: Pharmacy in space 1:** Possible, leading to a restaurant in space 7.\n*   **C: Restaurant in space 3:**  **Violates constraint 2**. Restaurants can't be in 3 or 6.\n*   **D: Toy store in space 6:** Possible, as long as the veterinarian isn't in 5 or 7.\n*   **E: Veterinarian in space 4:** Possible, as long as the pharmacy is in space 1. \n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the analysis, the only option that definitively violates the constraints is a restaurant in space 3. \n**Action: Answer(\"C\")** \n"
