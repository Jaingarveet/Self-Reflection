Option C is about the quality of the objections, not the representativeness of the sample. The best question to the blogger's conclusion is about the representativeness of the sample. Option D is the best question because it challenges the assumption that most people who follow this blogger's article are their loyal fans. If most of the followers are loyal fans, then the sample may not be representative of the general population, and the conclusion may not be valid.\nError Keywords:\n - Misunderstanding the question\n - Misinterpreting the answer choices\n - Ignoring the main point of the argument\nSolution:\nThe blogger's conclusion is based on the fact that 85% of the follow-up posts agree with his opinion. However, the quality of those posts and the representativeness of the sample are not clear. Therefore, we need to question the validity of the conclusion. The best question to the blogger's conclusion is about the representativeness of the sample. Option D is the best question because it challenges the assumption that most people who follow this blogger's article are their loyal fans. If most of the followers are loyal fans, then the sample may not be representative of the general population, and the conclusion may not be valid.\nInstructions:\n1. Read the question carefully and understand the argument.\n2. Identify the main point of the argument.\n3. Identify the evidence used to support the conclusion.\n4. Identify the assumptions made in the argument.\n5. Evaluate the validity of the evidence and assumptions.\n6. Choose the answer that best questions the validity of the conclusion.\n7. Double-check your answer to ensure it addresses the main point of the argument.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the argument.\n - Identify the main point of the argument and the evidence used to support it.\n - Identify the assumptions made in the argument.\n - Evaluate the validity of the evidence and assumptions.\n - Choose the answer that best questions the validity of the conclusion.\n - Double-check your answer to ensure it addresses the main point of the argument.\n - Remember that the best question is the one that challenges the validity of the conclusion.\n"
