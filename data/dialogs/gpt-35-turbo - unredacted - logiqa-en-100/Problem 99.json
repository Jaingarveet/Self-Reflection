        "content": "Topic: Logic\nContext: Conne Levi with a \"moe\" look looks like other newborns.But because it is the world's first test-tube baby screened by next-generation gene sequencing technology, his advent has attracted the attention of experts and scholars.Not long ago, this news detonated the audience at the \"European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology Annual Meeting\" held in London, England.And ordinary people also believe that humans may usher in the era of \"customized babies\".\nQuestion: Which of the following, if true, would best refute the views of ordinary people?\nChoices:\n  A: \"Artificial\" genetic screening does not rule out that there will be loopholes; in natural conception, the guidelines for survival of the fittest in nature seem to be more subtle and effective\n  B: It can be seen from the development history of modern science and technology that technological development is often faster than human cognition, and sometimes technology will go further and deviate from the track of human cognition\n  C: Gene screening is mainly to avoid reproductive defects, this technology brings opportunities for human eugenics and eugenics; as for \"customized babies\", the concept of cloning is more involved, the two should not be confused\n  D: \"Customized babies\" have not been tried globally, this concept also challenges the most controversial human reproductive ethics\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI misread the question stem and did not pay attention to the phrase \"best refute\". I chose an answer that provided evidence against the possibility of \"customized babies\" but did not necessarily refute the views of ordinary people. \nError Keywords:\n - Misreading\n - Inattention\n - Misunderstanding\nSolution:\nThe question asks for the choice that would best refute the views of ordinary people. The views of ordinary people are that humans may usher in the era of \"customized babies\". Therefore, the correct answer should provide evidence against the possibility of \"customized babies\" and refute the views of ordinary people.\nOption A talks about the limitations of artificial genetic screening, but it does not refute the possibility of \"customized babies\".\nOption B talks about the potential risks of technological development, but it does not refute the possibility of \"customized babies\".\nOption C distinguishes between gene screening and eugenics, and suggests that the concept of cloning is more involved, which refutes the possibility of \"customized babies\".\nOption D suggests that \"customized babies\" have not been tried globally and challenges human reproductive ethics, but it does not necessarily refute the possibility of \"customized babies\".\nInstructions:\n1. Read the question stem carefully and pay attention to key phrases.\n2. Identify the views of ordinary people.\n3. Look for the answer choice that best refutes the views of ordinary people.\n4. Choose the answer that provides evidence against the possibility of the views of ordinary people.\n5. Double-check your answer to ensure that it refutes the views of ordinary people.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question stem carefully and pay attention to key phrases.\n - Always identify the views or claims that the question is asking you to address.\n - Always look for the answer choice that best addresses the views or claims in the question.\n - Always double-check your answer to ensure that it directly refutes the views or claims in the question.\n"
