Read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n2. Identify the inconsistency in the question.\n3. Evaluate each option carefully and eliminate irrelevant or unhelpful options.\n4. Choose the option that provides new information that can help explain the inconsistency.\n5. Double-check your answer to ensure that it addresses the inconsistency in the question.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Evaluate each option carefully and eliminate irrelevant or unhelpful options.\n - Choose the option that provides new information that can help explain the inconsistency.\n - Double-check your answer to ensure that it addresses the inconsistency in the question.\n - Remember that the correct answer is the one that best addresses the inconsistency in the question.\n"
