        "content": "Topic: Logic\nContext: The Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge, built in 1968, has a clear height of 24 meters in the Fengshui area.Theoretically, it can pass a maximum of 3,000 tons of ships.Today, with the rapid economic development, it has become a building that “cuts the waist” of the Yangtze River waterway and hinders the passage of giant ships.A bridge expert asserted that the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge must be demolished and rebuilt in order to dredge the golden waterways of the Yangtze River completely.\nQuestion: If any of the following is true, can you raise the most doubts about this expert's point of view?\nChoices:\n  A: Due to the inability of large ships to pass through the Nanjing Bridge, a large number of exported goods in the middle and upper reaches of the Yangtze River can only be taken by road or railway.\n  B: 99% of international ships entering the Yangtze River are moored at ports below the Nanjing Bridge, and dozens of foreign trade terminals above Nanjing rarely have large external ships berthed.\n  C: It is not enough to dismantle only the Nanjing Bridge.The Yangtze River Bridge, which was built in Wuhu, Tongling, Anqing and other places, has a clear height of 24 meters.\n  D: Shipbuilding technology is highly developed, and 8000-ton ships designed for adapting to the passage of the Yangtze River abroad have passed through Nanjing to Wuhan.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI chose option B as it suggests that most international ships do not need to pass through the Nanjing Bridge, which contradicts the expert's point of view. However, option D is a stronger statement that directly contradicts the expert's point of view by stating that 8000-ton ships have already passed through the Nanjing Bridge. This suggests that the bridge may not need to be demolished and rebuilt to dredge the golden waterways of the Yangtze River completely. \nError Keywords:\n - Misinterpretation of options\n - Weak contradiction\n - Failure to identify a stronger contradiction\nSolution:\nThe expert's point of view is that the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge must be demolished and rebuilt to dredge the golden waterways of the Yangtze River completely. \nOption D directly contradicts the expert's point of view by stating that 8000-ton ships have already passed through the Nanjing Bridge. This suggests that the bridge may not need to be demolished and rebuilt to dredge the golden waterways of the Yangtze River completely. \nInstructions:\n1. Read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n2. Identify the expert's point of view.\n3. Read each option carefully and identify the one that contradicts or raises doubts about the expert's point of view.\n4. Choose the option that directly contradicts the expert's point of view.\n5. Double-check your answer to ensure accuracy.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always read each option carefully and identify the one that directly contradicts or raises doubts about the given statement.\n - Always choose the option that directly contradicts or raises doubts about the given statement.\n - Always double-check your answer to ensure accuracy.\n"
