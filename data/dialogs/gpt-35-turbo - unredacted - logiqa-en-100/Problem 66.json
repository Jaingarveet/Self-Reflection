(1) F is adjacent to H and is on the north side of H.(2) I and E are adjacent.(3) G is somewhere in the north of F.\nQuestion: If it is found that G is the northernmost island, how many possible arrangements are there for this group of islands?\nChoices:\n  A: 2\n  B: 3\n  C: 4\n  D: 5\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nMy mistake was that I did not consider all possible arrangements of the islands. \nI assumed that G must be at the top of the line, but it could also be second from the top. \nError Keywords:\n - Assumption error\n - Limited thinking\n - Failure to consider all possibilities\nSolution:\nIf G is the northernmost island, it could be either at the top of the line or second from the top. \nCase 1: G is at the top of the line\nFrom (1), F is adjacent to H and is on the north side of H, so F and H must be in the south of the line.\nFrom (3), G is somewhere in the north of F, so G must be adjacent to F and in the north of F.\nFrom (2), I and E are adjacent, so they must be in the middle of the line.\nTherefore, the only possible arrangement is G-F-H-E-I.\nCase 2: G is second from the top of the line\nFrom (1), F is adjacent to H and is on the north side of H, so F and H must be in the south of the line.\nFrom (3), G is somewhere in the north of F, so G must be adjacent to F and in the north of F.\nFrom (2), I and E are adjacent, so they must be in the middle of the line.\nTherefore, the possible arrangement is F-G-H-E-I.\nInstructions:\n1. Read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n2. Consider all possible arrangements of the given conditions.\n3. Think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n4. Double-check your calculations and final answer.\n5. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always consider all possible arrangements of the given conditions.\n - Never assume anything that is not explicitly stated in the problem.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that there may be more than one correct answer to a problem.\n"
