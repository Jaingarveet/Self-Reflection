However, the question asks which option cannot be used to question the opinion that sand and dust storms are caused by grassland degradation and desertification caused by climate drought. Option A provides evidence of grassland degradation, which supports the opinion that sand and dust storms are caused by grassland degradation and desertification. Option B and C provide evidence that grasslands in other areas are not degraded, which can be used to question the opinion. Option D suggests that human factors are the main cause of the increase in dust storms, which can be used to question the opinion.\nError Keywords:\n - Misunderstanding the question\n - Contradicting the question\n - Misinterpreting the options\nSolution:\nThe question asks which option cannot be used to question the opinion that sand and dust storms are caused by grassland degradation and desertification caused by climate drought. Option A provides evidence of grassland degradation, which supports the opinion that sand and dust storms are caused by grassland degradation and desertification. Option B and C provide evidence that grasslands in other areas are not degraded, which can be used to question the opinion. Option D suggests that human factors are the main cause of the increase in dust storms, which can be used to question the opinion.\nInstructions:\n1. Read the question carefully and understand what it is asking.\n2. Read each option carefully and understand what it is saying.\n3. Determine which options support or contradict the opinion in the question.\n4. Choose the option that cannot be used to question the opinion.\n5. Double-check your answer to ensure that it is the correct option.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand what it is asking.\n - Always read each option carefully and understand what it is saying.\n - Always determine whether each option supports or contradicts the opinion in the question.\n - Always choose the option that cannot be used to question the opinion.\n - Always double-check your answer to ensure that it is the correct option.\n"
