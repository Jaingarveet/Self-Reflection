This led me to incorrectly choose an answer related to the fear factor rather than the core disagreement.\n**Understanding the Disagreement:**\nThe key point of contention is whether modern children's stories have \"clearly immoral characters.\" Peter believes they lack such characters and should have them to teach consequences. Yoko argues that such characters still exist but are less frightening, which is a positive change.\n**Learning:**\nI need to pay closer attention to the specific points of disagreement rather than getting sidetracked by secondary details. The focus should be on identifying the core issue of contention between the speakers. \n## Answering the Question:\nWith the above reflection in mind, the correct answer should focus on the presence of \"clearly immoral characters\" in children's stories, which is the main point of disagreement. \nTherefore: \nAction: Answer(\"D\") \n"
