This choice assumes the opposite of what the president is arguing. The president believes maintaining quality education requires increased enrollment, not the other way around. \n**Understanding the Argument:**\nThe president's argument follows a chain of reasoning:\n1. **No enrollment increase -> Spending reduction**\n2. **Spending reduction -> Quality reduction**\n3. **Therefore, no enrollment increase -> Quality reduction**\n**Identifying the Assumption:**\nTo reach the conclusion, the president assumes that aggressive marketing will lead to increased enrollment. This is the missing link between the actions and the desired outcome.\n**Correct Answer:** \nTherefore, the correct answer should be **Answer(\"C\")**: The university will increase its enrollment if it markets its programs more aggressively. \n"
