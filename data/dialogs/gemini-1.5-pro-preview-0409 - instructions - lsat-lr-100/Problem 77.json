Personal conflicts arise primarily because people are being irrational. For instance, people often find it easier to ascribe bad qualities to a person than good ones-even when there is more evidence of the latter. If someone suspects that a friend is unreliable, for example, a single instance may turn this suspicion into a feeling of certainty, whereas a belief that someone is reliable is normally built up only after many years of personal interaction.\nQuestion: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main conclusion drawn in the argument?\nChoices:\n  A: Many people assume that personal conflicts are inevitable.\n  B: Even when there is more evidence of good qualities than of bad ones, people find it easier to ascribe bad qualities than good ones.\n  C: It is irrational to allow a single instance to turn one's suspicion that a friend is unreliable into a feeling of certainty.\n  D: Personal conflicts are not inevitable.\n  E: Unlike a suspicion that a friend is unreliable, a belief that someone is reliable is normally built up only after many years of personal interaction.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n"

        "content": "## Reflection on Previous Attempt:\nIn my previous attempt, I focused too much on the specific example of reliability and unreliability in friendships. While this is an important illustration within the argument, the main conclusion is broader. It addresses the root cause of personal conflicts, attributing them to irrational tendencies in human judgment. \n## Applying the Learning:\nThe correct answer should encompass the general idea of irrationality leading to conflict, not just the specific example.\n## Analyzing the Choices:\n*   **A:** This states a common assumption that the argument aims to refute, not the main conclusion.\n*   **B:** This accurately reflects the core idea of the argument: the tendency to attribute negative qualities more readily than positive ones, even with contrary evidence, leading to conflict.\n*   **C:** This focuses on a specific instance of irrationality within the example, not the overall conclusion.\n*   **D:** This is the point the argument aims to prove, but it doesn't explain *why* conflicts are not inevitable.\n*   **E:** This highlights a difference in how we perceive positive and negative traits but doesn't directly address the main conclusion about conflict.\n## Choosing the Best Answer:\nBased on the analysis, the choice that best expresses the main conclusion is **B**. It accurately captures the argument's core idea about the irrational tendency to ascribe negative qualities leading to personal conflicts.\n**Action: Answer(\"B\")** \n"
