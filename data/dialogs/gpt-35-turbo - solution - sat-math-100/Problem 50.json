There are 5 times as many right-handed female students as there are left-handed female students, and there are 9 times as many right-handed male students as there are left-handed male students. If there is a total of 18 left-handed students and 122 right-handed students in the school, which of the following is closest to the probability that a right-handed student selected at random is female? (Note: Assume that none of the eighth-grade students are both right-handed and left-handed.)\nChoices:\n  A: 0.410\n  B: 0.357\n  C: 0.333\n  D: 0.250\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\nLet's denote the number of left-handed female students and left-handed male students as $f$ and $m$, respectively. Then, we have:\n$f + m = 18$ (total number of left-handed students)\n$9m = 122 - f$ (number of right-handed male students)\n$5f = 122 - 9m$ (number of right-handed female students)\nSolving for $f$ and $m$, we get:\n$f = \\frac{610}{46}, m = \\frac{170}{46}$\nNow, we can find the number of right-handed female students and right-handed male students:\n$5f = \\frac{305}{23}$\n$9m = \\frac{765}{23}$\nThe total number of right-handed students is:\n$\\frac{305}{23} + \\frac{765}{23} = \\frac{1070}{23}$\nTherefore, the probability that a right-handed student selected at random is female is:\n$\\frac{\\frac{305}{23}}{\\frac{1070}{23}} = \\frac{305}{1070} \\approx 0.285$\n"
