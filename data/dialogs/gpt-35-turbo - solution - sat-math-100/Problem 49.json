However, I can solve the problem as follows:\nMultiplying both sides of the equation by $a x-2$ gives:\n$$24 x^{2}+25 x-47=-8 x(a x-2)-3(a x-2)-53$$\nSimplifying the right-hand side gives:\n$$24 x^{2}+25 x-47=-8 a x^{2}+19 x+101$$\nRearranging the terms gives:\n$$8 a x^{2}+x(19-25)+47-101=0$$\nSimplifying gives:\n$$8 a x^{2}-6 x-54=0$$\nDividing both sides by 2 gives:\n$$4 a x^{2}-3 x-27=0$$\nThis is a quadratic equation in $x$ and can be solved using the quadratic formula:\n$$x=\\frac{-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^{2}-4ac}}{2a}$$\nwhere $a=4a$, $b=-3$, and $c=-27$. Substituting these values gives:\n$$x=\\frac{3\\pm\\sqrt{9+27a^{2}}}{8a}$$\nFor this equation to be true for all values of $x \\neq \\frac{2}{a}$, the discriminant $9+27a^{2}$ must be equal to zero, since otherwise the square root would be non-zero for some values of $a$. Therefore:\n$$9+27a^{2}=0$$\nSolving for $a$ gives:\n$$a^{2}=-\\frac{1}{3}$$\nSince $a^{2}$ is negative, $a$ must be imaginary. Therefore, none of the given choices are correct."
