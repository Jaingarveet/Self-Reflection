If he gives each student 3 milliliters of solution, he will have 5 milliliters left over. In order to give each student 4 milliliters of solution, he will need an additional 21 milliliters. How many students are in the class?\nChoices:\n  A: 16\n  B: 21\n  C: 23\n  D: 26\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\nLet's use algebra to solve the problem.\nLet's assume there are 'x' students in the class.\nIf each student gets 3 milliliters of solution, then the total amount of solution required is 3x milliliters.\nIf Mr. Kohl has 5 milliliters left over, then the total amount of solution he has is 3x + 5 milliliters.\nIf each student gets 4 milliliters of solution, then the total amount of solution required is 4x milliliters.\nIf Mr. Kohl needs an additional [REDACTED] milliliters, then the total amount of solution he needs is 4x + [REDACTED] milliliters.\nWe can set up two equations using the above information and solve for 'x'.\n3x + 5 = n\n4x + [REDACTED] = n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second, we get:\nx + [REDACTED] = 0\nx = -[REDACTED]\nSince the number of students cannot be negative, this answer is not valid.\nThe correct answer can be found by solving for 'n' using either of the two equations and then dividing by the amount of solution each student gets.\nn = 3x + 5\nn = 4x + [REDACTED]\nSubstituting the second equation into the first, we get:\n3x + 5 = 4x + [REDACTED]\nx = [REDACTED]\nTherefore, there are [REDACTED] students in the class.\n"
