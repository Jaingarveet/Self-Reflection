For which of the following values of $a$ does the system have no solution?\nChoices:\n  A: -6\n  B: -3\n  C: 3\n  D: 6\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\nWe can solve the system of equations using elimination method.\nIf we multiply the first equation by $2$ and add it to the second equation, we get $ax+2y=4$ and $[REDACTED]x+4y=12$.\nSimplifying the second equation, we get $[REDACTED]x+2y=4$.\nComparing this equation with the first equation, we see that they are not the same.\nThis means that the two equations represent two different lines and have either one solution or no solution.\nFor the system to have no solution, the two equations must represent parallel lines.\nThis happens when the coefficients of $x$ and $y$ in the two equations are proportional but the constant terms are not.\nSo, we need to find the value of $a$ such that $\\frac{[REDACTED]}{a} = \\frac{2}{4}$.\nSimplifying, we get $[REDACTED] = a$.\n"
