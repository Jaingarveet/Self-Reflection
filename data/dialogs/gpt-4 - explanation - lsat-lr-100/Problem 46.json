We had all the information about them that we needed to draw archaeological conclusions, and future archaeologists studying the site, who may not have access to our records, might be misled by their absence.\nQuestion: Which one of the following, if assumed, most helps to justify the reasoning in the archaeologist's argument?\nChoices:\n  A: The only considerations that bear upon the question of whether the mosaics should have been removed are archaeological.\n  B: Archaeologists studying a site can tell whether or not that site had been flooded at some time.\n  C: The materials used in the construction of a mosaic are readily apparent when the mosaic is examined in its original location.\n  D: Archaeological sites from which artifacts have been removed rarely mislead archaeologists who later study the site.\n  E: The removal of artifacts from archaeological sites rarely has any environmental impact.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI answered the question incorrectly because I focused on the potential misleading nature of the absence of the mosaics, rather than considering the broader implications of the archaeologist's argument. The archaeologist's argument is not just about the potential for future archaeologists to be misled, but also about the overall value of leaving the mosaics in place.\n"
