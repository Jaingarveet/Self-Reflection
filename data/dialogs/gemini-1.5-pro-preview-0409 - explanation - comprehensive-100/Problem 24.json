Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.

I might have also overlooked the possibility of certain individuals being excluded due to the given conditions.\n## Answering the Question:\n**Given:** Kyle and Lenore are not giving reports.\n**Constraints:**\n* **George:** Tuesday only.\n* **Olivia & Robert:** Not in the afternoon.\n* **Nina:** If she presents, Helen & Irving present the next day (unless it's Wednesday).\n**Analysis:**\n1. **George MUST present on Tuesday:** This leaves Monday and Wednesday for the other morning reports.\n2. **Olivia & Robert:** They can only present in the mornings. \n3. **Nina:** If she presents on Monday, both Helen & Irving must present on Tuesday, which is impossible due to George's constraint. Therefore, Nina cannot present on Monday.\n**Possible Scenarios:**\n* **Nina on Tuesday morning:** This forces Helen & Irving on Wednesday, leaving Monday open for Olivia or Robert. \n* **Nina on Wednesday morning:** This has no impact on the other days, leaving Monday and Tuesday open for Olivia, Robert, or Helen.\n**Evaluating Choices:**\n* **A: Helen, George, Nina:** Impossible, as Nina on Monday forces Helen & Irving on Tuesday.\n* **B: Irving, Robert, Helen:** Possible if Nina presents on Wednesday.\n* **C: Nina, Helen, Olivia:** Impossible, as Nina cannot be on Monday.\n* **D: Olivia, Robert, Irving:** Possible if Nina presents on Wednesday.\n* **E: Robert, George, Helen:** Impossible, as it places Helen on Wednesday without Nina on Tuesday.\n**Therefore, the possible morning reports are either B or D, depending on whether Nina presents on Tuesday or Wednesday.**\nAction: Answer(\"B\") \n"
