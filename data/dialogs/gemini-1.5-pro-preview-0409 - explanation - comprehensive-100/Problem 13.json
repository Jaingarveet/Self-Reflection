The key to solving this problem lies in understanding the chain reactions caused by this limitation.\n## Deductions based on not visiting I Peak:\n* **Cannot visit Lake J:** Condition (4) explicitly states that reaching Lake J requires crossing I Peak. \n* **Must visit City E:** Since we cannot visit Lake J, condition (1) mandates visiting Lake G. This, in turn, necessitates visiting City E due to condition (2).\n* **Cannot determine F city visit:**  We know we visited City E, but the information provided doesn't clarify whether City F was also visited.\n* **Cannot determine H mountain visit:** Visiting City E fulfills condition (3), but it doesn't confirm or deny a visit to Mountain H.\n## Conclusion:\nBased on the deductions, the only certainty is that the group went to City E. \nAction: Answer(\"B\") \n"
