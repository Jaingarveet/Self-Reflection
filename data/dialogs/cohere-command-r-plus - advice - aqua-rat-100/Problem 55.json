I incorrectly assumed that the speed of the current was 2 kmph, when in fact, that was the man's speed against the current. This led me to set up the equations incorrectly and find an inaccurate solution. To get the right answer, I should have set up the equation using the provided information about the man's speed in still water and against the current.\n\nThought: \nLet the speed of the current be x kmph.\nThen,\n4 kmph - x kmph = 2 kmph\nx = 2 kmph\n\nNow, we can find the man's rate along the current:\n4 kmph + x kmph = 6 kmph\n\nSo, the answer is B: 6 kmph.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
