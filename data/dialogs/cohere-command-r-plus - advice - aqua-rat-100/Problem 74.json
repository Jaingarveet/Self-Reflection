I correctly identified the number of quadrilaterals with 3 vertices from the pentagon and 1 at the center, but I missed the second type of quadrilateral, which has 2 vertices from the pentagon and 2 at the center. This adds an additional 5 cases, making the total 15.\n\nThought: \nThere are two types of quadrilaterals that can be formed: those with 3 vertices from the pentagon ABCDE and 1 at the center, and those with 2 vertices from the pentagon and 2 at the center, F. \n\nFor the first type, we can choose 4 vertices from the 5 available in the pentagon (5 choose 4) which is equal to 5. \n\nFor the second type, we can choose 2 vertices from the pentagon (5 choose 2), and then there are 2 ways to include the center point (either both chosen points are connected to F or they are connected via F). So, this gives us a total of 5 x 2 = 10 quadrilaterals. \n\nTherefore, the total number of different quadrilaterals that can be formed is 5 + 10 = 15.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
