        "content": "Reflection: I made a mistake in my previous attempt by not considering that the given angles are part of a circle's circumference, which has a total angle measure of 360°. I correctly identified that point B bisects arc AC, but I incorrectly added the measures of arcs AD and DC instead of subtracting to find arc AD's measure. For this question, I should be more careful in applying geometric rules and performing calculations.\n\nThought: Given that point B bisects minor arc AC, minor arc AD and minor arc DC are equal in measure.\n\nThe sum of minor arcs AD, DC, and BD is 360° because they form a complete circle.\n\nminor arc AD + minor arc DC + minor arc BD = 360°\n\nWe know that minor arc AC is 160° and it can be split into 2 equal minor arcs, AD and DC, so:\n\nminor arc AD + minor arc DC = 160° / 2 = 80°\n\nAnd we have minor arc BD as 150°\n\nSo:\n80° + 150° + minor arc AD = 360°\n\nCombining like terms:\n230° + minor arc AD = 360°\n\nTo find the measure of minor arc AD, subtract 230° from both sides:\n\nminor arc AD = 360° - 230°\nminor arc AD = 130°\n\nTherefore, the measure of minor arc AD is 130°.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
