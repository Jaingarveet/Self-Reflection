Instead, I should have used the time taken to pass a point to calculate the shuttle's speed and length.\n\nCorrect Solution: \nThe speed of the shuttle when passing a point can be calculated as distance divided by time: \n- Distance = 700m\n- Time = 5 seconds\n- Speed = 700 / 5 = 140 m/s\n\nNow, we can find the length of the shuttle. It takes 5 seconds to pass a point at its maximum speed, so:\n- Length = Speed x Time = 140 x 5 = 700 meters\n\nTherefore, the answer is [CHOICE LETTER].\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
