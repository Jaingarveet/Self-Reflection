To solve this problem correctly, I need to calculate the profit for each person based on their investment duration and then find the corresponding number of months C invested in the business.\n\nThought: \nLet's assume C joined $x$ months after B.\n\nA invested for $12$ months, B invested for $(12-x)$ months, and C invested for $(12-x)$ months.\n\nProfit ratio: A:B:C = 12: (12-$x$): (12-$x$)\n\nNow, we can set up an equation:\n$(12/R) + [(12-x)/R] + [(12-x)/R] = 375,000/R$\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n$36/R = 375,000/R$\n\nSolving for $R$, we get $R = 10,000$.\n\nNow, we can find $x$:\n$[(12-x)/10,000] = 150,000/R$\n$(12-x) = 15$\n$x = 24-12 = 12$\n\nSo, C joined $12$ months after B, which is the same as $24$ months after A started the business.\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
