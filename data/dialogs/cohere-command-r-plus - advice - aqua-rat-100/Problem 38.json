        "content": "Reflection: I made a mistake in interpreting the question. I incorrectly assumed that the question was referring to the number of unpainted faces on the smaller cubes making up the outer surface. However, the question actually asks for the total number of unpainted faces from all the smaller cubes, including those inside the hollow structure.\n\nCorrect solution:\nThe hollow cube has an inner side length of 3cm, and it consists of 27 smaller cubes with an edge length of 1cm each. Each of these smaller cubes has 6 faces, resulting in a total of 162 faces. Out of these, only the 36 faces making up the inner surface of the hollow cube are not accessible for painting. Thus, 162 - 36 = 126 faces are available for painting on the smaller cubes inside.\n\nThe larger cube has 6 faces, each consisting of a 3x3 array of the smaller cubes. On each face, there are 9 smaller cubes, and each of these has 5 unpainted faces (since the outer surface is painted). This results in 45 unpainted faces per face, and for all 6 faces, it's 45 x 6 = 270.\n\nTherefore, the total number of unpainted faces is 126 (from the inner smaller cubes) + 270 (from the outer surface) = 496. So, the final answer is E: 496.\n\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
