To solve this problem accurately, I need to consider the varying daily changes and accumulate them to find when the frog escapes.\n\nThought: \nOn the first day, the frog jumps 3m up but falls back 2m, so the net change is a gain of 1m.\nEach day, the frog jumps 3m less as the well becomes shallower, and the fall remains at 2m.\nLet's calculate the number of days:\n\nNet change needed = 30m - 1m (starting position and first day's gain) = 29m\n\nDaily change = 3m jump - 2m fall = 1m gain\n\nNumber of days = Net change needed / Daily change = 29 days\n\nSo, it will take 29 days for the frog to escape the well.\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
