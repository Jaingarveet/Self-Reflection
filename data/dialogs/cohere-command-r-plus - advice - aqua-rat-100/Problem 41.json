        "content": "Reflection: I made a mistake in interpreting the question. I incorrectly assumed that the friends who didn't attend didn't contribute any money. However, the question states that the plan was to spend Rs. 96, implying that each friend was supposed to contribute regardless of attendance. Let's calculate the number who attended correctly:\n\nEach person was supposed to contribute: 96 / total people = 96 / x\n\nThose who attended had to contribute: (96 + 4*4) / attended = 112 / x\n\nNow, we can set these equal to each other:\n96 / total people = 112 / attended people\n\nMultiplying by \"total people\":\n96 = 112 * attended people / total people\n\nWe know that \"total people\" must be greater than \"attended people,\" so we can try the available choices to see which one satisfies this relationship:\n\nFor A:\n96 = 112 * 8 / 12\n=> 96 = 73.33\n=> Incorrect\n\nFor B:\n96 = 112 * 12 / 24\n=> 96 = 96\n=> Correct\n\nThus, the answer is B: 12 friends attended the picnic. I missed this answer previously by misinterpretating the question, but now with the reflection, we arrive at the correct solution."
