During a month, both of them makes 35 toys in total. If both of them have worked for almost similar number of hours how many toys have been prepared by Jacob?\nChoices:\n  A: 15\n  B: 16\n  C: 17\n  D: 18\n  E: 19\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n - Read the question carefully and identify the given rates, total work, and constraints. \n - Calculate the total hours worked by each person based on their rates. \n - Use the constraint that they worked for almost the same number of hours to set up an equation. \n - Solve the equation for the unknown number of toys made by Jacob. \n - Always double-check your calculations and the constraints provided in the question.\n"

        "content": "Reflection: I made a mistake in understanding the constraint that Alex and Jacob worked for almost the same number of hours. To make their hours 'almost equal', the difference between their individual hours should be minimized. \n\nNow, let's calculate their individual hours: \n- Alex: 7 hours/toy * 35 toys = 245 hours\n- Jacob: 9 hours/toy * [number of toys] = [number of hours] \n\nFor their hours to be almost equal, the difference between their hours should be minimized: \n |245 - [number of hours for Jacob]| should be minimized \n\nThis means that Jacob's hours should be very close to 245, and with the given options, it turns out that 8 hours/toy yields a value very close to 245: \n9 hours/toy * 17 toys = 153 hours \n\nTherefore, Jacob made 17 toys. \n\nLet's now double-check the difference in their working hours: \n |245 - (9 * 17)| = |245 - 153| = 92 - 153 = -61 \n\nSo, the correct answer is 'C: 17'."
