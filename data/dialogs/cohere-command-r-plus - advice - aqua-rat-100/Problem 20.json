        "content": "Reflection: I made a mistake in my previous attempt. I incorrectly assumed that the ratio of boys to girls would remain the same after new members joined. However, the question specifically states that the same number of boys and girls joined, which changes the ratio. I need to consider this change in my calculations.\n\nCorrect solution:\nLet's call the number of new boys and girls that joined the group \"x.\"\n\nInitially, the ratio of boys to girls was 64:40, which simplifies to 16:10.\n\nAfter the new members joined, the ratio became 4:3.\n\nWe can set up a proportion using the new ratio:\n$\\frac{16+x}{10+x} = \\frac{4}{3}$\n\nMultiplying both sides by the common multiple of 3*(10+x) and 4*(16+x), we get:\n$3(16+x) = 4(10+x)$\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n$48 + 3x = 40 + 4x$\n\nCombining like terms:\n$3x - x = 40 - 48$\n$2x = -8$\n$x = -4$\n\nThis means the number of new members who joined, for both boys and girls, was -4. This doesn't make sense in this context because the number of members can't be negative, and people can't join a group in a negative amount.\n\nTherefore, there must be something wrong with the question or the provided options.\nAction: This question cannot be answered with the provided options."
