Six pita breads = two rolls\n2. Three rolls = five baguettes\n\nNow, we want to find how many pita breads are equal to two baguettes.\n\n2 baguettes = 2/3 rolls (from the second relationship)\n\nNow, substitute the value of 2/3 rolls from the first relationship:\n\n2/3 rolls = 2/3 * (6 pita breads / 2) = 4 pita breads\n\nSo, the correct answer is D: 4 pita breads.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
