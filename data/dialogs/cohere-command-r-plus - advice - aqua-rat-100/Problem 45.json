        "content": "Thought:\nCost Price (CP) = Rs. 1200\nDesired Profit = 20%\nDiscount = 20%\n\nFirst, we calculate the profit margin that the seller wants to make. Since he wants to make a 20% profit, the Cost Price * Profit/100 = 1200 * 20/100 = Rs. 240\n\nSo, the Selling Price (SP) without discount = CP + Profit = 1200 + 240 = Rs. 1440\n\nNow, we calculate the price after offering a 20% discount. Discount/100 * SP = 20/100 * 1440 = Rs. 288\n\nSP after discount = SP without discount - Discount = 1440 - 288 = Rs. 1152\n\nTherefore, the price at which Karan should mark the sewing machine is Rs. 1152 more than the CP.\n\nCalculation for the correct answer:\nRequired Price = CP + CP * 20/100 + CP * 20/100 = 1200 * [1 + 20/100 + 20/100] = 6 * 1200/5 = Rs. (6 * 1200)/5 = Rs. 1440\n\nSo, the final answer is B.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
