I incorrectly assumed that the percentage of swim team members who aren't in the chess club referred to those who are only on the swim team, but the question doesn't specify that. This tripped me up, and I ended up with the incorrect answer. To get it right, I need to simply find the relationship between the given percentages without making extra assumptions.\n\nThought: \nLet X be the percentage of students who are members of the swim team.\n24% of students are in both the chess club and swim team, so the percentage of students in the swim team without considering the chess club is X - 24%.\nIt is given that 20% of the swim team members are not in the chess club. Therefore, (X - 24%) * 0.20 = 0.24X - 0.24 = 0.2X, and X = 60%.\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
