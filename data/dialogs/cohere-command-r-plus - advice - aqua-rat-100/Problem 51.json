This incorrect assumption led me to choose the wrong formula and calculate an inaccurate result. To solve this problem correctly, I should have recognized that point U, being the midpoint of ST, divides ST into two equal segments. \n\nThought: \nGiven that U is the midpoint of ST, the line segments SU and UT are equal in length. \nLet's denote the length of SU (and UT) as \"x.\"\nWe know that ST = 22, and since U is the midpoint, we can write:\nx + x = 22\n2x = 22\nx = 11\n\nNow, to find the length of RU, we can use the given length of RT (which is 17) and subtract the length of UT (which is 11):\nRU = RT - UT\nRU = 17 - 11\nRU = 6\n\nSo, the correct answer is 6 units.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
