Then the distance from the car to the top of the tower is $d + x$, where $x$ is the height of the tower.\n\nUsing trigonometry, we can set up the equation:\n$(d + x) / d = \\tan(60^\\circ) / \\tan(45^\\circ)$\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n$x = d(\\sqrt{3} - 1)$\n\nDifferentiating with respect to time, we get:\n$dx / dt = v$\nwhere $v$ is the speed of the car.\n\nSetting $dx / dt = v$ and solving for $d$, we get:\n$d = vt$\n\nNow, we can find the time $t$ it will take for the car to reach the base of the tower:\n$x = vt(\\sqrt{3} - 1)$\n$t = x / v(\\sqrt{3} - 1)$\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n$t = (\\sqrt{3} + 1) minutes$.\n\nTherefore, the car will reach the base of the tower after $5(\\sqrt{3} + 1)$ minutes more.\n\nSo, the correct answer is $A: 5(\\sqrt{3} + 1)$.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
