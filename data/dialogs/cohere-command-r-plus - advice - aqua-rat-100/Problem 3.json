        "content": "Reflection: I made a mistake in my previous attempt. Let's break the problem down step by step:\n\nFirst, we find the dimensions of the rectangle. After trimming 4 feet from one side of the square, the rectangle has a width ($w$) that is 4 feet less than its length ($l$). We know that the area of the rectangle is equal to twice the area of one triangle, or $70 \\times 2 = 140$ square feet. Using the formula for the area of a rectangle, we can set up the equation $lw = 140$.\n\nNext, we can substitute $w = l - 4$ into the equation and simplify:\n$(l - 4)l = 140$\n$l^2 - 4l - 140 = 0$\n\nBy factoring, we can solve for $l$:\n$(l - 10)(l + 14) = 0$\nSo, $l = 10$ or $l = -14$. \n\nSince length cannot be negative, $l = 10$. \n\nNow that we know the length of one side of the square, we can find its perimeter. The perimeter of the square is $4l = 4 \\times 10 = \\boxed{40}$ feet. \n\nI made a mistake in my previous attempt by incorrectly calculating the side length of the square. I should have paid closer attention to the geometric properties and ensured that I applied the formulas correctly. For future reference, I should carefully check my calculations and equations to avoid such errors."
