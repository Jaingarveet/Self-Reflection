I calculated the difference in averages correctly but then added, instead of subtracted, this value from the new average to find the weight of the heavy-duty truck. Correcting this mistake should lead to the right answer.\n\nThought: \nLet X be the weight of the heavy-duty truck.\nThe average weight of the 10 vehicles increased by 2.6 tons, so the new average = 12.2 tons + 2.6 tons = 14.8 tons.\nThus, the total weight of the 11 vehicles = 14.8 tons * 11 = 162.8 tons.\nSubtracting the total weight of the original 10 vehicles:\nX + 162.8 tons - 122 tons = 14.8 tons\nX = 40.8 tons\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
