I incorrectly assumed that I could combine the square root with the other terms inside the square root, which is not valid. Instead, I should've kept the expression as it was and proceeded to find the range of values for x by inspecting the numerator and denominator separately.\n\nThought: \nFirst, I'll simplify the expression for x:\n(n^2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16) / (n + 4√n + 4)\n\nNow, I'll find the range of values for x by considering the numerator and denominator separately:\nNumerator (N):\nN = n^2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16\n\nSince we have 36 ≤ n ≤ 72, we can find the range of values for N by plugging in the minimum and maximum values of n:\nN(min) = 36^2 + 2√36(36 + 4) + 16 ≈ 1676\nN(max) = 72^2 + 2√72(72 + 4) + 16 ≈ 5776\n\nSo, we have 1676 < N < 5776.\n\nDenominator (D):\nD = n + 4√n + 4\n\nAgain, plugging in the minimum and maximum values of n:\nD(min) = 36 + 4√36 + 4 ≈ 88\nD(max) = 72 + 4√72 + 4 ≈ 164\n\nSo, we have 88 < D < 164.\n\nNow, to find the range of x, I'll divide the range of N by the range of D:\n1676/164 < x < 5776/88\n\nSimplifying the fractions:\n20.95 < x < 65.63\n\nSo, the correct answer is B: 23 < x < 58.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
