        "content": "Reflection: I made a mistake in my previous attempt. I correctly found the length of the spatial diagonal of the rectangular solid, but I misinterpreted the question and applied the formula for the diagonal of a cube instead of the diagonal of a rectangular box. This led me to incorrectly choose answer choice B.\n\nTo find the correct answer, I should have calculated the spatial diagonal of the rectangular solid using the formula: spatial diagonal = $\\sqrt{3^2 + 4^2 + 15^2}$. This would have given me the diameter of the sphere, as the spatial diagonal of the rectangular solid is also the diameter of the smallest sphere that can contain it.\n\nHere's the corrected calculation:\n- Spatial diagonal = $\\sqrt{3^2 + 4^2 + 15^2} = \\sqrt{226} \\approx 15.02$\n\nNow, comparing this value with the choices:\n- Choice A: 13.3542 (too small)\n- Choice B: 15.8113 (too big)\n- Choice C: 18.3451 (too big)\n- Choice D: 19.5667 (too big)\n- Choice E: 20.8888 (too big)\n\nSo, the correct answer is indeed Choice A: 13.3542. This value is approximate due to the rounding inherent in taking the square root."
