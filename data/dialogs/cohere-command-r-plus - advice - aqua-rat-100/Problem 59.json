Instead, I should have focused on the given percentage relationship to solve for the total number of marbles.\n\nSolution: We know that the second draw represents the percentage of black marbles in the bag. There was 1 black marble out of 20 drawn, so the bag has 1/20 = 5% black marbles. \n\nInitially, 20 marbles were painted black and put back, so there are 20*5% = 1 black marble and 39 black marbles in total. \n\nTherefore, the bag currently holds 40 marbles in total.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
