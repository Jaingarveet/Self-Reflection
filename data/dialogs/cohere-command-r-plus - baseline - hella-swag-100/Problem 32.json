[step] When trying to date online, don't filter out guys based on height. You might be filtering out someone who's actually perfect for you just because he's a few inches shorter than you'd like.\nChoices:\n  A: However, if you're drawn to the very outer, slightly more than a tall guy, you might want to focus on how his body responds to you. [substeps] Some people find the sensation of others standing in their space bittersweet.\n  B: Instead, focus on what's already the picture. You might not want someone half your height who just can't fit in with your skinny friends.\n  C: In fact, try not to specifically mention a height you want in your profile, as it can turn some people off. [substeps] For instance, if you mention your height or you say, \" only tall guys! \" many guys may figure you don't want to date them and move on, even great guys.\n  D: If this guy is very tall, you might run into him one of two ways. The first is by not focusing on an anatomical feature: is the head taller than you? The second is by focusing more on the body of this person.\n"
