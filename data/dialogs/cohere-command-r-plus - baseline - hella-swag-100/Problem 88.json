[step] If you have a low sex drive, or if your sex drive has declined with age, you might want to give it a boost with some extra testosterone. In addition to increased libido, testosterone supplements can help you avoid unwanted erections and maintain erections when aroused.\nChoices:\n  A: A healthy body needs more testosterone in order to maintain erections. Some women who are female or older do not maintain regular erections until all their testosterone has been expended, so other people may need testosterone anyway.\n  B: [substeps] Be honest with yourself if you want to lower your testosterone. Taking testosterone supplements can lead to a reduction in your sex drive.\n  C: [title] Distinguish between testosterone and regular erections. [step] Studies have shown that women with low testosterone are able to have slightly lower levels of sexual function after sex, which is because the hormone changes are carried out through pleasure.\n  D: [title] Ask yourself if you want a healthier body. [step] Men who suffer from low testosterone may experience increased body fat and larger breasts.\n"

The phrase \"women with low testosterone\" doesn't fit with the common sense assumption that women typically have much lower testosterone levels than men.\n\nChoice D is irrelevant as it shifts the focus to body image issues without providing a clear link to testosterone or sexual function.\n\nTherefore, the best choice is B.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
