I will use my self-reflection to answer this question correctly.\n**Self-reflection:**\n* **Mistake:** I previously answered that the ratio of zinc and copper in alloy Z is 69:91. This was incorrect.\n* **Reason for mistake:** I made a calculation error when finding the total amount of zinc and copper in each alloy.\n* **Correct answer:** The correct ratio of zinc and copper in alloy Z is 59:91.\n**Solution:**\n* Alloy X contains 6/15 zinc and 9/15 copper.\n* Alloy Y contains 7/18 zinc and 11/18 copper.\n* When 40 grams of alloy X and 60 grams of alloy Y are mixed, the total amount of zinc is (6/15) * 40 + (7/18) * 60 = 59 grams.\n* The total amount of copper is (9/15) * 40 + (11/18) * 60 = 91 grams.\n* Therefore, the ratio of zinc and copper in alloy Z is 59:91.\n**Action:** Answer(\"D\")"
