        "content": "Let's assign variables:\n* Let x be the amount of money Arjun has.\n* Let y be the amount of money Sajal has.\nNow, let's write equations based on the given information:\n1. If Arun gives $30 to Sajal, Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun:\ny + 30 = 2(x - 30)\n2. If Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal:\nx + 10 = 3(y - 10)\nNow, let's simplify the equations:\n1. y + 30 = 2x - 60\n2. x + 10 = 3y - 30\nLet's solve this system of equations using substitution. From equation 1, we can express y as:\ny = 2x - 90\nSubstitute this expression for y in equation 2:\nx + 10 = 3(2x - 90) - 30\nx + 10 = 6x - 270 - 30\nx + 10 = 6x - 300\n5x = 290\nx = 58\nNow that we know x, we can substitute it back into the equation for y:\ny = 2(58) - 90\ny = 116 - 90\ny = 26\nTherefore, Arjun has $58 and Sajal has $26.\nChecking our solution:\n1. If Arun gives $30 to Sajal, Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun:\n26 + 30 = 2(58 - 30)\n56 = 56 (True)\n2. If Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal:\n58 + 10 = 3(26 - 10)\n68 = 68 (True)\nOur solution is correct.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
