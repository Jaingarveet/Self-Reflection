        "content": "## Self-Reflection\n**Previous Incorrect Answer:**\nMy previous answer was incorrect because I used the wrong formula to calculate the cost price. I used the formula for calculating the selling price, which resulted in an incorrect answer.\n**Corrected Approach:**\n1. **Selling Price:** The selling price of the article is given as Rs. 360.\n2. **Profit Percentage:** The profit percentage is given as 20%.\n3. **Decimal Conversion:** Converting the profit percentage into a decimal, we get 0.20.\n4. **Cost Price Formula:** The correct formula for calculating the cost price is:\n```\nCost Price = Selling Price / (1 + Profit Percentage)\n```\n5. **Calculation:** Plugging in the values, we get:\n```\nCost Price = 360 / (1 + 0.20) = 360 / 1.20 = 300\n```\n6. **Double-Checking:** 300 + 20% of 300 = 300 + 60 = 360. This confirms that the cost price is Rs. 300.\n7. **Answer:** Therefore, the correct answer is **B: 300**.\n## Action: Answer(\"B\")"
