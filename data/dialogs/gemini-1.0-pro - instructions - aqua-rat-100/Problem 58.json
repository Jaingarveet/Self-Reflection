        "content": "## Self-Reflection on Previous Incorrect Answer:\n**Mistake:** I incorrectly calculated the LCM (Least Common Multiple) of the rotation times for each ball. This led to an inaccurate answer.\n**Corrected Approach:**\n1. **Rotation Time:**\n    - Ball A: 26 minutes / 2 rotations = 13 minutes per rotation\n    - Ball B: 35 minutes / 5 rotations = 7 minutes per rotation\n2. **LCM:**\n    - LCM of 13 and 7 is 91 minutes.\n3. **Total Time:**\n    - Ball A: 91 minutes * 2 rotations = 182 minutes\n    - Ball B: 91 minutes * 5 rotations = 455 minutes\n4. **Combined Time:**\n    - 182 minutes + 455 minutes = 637 minutes\n5. **Double-Check:**\n    - 637 minutes / 13 minutes/rotation (Ball A) = 49 rotations (matches)\n    - 637 minutes / 7 minutes/rotation (Ball B) = 91 rotations (matches)\n6. **Answer:**\n    - 637 minutes = 10 hours and 37 minutes\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n**Action: Answer(\"E\")**"
