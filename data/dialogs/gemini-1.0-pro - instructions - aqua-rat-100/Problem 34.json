I used the formula for calculating the selling price with a profit, but I should have used the formula for calculating the cost price with a profit.\nHere is the correct solution:\n1. Selling price = Rs 27.50, Profit percentage = 10%\n2. Cost price = 27.50 / (100 + 10) * 100 = Rs 25\n3. New selling price = Rs 25.75\n4. Profit/Loss = 25.75 - 25 = Rs 0.75\n5. Profit/Loss percentage = (0.75 / 25) * 100 = 3%\n6. The answer is 3% Profit.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
