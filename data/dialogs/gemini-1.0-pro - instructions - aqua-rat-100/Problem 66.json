I also did not identify the key information given in the question.\nI have reflected on my mistake and I am now ready to answer the question correctly.\nHere is my step-by-step solution:\n1. Read the question carefully and understand the problem.\nThe question is asking for the number of members in a club whose ages are in arithmetic progression (A.P.) with a common difference of 3 months. The youngest member is 7 years old and the sum of the ages of all the members is 250.\n2. Identify the key information given in the question.\nThe key information given in the question is:\n* The ages of the members are in A.P.\n* The common difference is 3 months.\n* The youngest member is 7 years old.\n* The sum of the ages of all the members is 250.\n3. Determine the formula or method that is needed to solve the problem.\nThe formula for the sum of an A.P. is:\n```\nSn = n/2[2a + (n-1)d]\n```\nwhere:\n* Sn is the sum of the first n terms\n* a is the first term\n* d is the common difference\n* n is the number of terms\n4. Apply the formula or method to the given information.\nWe can use the formula to find the number of terms (n) in the A.P.\n```\n250 = n/2[2(7) + (n-1)3]\n500 = n[14 + 3n - 3]\n500 = n[3n + 11]\n500 = 3n^2 + 11n\n3n^2 + 11n - 500 = 0\n(3n - 25)(n + 20) = 0\nn = 25 or n = -20\n```\nSince the number of terms cannot be negative, we have n = 25.\n5. Check your answer to make sure that it is reasonable and correct.\nThe answer is reasonable because the sum of the ages of 25 members in an A.P. with a common difference of 3 months and a first term of 7 years old is 250.\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
