Carefully read the problem statement and identify all relevant information.\n2. Break down the problem into smaller, more manageable steps.\n3. Calculate the net movement in each direction separately.\n4. Use the appropriate formula (e.g., Pythagorean theorem) to calculate the total distance.\n5. Double-check your calculations and reasoning before selecting an answer.\nGeneral Advice:\n- Pay close attention to the wording of the problem statement.\n- Avoid making assumptions that are not explicitly stated.\n- Consider all possible movements and their impact on the final position.\n- Use appropriate formulas and calculations to determine the final distance.\n- Double-check your work to ensure accuracy.\n"
