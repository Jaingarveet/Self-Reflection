We want to find the range of x = (n2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16) / (n+ 4√n+ 4).\nFirst, we can simplify the expression for x:\nx = (n2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16) / (n+ 4√n+ 4)\nx = (n + 4√n + 4)(n - 4√n + 4) / (n+ 4√n+ 4)\nx = n - 4√n + 4\nNow, we can find the range of x by considering all possible values of n within the given constraints.\nWhen n = 36, x = 36 - 4√36 + 4 = 20.\nWhen n = 72, x = 72 - 4√72 + 4 = 58.\nTherefore, the range of x is 20 < x < 58.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
