I only focused on the time taken for each individual activity.\nTo answer this question correctly, I need to:\n1. Identify the total distance traveled by adding the distances traveled in each activity.\n2. Identify the total time taken for both activities.\n3. Divide the total distance traveled by the total time taken to calculate the average speed.\n4. Express the average speed in miles per hour.\nFollowing these steps, I can calculate the average speed as follows:\nTotal distance traveled = M + N miles\nTotal time taken = 4 hours\nAverage speed = (M + N miles) / 4 hours = M + N / 4 miles per hour\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
