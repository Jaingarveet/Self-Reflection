I only considered the number of black marbles pulled out the second time.\nTo answer this question correctly, I need to consider the following:\n* The number of black marbles in the bag is 20.\n* The number of marbles in the bag is Q.\n* The percentage of black marbles in the bag is 20/Q.\n* The percentage of black marbles pulled out the second time is 1/20.\nSince the percentage of black marbles pulled out the second time represents their percentage in the bag, we can set up the following equation:\n20/Q = 1/20\nSolving for Q, we get:\nQ = 400\nTherefore, the bag currently holds 400 marbles.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
