        "content": "## Self-Reflection\n**Previous Incorrect Answer:**\nMy previous answer was incorrect because I did not consider the condition that the sum of the 5 numbers should be divisible by 10 to result in a perfect square when divided by 10.\n**Corrected Approach:**\n1. **Identify the set of 5 consecutive two-digit odd numbers:**\n    - Let the first number be x.\n    - The next 4 consecutive odd numbers are x + 2, x + 4, x + 6, and x + 8.\n2. **Calculate the sum of these numbers:**\n    - Sum = x + (x + 2) + (x + 4) + (x + 6) + (x + 8) = 5x + 20.\n3. **Divide the sum by 10:**\n    - (5x + 20) / 10 = 0.5x + 2.\n4. **Check if the result is a perfect square:**\n    - For the result to be a perfect square, 0.5x + 2 must be an integer.\n    - This means x must be an even number.\n5. **Evaluate the options:**\n    - A: 47 is odd, so it cannot be the first number.\n    - B: 91 is odd, so it cannot be the first number.\n    - C: 41 is odd, so it cannot be the first number.\n    - D: 67 is odd, so it cannot be the first number.\n    - E: 44 is even, so it can be the first number.\n6. **Verify the sum and divisibility by 10:**\n    - Sum of 5 consecutive odd numbers starting with 44: 44 + 46 + 48 + 50 + 52 = 240.\n    - 240 / 10 = 24, which is a perfect square (6^2).\nTherefore, the correct answer is E: 44.\n**Action: Answer(\"E\")**"
