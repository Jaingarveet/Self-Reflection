        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: In a recent study, each member of two groups of people, Group A (composed of persons sixty-five to seventy-five years old) and Group B (composed of college students), was required to make a telephone call to a certain number at a specified time. The time when each call was initiated was recorded electronically. Group A proved far better at remembering to make a telephone call precisely at a specified time than did Group B. There were fourteen lapses in Group B but only one lapse in Group A. Clearly, at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages.\nQuestion: Which one of the following, if all of them are true, is LEAST helpful in establishing that the conclusion above is properly drawn?\nChoices:\n  A: There was the same number of people in each group.\n  B: The same group of researchers answered the calls made by the callers in both study groups.\n  C: Among the college students there were no persons more than forty years old.\n  D: Both groups had unrestricted access to telephones for making the required calls.\n  E: The members of the two groups received their instructions approximately the same amount of time before they were to make their telephone calls.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\nThe conclusion is that at least one type of memory does not decline with age, based on the difference in the number of lapses between the two age groups. \nTo establish this conclusion, it is important to consider the conditions of the experiment. \nThe fact that the same group of researchers answered calls for both groups is significant because it introduces the potential for bias. \nIf the researchers were expecting or hoping for a certain outcome, their presence and interaction with the callers could have influenced the results. \nThis factor is least helpful in supporting the conclusion because it raises questions about the validity of the data.\n"
