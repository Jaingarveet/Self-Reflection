        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: When presented with the evidence against him, Ellison freely admitted to engaging in illegal transactions using company facilities. However, the company obtained the evidence by illegally recording Ellison's conversations. Therefore, although the company may demand that he immediately cease, it cannot justifiably take any punitive measures against him.\nQuestion: Which one of the following judgments best illustrates the principle illustrated by the argument above?\nChoices:\n  A: After Price confessed to having stolen money from Long over a period of several years, Long began stealing from Price. Despite Price's guilt, Long was not justified in taking illegal action against him.\n  B: Shakila's secretary has admitted that he is illegally receiving cable television without paying for it. Shakila would not be justified in reporting him, though, since she once did the same thing.\n  C: After Takashi told Sarah's parents that he had seen her at the movies on Tuesday, Sarah confessed to sneaking out that day. On Monday, however, Takashi had violated the local curfew for minors. Hence Sarah's parents cannot justifiably punish her in this case.\n  D: After a conservation officer discovered them, Kuttner admitted that he had set the illegal animal traps on his land. But, because she was trespassing at the time, the conservation officer cannot justifiably punish Kuttner in this case.\n  E: Ramirez was forced by the discovery of new evidence to admit that she lied about her role in managing the chief of staff's financial affairs. Nevertheless, the board of directors cannot justifiably take action against Ramirez, because in past instances it has pardoned others guilty of similar improprieties.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\nThe argument presents a situation where evidence against an individual was obtained through illegal means, rendering it inadmissible in any punitive action. \n\nChoice [REDACTED]: This scenario does not illustrate the correct principle. While Long's response to Price's theft is unjustified, the information about Price's wrongdoing was not obtained through illegal means. \n\nChoice [REDACTED]: This scenario is also incorrect. Shakila's knowledge of her secretary's wrongdoing is based on her personal experience, which is not equivalent to illegally obtained evidence. \n\nChoice [REDACTED]: This scenario does not align with the principle. Sarah's parents could have obtained information about her sneaking out from a source other than Takashi, so his curfew violation is irrelevant to the justifiability of their potential punishment. \n\n**Choice [REDACTED]: This is the correct answer.** The conservation officer discovered Kuttner's illegal traps through trespass, which renders the evidence inadmissible. The officer's wrongdoing directly relates to the discovery of Kuttner's actions, and therefore, any punitive action against Kuttner is not justifiable. \n\nChoice [REDACTED]: This scenario is incorrect. The principle in the argument focuses on the means of obtaining evidence, not the consistency of punishment. Ramirez's actions are still improper, regardless of the board's past decisions.\n"
