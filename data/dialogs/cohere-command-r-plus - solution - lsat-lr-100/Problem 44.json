In Hallstown most people shop for groceries no more than three times a month. Therefore, in Hallstown most people buy prepared frozen dinners regularly.\nQuestion: Which one of the following arguments has a flawed pattern of reasoning most like the flawed reasoning in the argument above?\nChoices:\n  A: It is clear that most drivers in West Ansland are safe drivers since there are very few driving accidents in West Ansland and most accidents there are not serious.\n  B: It is clear that John cannot drive, since he does not own a car and no one in his family who does not own a car can drive.\n  C: It is clear that Fernando's friends usually drive to school, since all of his friends can drive and all of his friends go to school.\n  D: It is clear that most people in Highland County drive sedans, since most people who commute to work drive sedans and most people in Highland County commute to work.\n  E: It is clear that most of Janine's friends are good drivers, since she accepts rides only from good drivers and she accepts rides from most of her friends.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\nThe argument states: \"Most people who shop for groceries no more than three times a month buy prepared frozen dinners regularly.\" This is the premise that sets up a potential causal relationship. \nIt then applies this premise to the people of Hallstown, who generally shop for groceries infrequently. \nThe argument concludes that, therefore, most people in Hallstown must also buy frozen dinners regularly. \n\nThis is a false cause fallacy because it assumes a causal link (infrequent shopping leads to frozen dinner purchases) without providing supporting evidence. \nIt ignores other factors that may influence frozen dinner purchases, such as personal preferences, income, or access to alternative food options. \n\nNow, reviewing the choices:\n\nOption [REDACTED]: This argument presents a valid assessment of safe driving in West Ansland based on accident data. It does not establish a false cause relationship and provides relevant evidence.\n\nOption [REDACTED]: This argument uses a logical process of elimination to conclude that John cannot drive. It does not generalize or assume causality.\n\nOption [REDACTED]: This argument assumes that because all of Fernando's friends can drive and go to school, they must drive to school. While this conclusion is not certain, it does not establish a false cause relationship. It is more of an incomplete data issue.\n\nOption [REDACTED]: Correct answer. This argument parallels the original argument. It generalizes that since most commuters drive sedans, most people in Highland County, who are mostly commuters, must also drive sedans. This assumes a causal link without considering other factors, such as personal preferences or the availability of other car types.\n\nOption [REDACTED]: Janine's reasoning about her friends' driving skills is based on her selective acceptance of rides, which could indicate a valid correlation.\n"
