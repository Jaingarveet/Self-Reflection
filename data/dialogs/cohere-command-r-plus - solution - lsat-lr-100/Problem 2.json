It could be true, but it is not a definite conclusion. \n\nStatement [REDACTED] states: It is not true that every film that won a prize at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival was also shown at an international film festival. \n\nThis statement is the correct answer because it logically follows from the given information. If most films that won at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival also won at international festivals, it means that there could be films that did not follow this pattern, i.e., some films that won at Lac Nichoutec did not win at international festivals.\n"

However, the given information does not provide any data on the production or origin of the films shown at international festivals.\n\nStatement C is true as it is supported by the first premise, which states that only Canadian films are shown at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival. Therefore, if films won prizes at this festival, they must be Canadian.\n\nStatement D is the correct answer. It is a valid conclusion from the second premise, which states that most of the films that won prizes at the Lac Nichoutec Festival also won at international festivals. This implies that there could be some films that did not follow this pattern, i.e., some films that won at Lac Nichoutec might not have won at international festivals.\n\nStatement E is incorrect because it claims that there was at least one film that won at an international festival but was not shown at Lac Nichoutec. This cannot be concluded from the given information as it contradicts the second premise, which states that most films that won at Lac Nichoutec also won at international festivals.\n\nThus, the correct answer is D.\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
