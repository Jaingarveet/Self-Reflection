It is rational not to acquire such information unless one expects that the benefits of doing so will outweigh the cost and difficulty of doing so. Therefore, consumers who do not bother to acquire such information are thereby behaving rationally.\nQuestion: The conclusion of the argument is properly drawn if which one of the following is assumed?\nChoices:\n  A: Rational consumers who do not expect that the benefits outweigh the cost and difficulty of acquiring detailed information about a product they might purchase usually do not bother to acquire such information.\n  B: Whenever it is rational not to acquire detailed information about a product, it would be irrational to bother to acquire such information.\n  C: The benefits of acquiring detailed information about a product one might purchase usually do not outweigh the cost and difficulty of doing so.\n  D: Rational consumers usually expect that the benefits of acquiring detailed information about a product they might purchase would not outweigh the cost and difficulty of doing so.\n  E: Consumers who do not bother to acquire complete detailed information about a product they might purchase do not expect that the benefits of acquiring such information will outweigh the cost and difficulty of doing so.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\n"

It states the argument's conclusion and the relationship between consumers' behavior and their expectations of costs and benefits.\n\nChoice B is incorrect as it reverses the relationship. While the argument suggests that not acquiring information can be rational, it does not mean that acquiring information in such cases is always irrational.\n\nChoice C is incorrect as it is too broad. The argument focuses on consumers' rational behavior regarding information acquisition, not the general outcome of acquiring information.\n\nChoice D is incorrect. While similar to the correct answer, it differs in a crucial way. The argument is about consumers who do not acquire information, so the expectation mentioned in choice D should be about those who do not acquire information, as stated in choice A.\n\nChoice E is incorrect as it merely restates the argument's premise without capturing the relationship between behavior and expectation, which is key to the argument's conclusion.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
