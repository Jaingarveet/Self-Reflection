        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Patricia: During Japan's Tokugawa period, martial arts experts known as ninjas were trained for the purposes of espionage and assassination. Yet at that time there was actually very little ninja activity in Japan, and most Japanese did not fear ninjas. Tamara: That is not true. Many wealthy Japanese during the Tokugawa period had their houses constructed with intentionally squeaky floors so that they would receive warning if a ninja were in the house.\nQuestion: Of the following, which one, if true, is the strongest counter Patricia can make to Tamara's objection?\nChoices:\n  A: Many poor Japanese during the Tokugawa period also had houses constructed with intentionally squeaky floors.\n  B: As part of their secret training, ninjas learned to walk on squeaky floors without making a sound.\n  C: The wealthy made up a small portion of Japan's population during the Tokugawa period.\n  D: The fighting prowess of ninjas was exaggerated to mythic proportions in the years following the Tokngawa period.\n  E: There were very few ninjas at any time other than during the Tokugawa period.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\nTamara's argument suggests that the presence of squeaky floors indicates a fear of ninjas among the wealthy during the Tokugawa period. Patricia's counter should address the extent to which this fear was widespread among the general population, not just the wealthy.\n\nChoice [REDACTED] is the strongest counter because it shifts the focus to the demographic proportions. If the wealthy made up a small portion of the population, then the presence of squeaky floors in their homes does not necessarily indicate a widespread fear of ninjas among the majority of Japanese people during that time. It refutes Tamara's argument by providing context to the limited scope of her evidence.\n"
