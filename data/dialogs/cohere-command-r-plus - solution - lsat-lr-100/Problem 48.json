So, if we are to maintain the quality of the education we provide, we must market our programs more aggressively. Without such marketing we will be unable to increase our enrollment.\nQuestion: The conclusion of the university president's argument can be properly drawn ifwhich one of the following is assumed?\nChoices:\n  A: The university will not maintain the quality of the education it provides ifit increases its enrollment.\n  B: The university will not need to reduce spending next year if it increases its enrollment.\n  C: The university will increase its enrollmentifit markets its programs more aggressively.\n  D: The university will not maintain the quality of the education it provides if it reduces spending next year.\n  E: The university will not need to reduce spending next year if it markets its programs more aggressively.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\nThe university president's argument is about maintaining educational quality and avoiding spending cuts. The conclusion is that aggressive marketing is necessary to achieve this goal by increasing enrollment. \n\nTo properly draw this conclusion, we must assume that: \n- Increasing enrollment will not negatively impact educational quality (eliminating Choice A).\n- Increasing enrollment will prevent the need for spending reductions (supporting Choice [REDACTED], but not the correct answer).\n- Aggressive marketing will lead to increased enrollment (supporting Choice [REDACTED], but not the correct answer).\n\nThe correct answer, Choice [REDACTED], assumes that educational quality will be compromised if spending is reduced. This assumption directly addresses the argument's conclusion about maintaining quality and the relationship between spending and quality.\n"
