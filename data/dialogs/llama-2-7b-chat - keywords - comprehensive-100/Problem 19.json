However, this answer does not address the logical contradiction that arises from the combination of these two statements.\n\nTo resolve this contradiction, we need to consider the meaning of the statements \"Money is like dung\" and \"Friends are worth a thousand dollars.\" If we assume that these statements are true, then we can deduce that money is not like dung, as friends are worth more than money.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option C, which states that the statement \"friends are valuable\" is true. This answer resolves the logical contradiction and is consistent with the original statements.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* REDACTED (information not allowed to be seen)"
