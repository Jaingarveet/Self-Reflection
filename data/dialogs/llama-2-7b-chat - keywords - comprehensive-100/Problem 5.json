I misunderstood the problem and calculated the sum of the ages incorrectly. I will make sure to carefully read and understand the problem before answering.\n\nTo solve this problem, I will use the formula for the nth term of an A.P.:\n\na_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d\n\nwhere a_1 is the first term, n is the term number, and d is the common difference.\n\nGiven that the youngest member is 7 years old, and the sum of the ages is 250, we can set up the equation:\n\n7 + (n - 1) * 3 = 250\n\nSolving for n, we get:\n\nn = 20\n\nTherefore, there are 20 members in the club.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
