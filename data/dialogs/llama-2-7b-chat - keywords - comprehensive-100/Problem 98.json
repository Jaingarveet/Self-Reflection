I thought the question was asking about the amino acid that is not required for protein synthesis, but it is actually asking about the tRNA that is not required for protein synthesis.\n\nThe correct answer is (D) Methionine. Methionine is the only amino acid that does not require an aminoacyl-tRNA to initiate protein synthesis. This is because methionine is the first amino acid that is added to the growing polypeptide chain during translation, and it does not require a specific tRNA to attach to the ribosome.\n\nIn summary, my mistake was due to a misunderstanding of the question, and I hope this reflection helps me to better understand the concept and provide the correct answer this time."
