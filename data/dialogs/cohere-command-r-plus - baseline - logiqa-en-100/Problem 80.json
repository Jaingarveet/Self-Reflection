The administration department is above the planning department, so it must be above finance as well.\n3. The human resources department is above the administration department.\n4. The sales department and R&D department must occupy the remaining two floors, but we don't know their order.\n\nNow, let's examine each choice:\nA: This order is not possible because human resources and sales would be adjacent.\nB: This order places finance and planning together, administration above them, human resources above that, and then sales and R&D below. This fits our deductions and is a possible solution.\nC: This order separates finance and planning, which contradicts our deduction that they must be together.\nD: This order also separates finance and planning, so it is not a valid solution.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
