However, it does not provide a comprehensive explanation.\n\nChoice C suggests improving drivers' traffic safety awareness as a potential solution, which is a different approach that might help reduce accidents regardless of drunk driving investigations. This could be a factor worth considering to address the inconsistency.\n\nChoice D proposes expanding the scope of strict investigations to include other traffic violations, suggesting that a broader approach to traffic safety might be necessary to reduce accidents. This addresses the inconsistency by proposing a more comprehensive solution.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
