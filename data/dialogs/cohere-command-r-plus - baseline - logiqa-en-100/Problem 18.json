Thus, the celebrity's reputation is at stake either way.\n\nChoice C is false - as explained above, there is no 'best' strategy that guarantees a positive outcome.\n\nChoice D is irrelevant to the argument - while friends speaking up for the celebrity may help, it is not guaranteed to have a counter-effect, especially if the majority of public opinion is already against her.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.\n\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
