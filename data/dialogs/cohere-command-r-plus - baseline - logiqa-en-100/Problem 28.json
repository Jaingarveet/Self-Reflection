Let's assume E is selected first. \n\nNext, we know that either J or K will be selected, but not both. If we select J, then according to the conditions, we must also select G. So, if E and J are selected, the remaining two selections must be G and one of the remaining options (H, K, or M). \n\nWe also know that if F is not selected, then M will not be selected. So, in this case, M is eliminated, and we are left with H and K as the remaining options. \n\nTherefore, the coach's only options to complete the four-person team are: \n- E, G, J, H\n- E, G, J, K\n\nSo, the correct answer is neither A, B, C, nor D.\nAction: None of the Above"
