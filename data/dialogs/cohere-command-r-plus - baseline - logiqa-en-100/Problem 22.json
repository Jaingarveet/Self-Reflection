This directly relates to people's perceptions of a significant price increase and does not contradict their feelings.\n\nOption D mentions that high-income groups may be less sensitive to small price increases. However, this does not explain the gap between the moderate CPI increase and the perceived higher inflation by the general public, including those with varying income levels.\n\nTherefore, option D does not help explain the discrepancy between the statistics and people's feelings.\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
