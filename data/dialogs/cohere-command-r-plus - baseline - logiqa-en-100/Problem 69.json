If we assume that Li Si's bonus is lower than Wang Wu's, then the link between Zhang Shan's bonus and Miao Xiaoqin's bonus is broken.\n\nChoice D can be eliminated as it directly contradicts assumption C, which has already been identified as critical.\n\nTherefore, the exception is Choice C.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
