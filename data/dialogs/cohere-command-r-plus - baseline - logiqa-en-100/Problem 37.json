This dilemma strongly suggests that Huaizhou will face challenges in either domain (economic stagnation or environmental deterioration), if not both.\n\nThe other choices are not as strongly supported by the given truths.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because it states that the quality of life depends \"only\" on economic growth and the natural environment, ignoring the crucial role of industry in providing jobs and wages, which is given as true in the context.\n\nChoice C is unsupported as there is no information given about the economic environment having deteriorated specifically in \"recent years.\" The context only states that there is a general threat of deterioration.\n\nChoice D is incorrect because, while chemical companies are often a major source of industrial pollution, the context does not specify that they are the main cause in Huaizhou. The pollution could come from other industries as well, given that \"inevitable\" industrial pollution is a broad statement.\n\nTherefore, choice B is the best answer.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
