Therefore, we need to consider other factors that could impact the number of crocodiles, such as food sources. \n\nChoice D provides this alternative explanation - if crocodiles and seals compete for the same food source (capelin), then the increase in seals could indeed impact the crocodile population, as they would be competing for food. \n\nNone of the other choices weaken the argument as effectively: \n- A discusses damage caused by seawater pollution, which is irrelevant to the argument about the impact of seals. \n- B notes that there are still fewer seals than crocodiles, which does not affect the potential impact of seals on crocodile numbers. \n- C suggests that the decline in crocodiles began before the seal population increased, which does not preclude the possibility that seals contributed to the decline, especially if the seal population grew rapidly. \n\nThus, choice D is the correct answer. \n\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
