Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Of the eight students—George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert—in a seminar, exactly six will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.\nQuestion: If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, could be given by\nChoices:\n  A: Helen, George, and Nina\n  B: Irving, Robert, and Helen\n  C: Nina, Helen, and Olivia\n  D: Olivia, Robert, and Irving\n  E: Robert, George, and Helen\n\nThought:\n*  **George must present on Tuesday**, so options A, C, and D are out.\n*  **Neither Olivia nor Robert can give afternoon reports**. So, option B is out as it places Robert in the morning slot.\n*  This leaves us with option E: Robert, George, and Helen. This satisfies the given conditions. \nAction: Answer(\"E\") \n\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: D"

        "content": "## Reflection on Incorrect Answer\n**Explanation:** My error stemmed from misinterpreting the constraint on Olivia and Robert. I assumed they couldn't present at all in the afternoon, overlooking the possibility of them presenting in the morning. This led me to eliminate options with them in the morning slot incorrectly.\n**Error Keywords:**\n*   Misinterpretation of constraints\n*   Logical reasoning error\n*   Assumption error\n## Step-by-Step Solution\n1.  **George on Tuesday:** Eliminate options A, C, and D as they don't have George on Tuesday.\n2.  **Olivia/Robert Constraint:**  The constraint states they cannot give *afternoon* reports, not that they cannot present at all. So, option B is still possible.\n3.  **Nina's Condition:** Option E (Robert, George, Helen) violates the condition that if Nina presents, Helen and Irving must present the next day. Since Nina is not presenting, this condition doesn't apply here.\n4.  **Remaining Option:** Option D (Olivia, Robert, and Irving) satisfies all conditions: \n    *   Olivia and Robert present in the morning.\n    *   George presents on Tuesday.\n    *   Nina's condition is irrelevant.\n## Instructions for Future\n1.  **Carefully analyze each constraint:** Pay close attention to the exact wording and avoid making assumptions.\n2.  **Consider all possibilities:** Don't eliminate options prematurely based on misinterpretations.\n3.  **Apply conditions systematically:** Check each condition against the remaining options to ensure they are met.\n4.  **Review the problem and solution:** After solving, re-read the problem and ensure your chosen answer aligns with all conditions.\n## General Advice\n*   **Break down complex problems:** Divide the problem into smaller parts and analyze each part individually.\n*   **Identify key information:** Highlight crucial details and constraints to avoid overlooking them.\n*   **Visualize the problem:** Use diagrams or tables to represent the information and relationships between elements.\n*   **Practice logical reasoning:** Work on strengthening deductive and inductive reasoning skills to improve problem-solving. \n*   **Learn from mistakes:** Analyze incorrect answers to understand the reasoning errors and avoid them in the future. \n"
