Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Medical researcher: Scientists compared a large group of joggers who habitually stretch before jogging to an equal number of joggers who do not stretch before jogging. Both groups of joggers incurred roughly the same number of injuries. This indicates that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries.\nQuestion: Which one of the following, if true, would most weaken the medical researcher's argument?\nChoices:\n  A: For both groups of joggers compared by the scientists, the rate of jogging injuries during the study was lower than the overall rate of jogging injuries.\n  B: Among the joggers in the groups compared by the scientists, many of those previously injured while jogging experienced difficulty in their efforts to perform stretches.\n  C: Most jogging injuries result from falls, collisions, and other mishaps on which the flexibility resulting from stretching would have little if any effect.\n  D: The more prone a jogger is to jogging injuries, the more likely he or she is to develop the habit of performing stretches before jogging.\n  E: Studies have found that, for certain forms of exercise, stretching beforehand can reduce the severity of injuries resulting from that exercise.\n\nThought:\nWe need to find an option that weakens the claim that stretching doesn't prevent injuries.\nOption C suggests that most jogging injuries are unrelated to flexibility, which would explain why stretching doesn't seem to have an effect. \nAction: Answer(\"C\") \n\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: D"

        "content": "## Reflection on Incorrect Answer\n**Explanation:** I focused on finding an answer choice that explained why stretching might not prevent injuries, rather than one that directly weakens the researcher's conclusion. This led me to overlook the possibility that the data itself might be flawed.\n**Error Keywords:**\n*   Misinterpretation of question\n*   Focusing on explanation instead of weakening the argument\n*   Overlooking alternative explanations\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n1.  **Identify the Conclusion:** The researcher concludes that stretching before jogging does not help prevent injuries based on the equal injury rates in stretching and non-stretching groups.\n2.  **Analyze Answer Choices:** We need to find an option that casts doubt on the conclusion, not just explain the observation.\n3.  **Evaluate Option D:** This option suggests that injury-prone joggers are more likely to stretch. This means the stretching group might have had a higher proportion of individuals predisposed to injuries, potentially masking the preventative effect of stretching. This directly weakens the researcher's conclusion by suggesting a confounding variable.\n**Instructions for Future Similar Problems:**\n1.  **Identify the Conclusion:** Clearly understand the main argument or claim being made.\n2.  **Focus on Weakening/Strengthening:** Determine whether the task is to weaken or strengthen the argument.\n3.  **Analyze Answer Choices:** Look for options that directly challenge the conclusion, not just explain the observations.\n4.  **Consider Alternative Explanations:** Think about factors that might influence the data or introduce bias.\n5.  **Choose the Most Direct Challenge:** Select the option that most effectively undermines the conclusion's logic or evidence.\n**General Advice:**\n*   **Read Carefully:** Pay close attention to the wording of the question and answer choices.\n*   **Identify Assumptions:** Recognize the underlying assumptions of the argument.\n*   **Consider Bias:** Be aware of potential biases in the data or reasoning.\n*   **Think Critically:** Don't accept conclusions at face value; question the evidence and logic.\n*   **Practice:** Regularly engage in critical thinking exercises to improve your skills. \n"
