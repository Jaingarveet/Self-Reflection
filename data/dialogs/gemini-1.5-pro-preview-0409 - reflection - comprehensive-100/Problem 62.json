Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

This led to an incorrect value for x and ultimately the wrong solution.\nError Keywords:\n - Sign error\n - Substitution error\n - Arithmetic error\nSolution:\nFollowing the initial steps correctly:\n1. We multiplied the second equation by 3 to eliminate x:\n$$\\begin{array}{r}3 x+4 y=-23 \\\\ 6 y-3 x=-57\\end{array}$$\n2. We added the two equations together: \n$$10y = -80$$\n3. We solved for y:\n$$y = -8$$\n4. Now, substitute y = -8 back into the first equation:\n$$3x + 4(-8) = -23$$\n5. Solve for x, paying close attention to the signs:\n$$3x - 32 = -23$$\n$$3x = 9$$\n$$x = 3$$\nTherefore, the correct solution is (3, -8).\nInstructions:\n1. Choose a variable to eliminate by manipulating one or both equations.\n2. Multiply one or both equations by appropriate constants to achieve the same coefficient for the chosen variable with opposite signs.\n3. Add or subtract the equations to eliminate the chosen variable.\n4. Solve for the remaining variable.\n5. Substitute the value of the found variable back into one of the original equations.\n6. Solve for the other variable, paying close attention to signs during calculations.\n7. Write the solution as an ordered pair (x, y).\n8. Double-check your solution by substituting both values back into both original equations to ensure they hold true.\nAdvice:\n - Pay close attention to signs when manipulating equations and performing calculations.\n - Double-check your work at each step, especially when substituting values back into equations.\n - Consider using different methods (substitution, graphing) to verify your solution if unsure. \n - Practice solving systems of equations regularly to improve accuracy and speed. \n"
