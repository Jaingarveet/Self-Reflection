Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: People who are allergic to cats are actually allergic to certain proteins found in the animals' skin secretions and saliva; which particular proteins are responsible, however, varies from allergy sufferer to allergy sufferer. Since all cats shed skin and spread saliva around their environment, there is no such thing as a cat incapable of provoking allergic reactions, although it is common for a given cat to cause an allergic reaction in some-but not all-people who are allergic to cats.\nQuestion: Which one of the following statements is most strongly supported by the information above?\nChoices:\n  A: Any particular individual will be allergic to some breeds of cat but not to others.\n  B: No cat is capable of causing an allergic reaction in all types of allergy sufferers.\n  C: Not all cats are identical with respect to the proteins contained in their skin secretions and saliva.\n  D: The allergic reactions of some people who are allergic to cats are more intense than the allergic reactions of other allergy sufferers.\n  E: There is no way to predict whether a given cat will produce an allergic reaction in a particular allergy sufferer.\n\nThought:\nThe context highlights the variability of allergens among cats and the individual responses of allergy sufferers. \nOption B directly addresses this by stating that no single cat can trigger allergies in all individuals. \nAction: Answer(\"B\") \n\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: C"

        "content": "## Reflection on Incorrect Answer\n**Explanation:** I focused on the variability of allergic reactions among individuals but missed the key point about the variability of allergens among cats. The passage clearly states that the specific proteins causing allergies differ between cats.\n**Error Keywords:**\n*   Misinterpretation \n*   Focus on wrong information\n*   Ignoring key details\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n1.  **Identify the main topic:** The passage discusses cat allergies and the causes of allergic reactions.\n2.  **Analyze each answer choice:**\n    *   A is incorrect as it talks about breed-specific allergies, which is not mentioned.\n    *   B is partially correct but doesn't capture the full essence of the passage.\n    *   **C directly addresses the variability of proteins among cats, aligning with the passage's information.**\n    *   D discusses the intensity of reactions, which is not the focus.\n    *   E talks about predictability, which is not the main point.\n3.  **Choose the best answer:** Based on the analysis, C is the most strongly supported statement.\n**Instructions for Future:**\n1.  **Read the passage thoroughly:** Pay close attention to details and key points.\n2.  **Identify the central theme:** Understand the main idea the passage conveys.\n3.  **Analyze each answer choice in relation to the passage:** Eliminate options that are irrelevant or contradict the information.\n4.  **Choose the answer that best reflects the passage's main point and supporting details.**\n**General Advice:**\n*   **Avoid assumptions and focus on the information provided.**\n*   **Pay attention to keywords and phrases that indicate the main idea.**\n*   **Consider all answer choices carefully before making a decision.**\n*   **Practice active reading and critical thinking skills.** \n"
