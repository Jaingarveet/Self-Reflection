Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "## Reflection on Incorrect Answer\n**Explanation:** I incorrectly assumed the \"R\" in the disease name referred to the inheritance pattern, leading me to choose X-linked dominant. My knowledge gap was in the specific inheritance pattern of Hypophosphatemic Vitamin D Resistant Rickets.\n**Error Keywords:**\n*   Misinterpretation \n*   Assumption error\n*   Genetics knowledge gap\n## Solving the Problem\n1. **Analyze the name:** Break down the name \"Hypophosphatemic Vitamin D Resistant Rickets\" to understand its meaning. \n    *   Hypophosphatemic: Low phosphate levels in the blood\n    *   Vitamin D Resistant: Resistance to the effects of Vitamin D\n    *   Rickets: A bone disorder caused by impaired mineralization\n2. **Recall inheritance patterns:** Consider the common inheritance patterns:\n    *   Autosomal Dominant (AD)\n    *   Autosomal Recessive (AR)\n    *   X-linked Dominant (XD)\n    *   X-linked Recessive (XR)\n3. **Research or recall specific knowledge:**  Hypophosphatemic Vitamin D Resistant Rickets is known to be an X-linked Dominant disorder.\nTherefore, the correct answer is **C: XD**. \n## Instructions for Future Problem Solving\n1. **Break down medical terms:** Analyze the components of disease names to understand their meaning and potential causes.\n2. **Avoid assumptions:** Do not assume the meaning of abbreviations or terms within a disease name without verification.\n3. **Review inheritance patterns:** Refresh knowledge of basic inheritance patterns and their characteristics.\n4. **Research specific diseases:** When encountering unfamiliar diseases, research their inheritance patterns and key features.\n## General Advice for Similar Problems\n*   **Build a strong foundation:** Continuously expand your knowledge base in medicine and related fields like genetics.\n*   **Consult reliable resources:** Utilize textbooks, medical journals, and reputable online databases for accurate information.\n*   **Practice critical thinking:** Analyze information carefully and question assumptions before reaching conclusions.\n*   **Learn from mistakes:** Reflect on incorrect answers to identify knowledge gaps and improve future performance. \n"
