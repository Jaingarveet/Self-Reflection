Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

This satisfies all constraints. \n    *   **C:** Sales above Planning would place it next to HR (as Finance is above Planning), violating constraint 1.\n    *   **D:** Sales on the 2nd floor is possible but doesn't necessarily fit the scenario.\n3.  **Choose the option that fits the constraints and the question prompt:** Option B is the only option that satisfies all given constraints and could be true based on the information provided.\n## Instructions for Future Similar Problems\n1.  **Carefully analyze each statement and identify the relationships between the departments.**\n2.  **Pay close attention to the wording of the question and what it asks for.**\n3.  **Consider all possible arrangements that satisfy the given constraints.**\n4.  **Eliminate options that directly contradict the information or the question prompt.**\n5.  **Choose the option that logically follows from the given information and constraints, even if it's not explicitly stated.**\n## General Advice for Logic Problems\n*   **Break down complex problems into smaller, manageable steps.**\n*   **Draw diagrams or use visualization techniques to represent the relationships between elements.**\n*   **Consider all possibilities and eliminate options that violate the given constraints.**\n*   **Focus on the logical implications of the information provided, not just the explicit statements.**\n*   **Practice with various logic problems to improve your reasoning and inference skills.** \n"
