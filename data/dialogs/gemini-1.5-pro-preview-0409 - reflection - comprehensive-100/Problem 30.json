Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Exactly eight books—F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O—are placed on a bookcase with exactly three shelves—the top shelf, the middle shelf, and the bottom shelf. At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.\nQuestion: If G is placed on the top shelf, then which one of the following could be a complete and accurate list of the books placed on the middle shelf?\nChoices:\n  A: H, I\n  B: I, L\n  C: H, I, L\n  D: I, K, L\n  E: F, I, M\n\nThought:\n*   G is on the top shelf. \n*   I is on the middle shelf.\n*   K is above F, so K cannot be on the middle shelf with I. This eliminates options D and E.\n*   O is above L, so L could be on the middle shelf. This leaves options B and C as possibilities.\n*   F is with M, and since K is above F, both F and M must be on the bottom shelf (as K cannot be on the middle shelf). \n*   This leaves only H and I for the middle shelf.\nAction: Answer(\"A\") \n\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: D"

        "content": "## Reflection on Incorrect Answer\n**Explanation:** My error stemmed from a misinterpretation of the placement of book K. I assumed K being above F meant it couldn't be on the middle shelf, overlooking the possibility of F being on the bottom shelf.\n**Error Keywords:**\n*   Logic error\n*   Misinterpretation \n*   Assumption error\n*   Placement constraint misunderstanding \n## Step-by-Step Solution\n1. **G on Top Shelf:** We know G is on the top shelf. \n2. **I on Middle Shelf:** I is always on the middle shelf.\n3. **K above F:** K needs to be above F, but this doesn't restrict K to the top shelf.\n4. **O above L:** O needs to be above L, so L cannot be on the top shelf.\n5. **F with M:** F and M are always together.\n6. **Bottom Shelf Capacity:** Since more books are on the bottom shelf than the top, and G is alone on top, the bottom shelf must have at least 3 books.\nConsidering these constraints:\n*   **Top Shelf:** G\n*   **Middle Shelf:** I, K, L (possible)\n*   **Bottom Shelf:** F, M, O (possible)\nTherefore, the middle shelf could be **I, K, and L (Option D)**. \n## Instructions for Future Similar Problems\n1. **List all constraints explicitly:** Write down each placement rule clearly.\n2. **Consider all possibilities:** Don't make assumptions about placement based on partial information.\n3. **Work through scenarios:** Test different shelf arrangements that satisfy the constraints.\n4. **Pay attention to shelf capacity:** Remember the rule about the number of books on each shelf.\n5. **Eliminate impossible options:** Use the process of elimination based on the constraints.\n## General Advice for Similar Problems\n*   **Read carefully:** Understand the problem and all its conditions before starting.\n*   **Be flexible in your thinking:** Don't get locked into one interpretation of the rules.\n*   **Visualize the problem:**  Try drawing a diagram or using objects to represent the books and shelves.\n*   **Check your work:** Ensure your solution satisfies all the given conditions. \n*   **Practice similar problems:**  The more you practice, the better you will become at logical reasoning and problem-solving. \n"
