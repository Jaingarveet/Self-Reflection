Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "## Reflection on Incorrect Answer\n**Explanation:** My knowledge of the venous drainage system was incomplete, leading me to overlook the direct connection between the right suprarenal vein and the inferior vena cava. I incorrectly assumed all suprarenal veins drained via the renal veins.\n**Error Keywords:**\n*   Knowledge gap\n*   Anatomy misconception\n*   Venous drainage error\n## Step-by-Step Solution\n1.  **Recall the function of the inferior vena cava:** It collects deoxygenated blood from the lower body and returns it to the heart.\n2.  **Consider the options:**\n    *   Superior and inferior mesenteric veins are part of the hepatic portal system, not directly connected to the inferior vena cava.\n    *   Renal veins do drain directly into the inferior vena cava.\n    *   **Right suprarenal vein:** This vein drains the right adrenal gland and, unlike the left, directly connects to the inferior vena cava. \n3.  **Choose the correct option:** Based on the above, the right suprarenal vein (C) is the correct answer. \n## Instructions for Future Problem Solving\n1.  **Review the anatomy of the venous system**, paying close attention to the connections between major veins and their tributaries.\n2.  **Specifically focus on the drainage patterns of the adrenal glands**, noting the difference between the right and left suprarenal veins.\n3.  **When encountering questions about venous drainage, systematically eliminate options** based on your knowledge of the circulatory system.\n4.  **If unsure, consider the anatomical location and function of the structures involved** to make an educated guess.\n## General Advice for Similar Problems\n*   **Continuously update and refine your knowledge base** in medicine and anatomy.\n*   **Pay attention to exceptions and variations** within anatomical systems.\n*   **Develop a systematic approach to problem-solving** that involves elimination and logical reasoning.\n*   **Use anatomical and physiological principles to guide your reasoning** when faced with uncertainty. \n*   **Practice applying your knowledge to different scenarios** to reinforce understanding. \n"
