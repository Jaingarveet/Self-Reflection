[step] A land contract is when a homeowner agrees to sell a home directly to the buyer, with the terms for the deal set privately by the buyer and the seller. This allows for flexibility in setting up an agreeable payment schedule and permits the sale of homes to individuals with bad credit.\nChoices:\n  A: A land contract includes the following provisions : [substeps] The buyer agrees to pay a percentage of the purchase price. The seller agrees to pay the purchase price in repayment and whatever is due to the buyer in the sale.\n  B: Typically full payment is expected quicker than would be the case with a traditional mortgage, but the period of repayment is usually at least five years. The buyer lives in the house while he or she is completing payment on the property.\n  C: [title] Conduct business on an established bank account. [step] This will allow the buyer and seller to use the proceeds to purchase new homes with favorable terms.\n  D: Most real estate companies, though, will rent a home with a land contract in addition to paying off the mortgage, usually at a percentage of the purchase price. In exchange, the seller does the same for the buyer.\n"
