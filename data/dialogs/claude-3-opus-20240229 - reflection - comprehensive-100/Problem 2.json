        "content": "Topic: Math\nQuestion: A straight picket fence is composed of x pickets each of which is 1/2 inch wide. If there are 6 inches of space between each pair of pickets, which of the following represents the length of fence in feet?\nChoices:\n  A: 13x/2\n  B: 13x/2 - 6\n  C: 13x/24\n  D: (13x+1)/24\n  E: (13x-12)/24\n\nOkay, let's break this down step-by-step:\n1) Each picket is 1/2 inch wide.\n2) There are 6 inches of space between each pair of pickets.\n3) So, the total width of one picket plus one space is 1/2 + 6 = 13/2 inches.\n4) The total length of the fence will be the number of pickets (x) multiplied by the width of one picket plus one space (13/2 inches).\n   So, the total length in inches is: x * 13/2 = 13x/2 inches\n5) But the question asks for the length in feet. To convert inches to feet, we need to divide by 12.\n   So, the length in feet is: (13x/2) / 12 = 13x/24 feet\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: 13x/24.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: E"

        "content": "Explanation:\nI made an error in my calculation of the total length of the fence. I correctly identified that each picket plus space is 13/2 inches wide, but I failed to account for the fact that there is no space after the last picket. So my formula included an extra 6 inches of length.\nError Keywords:\n - Logical error\n - Fencepost error\n - Off-by-one error\n - Incorrect formula\nSolution:\n1) Each picket is 1/2 inch wide.\n2) There are 6 inches of space between each pair of pickets.\n3) So, the total width of one picket plus one space is 1/2 + 6 = 13/2 inches.\n4) For x pickets, there are only x-1 spaces. \n5) The total length in inches is: \n   (number of pickets * width of each picket) + (number of spaces * width of each space)\n   = (x * 1/2) + ((x-1) * 6)\n   = x/2 + 6x - 6\n   = 13x/2 - 6 inches\n6) To convert inches to feet, divide by 12:\n   (13x/2 - 6) / 12 = (13x - 12) / 24 feet\nTherefore, the correct answer is E: (13x-12)/24.\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the width of each picket.\n2. Identify the width of the space between pickets.\n3. Calculate the total width of one picket plus one space.\n4. Determine the number of spaces for x pickets (it's x-1, not x).\n5. Calculate the total length by:\n   - Multiplying the number of pickets by the width of each picket\n   - Multiplying the number of spaces by the width of each space\n   - Adding these two results\n6. If needed, convert the total length to the requested units by dividing.\n7. Simplify the resulting expression if possible.\n8. Select the answer choice that matches your expression.\nAdvice:\n - Always consider the \"fencepost problem\" - if you have x posts, you usually only have x-1 spaces between them.\n - Break the problem into parts - calculate the total contribution from the pickets, then the total contribution from the spaces, then add.\n - Remember to do unit conversions at the end if necessary.\n - Simplify your expression to match the answer choices, factoring out common terms.\n - Double-check your work, especially for off-by-one errors."
