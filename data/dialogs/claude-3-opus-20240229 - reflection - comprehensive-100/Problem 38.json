        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Economics professor: Marty's Pizza and Checkers Pizza are the two major pizza parlors in our town. Marty's sold coupon books including coupons good for one large plain pizza at any local pizza parlor, at Marty's expense. But Checkers refused to accept these coupons, even though they were redeemed by all other local pizza parlors. Accepting them would have cost Checkers nothing and would have satisfied those of its potential customers who had purchased the coupon books. This shows that Checkers's motive in refusing to accept the coupons was simply to hurt Marty's Pizza.\nQuestion: Which one of the following, if assumed, enables the economics professor's conclusion to be properly drawn?\nChoices:\n  A: Any company that refuses to accept coupons issued by a competitor when doing so would satisfy some of the company's potential customers is motivated solely by the desire to hurt that competitor.\n  B: Any company that wishes to hurt a competitor by refusing to accept coupons issued by that competitor will refuse to accept them even when accepting them would cost nothing and would satisfy its potential customers.\n  C: At least one company has refused to accept coupons issued by its major local competitor simply in order to hurt that competitor, even though those coupons were accepted by all other local competitors.\n  D: Any company that accepts its major competitor's coupons helps its competitor by doing so, even if it also satisfies its own actual or potential customers.\n  E: If accepting coupons issued by a competitor would not enable a company to satisfy its actual or potential customers, then that company's refusal to accept the coupons is motivated by the desire to satisfy customers.\n\nTo determine which assumption enables the professor's conclusion, let's break down the argument:\nPremise 1: Marty's Pizza sold coupon books for one large plain pizza, redeemable at any local pizza parlor.\nPremise 2: Checkers Pizza refused to accept these coupons, even though all other local pizza parlors accepted them.\nPremise 3: Accepting the coupons would have cost Checkers nothing and satisfied its potential customers who purchased the coupon books.\nConclusion: Checkers's motive in refusing the coupons was simply to hurt Marty's Pizza.\nThe correct assumption should bridge the gap between the premises and the conclusion, specifically addressing Checkers's motive.\nChoice A is too broad, as it assumes any company refusing competitor coupons is solely motivated by hurting the competitor, regardless of other factors.\nChoice B is the correct assumption. If a company wants to hurt a competitor by refusing their coupons, they would do so even when accepting them would cost nothing and satisfy potential customers. This directly supports the professor's conclusion about Checkers's motive.\nChoice C provides an example of a company acting to hurt a competitor but doesn't necessarily apply to Checkers's specific situation and motive.\nChoice D focuses on the effect of accepting coupons rather than the motive behind refusing them.\nChoice E discusses a situation where refusing coupons is motivated by customer satisfaction, which is not relevant to the professor's argument.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: A"

        "content": "Explanation:\nI incorrectly assumed that Choice B was the correct answer because it seemed to directly support the professor's conclusion about Checkers's motive. However, upon further reflection, I realize that Choice B is actually restating the conclusion rather than providing an assumption that enables the conclusion to be properly drawn.\nError Keywords:\n - Incorrect assumption\n - Restating conclusion\n - Failing to identify the gap between premises and conclusion\n - Misinterpreting answer choices\nSolution:\nThe professor's argument can be broken down as follows:\nPremise 1: Marty's Pizza sold coupon books for one large plain pizza, redeemable at any local pizza parlor.\nPremise 2: Checkers Pizza refused to accept these coupons, even though all other local pizza parlors accepted them.\nPremise 3: Accepting the coupons would have cost Checkers nothing and satisfied its potential customers who purchased the coupon books.\nConclusion: Checkers's motive in refusing the coupons was simply to hurt Marty's Pizza.\nTo properly draw the conclusion, we need an assumption that connects the premises (Checkers's refusal to accept the coupons despite no cost and potential customer satisfaction) to the conclusion (Checkers's motive was to hurt Marty's).\nChoice A provides this necessary assumption: If a company refuses to accept a competitor's coupons when doing so would satisfy potential customers and cost nothing, then the company's sole motivation must be to hurt the competitor. This assumption bridges the gap between the premises and the conclusion, enabling the conclusion to be properly drawn.\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the premises and conclusion of the argument.\n2. Determine the gap between the premises and the conclusion.\n3. Look for an answer choice that provides an assumption to bridge this gap.\n4. Ensure the chosen answer is an assumption, not a restatement of the conclusion or premises.\n5. Eliminate answer choices that are irrelevant, too broad, or unsupported by the given information.\nAdvice:\n - Always carefully identify the premises and conclusion of an argument.\n - Look for the gap between the premises and conclusion that needs to be bridged by an assumption.\n - Be cautious of answer choices that simply restate the conclusion or premises.\n - Eliminate answer choices that are out of scope, too broad, or unsupported by the given information.\n - The correct assumption should be a statement that, if true, enables the conclusion to be properly drawn from the premises."
