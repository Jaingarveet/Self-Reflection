        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Until 1985 all commercial airlines completely replenished the cabin air in planes in flight once every 30 minutes. Since then the rate has been once every hour. The less frequently cabin air is replenished in a plane in flight, the higher the level of carbon dioxide in that plane and the easier it is for airborne illnesses to be spread.\nQuestion: Which one of the following is most strongly supported by the information above?\nChoices:\n  A: In 1985 there was a loosening of regulations concerning cabin air in commercial airline flights.\n  B: People who fly today are more likely to contract airborne illnesses than were people who flew prior to 1985.\n  C: Low levels of carbon dioxide in cabin air make it impossible for airborne illnesses to spread.\n  D: In 1980 the rate at which the cabin air was replenished in commercial airliners was sufficient to protect passengers from the effects of carbon dioxide buildup.\n  E: In 1980 the level of carbon dioxide in the cabin air on a two-hour commercial airline flight was lower than it is today on a similar flight.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI misinterpreted the question and focused on the regulatory aspect rather than the carbon dioxide levels. I missed the key phrase \"be supported by\" and jumped to a conclusion about regulations. \n\nError Keywords:\n- Misinterpretation\n- Overlooking details\n- Jumping to conclusions\n\nSolution:\nThe context provides information about the rate of cabin air replenishment and its relationship to carbon dioxide levels. It states that less frequent air replenishment results in higher carbon dioxide levels. \n\nBefore 1985, cabin air was replenished every 30 minutes, which is more frequent than the current rate of once per hour. Therefore, we can infer that carbon dioxide levels were lower during a two-hour flight in 1980 than they would be during a similar flight today. \n\nInstructions:\n1. Read the question carefully and identify what needs to be supported by the information provided. \n2. Understand the context by identifying the key details: rate of cabin air replenishment and its impact on carbon dioxide levels. \n3. Recognize the relationship between air replenishment frequency and carbon dioxide levels. \n4. Compare the historical rate of replenishment (every 30 minutes) with the current rate (once per hour). \n5. Apply the relationship to the scenario described in option [REDACTED]: a two-hour flight in 1980 vs. a similar flight today. \n6. Choose the option that aligns with the inference supported by the information. \n\nAdvice:\n- Read the question and context carefully, identifying key phrases and relationships. \n- Avoid jumping to conclusions based on partial interpretations. \n- Ensure that your response directly addresses the specific point being asked about. \n- Consider all the information provided and how it relates to the options before selecting an answer. \n- Be mindful of potential traps or red herrings in the options that may lead you astray.\n"
