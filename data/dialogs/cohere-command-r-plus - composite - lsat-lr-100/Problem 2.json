It could be true, but it is not a definite conclusion. \n\nStatement [REDACTED] states: It is not true that every film that won a prize at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival was also shown at an international film festival. \n\nThis statement is the correct answer because it logically follows from the given information. If most films that won at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival also won at international festivals, it means that there could be films that did not follow this pattern, i.e., some films that won at Lac Nichoutec did not win at international festivals. \n\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the given statements and understand their implications. \n2. For each choice, determine if it logically follows from the given statements. \n3. Consider all possibilities and do not make assumptions beyond the given information. \n4. Look for statements that capture the essence of the given information while covering all possibilities. \n\nAdvice:\n - Always read and understand the given statements carefully. \n - Consider all possibilities and do not make assumptions or narrow your focus too quickly. \n - Look for statements that capture the core relationship between the given facts while allowing for alternative scenarios. \n - Practice identifying logical relationships and patterns to improve your understanding of logical reasoning. \n - Remember that \"must also be true\" indicates a definite conclusion, leaving no room for alternative possibilities.\n"

This is because, for Canadian films to have won prizes at both festivals, they must have been included in the group of films that won at international festivals.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is Choice C.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
