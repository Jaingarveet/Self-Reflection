        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: A smoker trying to quit is more likely to succeed if his or her doctor greatly exaggerates the dangers of smoking. Similar strategies can be used to break other habits. But since such strategies involve deception, individuals cannot easily adopt them unless a doctor or some other third party provides the warning.\nQuestion: Which one of the following is an assumption on which the argument depends?\nChoices:\n  A: People tend to believe whatever doctors tell them.\n  B: Most of the techniques that help people quit smoking can also help people break other habits.\n  C: The more the relevant danger is exaggerated, the more likely one is to break one's habit.\n  D: People generally do not find it easy to deceive themselves.\n  E: A doctor is justified in deceiving a patient whenever doing so is likely to make the patient healthier.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI misinterpreted the argument's focus on the role of third-party deception in habit-breaking. \nI overlooked the key assumption that individuals cannot easily deceive themselves and require external deception to facilitate behavior change. \nError Keywords:\n- Interpretation error\n- Omission error\n- Deception assumption error\nSolution:\nThe argument discusses the challenge of breaking habits and the potential effectiveness of exaggerated warnings delivered by doctors or third parties. \nChoice [REDACTED] is the correct answer because the argument assumes that individuals cannot easily deceive themselves to break habits. \nThis assumption is critical to the argument's conclusion that external deception by a doctor or third party is necessary for habit change.\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the argument's conclusion: Exaggerated warnings from doctors can help smokers quit.\n2. Determine the supporting evidence: Similar strategies involving deception can break habits.\n3. Recognize the gap: Individuals cannot easily employ such strategies themselves.\n4. Analyze the role of the third party: They provide external deception, filling the gap.\n5. Understand the key assumption: People generally cannot deceive themselves to break habits.\n6. Evaluate each choice: Only Choice [REDACTED] aligns with the identified assumption.\nAdvice:\n- Carefully identify the argument's conclusion and underlying assumptions.\n- Recognize the role of third parties in providing external deception.\n- Focus on the challenge of self-deception and the need for external influence.\n- Evaluate each choice critically, ensuring it aligns with the identified assumption.\n- Avoid surface-level interpretations and look for deeper, underlying assumptions.\n"
