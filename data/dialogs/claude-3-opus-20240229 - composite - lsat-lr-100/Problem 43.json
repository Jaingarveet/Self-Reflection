        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Ethicist: Marital vows often contain the promise to love \"until death do us part.\" If \"love\" here refers to a feeling, then this promise makes no sense, for feelings are not within one's control, and a promise to do something not within one's control makes no sense. Thus, no one—including those making marital vows—should take \"love\" in this context to be referring to feelings.\nQuestion: The ethicist's conclusion follows logically if which one of the following is assumed?\nChoices:\n  A: None of our feelings are within our control.\n  B: People should not make promises to do something that is not within their control.\n  C: \"Love\" can legitimately be taken to refer to something other than feelings.\n  D: Promises should not be interpreted in such a way that they make no sense.\n  E: Promises that cannot be kept do not make any sense.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI incorrectly identified the assumption as being that people should not make promises to do something outside their control. While this is stated in the argument, it is not the key assumption needed for the conclusion to follow. The conclusion that \"love\" should not be taken to refer to feelings relies on the unstated assumption that promises should not be interpreted in a way that makes them nonsensical. I failed to recognize this implicit premise in the argument.\nError Keywords:\n - Incorrect identification of key assumption\n - Failure to recognize implicit premise\n - Misinterpretation of argument structure\n - Logical reasoning error\nSolution:\n1. The argument states that if \"love\" in wedding vows refers to a feeling, the promise makes no sense.\n2. This is because feelings are outside one's control, and promising something outside one's control is nonsensical.\n3. The conclusion is that \"love\" in this context should not be taken to refer to feelings.\n4. For this conclusion to follow, we must assume that promises should not be interpreted in a way that makes them nonsensical.\n5. Therefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED]\nInstructions:\n1. Read the argument carefully and identify the conclusion.\n2. Identify the explicit premises stated in the argument.\n3. Look for the gap between the stated premises and the conclusion.\n4. Determine what unstated premise is required to bridge this gap and make the conclusion follow logically.\n5. Select the answer choice that best captures this necessary assumption.\nAdvice:\n - Always read arguments carefully and break them down into their component parts.\n - Identify both the explicit premises and the conclusion of the argument.\n - Look for unstated assumptions that are necessary for the conclusion to follow from the premises.\n - Be careful not to select an answer just because it is stated in the argument; it must be the key assumption.\n - Eliminate answer choices that are irrelevant or insufficient to make the conclusion follow logically.\n"

        "content": "Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:\n1. The conclusion of the argument is that no one should take \"love\" in marital vows to be referring to feelings.\n2. The explicit premises are:\n   - If \"love\" in marital vows refers to a feeling, the promise makes no sense. \n   - This is because feelings are not within one's control.\n   - Promising something not within one's control makes no sense.\n3. There is a gap between these premises and the conclusion. The premises talk about promises not making sense, but the conclusion is about how we should interpret \"love\".\n4. To bridge this gap, we need to assume that promises should not be interpreted in a way that makes them nonsensical. This unstated premise connects the idea of a nonsensical promise to the claim that we shouldn't interpret \"love\" as referring to feelings.\n5. Looking at the answer choices, D captures this necessary assumption: \"Promises should not be interpreted in such a way that they make no sense.\"\nThe other choices are either irrelevant or insufficient:\n- A is too broad, as the argument only requires that feelings of love are outside our control. \n- B is stated in the argument but is not the key assumption needed.\n- C is tempting but doesn't itself justify the conclusion.\n- E is close but too strong, as a promise could make no sense for reasons other than being impossible to keep.\nTherefore, the answer that best identifies the missing assumption is:\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
