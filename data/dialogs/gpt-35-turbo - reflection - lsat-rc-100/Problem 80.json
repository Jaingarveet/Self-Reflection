        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Music and literature, rivals among the arts, have not coexisted without intruding on each other's terrain. Ever since what we think of as \"literature\" developed out of the sounds of spoken, sung, and chanted art, writing bas aspired to the condition of music, in which fonn contnbutes significantly to content. Nowhere is this truer than in the African American tradition, whose music is often considered its greatest artistic achievement and one of the greatest contributions to North American art. But while many African American writers have used musicians and music as theme and metaphor in their writing, none had attempted to draw upon a musical genre as the structuring principle for an entire novel until Toni Morrison did so in her 1992 novel Jazz, a novel set in the Harlem section of New York City in 1926 . In Jazz, the connection to music is found not only in the novel's plot but, more strikingly, in the way in which the story is told. The narration slips easily from the third-person omniscience of the narrator's disembodied voice-which, though sensitive and sympathetic, claims no particular identity, gender, or immersion in specific social circumstances-to the first-person lyricism of key characters. But throughout these shifts, the narrator is both generous with the characters' voices and protective of his or her mastery over the narrative as a whole. On the one hand, the central characters are given the responsibility of relating their parts of the overarching story, but on the other hand, their sections are set offby quotation maIks, reminders that the narrator is allowing them to speak.. In this way, the narrative is analogous in structure to the playing of a jazz hand which intertwines its ensemble sound with the individuality of emhedded solo perfunnances. In jazz, composer and conductor Duke Ellington was the first to construct his compositions with his individual musicians and their unique \"voices\" in mind. Yet no matter how lengthy his musicians' improvisations, no matter how bold or inventive their solos might be, they always performed within the undeniable logic of the composer's frame-they always, in other words, performed as ifwith quotation marks ar01md their improvisations and solos. It is this same effect that Toni Morrison has achieved in Jazz, a literary rendering of an art of composition that Duke Ellington perfected around the time in which Jazz is set. In this novel, Morrison has found a way, paradoxically, to create the sense of an ensemble of characters improvising within the fixed scope of a carefully constructed collective narration. By simulating the style of a genius of music while exhibiting Morrison's own linguistic virtuosity, Jazz serves to redefine the very possibilities of narrative point of view.\nQuestion: The author's primary purpose in the passage is to\nChoices:\n  A: analyze and commend the variety of contributions to the art of the novel made by a particular writer\n  B: contrast a particular AfricanAmerican writer's work with the work of African American practitioners of another art\n  C: descrthe a particular aspect of one wOIk by a particular writer\n  D: demonstrate the ways in which two apparently dissimilar arts are, on a deeper analysis, actually quite similar\n  E: detail the thematic concems in the work ofa particular writer and identifY the sources of those concerns\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\") \nThe author's primary purpose in the passage is to demonstrate the ways in which two apparently dissimilar arts, music and literature, are, on a deeper analysis, actually quite similar. The author uses Toni Morrison's novel Jazz as an example of how literature can be structured like a jazz composition, with individual voices improvising within a fixed frame. The passage discusses the connection between music and literature, and how Morrison's novel uses the structure of jazz to redefine the possibilities of narrative point of view.\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: C"
