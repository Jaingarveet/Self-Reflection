Let's analyze the problem again:\n\nA point on the edge of a fan blade that is rotating in a plane 10 centimeters from the center of the fan. What is the distance traveled, in centimeters, by this point after 30 seconds when the fan runs at the rate of 300 revolutions per minute?\n\nWe know that the fan blade is rotating in a plane, so we can use the formula for the distance traveled by a point on a rotating circle:\n\nDistance = (radius of circle) x (angular velocity) x (time)\n\nIn this case, the radius of the circle is 10 centimeters (since the point is on the edge of the fan blade and the fan blade is rotating in a plane).\n\nThe angular velocity is given as 300 revolutions per minute (RPM). To convert this to radians per second, we can use the following conversion factor:\n\n1 radian/s = (300 RPM) x (2π radians/revolution)\n\nSo, the angular velocity is:\n\nangular velocity = 300 RPM x (2π radians/revolution) = 600π radians/s\n\nNow, we need to find the time in seconds. We are given that the fan runs for 30 seconds. Therefore, the time in seconds is:\n\ntime = 30 s\n\nNow, we can plug in the values we have found into the formula for distance traveled:\n\nDistance = (10 cm) x (600π radians/s) x (30 s)\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nDistance = 6000π cm\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nAction: Answer(\"E\")\n\nTherefore, the distance traveled by the point on the edge of the fan blade after 30 seconds is 6000π centimeters."
