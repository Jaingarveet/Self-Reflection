[REDACTED] travels 3 km towards the south.\n2. Then, [REDACTED] travels 5 km towards the east.\n3. Next, [REDACTED] travels 3 km towards the north.\n4. Finally, [REDACTED] travels 2 km towards the west.\n\nWe can represent A's journey as a right triangle with legs of length 3 km and 5 km, and a hypotenuse of unknown length.\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the length of the hypotenuse:\n\nHypotenuse = sqrt(3^2 + 5^2)\n\n= sqrt(9 + 25)\n\n= sqrt(34)\n\n= 6 km\n\nSo, [REDACTED] is 6 km away from home.\n"
