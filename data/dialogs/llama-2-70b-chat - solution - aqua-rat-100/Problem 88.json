After covering quarter of the distance, it starts raining and the train has to be slowed to speed of 75 miles/hour. What is the total journey duration?\nChoices:\n  A: 10\n  B: 11.5\n  C: 12.5\n  D: 13.5\n  E: 15\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\nLet's break this down step by step:\n\n1. The train's original speed is [REDACTED]0 miles/hour, and it takes [REDACTED] hours to reach its destination.\n2. This means the train travels a total distance of [REDACTED]00 miles ([REDACTED] x [REDACTED]0).\n3. The train slows down to 75 miles/hour after covering a quarter of the distance, which is 250 miles (1/4 x [REDACTED]00).\n4. The time taken to cover the remaining distance of 750 miles ([REDACTED]00 - 250) at a speed of 75 miles/hour is:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\nTime = 750 / 75\nTime = [REDACTED]\n\n5. The total journey duration is the sum of the time taken to cover the first quarter of the distance and the time taken to cover the remaining distance:\n\nTotal Time = [REDACTED] + [REDACTED]\nTotal Time = 20\n\n6. Therefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED] hours.\n"
