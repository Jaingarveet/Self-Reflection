What is the diameter of the sphere?\nChoices:\n  A:  13.3542\n  B:  15.8113\n  C:  18.3451\n  D:  19.5667\n  E:  20.8888\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\nLet's first determine the volume of the rectangular solid.\nVolume = Length × Width × Height\nVolume = 3 × 4 × 15\nVolume = 60\n\nSince the solid is inscribed in a sphere, the volume of the sphere is equal to the volume of the solid.\n\nWe can use the formula for the volume of a sphere:\nV = (4/3)πr³\n\nwhere r is the radius of the sphere.\n\nNow, we can set up the equation:\n(4/3)πr³ = 60\n\nWe can solve for r:\nr³ = (60/(4/3)) = 3^3 = 27\nr = 3\n\nNow, we can find the diameter of the sphere:\ndiameter = 2r = 2(3) = 6\n\nSo, the diameter of the sphere is 6.\n"
