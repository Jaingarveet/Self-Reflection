The sequence of 5 odd numbers is [REDACTED], [REDACTED], 89, 111, 133. When divided by 10, the numbers become 4.7, 6.7, 8.9, 11.1, and 13.3. The square root of each number is 2.1, 2.6, 3.1, 3.3, and 3.6, respectively. Among the given choices, the only perfect square is 8.9, which corresponds to choice C, 41. Therefore, the answer is C."
