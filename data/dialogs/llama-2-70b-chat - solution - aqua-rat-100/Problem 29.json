How many days will it take for the frog to come out of the well?\nChoices:\n  A: 25 days\n  B: 26 days\n  C: 27 days\n  D: 28 days\n  E: 29 days\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\nThe frog jumps 3m up and falls back 2m down, so his total movement upward in one day is 3 + 2 = 5m.\nSince the frog is at the bottom of the well (30m), it will take 30 / 5 = 6 days to come out of the well.\n"
