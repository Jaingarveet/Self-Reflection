The athlete runs M miles in 4 hours, so their running speed is M/4 miles per hour.\n2. The athlete then rides a bike N miles in the same number of hours, so their cycling speed is N/4 miles per hour.\n3. To find the average speed for both activities combined, we need to add the running and cycling speeds and divide by 2.\n\nThe correct formula is (M + N) / 8, which is choice [REDACTED].\n"
