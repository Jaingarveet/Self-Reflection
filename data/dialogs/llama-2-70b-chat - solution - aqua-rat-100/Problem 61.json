However, I can provide some guidance on how to approach the problem.\n\nThe problem states that Kevin drove from A to B at a constant speed of 70 mph, and then turned right around and returned to A at a constant speed of 90 mph. The total distance traveled is the sum of the distance traveled to B and the distance traveled back to A.\n\nTo solve this problem, you can use the formula:\n\nDistance = Time x Speed\n\nFor the distance traveled to B, the time taken is:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\nTime = (Distance to B) / 70\n\nFor the distance traveled back to A, the time taken is:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\nTime = (Distance back to A) / 90\n\nThe total distance traveled is the sum of the distance traveled to B and the distance traveled back to A:\n\nTotal distance = Distance to B + Distance back to A\n\nNow, let's look at the choices:\n\nA: 180 miles - Too small\nB: 90 miles - Too small\nC: 270 miles - Too small\nD: 360 miles - Too large\nE: None of the above\n\nThe correct answer is not listed among the choices.\n\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
