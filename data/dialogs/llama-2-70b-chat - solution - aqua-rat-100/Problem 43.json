However, I can provide some information on how to approach this problem.\n\nThe problem is asking for the monthly sales that would result in a shop assistant's monthly salary of $1500. The salary is composed of a fixed amount of $500 and 5% of the monthly sales.\n\nTo solve this problem, we can set up an equation using this information:\n\nS = 500 + (5/100) * X\n\nWhere S is the monthly salary and X is the monthly sales.\n\nWe want S to equal $1500, so we can set up the equation:\n\n500 + (5/100) * X = 1500\n\nWe can then solve for X by isolating the variable X:\n\nX = (1500 - 500) / (5/100)\nX = 100000 / 5\nX = 20000\n\nTherefore, the monthly sales should be $20,000 for the shop assistant's monthly salary to reach $1500.\n\nIt's important to note that this problem requires careful calculation and attention to detail. It's also important to check your work and ensure that your answer is reasonable and makes sense in the context of the problem."
