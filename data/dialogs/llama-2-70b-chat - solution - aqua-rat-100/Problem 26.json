What will be the measure of each side?\nChoices:\n  A: 9\n  B: 11\n  C: 22\n  D: 25\n  E: 31\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\nLet's first calculate the length of the wire in the shape of a rectangle:\nLength = 27 cm\nBreadth = 17 cm\n\nThe wire is bent to form a square. Let's call the length of each side of the square \"s\".\n\nWe know that the perimeter of the square is equal to the length of the wire.\nPerimeter of the square = s + s + s + s\n= 4s\n\nWe also know that the perimeter of the rectangle is equal to the length plus the breadth.\nPerimeter of the rectangle = Length + Breadth\n= 27 + 17\n= 44\n\nSince the wire is bent to form a square, the perimeter of the square must be equal to the perimeter of the rectangle.\n4s = 44\n\nNow, we can solve for \"s\":\ns = [REDACTED]\n\nSo, the length of each side of the square is [REDACTED] cm.\n"

I forgot to simplify the equation 4s = 44 before solving for \"s\". I learned that it's important to double-check my work and make sure that I have simplified my equations properly before solving for the answer. This time, I took my time to simplify the equation and got the correct answer."
