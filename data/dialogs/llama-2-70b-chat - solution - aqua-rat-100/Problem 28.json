What is the greatest value for the probability that neither of these two events will occur?\nChoices:\n  A: 0.22\n  B: 0.26\n  C: 0.37\n  D: 0.46\n  E: 0.63\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\nThe correct solution is as follows:\nThe probability that neither of the two events will occur is equal to 1 minus the probability that at least one of the events will occur.\nLet's first calculate the probability that at least one of the events will occur:\nP(at least one) = P([REDACTED] or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P([REDACTED] and B)\n= 0.56 + 0.74 - (0.56 x 0.74)\n= 0.56 + 0.74 - 0.41\n= 0.89\n\nNow, we can calculate the probability that neither of these two events will occur:\nP(neither) = 1 - 0.89 = 0.11\n\nSince the choices are not exhaustive, the greatest value for the probability that neither of these two events will occur is 0.11, which is not among the given choices.\n"
