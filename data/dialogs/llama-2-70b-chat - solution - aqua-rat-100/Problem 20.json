How many members does the group have now, if the ratio of boys to girls is 4:3?\nChoices:\n  A: 277\n  B: 288\n  C: 200\n  D: 277\n  E: 168\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\nLet's re-read the question carefully. The question states that the same number of boys and girls joined the group during the membership drive. This means that the number of boys who joined the group is equal to the number of girls who joined the group.\n\nLet's assume that the number of boys who joined the group is x and the number of girls who joined the group is also x.\n\nWe know that the total number of boys in the group is 64 + x, and the total number of girls in the group is 40 + x.\n\nSince the ratio of boys to girls is 4:3, we can set up the equation:\n(64 + x) / (40 + x) = 4/3\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\nx = 120\n\nNow, we can find the value of x:\nx = 120/4\nx = 30\n\nSo, the number of boys who joined the group is 30, and the number of girls who joined the group is also 30.\n\nNow, we can find the total number of members in the group:\nTotal members = 64 + 30 + 40 + 30 = [REDACTED]\n\nThe correct answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED].\n"
