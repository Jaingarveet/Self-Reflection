If his answer differed from the actual one by 770, find the that number.\nChoices:\n  A: 1584\n  B: 2520\n  C: 1728\n  D: 1656\n  E: None\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\nLet's X be the original number.\nThen, we have:\n7/8 * X = 7/18 * X + 770 ... (1)\n\nMultiplying both sides of equation (1) by 8, we get:\n7X = 7/9 * X + 6160 ... (2)\n\nSubtracting 7/9 * X from both sides of equation (2), we get:\n6X = 6160\n\nDividing both sides of equation (3) by 6, we get:\nX = 1027\n\nTherefore, the number is 1027.\n"
