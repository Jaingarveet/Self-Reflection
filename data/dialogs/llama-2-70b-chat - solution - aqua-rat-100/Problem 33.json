If these semi circles are cut down what is the area of the remaining paper?\nChoices:\n  A: 8.75\n  B: 8.79\n  C: 8.75\n  D: 8.71\n  E: 8.72\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\nLet's break this down step by step:\n\n1. The paper is a square with side length 20 cm.\n2. Two semi-circles are drawn on opposite sides of the square as diameters.\n3. The radius of each semi-circle is half the side length of the square, which is 10 cm.\n4. The area of each semi-circle is (1/2)πr^2, where r is the radius.\n5. The total area of the two semi-circles is 2(1/2)π(10cm)^2 = 20π cm^2.\n6. The area of the remaining paper is the area of the original square minus the total area of the two semi-circles.\n7. The area of the original square is 20^2 = 400 cm^2.\n8. Therefore, the area of the remaining paper is 400 - 20π = [REDACTED] cm^2.\n"
