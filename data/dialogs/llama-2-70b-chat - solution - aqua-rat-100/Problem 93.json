The correct answer is indeed C: 5.\n\nThe calculation for the numerator is as follows:\n[REDACTED] + ? × 19 - 1[REDACTED] - 7 = [REDACTED] + 19 × ? - 22\n\nWe can see that 19 × ? = 19 × [REDACTED] = 9[REDACTED]\n\nSo, the numerator is [REDACTED] + 9[REDACTED] - 22 = 78\n\nThe calculation for the denominator is:\n13 × 13 - 1[REDACTED]6 = 169 - 1[REDACTED]6 = 13\n\nNow, we can simplify the fraction:\n78/13 = 6\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: 5."
