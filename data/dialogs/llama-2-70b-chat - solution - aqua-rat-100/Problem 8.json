The total fare paid by 6 persons travelling by bus and 8 persons travelling by train between the two places is Rs.1512. Find the train fare between the two places for one person?\nChoices:\n  A: 126\n  B: 77\n  C: 88\n  D: 66\n  E: 54\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\nLet's break this down step by step:\n\n1. The bus fare for two persons is four-thirds the train fare for one person, so we can write an equation:\n\nBus fare = (4/3) * Train fare\n\n2. The total fare paid by 6 persons travelling by bus is 6 * Bus fare = 6 * (4/3) * Train fare = 8 * Train fare.\n\n3. The total fare paid by 8 persons travelling by train is 8 * Train fare.\n\n4. The total fare paid by both groups is Rs.1512, so we can set up the equation:\n\n8 * Train fare + 8 * Train fare = 1512\n\n5. Simplifying the equation, we get:\n\n16 * Train fare = 1512\n\n6. Dividing both sides by 16, we get:\n\nTrain fare = 94\n\nTherefore, the train fare for one person between Agra and Aligarh is Rs.94.\n\nAction: Answer(\"[REDACTED]\")\n\n---\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n"
