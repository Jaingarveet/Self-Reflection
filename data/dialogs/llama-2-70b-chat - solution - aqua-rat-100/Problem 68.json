Determine the prime factorization of 350: 350 = 2 x 3 x 5 x 7\n2. Determine the prime factorization of 7700: 7700 = 2 x 2 x 5 x 5 x 7\n3. Identify the common prime factors between 350 and 7700: 2, 5, and 7\n4. Determine the GCF of 350 and 7700: GCF = 2 x 5 x 7 = 11\n5. Determine the LCM of 350 and 7700: LCM = 2 x 2 x 5 x 5 x 7 = 7700\n6. Find the other integer by factoring 7700: 7700 = 2 x 3 x 3 x 5 x 7\n\nThe other integer is 2 x 3 x 3 x 5 x 7 = [REDACTED].\n"
