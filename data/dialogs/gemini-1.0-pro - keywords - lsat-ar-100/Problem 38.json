I assumed that because G was placed on the top shelf, there would only be one book left for the middle shelf. However, I overlooked the possibility that two books could be placed on the middle shelf.\nTo avoid making the same mistake again, I will carefully consider all of the information provided in the question and make sure that I am not overlooking any possibilities.\nHere is my step-by-step solution to the question:\n1. G is placed on the top shelf.\n2. More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. This means that at least three books must be placed on the bottom shelf.\n3. I is placed on the middle shelf.\n4. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. This means that K must be placed on either the middle shelf or the top shelf.\n5. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. This means that O must be placed on either the middle shelf or the top shelf.\n6. F is placed on the same shelf as M.\nBased on this information, the following possibilities exist for the books placed on the middle shelf:\n* H, I\n* I, L\n* H, I, L\n* I, K, L\n* F, I, M\nTherefore, the answer to the question is **D: I, K, L**."
