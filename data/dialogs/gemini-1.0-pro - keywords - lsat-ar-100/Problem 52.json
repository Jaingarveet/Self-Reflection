        "content": "## Self-Reflection\n**Error:** I initially answered this question incorrectly, selecting \"C: Exactly one witness is scheduled to testify on Monday.\"\n**Reasoning:** My initial reasoning was flawed. I focused on the fact that at least one witness must testify on Monday and that Hong cannot testify on Monday. However, I overlooked the additional constraint that exactly two witnesses must testify on Tuesday. This constraint, combined with the fact that Iturbe and Jackson are scheduled for Wednesday, leaves only Monday and Tuesday for Franco and Garcia. Since they cannot testify on the same day, this necessitates that one of them must testify on Monday, contradicting my initial answer.\n**Corrected Approach:**\n1. **Identify the fixed schedule:**\n    - Iturbe: Wednesday\n    - Jackson: Wednesday\n2. **Apply the remaining constraints:**\n    - Exactly two witnesses on Tuesday: This leaves Monday and Tuesday for Franco and Garcia.\n    - Franco and Garcia cannot testify on the same day: Therefore, one of them must be on Monday.\n3. **Evaluate the answer choices:**\n    - A: Franco on Monday: This satisfies the constraints.\n    - B: Garcia on Monday: This also satisfies the constraints.\n    - C: Exactly one witness on Monday: This is not guaranteed, as both Franco and Garcia could be on Monday.\n    - D: Exactly two witnesses on Monday: This is not possible, as only one of Franco or Garcia can be on Monday.\n    - E: Garcia and Hong on the same day: This is not guaranteed, as Garcia could be on Monday and Hong on Tuesday.\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the corrected approach and evaluation of the answer choices, the only option that must be true is:\n**Action: Answer(\"A\")** \nFranco is scheduled to testify on Monday. \n"
