I incorrectly assumed that there were two sales representatives in Zone 2, which led me to choose an answer that included two sales representatives from Zone 2.\nTo avoid making the same mistake again, I will pay close attention to the conditions regarding the number of sales representatives in each zone. I will also double-check my work to ensure that my answer is consistent with all of the given conditions.\nThought:\nWe know that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.\nWe also know that Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other, and Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.\nSince there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, and Parra and Quinn work in the same zone, they cannot both be in Zone 3.\nSimilarly, since Stuckey and Udall work in the same zone, they cannot both be in Zone 3.\nTherefore, the only possible list of sales representatives working in Zone 3 is Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
