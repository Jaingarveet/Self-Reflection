I can do this by solving for $k$ in the equation:\n\n$$4k - 15y = 0$$\n\nSolving for $k$, I get:\n\n$$k = \\frac{15y}{4}$$\n\nNow, I need to find the value of $y$ that makes the equation true.

Therefore, the system of equations has no solution when $k = \\frac{15}{4}$.\n\nAction: I will select the answer \"D: $-\\frac{15}{4}$\" as the correct answer."
