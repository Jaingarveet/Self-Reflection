I need to re-evaluate the problem using the correct conversion factors.\n\nAction:\nLet's start by converting 1 decagram to grams. According to the given equation, 1 decagram = 10 grams.\n\nNow, let's convert 1,000 milligrams to grams. Using the same equation, we can see that 1,000 milligrams = 1 gram.\n\nSo, if we have 2 decagrams of medicine, that means we have 20 grams of medicine (2 x 10 grams).\n\nNow, we need to convert 20 grams to milligrams. Using the conversion factor of 1 gram = 1,000 milligrams, we can see that 20 grams = 20,000 milligrams (20 x 1,000 milligrams).\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) 20,000 milligrams.\n\nReflection:\nI reflected on my previous mistake and realized that I misunderstood the conversion factors. I made sure to use the correct conversion factors to arrive at the correct answer. I will make sure to be more careful in the future when solving similar problems."
