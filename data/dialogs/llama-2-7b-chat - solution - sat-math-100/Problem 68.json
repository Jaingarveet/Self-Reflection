The equation can be simplified by multiplying both sides by $x + y$, which gives us:\n\n$$0.10x + 0.20y = 0.18(x + y)$$\n\nNow, we are asked to find the value of $x$ that satisfies the equation when $y = 100$. We can solve for $x$ by subtracting $0.20y$ from both sides, which gives us:\n\n$$0.10x = 0.18(x + 100)$$\n\nNow, we can divide both sides by $0.10$ to find the value of $x$:\n\n$$x = \\frac{0.18(x + 100)}{0.10}$$\n\nNow, we are given that Clayton uses 100 milliliters of the $20 \\%$ by mass saline solution. We can substitute this value into the equation we just derived to find the value of $x$:\n\n$$x = \\frac{0.18(x + 100)}{0.10} = \\frac{0.18(x + 100)}{0.10} = \\frac{0.18(100 + x)}{0.10}$$\n\nNow, we can simplify the equation by multiplying both sides by $0.10$ to find the value of $x$:\n\n$$x = \\frac{0.18(100 + x)}{0.10} = 18 + \\frac{x}{0.10}$$\n\nNow, we are asked to find the value of $x$ that satisfies the equation. We can solve for $x$ by subtracting $18$ from both sides, which gives us:\n\n$$\\frac{x}{0.10} = \\frac{x - 18}{0.10}$$\n\nNow, we can simplify the equation by multiplying both sides by $0.10$ to find the value of $x$:\n\n$$x = \\frac{x - 18}{0.10} = \\frac{x}{0.10}$$\n\nTherefore, the value of $x$ that satisfies the equation is $x = 5$.\n\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
