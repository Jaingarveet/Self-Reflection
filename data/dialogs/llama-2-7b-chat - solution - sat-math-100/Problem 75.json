I misunderstood the information provided in the problem. The quantity of the product supplied and demanded are related, but they are not the same thing. The supply function tells us the quantity of the product that suppliers are willing to sell at different prices, while the demand function tells us the quantity of the product that buyers are willing to buy at different prices. To find the price at which the quantity of the product supplied equals the quantity of the product demanded, we need to find the intersection point of the supply and demand functions.\n\nAction: I will recalculate the supply and demand functions using the given information.\n\n$S(P) = \\frac{1}{2}P + 40$\n$D(P) = 220 - P$\n\nTo find the intersection point of the supply and demand functions, I will solve the system of equations:\n\n$S(P) = D(P)$\n\nSubstituting the supply function:\n\n$\\frac{1}{2}P + 40 = 220 - P$\n\nSolving for $P$:\n\n$P = 100$\n\nTherefore, the price at which the quantity of the product supplied equals the quantity of the product demanded is $P = 100$.\n\nAction: I will select choice (C) as the correct answer.\n\nAnswer(\"C\")"
