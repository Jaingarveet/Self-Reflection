However, the problem states that the populations of City X and City Y were equal in 2015, which means that the population of City Y in 2010 must have been different from the population of City X in 2010.\n\nAction: I will use the information provided in the problem to calculate the population of City Y in 2010.\n\nThought: The population of City X in 2010 was 120,000, and the population of City X in 2015 was also 120,000. This means that the population of City X increased by 20% from 2010 to 2015. To find the population of City Y in 2010, I need to subtract the percentage decrease in the population of City Y from the population of City X in 2010.\n\nAction: I will subtract 10% from 120,000 to find the population of City Y in 2010.\n\nThought: The population of City Y in 2010 was 108,000 (120,000 - 10% = 108,000).\n\nAction: I will select option B, 90,000, as the correct answer.\n\nReflection: I made a mistake in my previous answer by assuming that the population of City Y in 2015 was equal to the population of City X. I corrected my mistake by using the information provided in the problem to calculate the population of City Y in 2010."
