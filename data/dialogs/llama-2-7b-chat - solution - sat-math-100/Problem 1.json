To find $v$, we need to isolate the variable $v$ on one side of the equation.\n\nI previously tried to solve for $v$ by adding $k$ to both sides of the equation, which resulted in $v=h+k-16 t$. However, this is incorrect.\n\nUpon further reflection, I realized that the correct solution is $v=\\frac{h-k+16}{t}$. This can be derived by dividing both sides of the equation by $t$, which results in $v=\\frac{h-k}{t}+16 t$.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) $v=\\frac{h-k}{t}+16 t$.\n\nAction: I will answer the question using the correct solution.\n\nAnswer: (B) $v=\\frac{h-k}{t}+16 t$."
