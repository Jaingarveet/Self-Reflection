Since the vertex of the parabola is at $(c, d)$, we can set $y = 0$ and solve for $x$.\n"

Since the vertex of the parabola is at $(c, d)$, we can set $y = 0$ and solve for $x$.\n\nSubstituting $y = 0$ into the equation, we get:\n\n$x = \\frac{d}{a}$\n\nSince the vertex of the parabola is at $(c, d)$, we can set $c = 0$. Therefore, the equation becomes:\n\n$x = \\frac{d}{a}$\n\nSolving for $x$, we get:\n\n$x = -\\frac{d}{a}$\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) $-2 a$.\n\nReflection:\nI am glad that I was able to reflect on my previous mistake and correct it.
