I also misunderstood the question and thought it was asking for the increase in height per year, rather than the increase in height per year in terms of the boy's age.\n\nAction: I will re-solve the problem using the correct approach.\n\n$$h = 3a + 28.6$$\n\nTo find the increase in height per year, we need to find the derivative of $h$ with respect to $a$.\n\n$$\\frac{d}{da} h = \\frac{d}{da} (3a + 28.6)$$\n\n$$= 3 + 28.6$$\n\nSo, the increase in height per year is $3 + 28.6 = 31.6$ inches.\n\nAnswer: B: $5.7$ inches."
