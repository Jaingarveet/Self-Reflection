To find when the ball will hit the ground, we need to set the height equal to zero, which gives us $h=0$.\n\nSolving for $t$, we get:\n\n$$t = \\frac{-h}{-4.9} = \\frac{25}{-4.9} = 5.0$$\n\nSo, the ball will hit the ground after approximately 5 seconds.\n\nAction: I will select the correct answer, which is (D) 5.0 seconds.\n\nAnswer: D) 5.0 seconds"
