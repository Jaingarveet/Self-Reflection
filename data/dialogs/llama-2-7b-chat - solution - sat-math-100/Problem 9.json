The total number of people who recalled at least one dream is 200.\n\nNow, let's calculate the probability of a person belonging to Group Y:\n\nProbability of a person belonging to Group Y = Number of people in Group Y who recalled at least one dream / Total number of people who recalled at least one dream\n= 39 / 200\n= $\\frac{79}{100}$\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
