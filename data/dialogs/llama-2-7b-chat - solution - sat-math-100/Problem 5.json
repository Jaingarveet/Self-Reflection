I need to use the correct equation to solve for the number of states that joined between 1850 and 1900.\n\nAction:\nI will use the equation $2x = 30$, where $x$ is the number of states that joined between 1850 and 1900.\n\nSolution:\nThe correct answer is (B) $2 x = 30$.\n\nExplanation:\nThe number of states that joined the United States between 1776 and 1849 is 30, and the number of states that joined between 1850 and 1900 is $x$. Since the number of states that joined between 1776 and 1849 is twice the number of states that joined between 1850 and 1900, we can set up the equation $2x = 30$. Solving for $x$, we get $x = 15$. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) $2 x = 30$."
