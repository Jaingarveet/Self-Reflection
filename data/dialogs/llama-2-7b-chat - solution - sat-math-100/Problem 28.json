Start with the given equation: $\\frac{x^{2}-[REDACTED]}{x-[REDACTED]} = -2$\n2. Simplify the right-hand side of the equation by multiplying both sides by $x-[REDACTED]$, which gives us $x^{2} - 2 = [REDACTED]$\n3.

The equation given is $\\frac{x^{2}-1}{x-1} = -2$. To solve for $x$, I started by simplifying the right-hand side of the equation by multiplying both sides by $x-1$, which gave me $x^{2} - 2 = -2$. Then, I factored the left-hand side of the equation as $x^{2} - 2 = (x + 1)(x - 2) = -2$. Finally, I solved for $x$ by setting each factor equal to -2 and solving for $x$. The solutions are $x = -3$ and $x = -1$. I checked the solutions to ensure they satisfy the original equation, and they do. Therefore, the correct answer is $x = -3$ and $x = -1$."
