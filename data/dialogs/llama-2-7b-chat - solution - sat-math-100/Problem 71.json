I realized that the percentage of respondents who answered \"Always\" is 30.9%, not 31.3% as I previously calculated. To calculate the probability that a tablet user answered \"Always,\" given that they did not answer \"Never,\" I need to use the formula:\n\nProbability = (Number of successes / Total number of trials)\n\nIn this case, the number of successes is 30.9% (the percentage of respondents who answered \"Always\"), and the total number of trials is 100% (the total number of respondents in the survey).\n\nTherefore, the closest answer to the probability that a tablet user answered \"Always,\" given that they did not answer \"Never,\" is B: 0.38.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
