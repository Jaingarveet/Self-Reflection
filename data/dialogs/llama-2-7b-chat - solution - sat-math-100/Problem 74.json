To solve this, I will use the fact that $\\frac{1}{x+2}$ and $\\frac{1}{x+3}$ are both equivalent to $\\frac{1}{x}$ when $x$ is greater than 3.\n\nSo, the equivalent of $\\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{x+2}+\\frac{1}{x+3}}$ is:\n\n$$\\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{x}} + \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{x}} = \\frac{2}{x}$$\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B): $\\frac{x^{2}+5 x+6}{2 x+5}$.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
