Stout beardfish would not benefit from a brightly colored body or the ability to swim quickly as there is no light to see these features. A mouth full of bristles might help with feeding, but it would not help locate food in the first place. Therefore, two whiskers that locate food would be the most beneficial characteristic.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
