However, it's important to note that these traits are also influenced by environmental factors. For example, height can be influenced by nutrition, hair color can be changed artificially, skin color can be influenced by sun exposure, and intelligence can be influenced by education and environment. Therefore, none of these traits are solely inherited. But the question asks for the trait that is not an inherited trait, which implies that it is not influenced by genetics at all. All of the options listed are influenced by genetics to some degree, so none of them can be the correct answer.\nAction: This question is flawed as all the options can be inherited traits."
