Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

I thought the argument was based on the increase in posts about certain social issues, and that the question was asking for a factor that could explain the increase in posts without necessarily indicating a deterioration in the social atmosphere. However, the argument was actually based on the comparison of posts about social issues published by netizens in the past year and 5 years ago, and the question was asking for a factor that would weaken the argument that the social atmosphere is rapidly deteriorating.\n\nError Keywords:\n - Misunderstood the argument\n - Misunderstood the question\n - Misinterpreted the evidence\n - Misidentified the conclusion\n\nSolution:\nThe argument is based on the comparison of posts about social issues published by netizens in the past year and 5 years ago, and concludes that the social atmosphere is rapidly deteriorating. However, the argument assumes that the increase in posts about certain social issues is a reliable indicator of the social atmosphere.\n\nChoice D states that the online forum is a legal forum. This means that the forum may have rules and regulations that prohibit certain types of posts, such as posts related to evildoing, escaping evil, and killing more people. If the forum has become more strict in enforcing these rules in the past year, it could explain the increase in posts about certain social issues without necessarily indicating a deterioration in the social atmosphere.\n\nInstructions:\n1. Read the argument carefully and identify the conclusion.\n2. Identify the evidence presented in the argument.\n3. Identify any assumptions made in the argument.\n4. Read the question carefully and understand what it is asking for.\n5. Evaluate each answer choice and consider how it would weaken the argument.\n6. Choose the answer that most effectively weakens the argument.\n\nAdvice:\n - Always read the argument and question carefully and understand what they are asking for.\n - Always identify the conclusion, evidence, and assumptions in the argument.\n - Always evaluate each answer choice and consider how it would weaken the argument.\n - Never assume that the argument is based on the same evidence or conclusion as the question.\n - Always consider alternative explanations for the evidence presented in the argument."
