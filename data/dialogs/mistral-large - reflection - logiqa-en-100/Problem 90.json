Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

To maintain economic development, the competitiveness of domestic enterprises must be strengthened, but paying social insurance premiums for employees reduces the competitiveness of enterprises. Therefore, reducing the proportion of social insurance premiums paid by companies could maintain the competitiveness of the company, but it may also affect social stability.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: C"
