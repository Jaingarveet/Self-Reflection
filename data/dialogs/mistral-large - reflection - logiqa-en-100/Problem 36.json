Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

Most people think that advertisers do whatever they can to attract customers.But advertisers are not always like this.Recently, in order to expand sales, a family magazine called \"Bay\" was renamed \"Inferno\", which mainly published violent and pornographic content.As a result, some perennial advertisers from the original \"Bay\" magazine refused to renew the contract and turned to other publications.This shows that these advertisers not only consider economic benefits, but also take into account their ethical responsibilities.\nQuestion: If the following items are true, they can weaken the above argument, except\nChoices:\n  A: The violent and pornographic content published in Purgatory magazine is more moderate in similar magazines.\n  B: Magazines that publish violent and pornographic content usually sell well, but have low credibility.\n  C: The above-mentioned advertisers who refused to renew their contracts mainly promoted household goods.\n  D: The advertising cost of the purgatory magazine after the name change is several times higher than before the name change.\n\nThought:\nThe argument is that advertisers consider ethical responsibilities, not just economic benefits.\nWe need to find the option that does not weaken this argument.\nOption A weakens the argument by suggesting that the content in \"Inferno\" is not as bad as in other magazines.\nOption B weakens the argument by suggesting that magazines with violent and pornographic content have low credibility, implying that advertisers might avoid them for reasons other than ethics.\nOption C does not weaken the argument, as the type of goods advertised does not necessarily relate to the advertisers' ethical considerations.\nOption D weakens the argument by suggesting that the advertisers might have left due to increased costs, not ethical concerns.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: A"
