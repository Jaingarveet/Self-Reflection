Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

The correct answer choice should help explain this contradiction.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because it does not explain why some people have not been poisoned after eating the fish.\nChoice C is incorrect because it introduces a new contradiction that is not relevant to the original statement.\nChoice D is incorrect because it does not explain why some people have not been poisoned after eating the fish.\nChoice B is the correct answer because it explains that the toxic chemicals are concentrated in the parts of the fish that seals eat but people do not.\n\nInstructions:\n1. Read the question carefully and identify the contradiction presented in the statement.\n2. Evaluate each answer choice to determine which one best explains the contradiction.\n3. Eliminate answer choices that do not explain the contradiction or introduce new contradictions.\n4. Choose the answer that best explains the contradiction.\n5. State your answer in the correct format: \"Action: Answer([ANSWER\\_CHOICE])\".\n\nAdvice:\n- Always read the question carefully and identify the problem.\n- Evaluate each answer choice based on its relevance to the problem.\n- Eliminate answer choices that are clearly incorrect.\n- Choose the answer that best solves the problem.\n- Always state your answer in the correct format."
