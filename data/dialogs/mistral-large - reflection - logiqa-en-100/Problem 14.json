Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

The human resources department and the sales department are not adjacent.\n2. The finance department is on the next floor of the planning department.\n3. The administration department is above the planning department but below the human resources department.\n4. The human resources department is not at the upper level of the administration department.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n1. Since the human resources department is not at the upper level of the administration department, the human resources department must be above the administration department.\n2. The sales department cannot be adjacent to the human resources department, so it cannot be on the floor immediately above or below the human resources department.\n3. The only option that satisfies these conditions is choice B: The sales department is one level above the administration department.\n\nInstructions:\n1. Carefully read and interpret the given information.\n2. Identify the relationships between the different departments based on the given information.\n3. Eliminate any answer choices that contradict the given information.\n4. Use logical reasoning to determine which answer choice is possible based on the given information.\n5. Double-check your reasoning to ensure accuracy.\n\nAdvice:\n- Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n- Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n- Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n- Never make assumptions that are not supported by the given information.\n- Always double-check your reasoning and final answer.\n- Remember to use logical reasoning to eliminate impossible answer choices and identify the correct one."
