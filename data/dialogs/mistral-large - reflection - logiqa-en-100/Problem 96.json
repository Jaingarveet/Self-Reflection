Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

Most people think that advertisers do whatever they can to attract customers.But advertisers are not always like this.Recently, in order to expand sales, a family magazine called \"Bay\" was renamed \"Inferno\", which mainly published violent and pornographic content.As a result, some perennial advertisers from the original \"Bay\" magazine refused to renew the contract and turned to other publications.This shows that these advertisers not only consider economic benefits, but also take into account their ethical responsibilities.\nQuestion: If the following item is true, can the argument be strengthened most?\nChoices:\n  A: The cost and selling price of \"Inferno\" are lower than that of \"Harbour\".\n  B: The above advertisers who refused to renew their contracts have not affected the benefits after switching to other publications.\n  C: Readers of family magazines are generally not interested in violent and pornographic content.\n  D: Some clients who advertise in other family magazines and so on turn to \"Inferno\" magazine.\n\nThought:\nThe argument is that advertisers consider ethical responsibilities, not just economic benefits.\nThe item that strengthens this argument would show that the advertisers' decision to leave \"Inferno\" was based on ethical concerns, not economic ones.\nChoice C suggests that the advertisers left because the content of \"Inferno\" was not of interest to their target audience, which supports the argument that they were considering ethical responsibilities.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: D"
