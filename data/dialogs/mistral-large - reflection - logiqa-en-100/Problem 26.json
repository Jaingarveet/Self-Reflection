Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "Topic: Logic\nContext: The late famous logician Jin Yuelin of China heard the words \"Money is like dung\" and \"Friends are worth a thousand dollars\" when he was a child, and found that there are logical problems because they can lead to the absurd conclusion of \"friends are like dung\".\nQuestion: Since the conclusion of \"friends like dung\" is not true, it can be logically derived?\nChoices:\n  A: The expression \"money is like dung\" is false.\n  B: If a friend is indeed worth a lot of money, then money is not like dung.\n  C: The statement that \"friends are valuable\" is true.\n  D: The words \"Money is like dung\" and \"Friends are worth a thousand dollars\" are either true or false.\n\nThought:\nThe conclusion \"friends are like dung\" is derived from the two statements \"money is like dung\" and \"friends are worth a thousand dollars\" by substituting the value of money with dung. However, this substitution is not logically valid because the two statements are not equivalent.\n\nThe first statement \"money is like dung\" is a metaphorical comparison, while the second statement \"friends are worth a thousand dollars\" is a literal valuation. The two statements are not logically related, and therefore, the conclusion \"friends are like dung\" is not logically derived.\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\")\n\nExplanation:\nThe words \"Money is like dung\" and \"Friends are worth a thousand dollars\" are either true or false, but they cannot be logically combined to derive the conclusion \"friends are like dung\". Therefore, the answer is \"D\".\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: B"
