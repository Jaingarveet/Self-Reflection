Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "Topic: Logic\nContext: According to a report, in the year to March, mainland Chinese buyers became the second largest group of foreign buyers buying US real estate, with a transaction volume of US $ 9 billion, second only to Canada.This is 23% higher than the previous year ’s USD 7.3 billion transaction volume and 88% higher than the previous year ’s USD 4.8 billion transaction volume.Some people think that there are more and more rich people in China who are transferring their property abroad.\nQuestion: Which of the following is true is the best argument against the above argument\nChoices:\n  ?: Although the turnover has increased by 23%, the volume of Chinese buyers has not increased this year\n  C: There are groups of real estate speculators among the wealthy Chinese who have speculated in Beijing and Shanghai\n  D: The risk of the US real estate market has been small in recent years and has a certain function of value preservation and appreciation\n\nThought:\nThe argument is that more and more rich people in China are transferring their property abroad, as evidenced by the increase in transaction volume of US real estate bought by mainland Chinese buyers.\nChoice A argues that the volume of Chinese buyers has not increased this year, despite the increase in transaction volume. This suggests that the increase in transaction volume may not be due to more buyers, but rather to existing buyers purchasing more or more expensive properties.\nChoice C is not relevant to the argument, as it discusses real estate speculation within China, not abroad.\nChoice D discusses the low risk of the US real estate market, which could be a reason for Chinese buyers to invest in US real estate, but it does not necessarily contradict the argument that more Chinese buyers are investing abroad.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: B"
