        "content": "Topic: Logic\nContext: The Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge, built in 1968, has a clear height of 24 meters in the Fengshui area.Theoretically, it can pass a maximum of 3,000 tons of ships.Today, with the rapid economic development, it has become a building that “cuts the waist” of the Yangtze River waterway and hinders the passage of giant ships.A bridge expert asserted that the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge must be demolished and rebuilt in order to dredge the golden waterways of the Yangtze River completely.\nQuestion: If any of the following is true, can you raise the most doubts about this expert's point of view?\nChoices:\n  A: Due to the inability of large ships to pass through the Nanjing Bridge, a large number of exported goods in the middle and upper reaches of the Yangtze River can only be taken by road or railway.\n  B: 99% of international ships entering the Yangtze River are moored at ports below the Nanjing Bridge, and dozens of foreign trade terminals above Nanjing rarely have large external ships berthed.\n  C: It is not enough to dismantle only the Nanjing Bridge.The Yangtze River Bridge, which was built in Wuhu, Tongling, Anqing and other places, has a clear height of 24 meters.\n  D: Shipbuilding technology is highly developed, and 8000-ton ships designed for adapting to the passage of the Yangtze River abroad have passed through Nanjing to Wuhan.\n\nThought:\nThe expert's point of view is that the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge must be demolished and rebuilt to allow larger ships to pass through.\nChoice A supports the expert's point of view, as it shows that the inability of large ships to pass through the bridge is causing transportation issues.\nChoice B raises doubts about the expert's point of view, as it suggests that most international ships are moored at ports below the bridge and rarely have large external ships berthed above Nanjing.\nChoice C raises doubts about the expert's point of view, as it suggests that dismantling only the Nanjing Bridge would not be enough to allow larger ships to pass through, as there are other bridges with the same clear height.\nChoice D raises doubts about the expert's point of view, as it shows that shipbuilding technology has advanced to the point where 8000-ton ships can pass through the bridge.\nAction: Answer(\"B\") or Answer(\"C\") or Answer(\"D\")\n\nFinal answer: Answer(\"B\") or Answer(\"C\") or Answer(\"D\")\n\nExplanation:\nAll three choices raise doubts about the expert's point of view, but choice B is the most convincing argument against demolishing the bridge. It suggests that most international ships are moored at ports below the bridge, and there is little need for larger ships to pass through. Choice C raises doubts about the effectiveness of demolishing only the Nanjing Bridge, but it does not necessarily argue against the need to allow larger ships to pass through. Choice D shows that shipbuilding technology has advanced to the point where larger ships can pass through the bridge, but it does not necessarily argue against the need to allow even larger ships to pass through. Therefore, any of the three choices could be used to raise doubts about the expert's point of view, but choice B is the most convincing argument against demolishing the bridge.\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: D"
