Calculate the speed of the space shuttle.\n2. Recognize that the distance traveled in 5 seconds includes the shuttle's length and the additional distance.\n3. Set up an equation to represent the relationship between the total distance, the shuttle's length, and the additional distance.\n4. Solve the equation to find the shuttle's length.\n5. Calculate the distance traveled in 5 seconds due to the shuttle's length.\n6. Divide this distance by the time to find the length of the space shuttle.\n7. Choose the answer closest to the calculated length.\n"

This distance includes the shuttle's length (L) and the additional distance it travels in 5 seconds.\n4.  Shuttle's length = Total distance - Additional distance \n5.
