Understand the concept of an angle bisector in the context of circles and arcs. Remember that it bisects the angle, not necessarily the arc length.\n2. Recall the relationship between inscribed angles and the arcs they intercept: the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.\n3. Break down the problem into smaller parts: find the measures of individual arcs (A[REDACTED], B[REDACTED], CD) based on the given information and relationships.\n4. Combine the measures of relevant arcs to find the measure of the desired arc (AD).\n"

So, arc AB = arc BC = 160°/2 = 80°.\nAngle ABD is an inscribed angle intercepting arc AD. \nAngle ABD is also a central angle for arc BD, so angle ABD = 150°.\nTherefore, arc AD = 2 * angle ABD = 2 * 150° = 300°. \nHowever, this is the major arc AD. \nSo, the minor arc AD = 360° - 300° = 60°.\nAction: Answer(\"None of the Above\") \n"
