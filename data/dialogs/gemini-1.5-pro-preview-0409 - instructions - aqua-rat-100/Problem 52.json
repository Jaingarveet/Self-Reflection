I mistakenly used the ratio as the direct quantity of each metal, rather than calculating the proportion of each metal based on the given weights of the alloys.\n**Corrected Approach:**\n1. **Calculate the amount of zinc and copper in alloy X:**\n    - Zinc in X: (6/15) * 40g = 16g\n    - Copper in X: (9/15) * 40g = 24g\n2. **Calculate the amount of zinc and copper in alloy Y:**\n    - Zinc in Y: (7/18) * 60g = 23.33g\n    - Copper in Y: (11/18) * 60g = 36.67g\n3. **Calculate the total amount of zinc and copper in alloy Z:**\n    - Total Zinc: 16g + 23.33g = 39.33g\n    - Total Copper: 24g + 36.67g = 60.67g\n4. **Find the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z:**\n    - Zinc : Copper = 39.33g : 60.67g\n    - Simplify the ratio by dividing both sides by the greatest common divisor (which appears to be close to 1):\n    - Zinc : Copper â‰ˆ 39 : 61\n**Answer Selection:**\nBased on the corrected calculations, the closest ratio among the choices is 39:61. However, none of the provided options exactly match this ratio. \nTherefore, I would need to analyze the options further or request clarification on the available choices. \n"
