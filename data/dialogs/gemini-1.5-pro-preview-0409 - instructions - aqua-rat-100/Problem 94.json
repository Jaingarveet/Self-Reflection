Order matters as different arrangements of letters and numbers will create different bike numbers (e.g., AB12 is different from BA21). So, we need to use permutations.\n3. We need to choose 2 distinct letters from 26, which can be done in 26P2 ways (permutation of 26 objects taken 2 at a time).\n4. We also need to choose 2 distinct numbers from 10, which can be done in 10P2 ways.\n5. The total number of distinct bike numbers is the product of these two: 26P2 * 10P2.\n6. Calculating 26P2 * 10P2 = 65000, which matches option D.\nAction: Answer(\"D\") \n"
