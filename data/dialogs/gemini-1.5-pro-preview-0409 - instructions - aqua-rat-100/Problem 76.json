This led to an incorrect simplification and ultimately the wrong answer choice. \n**Understanding the Correct Approach:**\nThe correct approach involves recognizing the given expression as a perfect square trinomial. This allows us to factor it and then simplify to find the range of possible values for x.\n**Steps for Correct Solution:**\n1. **Recognize the Perfect Square Trinomial:** The numerator of the expression is in the form of (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2, where a = n and b = 4√n.\n2. **Factor the Numerator:** Rewrite the numerator as (n + 4√n)^2.\n3. **Simplify the Expression:** Cancel out the common factor of (n + 4√n) in the numerator and denominator. This leaves us with x = n + 4√n.\n4. **Find the Range of x:** Given that 36 ≤ n ≤ 72, we can find the minimum and maximum values of x by substituting these values into the simplified expression.\n**Applying the Correct Approach:**\n1. **Minimum Value of x:** When n = 36, x = 36 + 4√36 = 60.\n2. **Maximum Value of x:** When n = 72, x = 72 + 4√72 ≈ 103.43.\nTherefore, the correct range for x is 60 < x < 103.43. \n"
