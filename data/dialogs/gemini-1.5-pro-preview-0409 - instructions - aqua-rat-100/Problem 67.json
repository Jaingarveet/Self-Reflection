From \"6 pitas = 2 rolls\", I get 1 roll = 3 pitas.\n2.  Substituting this into \"3 rolls = 5 baguettes\", I get (3 * 3 pitas) = 5 baguettes, which simplifies to 9 pitas = 5 baguettes.\n3.  Therefore, 1 baguette is equivalent to 9/5 pitas.\n4.  Finally, 2 baguettes would be 2 * (9/5) pitas = 18/5 pitas.\nAction: Answer(\"E\") \n"
