Determine the width of each picket and the width of each space.\n2. Calculate the combined width of a picket-space unit.\n3. Identify the number of pickets (x).\n4. Recognize that the number of spaces is one less than the number of pickets (x-1).\n5. Calculate the total length of the fence in inches by multiplying the number of pickets by the picket width and adding the product of the number of spaces and the space width.\n6. Convert the length from inches to feet by dividing by 12.\n7. Simplify the expression for the length in feet.\n"
