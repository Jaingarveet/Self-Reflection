I misunderstood the information provided in the problem and ended up with an incorrect solution.\n\nTo solve this problem, I will use the information provided in the question: Jack buys 18 sharpeners (white and brown) for Rs. 100. If he pays 1 rupee more for each white than brown sharpeners.\n\nI will start by identifying the number of white sharpeners Jack bought. According to the problem, Jack pays 1 rupee more for each white sharpeners than brown sharpeners. So, if he buys x brown sharpeners, he will pay 1 rupee more for each of them, which means he will pay a total of Rs. 100 + (x x 1) = Rs. 100 + x for the brown sharpeners.\n\nSince Jack buys 18 sharpeners in total, the number of brown sharpeners he bought is:\n\nx = 18 - 10 = 8\n\nSo, Jack bought 8 brown sharpeners.\n\nNow, to find the number of white sharpeners Jack bought, we can use the fact that he pays 1 rupee more for each white sharpeners than brown sharpeners. So, if he buys x white sharpeners, he will pay a total of Rs. 100 + (x x 1) = Rs. 100 + x for the white sharpeners.\n\nSince Jack buys 18 sharpeners in total, the number of white sharpeners he bought is:\n\nx = 18 - 8 = 10\n\nSo, Jack bought 10 white sharpeners.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA: 10,8\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification."
