The correct solution is as follows:\n\nLet the speed of the ship be x miles per hour. The plane started with 10 times the speed of the ship, so the speed of the plane is 10x miles per hour.\n\nAfter the ship has traveled 180 miles, the distance between the ship and the plane is:\n\nDistance = Speed x Time = x miles\n\nSince the plane started with a speed of 10x miles per hour, it will take it x/10 hours to catch up to the ship.\n\nTherefore, the distance between the ship and the plane when they meet is:\n\nDistance = Speed x Time = x miles + (x/10) hours = (x + 10x/10) miles\n\nSo, the distance between the ship and the plane when they meet is (11x/10) miles.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
