The correct formula to use is:\n\nSelling Price = Cost Price + Profit Margin - Discount\n\nSo, to find the selling price that will give Karan a 20% profit and a 20% discount, we can use the formula like this:\n\nSelling Price = 1200 + (20/100) x 1200 - (20/100) x 1200\n\nSimplifying the calculation, we get:\n\nSelling Price = 1200 + 240 - 240\nSelling Price = 1200 + 0\n\nSo, the selling price should be Rs. 1200.\n\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
