I will use my self-reflection to help me answer the question correctly this time.\n\nThe problem states that minor arc AC is 160°, and minor arc BD is 150°. If B bisects minor arc AC, then the measure of minor arc AD is equal to the difference between the measures of minor arcs AC and BD.\n\nUsing the information provided, we can calculate the measure of minor arc AD as follows:\n\nAD = AC - BD\n= 160° - 150°\n= 10°\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) 10°."
