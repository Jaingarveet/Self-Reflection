I misunderstood the information provided in the problem and calculated the distance incorrectly.\n\nTo solve the problem correctly, I used the information provided in the problem that Kevin drove at a constant speed of 70 mph and that he was 70 miles away from B at the end of his trip. I then calculated the total distance traveled by Kevin during his trip by multiplying his speed by the time it took him to travel that distance.\n\nThe correct answer is (70 x 3) = 210 miles.\n\nI learned that it is important to carefully read and understand the problem before answering, and to double-check my calculations to ensure that they are correct."
