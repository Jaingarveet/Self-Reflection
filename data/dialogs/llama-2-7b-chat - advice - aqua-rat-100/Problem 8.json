I also know that the total fare paid by 6 persons traveling by bus and 8 persons traveling by train between the two places is Rs.1512.\n\nAction: Let's use the information provided to find the train fare for one person.\n\nThe bus fare for two persons is four-thirds the train fare for one person, so the train fare for one person is:\n\nTrain fare = 4/3 \\* Bus fare\n\nWe are given that the bus fare for two persons is Rs.126, so:\n\nTrain fare = 4/3 \\* 126 = 77\n\nTherefore, the train fare between Agra and Aligarh for one person is Rs.77.\n\nAnswer: B) 77"
