I will follow the steps I outlined in my advice to ensure I get the correct answer this time.\n\nStep 1: Let the breadth of the rectangular piece be x meters.\n\nStep 2: Since the length is 1m more than 4 times the breadth, the length is 4x + 1 meters.\n\nStep 3: The perimeter of a rectangle is found by adding the lengths of all four sides. In this case, the perimeter is 2(length + breadth).\n\nStep 4: Substitute the values of length and breadth into the perimeter formula.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
