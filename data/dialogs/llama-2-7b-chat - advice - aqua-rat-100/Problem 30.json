The doctor gave Roy 5 tablets to take every 15 minutes.\n2. To find out how many times Roy will take the tablets, we can divide the number of tablets by the time interval (15 minutes). So, 5 tablets / 15 minutes = 3 times.\n3. Therefore, Roy will take all 5 tablets in 3 x 15 minutes = 45 minutes.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
