        "content": "  Reflection:\nI previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand now that the problem is asking for the number of faces of the smaller cubes that remain unpainted after painting the outer surface of the hollow cube.\n\nTo solve this problem, I will decompose it into simpler steps:\n\n1. The hollow cube has a size of 5cm, and the thickness of 1cm.\n2. The cube is made of smaller cubes of size 1cm.\n3. The outer surface of the cube is painted.\n\nNow, I will think through each subproblem step-by-step:\n\nStep 1: The hollow cube has a size of 5cm, and the thickness of 1cm.\n\nAction: Calculate the number of faces of the smaller cubes that are inside the hollow cube.\nAnswer: 5cm / 1cm = 5 faces.\n\nStep 2: The cube is made of smaller cubes of size 1cm.\n\nAction: Calculate the number of faces of the smaller cubes that are outside the hollow cube.\nAnswer: 5cm - 1cm = 4 faces.\n\nStep 3: The outer surface of the cube is painted.\n\nAction: Calculate the number of faces of the smaller cubes that remain unpainted after painting the outer surface of the hollow cube.\nAnswer: 4 faces.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) 450.\n\nI hope this reflection helps me to answer the question correctly this time."
