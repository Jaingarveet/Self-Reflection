I will use my self-reflection to help me answer the question correctly this time.\n\nThe problem states that Train A leaves every 16 minutes, and Train B leaves every 17 minutes. To find the time until they both leave the station again, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 16 and 17.\n\nI will break down the problem into simpler steps:\n\nStep 1: Find the multiples of 16: 16, 32, 48, 64, ...\nStep 2: Find the multiples of 17: 17, 34, 51, 68, ...\nStep 3: Find the least common multiple (LCM) of 16 and 17: 16 x 17 = 252.\n\nTherefore, the time until both trains leave the station again is 252 minutes, or 4 hours and 2 minutes.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
