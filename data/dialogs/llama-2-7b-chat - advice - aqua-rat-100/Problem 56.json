To solve this problem, I will break it down into smaller steps and use the correct formula.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the total amount paid by the borrower in 12 monthly installments.\nTotal amount paid = Number of installments x Monthly installment amount\nTotal amount paid = 12 x 31.50\nTotal amount paid = 382\n\nStep 2: Calculate the interest rate by dividing the total amount paid by the amount borrowed.\nInterest rate = Total amount paid / Amount borrowed\nInterest rate = 382 / 360\nInterest rate = 1.0125 (REDACTED)\n\nTherefore, the interest rate is 1.0125%.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
