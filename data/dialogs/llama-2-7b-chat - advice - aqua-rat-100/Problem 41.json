I thought the number of friends attending the picnic was the total number of friends, rather than the number of friends who actually attended.\n\nTo solve this problem, I will break it down into smaller steps:\n\n1. The original number of friends who planned to spend Rs. 96 on eatables is 8.\n2. Four of the friends did not turn up, so the number of friends who actually attended the picnic is 8 - 4 = 4.\n3. Since 4 friends attended the picnic, each friend had to contribute Rs. 4 extra, resulting in a total of Rs. 96 + 4 = Rs. 100.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) 12.\n\nAdvice:\n\n* Always carefully read the question and understand the problem.\n* Always break down complex problems into smaller, manageable steps.\n* Always double-check your calculations and reasoning.\n* Remember that the correct answer is the one that matches the problem statement."
