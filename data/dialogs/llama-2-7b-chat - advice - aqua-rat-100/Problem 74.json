To form a quadrilateral by joining 4 points from a regular pentagon, we need to choose 4 points from the 5 points of the pentagon.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")\nExplanation:\nThere are 5 points in the pentagon, and we need to choose 4 of them to form a quadrilateral. Therefore, the number of quadrilaterals that can be formed is 5 x 4 = 20.\n\nReflection:\nI reflected on my previous answer and realized that I made a mistake in my calculation. I limited my thinking to a small number of possibilities and did not consider all the possible combinations of points. I will make sure to be more thorough in my calculations in the future.\n\nAdvice:\nThank you for providing feedback on my previous answer. I will keep in mind the advice you provided, including considering all possible combinations of points and double-checking my calculations for accuracy."
