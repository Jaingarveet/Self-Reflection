I will follow the steps I should have taken to solve the problem correctly.\n\nStep 1: Identify the given information:\nThe shopkeeper gives a discount of 5% and earns Rs. 15 less as profit. The marked price of the watch is Rs. x.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the discount:\nThe discount given by the shopkeeper is 5%, which means he will deduct 5% of the marked price. So, the discount amount is 5% of Rs. x.\n\nDiscount amount = 5% of Rs. x\nDiscount amount = Rs. 0.05x\n\nStep 3: Calculate the profit:\nThe shopkeeper earns Rs. 15 less as profit, which means he will subtract Rs. 15 from the marked price.\nProfit = Rs. 15\n\nStep 4: Solve for the marked price:\nWe are given two equations:\n\nDiscount amount = Rs. 0.05x\nProfit = Rs. 15\n\nWe can solve this system of equations by substituting the value of discount amount in the second equation:\n\nProfit = Rs. 15\nRs. 0.05x = Rs. 15\n\nx = Rs. 300\n\nSo, the marked price of the watch is Rs. 300.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
