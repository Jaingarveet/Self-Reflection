        "content": "  Reflection:\n\nI previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand now that I made a mistake in my calculation. I will use my self-reflection to help me answer the question correctly this time.\n\nThe problem states that the point on the edge of the fan blade is rotating in a plane 10 centimeters from the center of the fan, and the fan runs at a rate of 300 revolutions per minute. To find the distance traveled by the point, we need to use the formula:\n\nDistance = Revolutions x Angular Speed x Time\n\nIn this case, the angular speed of the fan is 300 revolutions per minute, which is equivalent to 50 revolutions per second. The time is 30 seconds.\n\nSo, the distance traveled by the point is:\n\nDistance = 50 revolutions/second x 30 seconds = 1500 pi\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) 1500 pi.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification."
