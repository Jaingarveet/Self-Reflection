I will re-evaluate the problem and provide the correct answer this time.\n\nReflection:\nI analyzed the problem and realized that I misunderstood the information provided. I mistakenly calculated the time when C joined the business based on the total profit and the share of C. However, the correct calculation is based on the amount of money that C brought into the business.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")\n\nExplanation:\nC joined the business after some more time after B joined. The total profit for the year is Rs.375,000, and C gets Rs.150,000 as his share. This means that C brought Rs.120,000 into the business (Rs.150,000 - Rs.30,000). Since B joined the business 2 months after A started the business, and C joined after some more time, C joined the business 4 months after B joined (2 + 4 = 6 months). Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 4 months."
