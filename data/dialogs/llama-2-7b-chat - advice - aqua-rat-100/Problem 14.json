Raj was one-third as old as Rahim 5 years back, so Rahim's age 5 years ago was 3/3 = 1 times Raj's age.\n2. Raj is currently 17 years old, so Rahim's age 5 years ago was 17 - 5 = 12 years old.\n\nTherefore, Rahim is currently 12 + 5 = 17 years old.\n\nThe correct answer is (D) 42.\n\nAdvice:\n\n* Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n* Break down complex problems into smaller, manageable steps.\n* Double-check your calculations and ensure accuracy.\n* Use visual aids or diagrams to help with calculations and problem-solving.\n* Practice, practice, practice to improve math skills and accuracy."
