I realized that 20% of the students took physics, and 28% of the students took math. This means that the total number of students who took either physics or math is 100% (20% + 28% = 48%).\n\nNow, I need to find the least possible number of students in the school. Let's assume that the number of students in the school is x.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we know that at least 20% of the students took physics, so the number of students who took physics is 20% of x.\n\nSimilarly, at least 28% of the students took math, so the number of students who took math is 28% of x.\n\nWe can now set up the following equation:\n\n20% of x = 28% of x\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx = 500\n\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
