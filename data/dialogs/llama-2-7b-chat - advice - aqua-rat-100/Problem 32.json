I will use my self-reflection to help me answer the question correctly this time.\n\nTo solve this problem, I will break it down into smaller steps:\n\nStep 1: Identify the given information: The cyclist travels at 12 miles per hour, and the distance to be traveled is 48 miles.\n\nStep 2: Determine the time it takes to travel a single mile: 12 miles/hour = 1 hour (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).\n\nStep 3: Calculate the time it takes to travel 48 miles: 48 miles / 1 hour = 48 hours.\n\nStep 4: Check your calculation: 48 hours = 48 x 60 minutes/hour = 2880 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B) 240 minutes.\n\nI hope this helps!
