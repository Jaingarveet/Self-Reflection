I thought the problem was asking for the number of pita breads in total, but it's actually asking for the number of pita breads in relation to the number of rolls.\n\nTo solve the problem correctly, I need to use the information provided in the problem:\n\n* Six pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as do two rolls.\n* Three rolls contain the same amount of falafel as five baguettes do.\n\nUsing this information, I can set up the following equation:\n\nNumber of pita breads = Number of rolls / 6\n\nSubstituting the value for the number of rolls (2), I get:\n\nNumber of pita breads = 2 / 6 = 1/3\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) 2.\n\nAdvice: When solving a problem, it's important to carefully read and understand the problem statement, and to use the information provided to set up the correct equation. It's also important to check your work and make sure you have the correct answer."
