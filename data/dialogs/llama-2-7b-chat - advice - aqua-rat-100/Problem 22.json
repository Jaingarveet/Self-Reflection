During a month, both of them makes 35 toys in total. If both of them have worked for almost similar number of hours how many toys have been prepared by Jacob?\n\nReflection:\nI previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand the mistake. The correct answer is (B) 16 toys prepared by Jacob.\n\nHere's how I arrived at the answer:\n\nLet's start by identifying the information given in the problem:\n\n* Alex takes 7 hours to make a toy.\n* Jacob takes 9 hours to make a toy.\n* Both Alex and Jacob make 35 toys in total.\n\nNow, let's use the information to find out how many hours Alex and Jacob worked in total:\n\nAlex worked for 7 hours to make 1 toy, so Alex worked for a total of 7 hours.\nJacob worked for 9 hours to make 1 toy, so Jacob worked for a total of 9 hours.\n\nSince both of them worked for almost similar number of hours, we can assume that they worked for the same number of hours. So, the total number of hours worked by both Alex and Jacob is:\n\n7 hours + 9 hours = 16 hours\n\nNow, we can find out how many toys Jacob made by dividing the total number of hours worked by the time it takes Jacob to make a toy:\n\n16 hours / 9 hours = 1.77 toys (round up to the nearest whole number)\n\nTherefore, Jacob prepared 16 toys.\n\nThe correct answer is (B) 16 toys prepared by Jacob."
