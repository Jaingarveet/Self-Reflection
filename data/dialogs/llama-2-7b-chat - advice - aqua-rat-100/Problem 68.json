The least common multiple of these two integers is 7700.\n\nAction: Let's use the information provided to find the other integer.\n\nThe greatest common factor of 350 and x is 11. Therefore, we can divide both numbers by 11:\n\n350 รท 11 = 32\n\nx รท 11 = 69\n\nNow, we can see that the least common multiple of 32 and 69 is 7700. Therefore, the other integer is 69.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")\n\nReflection: I reflected on my previous mistake and how I was able to find the correct answer this time. I realized that I needed to divide both numbers by the greatest common factor to find the least common multiple. I also noticed that I was able to find the correct answer by using the information provided in the question."
