I will use my self-reflection to help me answer the question correctly this time.\n\nThe problem states that M men agree to purchase a gift for Rs. D. If 3 men drop out, the remaining men will have to contribute more towards the purchase of the gift. To find out how much more each man will have to contribute, we need to calculate the new ratio of the number of men to the amount of money needed.\n\nLet's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. The original number of men is M.\n2. The original amount of money needed is D.\n3. After 3 men drop out, the new number of men is M - 3.\n4. The new amount of money needed is D - 3D.\n\nNow, let's calculate the new ratio of men to money:\n\nNew ratio = (M - 3) / (D - 3D)\n\nSimplifying the ratio, we get:\n\nNew ratio = M / D\n\nNow, we need to find out how much more each man will have to contribute. We can do this by multiplying the new ratio by the original amount of money needed:\n\nEach man's contribution = D x (M / D)\n\nSubstituting the values given in the question, we get:\n\nEach man's contribution = D x (M / D) = D(M/D)\n\nSince the answer choices are:\n\nA: D/(M-3)\nB: MD/3\nC: M/(D-3)\nD: 3D/(M2-3M)\nE: None of these\n\nWe can see that the correct answer is (D(M/D)). Therefore, the answer is (B): MD/3."
