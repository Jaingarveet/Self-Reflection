I will make sure to double-check my calculations and apply the formula correctly this time.\n\nTo find the cost price of the article, we need to use the formula:\nCost price = Selling price / (1 + Percentage profit)\n\nIn this case, the selling price is Rs.360, and the percentage profit is 20%.\n\nCost price = Selling price / (1 + 0.20)\nCost price = Rs.360 / (1 + 0.20)\nCost price = Rs.360 / 1.20\nCost price = Rs.300\n\nTherefore, the cost price of the article is Rs.300.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
