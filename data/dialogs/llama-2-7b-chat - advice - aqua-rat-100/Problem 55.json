Here is my reflection on the problem, my solution, and the correct answer:\n\nProblem: A man rows at the rate of 4 kmph in still water and his rate against the current is 2 kmph. What is the man's rate along the current?\n\nSolution (incorrect): I initially thought that the man's rate along the current would be 6 kmph (4 kmph in still water + 2 kmph against the current).\n\nCorrect Answer: The man's rate along the current is 12 kmph (4 kmph in still water + 2 kmph against the current).\n\nExplanation: To find the man's rate along the current, we need to add the man's rate in still water to his rate against the current. The total rate is 12 kmph.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
