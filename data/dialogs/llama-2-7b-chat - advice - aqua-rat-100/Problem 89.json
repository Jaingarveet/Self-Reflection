This means that the maximum distance I can travel with $8.50 is actually less than what I previously calculated.\n\nAction: I will recalculate the maximum distance I can travel with $8.50 by considering the additional 10 cents for each additional quarter-mile.\n\nMaximum distance = $3.50 (first quarter-mile) + ($0.10 x number of additional quarter-miles)\n\nNumber of additional quarter-miles = distance - first quarter-mile\n\nDistance = 11.75 miles (from previous answer) - 0.25 miles = 11.5 miles\n\nMaximum distance = $3.50 (first quarter-mile) + ($0.10 x number of additional quarter-miles)\nMaximum distance = $3.50 + ($0.10 x 11.5 miles)\nMaximum distance = $3.50 + $1.15\nMaximum distance = $4.65\n\nTherefore, the maximum distance I can travel with $8.50 on a cab that charges $3.50 for the first quarter-mile and 10 cents for each additional quarter-mile is 4.65 miles.\n\nAnswer: C) 17.75 miles"
