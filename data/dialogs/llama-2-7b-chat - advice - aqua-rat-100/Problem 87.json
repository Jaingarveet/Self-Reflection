        "content": "  Reflection:\nI previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand now that I need to use the principle of permutations to solve it. The problem states that there are 10 oranges in a basket, and we want to choose 2 oranges from the basket. To calculate the number of ways to choose a subset of 2 oranges from a set of 10 oranges, we can use the formula:\n\nn! / (k! \\* (n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of oranges (10), k is the number of oranges we want to choose (2), and the factorial symbol \"!\" represents the number of ways to arrange the oranges in a particular order.\n\nUsing this formula, we can calculate the number of ways to choose 2 oranges from 10 oranges as follows:\n\nn! = 10! = 10 x 9 x 8 x 7 x 6 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 3,628,800\n\nk! = 2! = 2 x 1 = 2\n\n(n-k)! = (10-2)! = 8\n\nSo, the number of ways to choose 2 oranges from a basket of 10 oranges is:\n\n3,628,800 / (2! x 8) = 181,440\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) 90.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
