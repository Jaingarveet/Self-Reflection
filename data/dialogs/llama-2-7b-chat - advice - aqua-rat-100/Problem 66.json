Here's what happened:\n\nI initially thought that the sum of the ages of all the members was 250, and I calculated the number of members based on that assumption. However, I noticed that the youngest member is only 7 years old, which means that the sum of the ages of all the members cannot be 250.\n\nSo, I went back to the problem and recalculated the number of members based on the correct information. I realized that the number of members in the club is 20.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
