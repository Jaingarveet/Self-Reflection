Service targets will be set at 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day. Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail. The six targets are set according to the following conditions: None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.\nQuestion: If Image's website target is 2 days, which one of the following targets must also be 2 days?\nChoices:\n  A: Image's voicemail target\n  B: Solide's website target\n  C: Solide's voicemail target\n  D: Truvest's website target\n  E: Truvest's voicemail target\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n- Always read the conditions carefully and understand their implications.\n- Break down complex problems into simpler parts.\n- Apply logical reasoning to solve the problem.\n- Double-check your understanding of the conditions and your application of them to the problem.\n- Practice more problems to improve your logical reasoning skills.\n"

This means that if Image's website target is 2 days, its voicemail target must be either 1 or 2 days. However, Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Therefore, Image's voicemail target cannot be 2 days, it must be 1 day. This means that none of the other targets can be 2 days because they must be either equal to or longer than Image's voicemail target. \nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
