The order in which the articles are edited is subject to the following conditions: Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other. S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third. S must be earlier than Y. J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.\nQuestion: If G is fourth, which one of the following could be true?\nChoices:\n  A: H is fifth.\n  B: J is first.\n  C: Q is second.\n  D: S is fifth\n  E: Y is sixth.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n- Always read the conditions carefully and make sure you understand them correctly.\n- Pay attention to the order or sequence in the conditions.\n- Apply logical reasoning to evaluate each answer choice.\n- Double-check your understanding of the conditions and your application of them to the given scenario.\n"

S cannot be fifth because S must be earlier than Y, and if S is fifth, there are only two spots left for Y which would violate the rule that G must be earlier than R.
