Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.\nQuestion: If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then which one of the following could be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Kim works in Zone 2.\n  B: Mahr works in Zone 2.\n  C: Parra works in Zone 3.\n  D: Tiao works in Zone 1.\n  E: Udall works in Zone 3.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n- Always read the conditions carefully and understand the constraints.\n- Break down the problem and analyze each part separately.\n- Be careful not to make assumptions that are not supported by the conditions.\n- Evaluate each answer choice carefully based on the conditions and constraints.\n- Practice logical reasoning problems to improve your skills.\n"

Since either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, and either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2, it means that Parra and Tiao cannot be in the same zone. Therefore, Parra and Quinn must be in Zone 1, and Tiao, Stuckey, and Udall must be in Zone 2. Since there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, and more in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, it means that Kim and Mahr must be in Zone 3. Therefore, the only possible answer is that Mahr works in Zone 2.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
