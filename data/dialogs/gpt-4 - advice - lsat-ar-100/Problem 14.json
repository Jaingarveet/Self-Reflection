Since at least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F, it means that R cannot be performed fourth. Therefore, S cannot be performed fourth because P is performed at some time before S. Also, since O is performed either first or fifth and T is performed fifth, O must be performed first. Therefore, S cannot be performed first. The only remaining options for S are third, seventh, or eighth. However, the eighth composition performed is either L or H, so S cannot be performed eighth. Therefore, S must be performed either third or seventh.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
