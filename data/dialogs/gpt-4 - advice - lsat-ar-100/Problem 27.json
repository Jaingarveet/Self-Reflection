The following conditions must apply: Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.\nQuestion: Which one of the following could be an accurate and complete list of the students who review Tamerlane?\nChoices:\n  A: Jiang, Kramer\n  B: Kramer, O'Neill\n  C: Kramer, Lopez, O'Neill\n  D: Kramer, Megregian, O'Neill\n  E: Lopez, Megregian, O'Neill\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n- Always read the conditions carefully and understand them.\n- Break down complex conditions into simpler ones.\n- Be careful not to misinterpret conditions.\n- Apply conditions to each option and eliminate those that do not meet them.\n- Double-check your understanding of the conditions and your application of them to the options.\n"

The conditions also state that neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Since Jiang is not mentioned as reviewing Tamerlane, we can't exclude Lopez or Megregian based on this condition. However, we know that Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian, so Megregian can't be in the list because that would mean she reviews the same number of plays as Kramer and O'Neill. Therefore, the only possible list is Kramer and O'Neill.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
