Since G and H (both botanists) are selected, we can only select one zoologist. The conditions also state that if M (a chemist) is selected, both P and R (zoologists) must be selected. But we can't select both P and R because we've already selected two botanists. Therefore, M cannot be selected. Since we need at least one chemist and M cannot be selected, we must select either K or L. But the conditions state that F and K cannot both be selected. Since F is a botanist and we've already selected two botanists, we can't select F. Therefore, we must select K. \nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
