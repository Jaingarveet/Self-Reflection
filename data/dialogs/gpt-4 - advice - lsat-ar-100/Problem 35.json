This means that each day must have a different type of cookie being baked. Since there are three types of cookies and five days in a week, at least one type of cookie must be baked twice in a week. Therefore, at least one batch of cookies is made on each of the five days (A) cannot be false. \nThe second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. This means that at least two batches of cookies are made on one day, so (B) cannot be false. \nThe condition that at least one batch of cookies is made on Monday does not specify the number of batches, so it is possible that exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday (C) cannot be false. \nThe condition that the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday does not specify the number of batches made on Tuesday, so it is possible that exactly two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday (D) could be false. \nThe condition that no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day does not specify the number of batches made on Friday, so it is possible that exactly one batch of cookies is made on Friday (E) cannot be false. \nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
