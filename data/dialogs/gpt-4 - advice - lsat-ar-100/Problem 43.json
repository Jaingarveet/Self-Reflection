S must be earlier than Y. J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.\nQuestion: If Y is fourth, which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: J is second.\n  B: J is third\n  C: Q is first.\n  D: Q is third\n  E: R is seventh.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n- Always read the question and conditions carefully.\n- Break down complex problems into simpler parts.\n- Analyze each condition and its implications separately.\n- Apply logical reasoning to eliminate incorrect options.\n- Double-check your reasoning and final answer.\n"
