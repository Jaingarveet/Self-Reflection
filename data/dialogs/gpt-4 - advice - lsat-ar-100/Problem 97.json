Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day. The following conditions apply: No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.\nQuestion: If the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday, then each of the following could be true EXCEPT:\nChoices:\n  A: Two different kinds of cookie have their first batch made on Monday.\n  B: Two different kinds of cookie have their first batch made on Tuesday.\n  C: Two different kinds of cookie have their second batch made on Wednesday.\n  D: Two different kinds of cookie have their second batch made on Thursday.\n  E: Two different kinds of cookie have their third batch made on Friday.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n- Read the problem carefully and understand the conditions.\n- Make no assumptions that are not supported by the conditions.\n- Evaluate each option carefully.\n- Use logical reasoning to solve the problem.\n"

If the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday, then the second batch of oatmeal cookies is also made on Tuesday. This means that the first batch of oatmeal cookies must have been made on Monday. The conditions also state that the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday. Therefore, the first batch of sugar cookies must have been made on a day before Thursday, which could be Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday. \nGiven these conditions, let's evaluate each choice:\nA: Two different kinds of cookie have their first batch made on Monday. This could be true if the first batch of sugar cookies is also made on Monday.\nB: Two different kinds of cookie have their first batch made on Tuesday. This could be true if the first batch of sugar cookies is made on Tuesday.\nC: Two different kinds of cookie have their second batch made on Wednesday. This could be true if the second batch of peanut butter cookies or the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Wednesday.\nD: Two different kinds of cookie have their second batch made on Thursday. This could be true if the second batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Thursday.\nE: Two different kinds of cookie have their third batch made on Friday. This could not be true because the third batch of any kind of cookie would have to be made after the second batch of that kind of cookie, and the second batch of each kind of cookie is already accounted for on Tuesday (oatmeal) and Thursday (sugar). There are not enough days left in the week for the third batch of two different kinds of cookie to be made on Friday.\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
