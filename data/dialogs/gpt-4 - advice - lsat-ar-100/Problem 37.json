The order of their performance must satisfy the following conditions: T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R. At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F. O is performed either first or fifth. The eighth composition performed is either L or H. P is performed at some time before S. At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.\nQuestion: If S is performed fourth, which one of the following could be an accurate list of the compositions performed first, second, and third, respectively?\nChoices:\n  A: F, H, P\n  B: H, P. L\n  C: O, P, R\n  D: O, P, T\n  E: P, R, T\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n- Always read the question carefully and understand the conditions.\n- Break down the problem and consider each condition separately.\n- Be careful not to overlook any conditions.\n- Use logical reasoning to solve the problem.\n- Double-check your answer to ensure it meets all conditions.\n"
