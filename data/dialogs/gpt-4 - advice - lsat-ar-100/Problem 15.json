The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.\nQuestion: If the shoe store is in space 4, which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: The optometrist is next to a restaurant.\n  B: The pharmacy is next to the veterinarian.\n  C: A restaurant is next to the toy store.\n  D: The shoe store is next to the toy store.\n  E: The shoe store is next to the veterinarian.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n- Always read the question and the constraints carefully.\n- Understand the constraints and how they affect the possible locations of the businesses.\n- Use logical reasoning to determine the possible locations for each business.\n- Double-check your reasoning and your answer.\n- Remember that the constraints may not specify the exact locations of the businesses, but they limit the possible locations.\n"
