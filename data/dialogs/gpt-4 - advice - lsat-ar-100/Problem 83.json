Each session will be led by a different lab assistant—Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, or Rebecca. The assignment of lab assistants to sessions is constrained as follows: Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day. Nessa must lead an afternoon session. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.\nQuestion: If Julio and Kevin both lead morning sessions, then any of the following could be true EXCEPT:\nChoices:\n  A: Lan's session meets Wednesday morning.\n  B: Lan's session meets Thursday afternoon.\n  C: Nessa's session meets Friday afternoon.\n  D: Olivia's session meets Thursday morning.\n  E: Olivia's session meets Friday morning.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n- Always read the question and constraints carefully.\n- Understand the implications of each constraint.\n- Apply the constraints systematically to each answer choice.\n- Be careful not to overlook any constraints or implications.\n- Practice logical reasoning problems to improve your skills.\n"

This means Olivia cannot have a session on Wednesday. Therefore, if Lan's session meets Wednesday morning, it would not conflict with Olivia's session. If Lan's session meets Thursday afternoon, it would not conflict with Olivia's session. Nessa's session can meet Friday afternoon because there is no constraint against it. Olivia's session can meet Friday morning because it is after Julio's session. However, Olivia's session cannot meet Thursday morning because Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's, and Julio is leading a morning session. \nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
