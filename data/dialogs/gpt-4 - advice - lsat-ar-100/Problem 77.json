Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.\nQuestion: For how many of the six new employees is the assignment of a parking space limited to one of only two possible spaces?\nChoices:\n  A: none\n  B: two\n  C: three\n  D: four\n  E: five\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n- Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n- Break down complex problems into simpler parts.\n- Consider the implications of each rule or restriction individually.\n- Consider how the rules or restrictions interact with each other.\n- Double-check your reasoning and final answer.\n"

Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.\n4. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.\nFrom these rules, we can deduce that:\n- Togowa cannot be assigned parking space #6 because Young must have a higher number.\n- Young cannot be assigned parking space #1 because Robertson must have a lower number.\n- Souza cannot be assigned parking space #6 because Xu must have a higher number.\n- Xu cannot be assigned parking space #1 because Souza must have a lower number.\n- Robertson cannot be assigned parking space #5 or #6 because he must be in #1, #2, #3, or #4.\nSo, the employees with only two possible spaces are:\n- Togowa: can only be in #1 or #2 because Young must be higher and Robertson must be higher than Young.\n- Young: can only be in #3 or #4 because Robertson must be lower and Togowa must be lower.\n- Robertson: can only be in #1 or #2 because he must be lower than Young and cannot be in #5 or #6.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
