What percentage of the chocolates are both vanilla flavored and not squashed?\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")\n\nExplanation:\n\nTo find the percentage of chocolates that are both vanilla flavored and not squashed, we need to calculate the percentage of chocolates that are not squashed and then multiply it by the percentage of vanilla flavored chocolates.\n\nLet's first calculate the percentage of chocolates that are not squashed:\n\n90% of 100% - 10% of 100% = 90% - 10% = 80%\n\nSo, 80% of the chocolates are not squashed.\n\nNext, let's calculate the percentage of vanilla flavored chocolates:\n\n10% of 100% = 10%\n\nSo, 10% of the chocolates are vanilla flavored.\n\nNow, let's multiply the percentage of chocolates that are not squashed by the percentage of vanilla flavored chocolates:\n\n80% x 10% = 8%\n\nTherefore, the percentage of chocolates that are both vanilla flavored and not squashed is 8%.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Miscalculation\n* Error in logic\n* Incorrect application of percentages\n\nSolution:\n\nI apologize for my mistake earlier.
