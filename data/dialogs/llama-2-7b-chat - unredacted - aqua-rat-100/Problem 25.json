The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower?\nChoices:\n  A: 5(√3 + 1)\n  B: 6(√3 + √2)\n  C: 7(√3 – 1)\n  D: 8(√3 – 2)\n  E: None of these\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI made a mistake in my reasoning and calculation. I misunderstood the problem and the concept of angle of elevation.\n\nThe correct solution is:\n\nThe car is moving at a uniform speed, so the distance traveled in 10 minutes is equal to the speed multiplied by the time.\nThe angle of elevation changes from 45° to 60°, so the height of the tower is increasing at a rate of 15° per 10 minutes.\n\nThe time taken for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60° is 10 minutes.\n\nSo, the distance traveled by the car in this time is:\nDistance = Speed x Time = 10 minutes x Speed\n\nSpeed = Distance / Time = 10 minutes / 10 minutes = 1\n\nNow, the height of the tower is increasing at a rate of 15° per 10 minutes.\nSo, the height of the tower after 10 minutes is:\nHeight = 15° x 10 minutes = 150°\n\nThe angle of elevation at the base of the tower is 45°.\nSo, the height of the tower from the base is:\nHeight = Angle of elevation x Distance = 45° x 150° = 6750°\n\nTherefore, the car will reach the base of the tower after 6750° / 1 = 6750 minutes = 109.4 hours = 4.5 days.\n\nThe correct answer is (A) 5(√3 + 1).\n\nAdvice:\n\n* Always read the problem carefully and understand the concept.\n* Always break down complex problems into simpler sub-problems.\n* Always use the correct units and conversion factors.\n* Always check your calculations and assumptions.\n* Always double-check your answer.\n"
