After covering quarter of the distance, it starts raining and the train has to be slowed to speed of 75 miles/hour. What is the total journey duration?\nChoices:\n  A: 10\n  B: 11.5\n  C: 12.5\n  D: 13.5\n  E: 15\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI made a calculation error in my previous answer. I misunderstood the information provided in the question and made an incorrect assumption about the train's speed after it started raining.\n\nThe correct calculation for the total journey duration is as follows:\n\n1. The train covers the first quarter of the distance at a speed of 100 miles/hour, which means it covers 25% of the total distance in 10 hours (since the train runs at a speed of 100 miles/hour for 10 hours).\n2. After covering a quarter of the distance, the train's speed is reduced to 75 miles/hour, which means it covers the remaining distance at a speed of 75 miles/hour.\n3. The total distance traveled by the train is half of the total distance, which is equal to the distance traveled before the rain plus the distance traveled after the rain.\n4. The distance traveled before the rain is equal to the distance traveled in the first 10 hours (25% of the total distance).\n5. The distance traveled after the rain is equal to the remaining distance (50% of the total distance).\n\nTherefore, the total journey duration is:\n\n10 hours (distance traveled in the first 10 hours) + 5 hours (distance traveled after the rain) = 15 hours\n\nSo, the correct answer is (C) 15 hours.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Misunderstanding the information provided in the question\n* Making an incorrect assumption about the train's speed after it started raining\n* Calculation error in determining the total distance traveled by the train\n\nAdvice:\n\n* Always read the question carefully and understand the problem before answering.\n* Break down complex problems into smaller, manageable subproblems.\n* Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n* Use the information provided in the question to determine the train's speed after it started raining.\n* Consider the distance traveled before and after the rain when calculating the total journey duration.\n"

For this question, I will choose the correct answer, which is (C) 15 hours.\n\nHere's my thought process:\n\nThe train covers the first quarter of the distance at a speed of 100 miles/hour, which means it covers 25% of the total distance in 10 hours (since the train runs at a speed of 100 miles/hour for 10 hours).\n\nAfter covering a quarter of the distance, the train's speed is reduced to 75 miles/hour, which means it covers the remaining distance at a speed of 75 miles/hour.\n\nThe total distance traveled by the train is half of the total distance, which is equal to the distance traveled before the rain plus the distance traveled after the rain.\n\nThe distance traveled before the rain is equal to the distance traveled in the first 10 hours (25% of the total distance).\n\nThe distance traveled after the rain is equal to the remaining distance (50% of the total distance).\n\nTherefore, the total journey duration is:\n\n10 hours (distance traveled in the first 10 hours) + 5 hours (distance traveled after the rain) = 15 hours\n\nSo, the correct answer is (C) 15 hours."
