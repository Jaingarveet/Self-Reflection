What is the distance traveled, in centimeters, by this point after 30 seconds when the fan runs at the rate of 300 revolutions per minutes?\nChoices:\n  A: 750pi\n  B: 1500pi\n  C: 1875pi\n  D: 3000pi\n  E: 7500pi\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI made a mistake in my answer by selecting option C, which is incorrect. The correct answer is option D, which is 3000π.\n\nHere's why:\n\nThe formula for finding the distance traveled by a point on the edge of a rotating disk is:\n\ndistance = revolutions x radius x time\n\nIn this case, the radius of the fan blade is 10 cm, and the fan rotates at a rate of 300 revolutions per minute. To find the distance traveled by the point on the edge of the fan blade, we need to multiply the number of revolutions by the radius and time.\n\nUsing the formula, we get:\n\ndistance = 300 x 10 x 30 = 3000π\n\nTherefore, the distance traveled by the point on the edge of the fan blade after 30 seconds is 3000π.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Misunderstanding the formula\n* Calculation error\n* Pi mistake\n\nSolution:\n\nTo solve this problem correctly, we need to:\n\n1. Understand the formula for finding the distance traveled by a point on the edge of a rotating disk.\n2. Identify the given values correctly, including the radius of the fan blade and the fan's rotational rate.\n3. Multiply the number of revolutions by the radius and time to find the distance traveled.\n4. Use the correct value of pi (3.14) in the calculation.\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Identify the radius of the fan blade and the fan's rotational rate.\n2. Use the formula to find the distance traveled by the point on the edge of the fan blade.\n3. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n4. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\n\nAdvice:\n\n* Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n* Always use the correct formula and units in your calculations.\n* Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n* Use pi correctly in your calculations.\n* Take your time to solve the problem step-by-step.\n"
