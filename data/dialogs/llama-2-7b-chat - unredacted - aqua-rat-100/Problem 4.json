I mistakenly used the multiplication of 16 and 17 to find the time until the trains meet again, which is not the correct approach. Instead, I should have identified the least common multiple (LCM) of 16 and 17 to find the time until the trains meet again.\n\nTo solve the problem correctly, I will use the least common multiple of 16 and 17, which is 190 minutes. Therefore, the trains will meet again in 190 minutes.\n\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
