We can start by simplifying the expression for x:\n\nx = (n2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16) / (n+ 4√n+ 4)\n\nWe know that 36 ≤ n ≤ 72, so we can substitute these values into the expression for x:\n\nx = (362 + 2√36(36 + 4) + 16) / (36 + 4√36 + 4)\n= (252 + 144 + 16) / (36 + 12 + 4)\n= 1.29\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) 28 < x < 60.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Calculation error\n* Miscalculation\n* Incorrect reasoning\n\nSolution:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to follow the steps outlined in the instructions:\n\n1.
