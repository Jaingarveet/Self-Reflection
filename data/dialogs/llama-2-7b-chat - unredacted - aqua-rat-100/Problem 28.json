The correct answer is B: 0.26.\n\nReflection:\nI calculated the probability of neither event occurring as follows:\n\nProbability of neither Stock A nor Stock B increasing in value = probability of Stock A increasing in value × probability of Stock B increasing in value\n\nProbability of Stock A increasing in value = 0.56\nProbability of Stock B increasing in value = 0.74\n\nTherefore, the probability of neither Stock A nor Stock B increasing in value is:\n\n0.56 × 0.74 = 0.39\n\nSo, the greatest value for the probability that neither of these two events will occur is 0.39, which corresponds to choice B: 0.26.\n\nI apologize for any confusion caused by my previous incorrect answer."
