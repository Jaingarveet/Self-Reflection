However, upon reviewing the problem, I realized that the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z is actually (B) 59:91.\n\nTo arrive at this answer, I used the information given in the problem that 40 grams of alloy X and 60 grams of alloy Y were mixed to form alloy Z. Since the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy X is 6:9 and in alloy Y is 7:11, the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z is:\n\n40/6 + 60/9 = 59/91\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) 59:91."
