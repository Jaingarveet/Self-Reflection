But, if Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal. How much money does each have?\nChoices:\n  A: 62, 35\n  B: 62, 34\n  C: 34, 62\n  D: 42, 62\n  E: 62, 42\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nYou are correct! Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. Arjun gives $30 to Sajal, so Sajal now has $60 left.\n2. Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, so Arjun now has $30.\n\nNow, let's use the information that Sajal has $60 left, and Arjun has $30 to find the initial amounts of money each had:\n\nSajal had $60 - $30 = $30 initially.\nArjun had $30 initially.\n\nSo, the correct answer is (C) $34, $62.\n\nGreat job!\n\nHere are some tips to help you with similar problems in the future:\n\n1. Read the problem carefully and identify the key information.\n2. Break down the problem into smaller steps and work through each step systematically.\n3. Use the information provided in the problem to find the initial amounts of money each person had.\n4. Check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n5. Double-check your answer to make sure it matches the correct answer.\n\nRemember, practice makes perfect! Keep practicing, and you'll become more confident and proficient in solving math problems.\n"
