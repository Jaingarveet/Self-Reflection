I misunderstood the question and overlooked an important detail.\n\nThe correct solution is:\n\nIf B bisects minor arc AC, then the measure of minor arc AD is equal to the difference between the measures of minor arcs AC and BD.\n\nIn this case, the measure of minor arc AC is 160°, and the measure of minor arc BD is 150°.
