I thought the problem was asking for the number of ways to choose 2 oranges from a basket of 10 oranges, which is a classic problem in combinatorics. However, the correct approach is to use the principle of permutations, as we are counting the number of ways to arrange 2 oranges from the basket.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Combinatorics\n* Permutations\n* Misapplication of principles\n\nSolution:\nTo find the number of ways to choose 2 oranges from a basket of 10 oranges, we need to use the principle of permutations. There are 10 oranges in the basket, and we need to arrange 2 of them in a particular order. Therefore, the number of ways to choose 2 oranges from the basket is:\n\n10C2 = 10 × 9 = 90\n\nInstructions:\n\n1.
