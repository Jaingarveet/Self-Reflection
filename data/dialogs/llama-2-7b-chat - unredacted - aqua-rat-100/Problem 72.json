What is the length of the other side of the yard?\nChoices:\n  A: 30 feet\n  B: 20 feet\n  C: 10 feet\n  D: 50 feet\n  E: 60 feet\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nGreat job! You correctly solved the problem step by step. Here's a breakdown of your thought process:\n\n1. You identified that the yard is rectangular and one side is 100 feet wide.\n2. You set up the equation for the area of the yard: Area = Length x Width.\n3. You substituted the known value of the width (100 feet) into the equation.\n4. You divided both sides of the equation by the width to solve for the length of the other side.\n5. You arrived at the correct answer of 30 feet for the length of the other side of the yard.\n\nExcellent work! Here are some tips to help you solve similar problems in the future:\n\n1. Always read the question carefully and identify the key information. In this case, you knew the yard was rectangular and one side was 100 feet wide.\n2. Use visual aids, such as diagrams or drawings, to help you visualize the problem and solve it more easily.\n3. Break down complex problems into smaller, more manageable steps. This will help you stay organized and avoid mistakes.\n4. Use the correct mathematical formulas and operations to solve the problem. In this case, you used the formula for the area of a rectangle (Area = Length x Width).\n5. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy. In this case, you divided both sides of the equation by the width to solve for the length of the other side, and you arrived at the correct answer of 30 feet.\n\nGreat job on this problem! Keep practicing and you'll become a math whiz in no time.\n"

Here's how I would answer the question:\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")\n\nExplanation:\nI understand that Julie's yard is rectangular, and one side is 100 feet wide. To find the length of the other side, I can use the formula for the area of a rectangle, which is Area = Length x Width.\n\nI know the area of the yard is 3,000 square feet, so I can set up the equation:\n\nArea = Length x Width\n\nI substitute the known value of the width (100 feet) into the equation:\n\n3000 = Length x 100\n\nTo solve for the length, I divide both sides of the equation by the width:\n\nLength = 3000 / 100 = 30 feet\n\nTherefore, the length of the other side of Julie's yard is 30 feet."
