I focused on the fact that most of the films that won prizes at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival also won prizes at international film festivals, but I did not consider the fact that only Canadian films are shown at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival. This led me to choose answer A, which is incorrect.\nThe correct answer is C. Some of the films that won prizes at international film festivals this year were Canadian films. This is because all of the films that won prizes at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival were Canadian films, and most of the films that won prizes at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival also won prizes at international film festivals.\nI will use this information to help me answer future questions. I will make sure to consider all of the information provided in the context, and I will not make assumptions about the information that is not provided.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
