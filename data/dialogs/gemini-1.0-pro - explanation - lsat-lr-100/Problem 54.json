However, among the gifts Hana received at her party was a recording in which she had expressed an interest. Since her brothers had planned to give her that recording, at least some of Hana's brothers must have been among the guests at Hana's birthday party after all.\nQuestion: A reasoning error in the argument is that the argument\nChoices:\n  A: disregards the possibility that a change of mind might be justified by a change in circumstances\n  B: treats the fact of someone's presence at a given event as a guarantee that that person had a legitimate reason to be at that event\n  C: uses a term that is intrinsically evaluative as though that term was purely descriptive\n  D: fails to establish that something true of some people is true of only those people\n  E: overlooks the possibility that a person's interest in one kind of thing is compatible with that person's interest in a different kind of thing\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI incorrectly identified the reasoning error in the argument. \nThe argument assumes that because Hana received a recording from her brothers, they must have been at her party. However, it is possible that they gave her the recording without attending the party. \nThe argument fails to establish that something true of some people (Hana's brothers who gave her the recording) is true of only those people (Hana's brothers who attended her party).\n"
