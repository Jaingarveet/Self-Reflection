        "content": "## Reflection on Previous Answer\n**Incorrect Answer:** C\n**Reasoning:** I mistakenly focused on the specific content of Brooks' statement rather than the overall structure of Morgenstern's argument.\n**Correct Answer:** B\n**Reasoning:** Morgenstern's argument relies on the assumption that the only risk involved in quitting is not finding another job. This assumption is tantamount to assuming the conclusion, as it essentially states that quitting is always the best option because the alternative (staying in the job) is always worse.\n**Key Takeaways:**\n* Pay close attention to the structure of arguments, not just the specific content.\n* Identify and analyze underlying assumptions, especially when they seem to be taken for granted.\n* Be wary of arguments that rely on circular reasoning or tautologies.\n**Action:** Answer(\"B\")"
