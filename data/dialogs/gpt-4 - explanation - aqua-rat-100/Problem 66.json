The sum of the ages of all the members is 250 years. \nIn an A.P., the sum of all terms (S) can be calculated using the formula S = n/2 * (2a + (n-1)d), where n is the number of terms, a is the first term, and d is the common difference. \nHere, S = 250, a = 7, and d = 0.25. We can substitute these values into the formula and solve for n.\n250 = n/2 * (2*7 + (n-1)*0.25)\nSolving this equation will give us the number of members in the club.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
