        "content": "Thought: \nLet's denote the number of newspapers the hotel buys on Monday as x. Since the hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday, it buys 2x newspapers on Sunday. The cost for Sunday newspapers is 2x * $4 = $8x. The cost for newspapers for the rest of the week (Monday to Saturday) is x * $1 * 6 = $6x. The total cost for newspapers per week is $8x + $6x = $14x. Given that the total cost per week is $210, we can set up the equation $14x = $210 and solve for x. \nAction: \nSolving the equation $14x = $210 gives x = $210 / $14 = 15. Therefore, the hotel buys 15 newspapers on Monday. \nAnswer(\"A\")"
