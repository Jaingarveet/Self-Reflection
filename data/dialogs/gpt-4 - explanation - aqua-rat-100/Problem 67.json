I incorrectly calculated the number of pita breads equivalent to [REDACTED] baguettes. I should have multiplied the number of rolls equivalent to [REDACTED] baguettes by the number of pita breads equivalent to 1 roll, not divided.\n"

So, 1 roll is equivalent to 6/2 = 3 pita breads.\nNext, we need to find the equivalent of one baguette in terms of rolls. From the problem, we know that 3 rolls are equivalent to 5 baguettes. So, 1 baguette is equivalent to 3/5 rolls.\nFinally, we need to find the equivalent of two baguettes in terms of pita breads. Since 1 baguette is equivalent to 3/5 rolls, 2 baguettes are equivalent to 2*(3/5) = 6/5 rolls. Since 1 roll is equivalent to 3 pita breads, 6/5 rolls are equivalent to (6/5)*3 = 18/5 = 3.6 pita breads.\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
