        "content": "Thought: \nEach picket is 1/2 inch wide and there are x pickets, so the total width of the pickets is 1/2x inches. \nThere are 6 inches of space between each pair of pickets, but there is no space after the last picket. So, there are (x-1) spaces, each of 6 inches, which is 6(x-1) inches.\nThe total length of the fence in inches is 1/2x + 6(x-1).\nTo convert this length to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot).\nSo, the length of the fence in feet is (1/2x + 6(x-1))/12 = (x + 6x - 6)/24 = (7x - 6)/24.\nThis simplifies to (7x/24) - (6/24) = (7x/24) - (1/4).\nThis is not one of the answer choices, so I must have made a mistake in my calculations.\nLet's try again.\nThe total length of the fence in inches is 1/2x + 6(x-1).\nThis simplifies to 1/2x + 6x - 6.\nTo convert this length to feet, we divide by 12.\nSo, the length of the fence in feet is (1/2x + 6x - 6)/12 = (13x - 12)/24.\nThis matches choice E.\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
