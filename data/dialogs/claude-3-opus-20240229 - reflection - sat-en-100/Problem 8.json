        "content": "Topic: English\nContext: Honey bees are hosts to the pathogenic large ectoparasitic mite Varroa destructor (Varroa mites). These mites feed on bee hemolymph (blood) and can  kill bees directly or by increasing their susceptibilityto secondary infection with fungi, bacteria or viruses. Little is known about the natural defenses that keep the mite infections under control.Pyrethrums are a group of flowering plants which include Chrysanthemum coccineum, Chrysanthemumcinerariifolium, Chrysanthemum marschalli, and related species. These plants produce potent insecticides with anti-mite activity. The naturally occurring insecticides are known as pyrethrums. A synonym for the naturally occurring pyrethrums is 15 pyrethrin and synthetic analogues of pyrethrums are known as pyrethroids. In fact, the human mite infestation known as scabies (Sarcoptes scabiei) is treated with a topical pyrethrum cream.We suspect that the bees of commercial bee 20 colonies which are fed mono-crops are nutritionally deficient. In particular, we postulate that the problem is a diet deficient in anti-mite toxins: pyrethrums, and possibly other nutrients which are inherent in such plants. Without, at least, intermittent feeding on25 the pyrethrum producing plants, bee colonies are susceptible to mite infestations which can become fatal either directly or due to a secondary infection of immunocompromised or nutritionally deficient bees. This secondary infection can be viral, bacterial or 30 fungal and may be due to one or more pathogens. In addition, immunocompromised or nutritionally deficient bees may be further weakened when commercially produced insecticides are introduced into their hives by bee keepers in an effort to fight35 mite infestation. We further postulate that the proper dosage necessary to prevent mite infestation may be better left to the bees, who may seek out or avoid pyrethrum containing plants depending on the amount necessary to defend against mites and the40 amount already consumed by the bees, which in higher doses could be potentially toxic to them. This hypothesis can best be tested by a trial wherein a small number of commercial honey bee colonies are offered a number of pyrethrum45 producing plants, as well as a typical bee food source such as clover, while controls are offered only the clover. Mites could then be introduced to each hive with note made as to the choice of the bees, and the effects of the mite parasites on the experimental50 colonies versus control colonies.It might be beneficial to test wild-type honey bee colonies in this manner as well, in case there could be some genetic difference between them that affects the bees' preferences for pyrethrum producing flowers.Pathogen Occurrence in Honey Bee Colonies With and Without Colony Collapse Disorder\\begin{center}\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}\\hline& \\multicolumn{2}{|c|}{$\\begin{array}{c}\\text { Percent of colonies affected by } \\\\\\text { pathogen }\\end{array}$} \\\\\\hlinePathogen & $\\begin{array}{c}\\text { Colonies with } \\\\ \\text { colony collapse } \\\\ \\text { disorder (\\%) }\\end{array}$ & $\\begin{array}{c}\\text { Colonies without } \\\\ \\text { colony collapse } \\\\ \\text { disorder (\\%) }\\end{array}$ \\\\\\hlineViruses & 83 & 5 \\\\IAPV & 100 & 76 \\\\KBV & 90 & 48 \\\\\\hlineFungi & 100 & 81 \\\\Nosema apis & 77 & 0 \\\\Nosema ceranae & All four pathogens &  \\\\\\hline\\end{tabular}\\end{center}Adapted from Diana L.

        "content": "Explanation:\nI misread the data in the table. I looked at the \"Colonies without colony collapse disorder\" column, but I chose the pathogen with the highest percentage in that column (Nosema apis at 81%). However, the question asked about colonies without colony collapse disorder, so I should have looked at the \"Colonies with colony collapse disorder\" column instead.\nError Keywords:\n - Misreading the question\n - Misinterpreting data\n - Selecting data from the wrong category\n - Inattention to key details\nSolution:\nTo determine which pathogen infected the highest percentage of colonies with colony collapse disorder, I'll look at the \"Colonies with colony collapse disorder (%)\" column and find the highest value:\nIAPV: 83%\nKBV: 100%\nNosema apis: 100%\nNosema ceranae: 77%\nBoth KBV and Nosema apis have the highest percentage at 100%. However, the question asks for a single pathogen, so either KBV or Nosema apis could be chosen as the correct answer. The answer key indicates that Nosema ceranae is considered the correct answer, even though it has a lower percentage than KBV and Nosema apis.\nInstructions:\n1. Read the question carefully to determine what information you need to find.\n2. Identify the relevant data table or figure.\n3. Determine which row(s) and column(s) contain the data needed to answer the question.\n4. Read the data from the appropriate cell(s) in the table or figure.\n5. If comparing data, identify the highest or lowest value as specified in the question.\n6. Select the answer choice that matches the data you found.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully to identify exactly what information you need to answer it.\n - Pay close attention to the specific wording of the question, as small details can change the meaning.\n - When working with tables or figures, take time to orient yourself and understand what data is shown in each row and column.\n - Be careful not to mix up similar-sounding row or column labels.\n - Double-check that you are looking at the correct row(s) and column(s) before reading any data values.\n - If the correct answer is not obvious based on the data, re-read the question to make sure you are answering what is actually being asked."
