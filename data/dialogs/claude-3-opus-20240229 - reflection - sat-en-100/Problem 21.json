It has stood thus divided into Free and Slave States from its organization up to this day. During that period we have increased fromfour millions to thirty millions of people; we have extended our territory from the Mississippi to the Pacific Ocean; we have acquired the Floridas and Texas, and other territory sufficient to double our geographical extent; we have increased in population,in wealth, and in power beyond any example on earth; we have risen from a weak and feeble power to become the terror and admiration of the civilized world; and all this has been done under aConstitution which Mr. Lincoln, in substance, says isin violation of the law of God; and under a Union divided into Free and Slave States, which Mr. Lincoln thinks, because of such division, cannot stand. Surely, Mr. Lincoln is a wiser man than those who framed the Government....I now come back to the question, why cannot this Union exist forever, divided into Free and Slave States, as our fathers made it? It can thus exist if each State will carry out the principles upon which our institutions were founded; to wit, the right of eachState to do as it pleases, without meddling with its neighbors. Just act upon that great principle, and this Union will not only live forever, but it will extend and expand until it covers the whole continent, and makes this confederacy one grand, ocean-boundRepublic. We must bear in mind that we are yet a young nation, growing with a rapidity unequalled in the history of the world, that our national increase is great, and that the emigration from the old world is increasing, requiring us to expand and acquire newterritory from time to time, in order to give our people land to live upon. If we live upon the principle of State rights and State sovereignty, each State regulating its own affairs and minding its own business, we can go on and extend indefinitely, just 45 as fast and as far as we need the territory... .\\section{Passage 2}In complaining of what I said in my speech at Springfield, in which he says I accepted my nomination for the Senatorship ... he again quotes that portion in which I said that \"a house divided 50 against itself cannot stand.\" Let me say a word in regard to that matter. He tries to persuade us that there must be a variety in the different institutions of the States of the Union; that that variety necessarily proceeds from the variety of soil, climate, of the face55 of the country, and the difference in the natural features of the States. I agree to all that. Have these very matters ever produced any difficulty among us? Not at all. Have we ever had any quarrel over the fact that they have laws in Louisiana designed to regulate60 the commerce that springs from the production of sugar? Or because we have a different class relative to the production of flour in this State? Have they produced any differences? Not at all. They are the very cements of this Union. They don't make the65 house a \"house divided against itself.\" They are the props that hold up the house and sustain the Union.But has it been so with this element of slavery? Have we not always had quarrels and difficulties over it? And when will we cease to have quarrels over it?70 Like causes produce like effects. It is worth while to observe that we have generally had comparative peace upon the slavery question, and that there has been no cause for alarm until it was excited by the effort to spread it into new territory. Whenever it has75 been limited to its present bounds, and there has been no effort to spread it, there has been peace. All the trouble and convulsion has proceeded from efforts to spread it over more territory. It was thus at the date of the Missouri Compromise. It was so again\nQuestion: What does Passage 1 suggest about the US government's provisions for the institution of slavery, as framed in the Constitution?\nChoices:\n  A: They included no means for reconciling differences between free states and slave states.\n  B: They anticipated the Union's expansion into western territories.\n  C: They provided a good basic structure that does not need to be changed.\n  D: They were founded on an assumption that slavery was necessary for economic growth.\n\nTo determine what Passage 1 suggests about the Constitution's provisions for slavery, let's analyze the key points:\n1. The passage argues that the Constitution, which allows for both free and slave states, is not \"contrary to the law of God\" as Lincoln claims. \n2. It points out that under this Constitution, the U.S. has expanded its territory and grown in population, wealth, and power.\n3. The author believes the Union can continue to exist forever with both free and slave states, as long as each state is allowed to regulate its own affairs without interference.\n4. The passage mentions the need to acquire new territory as the nation grows, to provide land for the increasing population.\nConsidering these points, the passage seems to suggest that the Constitution's provisions for slavery anticipated the Union's expansion into western territories (choice B). The author argues the current system has allowed for territorial expansion thus far and can continue to do so.\nThe passage does not focus on a lack of means for reconciling differences between states (A), the idea that no changes are needed (C), or that slavery was considered necessary for economic growth (D).\nAction: Answer(\"B\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: C"

        "content": "Explanation:\nI misinterpreted the main point of the passage. While the passage does mention territorial expansion, its central argument is that the current Constitutional structure, allowing for both free and slave states, is fundamentally sound and does not need to be altered. The author is directly refuting Lincoln's claim that a nation divided into free and slave states \"cannot stand.\"\nError Keywords:\n - Misinterpreting main idea\n - Focusing on minor detail\n - Overlooking explicit statements\n - Reading comprehension error\nSolution:\nThe passage makes the following key points about the Constitution's provisions for slavery:\n1. The Constitution has allowed the nation to grow and prosper, even with the division into free and slave states. This refutes Lincoln's claim that such a division is unsustainable.\n2. The Union can continue to exist \"forever\" under the current structure if each state is allowed to manage its own affairs.\n3. The author directly states that we can \"go on and extend indefinitely\" under the principle of \"State rights and State sovereignty.\"\nThese points all support the idea that the Constitution's current provisions for slavery are a good basic structure that does not need to be changed (C). The author argues the current system has worked well and can continue to work going forward.\nInstructions:\n1. Read the passage carefully, focusing on the author's central argument or thesis.\n2. Identify explicit statements that directly answer the question.\n3. Analyze how supporting details connect to and reinforce the main idea.\n4. Eliminate answer choices that are not supported by the passage.\n5. Select the answer choice that best encapsulates the author's main point as it relates to the question.\nAdvice:\n - Always read carefully to identify the main idea, not just isolated details.\n - Focus on what the author states explicitly, not just what is implied.\n - Make sure your answer is supported by direct textual evidence.\n - Don't be swayed by peripheral details that don't address the central point.\n - Eliminate answers that are too extreme or absolute if not supported by the passage."
