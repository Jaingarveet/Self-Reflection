What is the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee that the yearly profit (revenue from sales minus production costs) will be at least $626,400 ?\nChoices:\n  A: 226\n  B: 230\n  C: 240\n  D: 260\n  E: 280\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nThe yearly profit should be at least $626,400, which is the sum of the production cost and the desired profit.\nThe production cost is 420 x $110 x 12 = $554,400.\nThe desired profit is $626,400 - $554,400 = $72,000.\nThe revenue from selling 5040 units at the minimum selling price per component is 5040 x P, where P is the minimum selling price per component.\nWe need to find P such that 5040P >= $1,180,800, which is the sum of the production cost and the desired profit.\nP >= $1,180,800 / 5040 = $234.\nTherefore, the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee that the yearly profit will be at least $626,400 is $234.\nThe closest answer choice is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED], which is not the exact answer but is the closest to the correct answer.\nKeywords:\n- Profit\n- Production cost\n- Revenue\n- Selling price\n- Units produced\n- Yearly profit\n"
