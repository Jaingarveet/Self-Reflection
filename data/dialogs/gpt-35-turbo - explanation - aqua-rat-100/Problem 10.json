What then is the length of the space shuttle?\nChoices:\n  A: 50 m\n  B: 75 m\n  C: 100 m\n  D: 125 m\n  E: 150 m\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI correctly calculated the speed of the space shuttle and the distance it traveled during the 5 seconds. However, I made a mistake in calculating the length of the space shuttle. I subtracted the distance traveled during the 5 seconds from the total distance traveled during the 40 seconds, which is incorrect. The distance traveled during the 5 seconds is the distance of the space shuttle itself, not the distance it traveled. To find the length of the space shuttle, we need to subtract the distance it traveled during the 40 seconds from the total distance it traveled during the 40 seconds.\n"
