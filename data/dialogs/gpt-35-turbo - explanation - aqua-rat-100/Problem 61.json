        "content": "Thought:\nLet's call the distance between A and B \"d\". \nWe know that Kevin drove from A to B at a constant speed of 70 mph, and then from B to A at a constant speed of 90 mph. \nLet's call the time it took Kevin to drive from A to B \"t1\", and the time it took him to drive from B to A \"t2\". \nWe also know that exactly 3 hours before the end of his trip, he was still approaching B, only 70 miles away from it. \nThis means that at time (t1 + t2 - 3), Kevin was 70 miles away from B. \nUsing the formula distance = rate x time, we can set up two equations: d = 70t1 and d = 90t2. \nWe can also set up a third equation using the fact that at time (t1 + t2 - 3), Kevin was 70 miles away from B: \nd - 70 = 90(t1 + t2 - 3). \nNow we have three equations and three unknowns (d, t1, and t2), which we can solve for. \nSimplifying the third equation, we get d - 70 = 90t1 + 90t2 - 270. \nSubstituting d = 70t1 and d = 90t2 into this equation, we get: \n70t1 - 70 = 90t1 + 90t2 - 270. \nSimplifying this equation, we get: \n20t1 - 90t2 = 200. \nWe also know that t1 + t2 = (total time of trip) - 3. \nLet's call the total time of the trip \"T\". \nWe know that distance = rate x time, so we can set up another equation: \nd = 70t1 + 90t2. \nSubstituting d = 70t1 and d = 90t2 into this equation, we get: \nd = 70t1 + 90t2 = 70t1 + 70t2 + 20t2 = 70(t1 + t2) + 20t2 = 70(T - 3) + 20t2. \nNow we have four equations and four unknowns (d, t1, t2, and T), which we can solve for. \nSimplifying the last equation, we get: \nd = 70(T - 3) + 20t2 = 70T - 210 + 20t2. \nSubstituting this into the second equation (d = 90t2), we get: \n90t2 = 70T - 210 + 20t2. \nSimplifying this equation, we get: \n70t2 = 70T - 210. \nSubstituting this into the first equation (20t1 - 90t2 = 200), we get: \n20t1 - (70T - 210) = 200. \nSimplifying this equation, we get: \n20t1 - 70T + 210 = 200. \nSubtracting 210 from both sides, we get: \n20t1 - 70T = -10. \nDividing both sides by 10, we get: \n2t1 - 7T = -1. \nWe also know that t1 + t2 = T - 3, so we can substitute t2 = T - 3 - t1 into the equation 90t2 = 70T - 210 to get: \n90(T - 3 - t1) = 70T - 210. \nSimplifying this equation, we get: \n90T - 270 - 90t1 = 70T - 210. \nSubtracting 70T from both sides, we get: \n20T - 270 - 90t1 = -210. \nAdding 270 to both sides, we get: \n20T - 90t1 = 60. \nMultiplying both sides by 2, we get: \n40T - 180t1 = 120. \nNow we have two equations and two unknowns (2t1 - 7T = -1 and 40T - 180t1 = 120), which we can solve for. \nMultiplying the first equation by 20, we get: \n40t1 - 140T = -20. \nAdding this to the second equation (40T - 180t1 = 120), we get: \n-40t1 = 100. \nDividing both sides by -40, we get: \nt1 = -2.5. \nSubstituting this into the equation 2t1 - 7T = -1, we get: \n2(-2.5) - 7T = -1. \nSimplifying this equation, we get: \n-5 - 7T = -1. \nAdding 5 to both sides, we get: \n-7T = 4. \nDividing both sides by -7, we get: \nT = -4/7. \nThis is a negative value, which doesn't make sense in the context of the problem. \nTherefore, there must be no solution to this problem. \nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
