Carefully read and understand the original statement.\n2. Identify the key concepts and ideas in the statement.\n3. Analyze each option and compare it to the key concepts in the statement.\n4. Look for options that directly contradict or deviate from the original statement.\n5. Consider broader interpretations and implications of the original statement.\n6. Choose the option that is the least logically connected to the original statement.\nAdvice:\n - Pay close attention to the wording and specific language used in the original statement.\n - Identify the main idea or principle conveyed by the statement.\n - Analyze each option individually and compare it to the core concept of the statement.\n - Look for options that introduce new ideas or concepts not present in the original statement.\n - Consider the logical implications and consequences of the original statement.\n - Choose the option that is the least logically consistent with the original statement.\n"
