(1) F is adjacent to H and is on the north side of H.(2) I and E are adjacent.(3) G is somewhere in the north of F.\nQuestion: If it is found that G is the northernmost island, how many possible arrangements are there for this group of islands?\nChoices:\n  A: 2\n  B: 3\n  C: 4\n  D: 5\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI incorrectly assumed that the given information only allowed for one possible arrangement of the islands. I failed to consider the possibility of different arrangements within the constraints provided.\nError Keywords:\n- Oversimplification\n- Lack of consideration of alternative possibilities\n- Misinterpretation of constraints\nSolution:\nG is the northernmost island.\nF is adjacent to H and is on the north side of H.\nI and E are adjacent.\nBased on these constraints, there are four possible arrangements:\n1. G-F-H-E-I\n[REDACTED]. G-H-F-E-I\n[REDACTED]. G-F-E-H-I\n[REDACTED]. G-E-F-H-I\nInstructions:\n1. Carefully analyze all given information and identify the constraints they impose on the possible arrangements.\n[REDACTED]. Consider all possible arrangements that satisfy the given constraints.\n[REDACTED]. Do not jump to conclusions based on limited information.\n[REDACTED]. Systematically explore all possibilities within the given constraints.\n[REDACTED]. Double-check your analysis to ensure that you have not overlooked any valid arrangements.\nAdvice:\n- When solving logic problems, pay close attention to the details and implications of each piece of information provided.\n- Consider all possible scenarios that satisfy the given constraints, even if they seem unlikely at first glance.\n- Avoid making assumptions or jumping to conclusions without sufficient evidence.\n- Use a systematic approach to explore all possibilities and eliminate those that violate the given constraints.\n- Double-check your analysis and reasoning to ensure that you have not made any errors in your logic.\n"
