Read each sentence carefully and identify the meaning of each word in context.\n2. Do not assume the meaning of a word based on its position in a sentence.\n3. Look for clues in other sentences that may provide additional context.\n4. Consider all possible interpretations of each word before making a decision.\n5. Choose the answer that is most consistent with all of the information provided.\nAdvice:\n - Be aware of the potential for misinterpretations, especially when dealing with unfamiliar languages or contexts.\n - Always consider all possible interpretations of a word or phrase before making a decision.\n - Look for clues and context in other parts of the text to help you understand the meaning of individual words.\n - Do not rely on assumptions or guesses when interpreting information.\n - Be cautious when making inferences or drawing conclusions based on limited information.\n"
