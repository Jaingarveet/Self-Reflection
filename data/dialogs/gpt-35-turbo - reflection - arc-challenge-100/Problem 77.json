        "content": "Topic: Science\nQuestion: Sheep Challenge Evolution A species of sheep lives on the Scottish island of Hirta. Hirta has plenty of grass for the sheep to eat, and no natural predators of the sheep live on the island. Some sheep have dark wool, and some have light wool. The sheep with dark wool tend to be much larger and stronger than the sheep with light wool. However, researchers have found that in the last 20 years, the sheep with light wool have increased in number. Usually, strength and size help animals survive and breed. A new sheep predator is introduced to the island. Which change to the sheep population will most likely occur first?\nChoices:\n  A: a decrease in the population of sheep with dark wool\n  B: a decrease in the population of sheep with light wool\n  C: an increase in the population of sheep with dark wool\n  D: an increase in the population of sheep with light wool\n\nThought:\nThe sheep with dark wool are larger and stronger, which usually helps animals survive and breed. However, the sheep with light wool have increased in number in the last 20 years, which suggests that they have some advantage over the sheep with dark wool. When a new predator is introduced, the sheep with light wool may have an advantage over the sheep with dark wool.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: B"

However, the question states that the sheep with dark wool are larger and stronger, which usually helps animals survive and breed. Therefore, the sheep with dark wool are more likely to survive the introduction of a new predator. The increase in the population of sheep with light wool in the last 20 years may be due to other factors, such as changes in the environment or breeding patterns.\nError Keywords:\n - Assumption error\n - Misinterpretation error\n - Logical error\nSolution:\nThe sheep with dark wool are larger and stronger, which usually helps animals survive and breed. Therefore, the sheep with dark wool are more likely to survive the introduction of a new predator. The increase in the population of sheep with light wool in the last 20 years may be due to other factors, such as changes in the environment or breeding patterns. When a new predator is introduced, the sheep with light wool are more likely to be targeted and killed, which will result in a decrease in their population.\nInstructions:\n1.
