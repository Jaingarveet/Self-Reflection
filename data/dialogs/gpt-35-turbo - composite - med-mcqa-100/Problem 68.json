However, [REDACTED] is the shortest acting skeletal muscle relaxant. \nThe gap in my knowledge was in the mechanism of action and duration of action of different skeletal muscle relaxants. \nError Keywords:\n - Knowledge gap\n - Mechanism of action\n - Duration of action\nSolution:\nThe shortest acting skeletal muscle relaxant is [REDACTED].\n[REDACTED] has a rapid onset and short duration of action.\n[REDACTED] has a relatively short duration of action but not as short as [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n1. Understand the mechanism of action of different skeletal muscle relaxants.\n2. Understand the duration of action of different skeletal muscle relaxants.\n3. Identify the skeletal muscle relaxant with the shortest duration of action.\n4. Double-check your answer to ensure accuracy.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always review your knowledge of the topic before answering the question.\n - Always double-check your answer to ensure accuracy.\n - Remember that the shortest acting skeletal muscle relaxant is expected to have a rapid onset and short duration of action.\n"
