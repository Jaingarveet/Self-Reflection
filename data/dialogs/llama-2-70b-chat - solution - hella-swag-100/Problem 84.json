It's not to make the eggplant taste salty, but to remove excess moisture and bitterness from the eggplant.\n\nWith that in mind, the correct answer is B: Remove the eggplant from the water and allow it to sit in the salted water for 30 minutes. Then remove from the water and wring out the excess liquid.\n\nThis step allows the eggplant to absorb the salt and water, making it less bitter and easier to fry. It also helps to remove excess moisture, which can make the fritters too soggy.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
