[step] Depending on your guests' tastes and how formal the event is, and what your menu calls for, you may need more napkins to help hold the tablecloth together.\n  B: [title] Place the napkin on the left side of the placemat. [step] Fold the napkin in halves or fourths, depending on the napkin.\n  C: You should also have enough placemats that are about 2 feet (0.91 m) off the ground.

The correct answer is B: Place the napkin on the left side of the placemat.\n\nHere's my thought process:\n\n* The question asks for the most likely completion to the text, which means we need to choose the option that best fits the context and purpose of the text.\n* The text is about setting a table, specifically putting down placemats and napkins.\n* Option A doesn't make sense because it talks about placing more cloth napkins around the table, which isn't related to the topic of setting a table.\n* Option C is also not relevant because it talks about setting the tablecloth right next to the chairs, which isn't the next step in setting a table.\n* Option D is not the best choice because it talks about asking for placemats with more flair, which may not be necessary for a formal dinner setting.\n* Option B, on the other hand, is the most relevant and useful option. It tells us where to place the napkin, which is an important part of setting a table.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: Place the napkin on the left side of the placemat."
