[step] The chemical ingredients in thermacare wraps need to be exposed to air to activate. Once exposed to air, the wrap should immediately begin heating, reaching its maximum temperature in about half an hour.\nChoices:\n  A: Attaching the wrap too early will limit its exposure to air, causing it to heat more slowly. [substeps] Do not microwave the wrap, or attempt to speed up the warming by heating it in any other fashion.\n  B: [substeps] There are a few precautions you must take regarding opening the wrap before using a thermacare on your entire body when it is hot outside. You must also take steps: stand close to a wall with plenty of space in between the heat wrap and the wall and ceiling.\n  C: Make sure that the wraps are not exposed to the heat coming from the candles/fans/jars, through the open oven door, or in the freezer.

The correct answer is (B) There are a few precautions you must take regarding opening the wrap before using a thermacare on your entire body when it is hot outside. You must also take steps: stand close to a wall with plenty of space in between the heat wrap and the wall and ceiling.\n\nMy reasoning for this answer is that the passage states that the chemical ingredients in thermacare wraps need to be exposed to air to activate, and that the wrap should immediately begin heating, reaching its maximum temperature in about half an hour. Therefore, it is important to open the wrap in a well-ventilated area, and to take precautions to ensure that the wrap is not exposed to heat from other sources, such as candles, fans, jars, or the oven.\n\nAdditionally, the passage advises against microwaving the wrap or attempting to speed up the warming process in any other fashion, which suggests that the wrap should be allowed to heat up naturally through exposure to air.\n\nI hope this answer is correct. Please let me know if there is any further information I can provide to support my response."
