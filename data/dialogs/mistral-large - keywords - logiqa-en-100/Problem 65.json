I thought the inconsistency was that strict investigation of drunk driving was not reducing traffic accidents, but the actual inconsistency was that the incidence of traffic accidents was similar in cities where drunk driving was strictly investigated and those who do not. I also incorrectly reasoned that choice A was the correct answer because it mentioned severe investigations of drunk driving, but it did not explain why traffic accidents were still occurring at a similar rate. The correct answer is choice B because it explains that the city that implements strict investigation of drunk driving has not eliminated drunk driving, which could be the reason why traffic accidents are still occurring at a similar rate."
