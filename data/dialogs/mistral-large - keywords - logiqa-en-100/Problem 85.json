I also made a logical reasoning error by not considering the conditions for papers G and H in relation to paper J. Lastly, I misunderstood the conditions for papers G and K, thinking that if G is not used, then K cannot be used, when in fact it is the opposite.\n\nThought:\nSince paper E cannot be used (condition 4), paper K must also not be used (condition 1). This means that paper J can be used since it does not conflict with any other conditions. If paper J is used, then paper G and H cannot be used (condition 2). Therefore, the only option that must be true is that no paper J, but paper K is false.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
