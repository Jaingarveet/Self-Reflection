I also made a misinterpretation error by interpreting the conclusion as stating that image thinking methods are the only way to achieve major scientific breakthroughs, rather than one possible way. To avoid these errors in the future, I will focus on identifying the underlying assumption in the conclusion and interpreting it in the context of the given information."
