I assumed that the human resources department and the sales department were adjacent because they were mentioned together in the first piece of information, but this was not stated explicitly. I also misinterpreted the information about the administration department being above the planning department but below the human resources department. I incorrectly assumed that this meant the administration department was on the floor immediately above the planning department and immediately below the human resources department, but this was not stated explicitly either. I will be more careful in the future to interpret the information given accurately and not make assumptions."
