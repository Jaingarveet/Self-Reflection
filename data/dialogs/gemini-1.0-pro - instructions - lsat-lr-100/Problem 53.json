I focused on the fact that the props and costumes are too old and fragile for use in a performance, but I did not consider the fact that Wexell claims that such items have no artistic significance outside the context of a performance.\nTo answer this question correctly, I need to identify the main point of Wexell's argument and then determine whether Robinson's response addresses that point.\nWexell's main point is that the museum wasted its money in purchasing props and costumes from famous stage productions because such items have no artistic significance outside the context of a performance. Robinson's response does not address this point. Instead, Robinson argues that the museum did not waste its money because displaying the props and costumes is the only way of making them available to the public. This is a non sequitur. Even if displaying the props and costumes is the only way of making them available to the public, that does not mean that they have artistic significance outside the context of a performance.\nTherefore, the reasoning in Robinson's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it gives reasons that do not address the point made in Wexell's argument.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
