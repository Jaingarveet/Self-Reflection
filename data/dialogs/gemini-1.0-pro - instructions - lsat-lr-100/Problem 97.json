        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Editorial: Cell-phone usage on buses and trains is annoying to other passengers. This suggests that recent proposals to allow use of cell phones on airplanes are ill-advised. Cell-phone use would be far more upsetting on airplanes than it is on buses and trains. Airline passengers are usually packed in tightly. And if airline passengers are offended by the cell-phone excesses of their seatmates, they often cannot move to another seat.\nQuestion: Which one of the following most accurately describes the role played in the editorial's argument by the statement that cell-phone use would be far more upsetting on airplanes than it is on buses and trains?\nChoices:\n  A: It is the main conclusion of the argument.\n  B: It is a claim that the argument tries to rebut.\n  C: It is a premise that indirectly supports the main conclusion of the argument by supporting a premise for that conclusion.\n  D: It is a conclusion for which support is provided and that itself is used in turn to directly support the argument's main conclusion.\n  E: It provides background information that plays no role in the reasoning in the argument.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the main conclusion of the argument.\n2. Identify the premises that support the main conclusion.\n3. Identify the conclusions that are supported by the premises and that themselves support the main conclusion.\n4. Identify the claims that are not premises, conclusions, or supporting information.\n5. Determine the role that each claim plays in the argument.\n"

However, the statement is not a premise because it does not provide direct support for the main conclusion.\n**Correct Answer:** D\n**Reasoning:** The statement \"cell-phone use would be far more upsetting on airplanes than it is on buses and trains\" is a conclusion that is supported by the argument. This conclusion is then used to directly support the main conclusion that recent proposals to allow cell-phone use on airplanes are ill-advised.\n**Explanation:**\n1. **Main Conclusion:** Recent proposals to allow cell-phone use on airplanes are ill-advised.\n2. **Premises:**\n    - Cell-phone usage on buses and trains is annoying to other passengers.\n    - Cell-phone use would be far more upsetting on airplanes than it is on buses and trains.\n3. **Conclusions that support the main conclusion:**\n    - Cell-phone use on airplanes would be disruptive and annoying to passengers.\n4. **Claims that are not premises, conclusions, or supporting information:**\n    - None\n5. **Role of each claim:**\n    - The first premise provides direct support for the main conclusion.\n    - The second premise provides support for the conclusion that cell-phone use on airplanes would be disruptive and annoying to passengers. This conclusion, in turn, directly supports the main conclusion.\n**Action:** Answer(\"D\")"
