It suggests that hitting a low point can be a turning point to aim higher, and to stop caring about criticism in the short-term for some relief.\n2. Looking at the answer choices:\n   A) This choice continues the theme of not letting money or others' opinions control you, and believing you can do better. It fits well with the given text.\n   B) Mentions things getting harder over time, which doesn't quite fit the more optimistic tone of the original text about aiming higher after hitting bottom. Looking at what others like also seems off-topic.\n   C) The mention of \"jumping from top to bottom like a desperate schoolgirl\" is nonsensical and doesn't align with the rest of the text.\n   D) Giving notice to someone who deserves it is reasonable advice, but doesn't directly follow from the preceding text about not caring what others think. The mention of a \"healthy and productive life\" also introduces a new idea.\n3. Choice A is the only one that logically and tonally continues the flow of the original text. The other choices either introduce unrelated ideas or don't make sense in context.\nTherefore, the best answer is A.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
