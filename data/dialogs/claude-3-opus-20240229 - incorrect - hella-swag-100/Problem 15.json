Choice A mentions setting the glasses on the table and panning over them. This doesn't seem directly related to the lemonade making process.\n3. Choice B says the glasses are filled with ice and poured afterwards. Adding ice to hot lemonade and then pouring it makes sense as a next step to chill the lemonade.\n4. Choice C mentions filling the glasses with lemonade, vegetables and honey mustard. Vegetables and honey mustard are not typical lemonade ingredients. \n5. Choice D talks about pouring the contents into wooden bowls with a knife. Transferring to bowls with a knife is not a logical next step for lemonade.\nConsidering the lemonade making process, choice B about adding ice and then pouring the lemonade is the most reasonable next step after adding hot water and stirring.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
