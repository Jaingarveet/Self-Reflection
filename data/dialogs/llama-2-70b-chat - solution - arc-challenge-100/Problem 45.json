If the astronaut has a mass of about 84 kilograms, which are the approximate weight and mass of the astronaut when standing on the Earth?\nChoices:\n  A: 31 pounds and 14 kilograms\n  B: 31 pounds and 84 kilograms\n  C: 186 pounds and 14 kilograms\n  D: 186 pounds and 84 kilograms\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\nThe weight of an object on the moon is about one-sixth of its weight on Earth, because the moon has only about one-sixth of the Earth's gravity.\nSo, the weight of the astronaut on the moon is about 31/6 = 5 pounds.\nThe mass of the astronaut is not affected by the location, so it remains at 84 kilograms.\nThe weight of the astronaut on Earth would be 5 x 6 = 30 pounds.\n"
