This process is irreversible, meaning the wood cannot be restored to its original state. However, the energy in the wood is not destroyed; it is transformed into other forms, such as heat and light.\n"

This process is irreversible, meaning the wood cannot be restored to its original state. However, the energy in the wood is not destroyed; it is transformed into other forms, such as heat and light. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) The energy in the wood is transformed.\n\nReflection:\nMy previous answer was incorrect because I mistakenly believed that the energy in the wood was destroyed during the burning process. However, upon reflection, I realized that the energy is actually transformed into other forms, making answer (D) the correct choice."
