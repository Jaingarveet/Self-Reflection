Instead, the force of friction acts on the car, causing it to slow down and decrease in speed. The forces influencing the car are not balanced, as the force of friction is greater than the force of gravity, causing the car to slow down. Therefore, the correct answer is choice C: The forces influencing the car are not balanced."
