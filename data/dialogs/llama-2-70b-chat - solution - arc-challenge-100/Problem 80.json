[REDACTED] metal spoon is used to occasionally stir the soup.\n\nThe heat from the stove burner is transferred to the pan through radiation and conduction. The pan is heated by convection, as the heat from the burner causes the molecules in the pan to move and collide, transferring energy to the surrounding molecules.\n\nThe soup is heated by convection as well, as the hot molecules in the pan transfer energy to the surrounding molecules in the soup. The metal spoon is not heated by convection, as it is not in direct contact with the hot pan or soup.\n"

The correct answer is option B, \"heating the soup,\" as the hot molecules in the pan transfer energy to the surrounding molecules in the soup through convection."
