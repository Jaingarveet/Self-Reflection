Since then the rate has been once every hour. The less frequently cabin air is replenished in a plane in flight, the higher the level of carbon dioxide in that plane and the easier it is for airborne illnesses to be spread.\nQuestion: Which one of the following is most strongly supported by the information above?\nChoices:\n  A: In 1985 there was a loosening of regulations concerning cabin air in commercial airline flights.\n  B: People who fly today are more likely to contract airborne illnesses than were people who flew prior to 1985.\n  C: Low levels of carbon dioxide in cabin air make it impossible for airborne illnesses to spread.\n  D: In 1980 the rate at which the cabin air was replenished in commercial airliners was sufficient to protect passengers from the effects of carbon dioxide buildup.\n  E: In 1980 the level of carbon dioxide in the cabin air on a two-hour commercial airline flight was lower than it is today on a similar flight.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nError Keywords:\n - Assumption error\n - Causal reasoning error\n - Proportional reasoning error\n"

I incorrectly assumed that because the rate of cabin air replenishment was reduced in 1985, this must have led to an increase in airborne illnesses.\n* **Solution:** I need to carefully consider all of the information provided in the context and avoid making assumptions that are not explicitly stated.\n* **Correct Answer:** The correct answer is **E: In 1980 the level of carbon dioxide in the cabin air on a two-hour commercial airline flight was lower than it is today on a similar flight.** This is because the context states that the rate of cabin air replenishment was reduced from once every 30 minutes to once every hour in 1985. This means that the air in the cabin is now replenished less frequently, which would lead to a higher level of carbon dioxide.\n**Action:** Answer(\"E\")"
