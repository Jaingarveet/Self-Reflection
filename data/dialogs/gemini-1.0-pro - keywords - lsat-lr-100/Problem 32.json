On other occasions, however, the same party has claimed that the government should not increase spending on education. So this party's policy is clearly inconsistent.\nQuestion: The argument in the editorial depends on assuming which one of the following?\nChoices:\n  A: It is inconsistent for a legislator both to claim that increasing spending on education is a worthy goal and to vote against increasing spending on education.\n  B: A consistent course of action in educational policy is usually the course of action that will reduce spending on education in the long run.\n  C: Even if a goal is a morally good one, one should not necessarily try to achieve it.\n  D: A consistent political policy does not hold that an action that comprises a worthy goal should not be performed.\n  E: Members of one political party never have inconsistent views on how to best approach a political issue.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nError Keywords:\n- Misinterpretation of the editorial's argument\n- Incorrect assumption about the basis of the editorial's criticism\n"

This is because the editorial criticizes the party for holding these two contradictory positions. \nThe other answer choices are incorrect because they do not accurately reflect the editorial's argument. \n* Choice B is incorrect because the editorial does not discuss the long-term effects of different educational policies.\n* Choice C is incorrect because the editorial does not discuss whether or not increasing spending on education is a morally good goal.\n* Choice D is incorrect because the editorial does criticize the party for holding an inconsistent policy.\n* Choice E is incorrect because the editorial does not discuss the views of other political parties. \n"
