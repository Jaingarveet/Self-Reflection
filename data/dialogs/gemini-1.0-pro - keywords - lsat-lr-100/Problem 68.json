This information would help to determine whether the high number of registered cocker spaniels in Flynn Heights is a significant factor in the likelihood of finding a stray cocker spaniel in the area. If cocker spaniels are more likely to stray than other breeds, then the high number of registered cocker spaniels in Flynn Heights could explain the high number of stray cocker spaniels found in the area. However, if cocker spaniels are not more likely to stray than other breeds, then the high number of stray cocker spaniels in Flynn Heights could be due to other factors, such as the presence of a dog park or a high number of pet owners in the area."
