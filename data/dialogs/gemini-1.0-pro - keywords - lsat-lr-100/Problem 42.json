Such epithets often seem abusive, are difficult to prove, and rarely help the group reach a resolution. Those who wish to make such an accusation stick, however, should choose \"unyielding,\" because one can always appeal to the fact that the accused has not yielded; obviously if one acknowledges that a person has not yielded, then one cannot deny that the person is unyielding, at least on this issue.\nQuestion: Which one of the following most accurately descrthes the argumentative technique employed above?\nChoices:\n  A: rejecting a factic on the grounds that it constitutes an attack on the character of a person and has no substance in :fact\n  B: rejecting a factic on the grounds that the factic makes it virtually imposSlble for the group to reach a consensus on the issue in question\n  C: conditionally advocating a factic on the grounds that it results in an accusation that is less offensive than the alternatives\n  D: conditionally advocating a factic on the grounds that it results in an argument that would help the group to reach a consensus on the issue in question\n  E: conditionally advocating a factic on the grounds that it results in an argument for which one could not consistently accept the premise but deny the conclusion\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nError Keywords:\n - Misunderstanding of \"factic\"\n - Misinterpretation of argument structure\n - Incorrect identification of argumentative technique\n"

This aligns with the definition of the argumentative technique \"rejecting a factic.\" \n"
