It is caused by mutations in the PHEX gene, which is located on the X chromosome. This disorder is inherited in an X-linked dominant pattern, which means that a mutation in one copy of the gene is enough to cause the disorder. Females are more likely to be affected than males because they have two X chromosomes. The symptoms of this disorder include bowed legs, short stature, dental problems, and bone pain. \nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
