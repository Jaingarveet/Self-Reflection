This option broadens the scope by suggesting that, in addition to drunk driving, addressing a wider range of traffic violations could help reduce accidents. It considers other factors that contribute to road safety and acknowledges that multiple measures are often needed to create a meaningful impact.\n\nThought: To eliminate the inconsistency, we need to consider factors that could influence the relationship between strict investigations of drunk driving and the incidence of traffic accidents.\n\nOption D is the best choice as it suggests a more comprehensive approach. By targeting not just drunk driving but also other traffic violations, we can address a wider range of contributing factors to accidents. This multifaceted strategy aligns with the experts' beliefs and acknowledges the complexity of road safety.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
