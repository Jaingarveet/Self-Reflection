I misinterpreted condition (3) to mean that X and W must be in different departments, when in fact it states that if X is in Sales, then W must be in Production. This means that X and W can be in the same department, just not when X is in Sales.\n\nNow, considering all the conditions:\n- H and Y must be in the same department\n- F and G cannot be in the same department\n- F must be in Production\n- X and W can be in the same department as long as it's not Sales (X and W must be in Production if they are in the same department)\n\nWith these conditions in mind, we can rule out choices A and B, as they place H and Y in different departments and have X and W in different departments when X is in Sales.\n\nChoice C can also be ruled out because it violates condition (2) by placing F and G in the same department.\n\nChoice D is the only option that remains and satisfies all the conditions.\n\nAnswer: D"
