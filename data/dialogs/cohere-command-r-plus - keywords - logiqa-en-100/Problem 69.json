I assumed that because Wang Wu's bonus was higher than Miao Xiaoqin's, and Zhang Shan's bonus was higher than Wang Wu's, that Zhang Shan's bonus must also be higher than Miao Xiao's. However, this assumption is incorrect as it contradicts the given information that Zhang Shan's bonus is higher than Li Si's bonus, and Li Si's bonus could be higher than Miao Xiaoqin's.\n\nThought: \nThe key to this question is to identify the assumption that, if false, would make the inference invalid. In other words, we are looking for an assumption that, if false, would still allow the inference to be valid.\n\nThe correct answer is Choice \"D: Li Si's bonus is as high as Wang Wu's.\" If this assumption is false, it does not affect the validity of the inference. Even if Li Si's bonus is not equal to Wang Wu's, it does not change the fact that Zhang Shan's bonus is higher than Miao Xiaoqin's based on the other given information.\n\nTherefore, choice D is the exception that does not affect the validity of the inference.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
