A true statement that refutes this conclusion would suggest that the human activity was not indicative of habitation.\n\nChoice D states that the entrance to the cave collapsed 5,000 years ago. This suggests that the human activity in the cave may have occurred after the collapse and that the cave was not inhabited, but rather used for other purposes over a shorter period. This statement effectively refutes the argument's conclusion and is, therefore, the correct answer.\n\nThe other choices are irrelevant or do not refute the conclusion.\n\nPrevious reflection: I misinterpreted \"refute\" and looked for a statement that supported, rather than contradicted, the argument.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
