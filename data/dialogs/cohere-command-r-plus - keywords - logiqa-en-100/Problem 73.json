This means that Team 1 can consist of {G, L, [either K or P]} and Team 2 consists of {H, Q, [the other of K or P]}.\n\nThought: \nGiven that G is in Team 1, we know from condition 1 that G must be in the front position. Condition 3 states that L must be in Team 1, and condition 2 states that K must be in the middle. This means that Team 1 can consist of {G, L, K} or {G, L, P}, satisfying conditions 1, 2, 3, and 4. Thus, the correct answer is choice C: L and N.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
