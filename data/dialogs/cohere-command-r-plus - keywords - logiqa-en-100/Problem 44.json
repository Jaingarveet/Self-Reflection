Any car equipped with airbags may experience a car accident.\n  B: Ignore this possibility? Owners without airbags pay more attention to driving cautiously.\n  C: Improper assumption? In any car accident, the airbag will automatically open.\n  D: Improperly equate the possibility of a car accident with the seriousness of the car owner â€™s injury in the accident.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nError Keywords:\n- Misinterpretation\n- Scope error\n- Equivocation\n- Fallacy\n\nSolution: The argument claims that airbags do not make car owners safer based on accident statistics. Choice [REDACTED] correctly identifies the issue: the argument improperly equates accident rates with owner safety. It fails to consider that airbags aim to reduce harm in accidents, regardless of the accident rate.\n"
