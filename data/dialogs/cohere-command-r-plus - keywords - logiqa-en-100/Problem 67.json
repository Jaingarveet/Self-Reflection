I interpreted the statement \"the official history of China has been the diary of the emperor's own family\" too literally and assumed it meant that all official histories are personal matters of the emperor's family. However, the correct assumption is that the official histories are one-sided and may not reflect the true face of the emperor, which is where Ye Shi comes in to provide a more complete picture.\n\nThought: \nThe argument assumes that the official history, as the diary of the emperor's family, may not provide a complete or unbiased view of the emperor's life. \nIt suggests that Ye Shi, as a portrayal of the emperor's life, offers a different perspective that is necessary to understand the \"true face\" of the emperor. \n\nTherefore, the assumption the argument relies on is that the official history and Ye Shi should be considered together to gain a comprehensive understanding of the emperor.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
