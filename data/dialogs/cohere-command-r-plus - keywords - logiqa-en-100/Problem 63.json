As the interest rates on bank deposits are low, residents are considering alternative investments, such as stocks or funds, which are expected to provide higher returns. This is supported by the information that residents' income is increasing but their savings deposits are not, suggesting they are investing their income elsewhere.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
