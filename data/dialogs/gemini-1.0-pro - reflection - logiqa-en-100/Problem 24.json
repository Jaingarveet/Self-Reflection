Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

While the sample size and composition are indeed crucial factors, the analogy presented in option C effectively exposes the fundamental flaw in the reasoning.\n## Error Keywords:\n* **Limited scope:** Focusing solely on sample representativeness without considering broader context and potential biases.\n* **Ignoring confounding variables:** Failing to account for factors like occupation, lifestyle, and access to healthcare that could significantly influence life expectancy.\n* **Misleading analogy:** Overlooking the flawed logic of comparing the average age of death of in-service staff with the average life expectancy of the general population.\n## Solution:\n1. **Identify the target population:** Intellectuals in Zhongguancun.\n2. **Recognize the limited scope of the sample:** In-service staff from 7 specific research institutes.\n3. **Consider potential biases:** Occupation, lifestyle, and access to healthcare could differ significantly between the sample and the target population.\n4. **Evaluate the analogy in option C:** It accurately highlights the flawed logic of comparing the average age of death of a specific group with the average life expectancy of a broader population.\n5. **Conclude that the reasoning is fallacious due to its limited scope, potential biases, and misleading analogy.**\n## Instructions for Future Problems:\n1. **Carefully analyze the context and target population.**\n2. **Evaluate the representativeness and potential biases of the sample.**\n3. **Consider alternative explanations and confounding variables.**\n4. **Be cautious of misleading analogies and overgeneralizations.**\n5. **Focus on logical reasoning and avoid jumping to conclusions.**\n## General Advice:\n* **Develop a critical eye for statistical reasoning.**\n* **Question assumptions and look for potential biases.**\n* **Consider alternative explanations and evidence.**\n* **Be mindful of the limitations of data and statistical methods.**\n* **Strive for logical consistency and avoid overgeneralizations.** \n"
