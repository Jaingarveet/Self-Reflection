Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "Explanation:\nThe argument relies on the assumption that a person can know exactly how long he can live before deciding whether to steal. \nThis assumption is not stated explicitly in the argument, but it is necessary for the argument to be valid. \nWithout this assumption, the argument would be flawed because it would be possible for someone to steal something from someone else even if they knew they would live for a long time.\nError Keywords:\n - Unstated assumption\n - Flawed reasoning\n - Necessary assumption\nSolution:\nThe argument states that whether a person does good behavior or bad behavior depends on the length of his life. \nThe argument then concludes that if a person only lived one day, it would be best for him to steal other people's things because he would not suffer the fear of being caught. \nHowever, this conclusion is only valid if the person can know exactly how long he can live. \nIf the person cannot know how long he can live, then he may choose to do good behavior even if he knows he will only live for a few days.\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the conclusion of the argument.\n2. Identify the premises of the argument.\n3. Determine whether the premises support the conclusion.\n4. If the premises do not support the conclusion, identify the unstated assumption that is necessary for the argument to be valid.\n5. Evaluate the validity of the argument based on the unstated assumption.\nAdvice:\n - Always be on the lookout for unstated assumptions.\n - Unstated assumptions can often be the most important part of an argument.\n - If you can identify the unstated assumptions of an argument, you will be in a better position to evaluate its validity.\n - Be aware of the different types of logical fallacies.\n - A logical fallacy is an error in reasoning that makes an argument invalid.\n - By being aware of the different types of logical fallacies, you will be better able to identify them and avoid making them yourself."
