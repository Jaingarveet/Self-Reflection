Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

E or F has one person to participate, but not both .One of J or K will participate, but not both.If J participates, then G participates.Unless F participates, M does not participate.\nQuestion: Which two of the following players will be selected by the coach to make the four-person team the only choice?\nChoices:\n  A: F and H\n  C: G and M\n  B: G and J\n  D: H and M\n\nThought:\nLet's analyze the conditions:\n1. E or F, but not both: This means either E or F will be selected, but not both.\n2. J or K, but not both: This means either J or K will be selected, but not both.\n3. If J, then G: This means if J is selected, then G must also be selected.\n4. Unless F, then not M: This means if F is not selected, then M cannot be selected.\nNow, let's analyze the choices:\nA: F and H: This violates condition 1, as both F and E are selected.\nB: G and J: This satisfies all conditions. If J is selected, then G is also selected (condition 3). If F is not selected (condition 4), then M cannot be selected.\nC: G and M: This violates condition 4, as F is not selected and M is selected.\nD: H and M: This violates condition 1, as both E and F are selected.\nTherefore, the only choice that satisfies all conditions is B: G and J.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: D"

        "content": "Explanation:\nI misinterpreted the condition \"Unless F, then not M\" as \"If F, then M\". This led me to incorrectly eliminate option D, which satisfies all other conditions.\nError Keywords:\n- Misinterpretation\n- Conditional logic error\n- Negation error\nSolution:\n1. E or F, but not both: This means either E or F will be selected, but not both.\n2. J or K, but not both: This means either J or K will be selected, but not both.\n3. If J, then G: This means if J is selected, then G must also be selected.\n4. Unless F, then not M: This means if F is not selected, then M cannot be selected.

If J is selected, then G is also selected (condition 3).
