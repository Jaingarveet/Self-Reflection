Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

However, I failed to consider the possibility that the sales department could be on the same floor as the planning department.\nError Keywords:\n - Reasoning error\n - Logical error\n - Overlooking possibilities\nSolution:\n1. The two floors of the human resources department and the sales department are not adjacent.\n2. The finance department is on the next floor of the planning department.\n3. The floor of the administrative department is above the planning department, but below the human resources department.\n4.

Consider all possible scenarios that satisfy the constraints.\n5. Choose the option that best fits the given information and constraints.\nAdvice:\n - Be thorough in your analysis and consider all possible scenarios.\n - Do not jump to conclusions based on limited information.\n - Double-check your reasoning and ensure that it is consistent with the given constraints.\n - Be mindful of potential logical fallacies and biases in your thinking."
