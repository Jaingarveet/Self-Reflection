Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

I focused on the lower running cost of aluminum alloy vehicles but overlooked the higher initial cost.\nError Keywords:\n- Misinterpretation of information\n- Incomplete analysis\n- Overlooking crucial details\nSolution:\n- Identify the conclusion: Replacing steel with aluminum is not financially advisable.\n- Analyze each option's impact on the conclusion:\n    - A: Lower running cost for aluminum weakens the conclusion.\n    - B: Additional costs for aluminum strengthen the conclusion.\n    - C: Irrelevant comparison, does not affect the conclusion.\n    - D: Potential decrease in steel price strengthens the conclusion.\n- Choose the option that most significantly weakens the conclusion.\nInstructions:\n1. Clearly identify the conclusion from the context.\n2. Analyze each option individually and determine its impact on the conclusion.\n3. Consider all aspects of each option, not just isolated details.\n4. Choose the option that directly contradicts or weakens the conclusion the most.\n5. Be cautious of options that introduce irrelevant information or false comparisons.\nAdvice:\n- Pay close attention to the wording of the conclusion and each option.\n- Consider all aspects of each option, including both positive and negative implications.\n- Avoid making assumptions or drawing conclusions based on incomplete information.\n- Prioritize options that directly contradict or weaken the conclusion.\n- Be wary of options that introduce irrelevant information or false comparisons."
