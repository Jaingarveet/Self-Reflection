Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "## Explanation:\nMy initial analysis of the answer choices was correct in identifying options B and D as employing a similar modus tollens structure to the original argument. However, I erred in prioritizing option B based on the superficial similarity of objects and properties. The core of the logical structure, which is the focus of the question, aligns more closely with option D. \n## Error Keywords:\n* Superficial similarity\n* Object-property focus\n* Modus tollens structure\n## Solution:\n1. **Identify the logical structure:** The original argument is a modus tollens, with the form:\n    * All P are Q\n    * Not Q\n    * Therefore, not P\n2. **Analyze answer choices:**\n    * A: Modus ponens, not similar.\n    * B: Modus tollens, similar in structure but not in object-property focus.\n    * C: Modus ponens, not similar.\n    * D: Modus tollens, similar in both structure and object-property focus.\n3. **Choose the answer that best reflects the logical structure:** Option D aligns most closely with the modus tollens structure of the original argument.\n## Instructions:\n1. **Focus on the logical structure:** Prioritize identifying the type of logical reasoning employed in the original argument.\n2. **Analyze answer choices based on structure:** Evaluate each answer choice based on its adherence to the identified logical structure, not just superficial similarities.\n3. **Consider object-property focus:** If applicable, assess whether the objects and properties in the answer choices align with those in the original argument.\n4. **Choose the answer that best reflects the overall logic:** Select the answer that most closely mirrors the reasoning process of the original argument.\n## General Advice:\n* **Understand the different types of logical reasoning:** Familiarize yourself with common logical structures like modus ponens, modus tollens, and hypothetical syllogism.\n* **Practice identifying logical structures:** Analyze various arguments to hone your ability to recognize the underlying reasoning patterns.\n* **Focus on the core logic, not just surface features:** Don't be misled by superficial similarities in objects or properties; prioritize the underlying logical structure.\n* **Double-check your reasoning:** Carefully review your analysis and ensure your chosen answer aligns with the original argument's logic. \n"
