Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

Carefully read the argument and identify its main claim.\n2. Analyze each option to determine whether it supports, weakens, or is irrelevant to the argument.\n3. Be cautious of options that appear to support the argument but actually strengthen it.\n4. Consider the implications of each option in relation to the main claim of the argument.\n5. Choose the option that most clearly constitutes doubt or rebuttal to the argument.\nAdvice:\n - Pay close attention to the wording of the argument and the answer choices.\n - Consider the logical structure of the argument and how each option interacts with it.\n - Be wary of options that seem intuitively appealing but do not directly address the argument.\n - Remember that the goal is to identify the option that casts doubt on or refutes the argument, not necessarily the option that is most obviously wrong."
