Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "Explanation:\nI incorrectly assumed that the statement \"money is like dung\" was the only premise leading to the absurd conclusion. However, the other premise, \"friends are worth a thousand dollars,\" also plays a crucial role. \nError Keywords:\n - Incomplete analysis\n - Overlooking premises\n - Ignoring logical implications\nSolution:\n1. Identify all the premises involved in the argument.\n2. Analyze how each premise contributes to the conclusion.\n3. Consider the logical implications of each premise individually and in combination.\n4. Determine which premise, if false, would prevent the derivation of the absurd conclusion.\nInstructions:\n1. Carefully read and understand the argument and its conclusion.\n2. Identify all the premises explicitly stated or implied in the argument.\n3. Analyze the logical structure of the argument, including the relationships between the premises and the conclusion.\n4. Consider the truth value of each premise and its impact on the validity of the argument.\n5. Identify the premise whose falsity would invalidate the argument and prevent the derivation of the absurd conclusion.\nAdvice:\n - Pay close attention to all premises involved in an argument, not just the most prominent ones.\n - Analyze the logical implications of each premise individually and in combination.\n - Consider counterexamples and alternative interpretations to challenge your assumptions.\n - Be cautious of drawing conclusions based on incomplete or flawed reasoning.\n - Remember that a valid argument with true premises guarantees a true conclusion, but an invalid argument or an argument with false premises can lead to false conclusions."
