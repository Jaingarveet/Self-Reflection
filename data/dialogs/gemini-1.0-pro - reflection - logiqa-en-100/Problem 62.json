Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

Carefully read the question and understand the experts' opinion.\n2. Analyze each option and consider its potential impact on the decline in the salamander population.\n3. Choose the option that presents the most significant challenge to the experts' opinion.\n4. Do not focus solely on options that directly contradict the experts' opinion; consider alternative explanations and their relative impact.\n5. Think critically and logically about the problem and the potential consequences of each option.\nAdvice:\n - When evaluating multiple options, consider their relative impact and not just their direct contradiction to the given statement.\n - Think critically about the problem and the potential consequences of each option.\n - Do not jump to conclusions; carefully analyze each option and its implications.\n - Consider alternative explanations and their potential impact on the situation.\n - Be open to different perspectives and interpretations."
