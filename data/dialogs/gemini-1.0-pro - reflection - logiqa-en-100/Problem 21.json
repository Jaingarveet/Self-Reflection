Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

At present, part of the orbit of Comet 1996D3 is far from the sun, but recently it can be found to emit flickering light through the solar telescope.In the past, people never observed such flashes of comets far away from the sun, so this flicker must be an unusual scene.Xiao Wang? Normally people don't observe comets far away from the sun.The 1996D3 comet flicker light discovered this time was obtained by continuous and careful tracking observation.\nQuestion: Which of the following most accurately summarizes the method Xiao Wang used to refute Xiao Chen's views?\nChoices:\n  A: Point out that the key concepts used by Xiao Chen are ambiguous.\n  B: pointed out that Xiao Chen's argument is clearly lacking in persuasion.\n  C: pointed out that Xiao Chen's arguments contradict themselves.\n  D: Disagree with Xiao Chen's conclusion, and put forward another explanation for Xiao Chen's argument.E.Agree with Xiao Chen's conclusion, but put forward another explanation for Xiao Chen's argument.\n\nThought: \nXiao Chen argues that the flickering light of Comet 1996D3 is unusual because it has never been observed before.\nXiao Wang counters that comets far away from the sun are not normally observed, and the flickering light was discovered through careful tracking observation.\nXiao Wang is not directly refuting Xiao Chen's claim about the unusual nature of the flickering light. Instead, Xiao Wang is suggesting that the lack of previous observations is not sufficient evidence to support Xiao Chen's claim.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: B"

By pointing out that the flickering light was only observed through careful tracking, Xiao Wang is suggesting that the lack of previous observations is not a valid reason to conclude that the flickering light is unusual.\nInstructions:\n1. Carefully read and understand the arguments presented by both Xiao Chen and Xiao Wang.\n2. Identify the specific claim that Xiao Wang is refuting.\n3.
