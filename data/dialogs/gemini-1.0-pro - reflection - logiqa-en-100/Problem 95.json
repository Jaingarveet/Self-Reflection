Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "## Reflection on Incorrect Answer\n**Explanation:**\nMy initial analysis of the passage and answer choices was flawed. While I correctly identified the central theme of China's population size and its challenges, I misinterpreted the specific message conveyed by Premier Wen Jiabao. I focused on the literal meaning of multiplication and division, overlooking the metaphorical usage in the context.\n**Error Keywords:**\n* Misinterpretation of metaphor\n* Overlooking figurative language\n* Focusing on literal meaning\n**Solution:**\n1. **Identify the central theme:** The passage highlights the challenges of managing a large population like China's.\n2. **Analyze the metaphorical language:** The use of \"multiplication\" and \"division\" is not literal but represents the impact of population size on problems and solutions.\n3. **Connect the metaphor to the message:** A large population can amplify both problems and solutions, making it crucial for China to work collaboratively and efficiently.\n4. **Choose the answer that aligns with the metaphor:** Option D, \"Everyone collects firewood and the flame is high,\" best reflects the message of collective effort and amplified outcomes.\n**Instructions for Future:**\n1. Pay close attention to figurative language and metaphors within the context.\n2. Analyze the intended message beyond the literal meaning of words and phrases.\n3. Consider the author's purpose and the overall tone of the passage.\n4. Choose the answer that best aligns with the metaphorical message.\n**General Advice:**\n* Be mindful of the author's intended message and the overall context.\n* Recognize and interpret figurative language within the text.\n* Analyze the relationship between the metaphor and the central theme.\n* Choose the answer that best reflects the metaphorical message.\n**Additional Note:**\nThis reflection highlights the importance of understanding the author's intent and interpreting figurative language accurately. By focusing on the literal meaning of \"multiplication\" and \"division,\" I overlooked the deeper message about collective effort and amplified outcomes. In the future, I will pay closer attention to figurative language and analyze the intended message beyond the surface level. \n"
