        "content": "Thought:\nThe axillary artery is a continuation of the subclavian artery and is divided into three parts by the pectoralis minor muscle. The second part of the axillary artery is located posterior to the pectoralis minor muscle. The branches of the second part of the axillary artery include the thoracoacromial artery, the lateral thoracic artery, and the subscapular artery. The subscapular artery gives rise to the circumflex scapular artery and the thoracodorsal artery. The circumflex scapular artery anastomoses with the dorsal scapular artery, which is a branch of the transverse cervical artery. The anterior and posterior circumflex humeral arteries arise from the third part of the axillary artery and supply the shoulder joint and the muscles of the rotator cuff. The suprascapular artery arises from the thyrocervical trunk and supplies the supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscles. \nTo answer this question, we need to identify the anastomosis that will maintain the blood supply of the upper limb in the case of obstruction of the second part of the axillary artery. \nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
