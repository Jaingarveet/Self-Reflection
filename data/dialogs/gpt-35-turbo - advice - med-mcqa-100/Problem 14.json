The end product of anaerobic glycolysis is pyruvate, which is converted to lactate in the presence of lactate dehydrogenase. The net yield of ATP in anaerobic glycolysis is 2 ATP molecules per glucose molecule. However, 2 NADH molecules are also produced, which can be used in the electron transport chain to produce additional ATP.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
