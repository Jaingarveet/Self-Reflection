The vagus nerve is responsible for both voice and swallowing, so it is unlikely to be the nerve affected. The recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) is responsible for voice, and the superior laryngeal nerve (SLN) is responsible for swallowing. Glossopharyngeal nerve is responsible for taste and sensation in the posterior third of the tongue, and it does not have any role in swallowing or voice. Therefore, the most likely nerve injured during surgery is the SLN nerve.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
