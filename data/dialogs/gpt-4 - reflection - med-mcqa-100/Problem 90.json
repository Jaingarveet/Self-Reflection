Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6.

It can be due to:\nChoices:\n  A: Oligohydramnios\n  B: Placenta pre\n  C: Pelvic tumor\n  D: Uterine anomalies\n\nThought: \nAn unstable lie is when the baby's position changes frequently during the last month of pregnancy. This can be due to several reasons, including a large amount of amniotic fluid (polyhydramnios), multiple pregnancies, a uterus that is abnormally shaped or has abnormal growths, or a baby that is small or not growing well. In this case, the woman has had two previous normal deliveries, so uterine anomalies are less likely. A pelvic tumor could potentially cause an unstable lie, but it's not the most common cause. Placenta previa could potentially cause an unstable lie, but it would likely present with other symptoms as well, such as bleeding. Oligohydramnios, or a low amount of amniotic fluid, could potentially cause an unstable lie, but it's not the most common cause.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: B"

        "content": "Explanation:\nI answered the question incorrectly because I misunderstood the potential impact of placenta previa on the position of the fetus. I incorrectly assumed that placenta previa would present with other symptoms and therefore could not be the cause of an unstable lie.\nError Keywords:\n- Misunderstanding\n- Incorrect assumption\n- Gynaecology & Obstetrics\nSolution:\nAn unstable lie can be due to several reasons, including placenta previa. Placenta previa is a condition where the placenta partially or completely covers the mother's cervix, which is the outlet for the uterus. This can cause the baby to change positions frequently, resulting in an unstable lie. Even though placenta previa often presents with other symptoms such as bleeding, it can still be the cause of an unstable lie even in the absence of these symptoms.\nInstructions:\n1. Understand the question and the medical condition being asked about.\n2. Review each answer choice and consider how it could potentially cause the condition.\n3. Remember that placenta previa can cause an unstable lie, even if other symptoms are not present.\n4. Choose the answer that is the most likely cause of the condition based on the information given in the question.\nAdvice:\n- Always read the question carefully and understand the medical condition being asked about.\n- Don't make assumptions about the presence or absence of other symptoms unless this information is given in the question.\n- Review each answer choice carefully and consider how it could potentially cause the condition.\n- Remember that the most common cause of a condition may not always be the correct answer, especially if the question provides specific information about the patient's history or current situation."
