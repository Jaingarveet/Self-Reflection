Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

In this condition, the body's immune system produces antibodies against certain proteins in the skin and mucous membranes. These proteins are part of the basement membrane, which helps hold the skin and mucous membranes together. The antigen that is bound by IgG in cicatricial pemphigoid is BP antigen 1 & 2.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: A"

In Bullous pemphigoid, the antibodies target BP antigen 1 & 2, while in Cicatricial pemphigoid, the antibodies target XVII collagen.\nError Keywords:\n- Misidentification\n- Confusion between similar diseases\n- Incorrect antigen association\nSolution:\nCicatricial pemphigoid is an autoimmune blistering disease where the body's immune system produces antibodies against certain proteins in the skin and mucous membranes. The antigen that is bound by IgG in Cicatricial pemphigoid is XVII collagen, not BP antigen 1 & 2. Therefore, the correct answer is \"A: XVII collagen\".\nInstructions:\n1. Understand the disease in question - Cicatricial pemphigoid.\n2. Recall that it is an autoimmune blistering disease.\n3. Remember that the antibodies in this disease target XVII collagen.\n4. Identify the correct answer as \"A: XVII collagen\".\nAdvice:\n- Always read the question carefully and understand the disease in question.\n- Be careful not to confuse similar diseases and their associated antigens.\n- Take time to recall the specific details of each disease, including the antigens involved.\n- Double-check your answer before finalizing it to avoid mistakes."
