Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

Biopsy finding is also shown below. What is your diagnosis?\nChoices:\n  A: Rhinoscleroma\n  B: Wegener's granulomatosis\n  C: Stewa's granuloma\n  D: Rhinosporidiosis\n\nThought: \nThe question does not provide enough information to make a diagnosis. A biopsy finding is mentioned but not shown. Therefore, I cannot make a diagnosis based on the information given. However, considering the age of the patient and the symptoms, Wegener's granulomatosis could be a possibility, but without the biopsy results, it's impossible to make a definitive diagnosis. \nAction: Answer(\"B\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: D"

        "content": "Explanation:\nI answered the question incorrectly because I made an assumption based on the patient's age and symptoms without considering all the possible diagnoses. I should have considered Rhinosporidiosis, which can also present with similar symptoms.\nError Keywords:\n- Assumption error\n- Diagnostic error\n- Differential diagnosis error\nSolution:\nGiven the patient's symptoms of right-sided nasal obstruction, nasal discharge, and blood-tinged discharge, the correct diagnosis should be Rhinosporidiosis. This condition is a chronic granulomatous infection that primarily affects the mucous membranes of the nose and nasopharynx. It is characterized by polypoidal lesions that can cause nasal obstruction and epistaxis, which aligns with the patient's symptoms.\nInstructions:\n1. Read the patient's symptoms carefully.\n2. Consider all possible diagnoses based on the symptoms.\n3. Do not make assumptions based on a few symptoms; consider the whole clinical picture.\n4. Remember that Rhinosporidiosis can present with nasal obstruction and blood-tinged discharge.\n5. Choose the diagnosis that best fits the patient's symptoms and age.\nAdvice:\n- Always consider all possible diagnoses before making a decision.\n- Do not make assumptions based on a few symptoms; consider the whole clinical picture.\n- Remember to consider less common diagnoses, especially when common conditions do not fit the clinical picture.\n- Always double-check your answer before finalizing it."
