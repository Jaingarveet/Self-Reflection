I will try my best to answer this question correctly.\n**Step 1: Simplify the expression for x.**\nWe can start by simplifying the expression for x:\n```\nx = (n^2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16) / (n + 4√n + 4)\n```\n```\n= (n + 4√n + 4)(n - 4√n + 4) / (n + 4√n + 4)\n```\n```\n= n - 4√n + 4\n```\n**Step 2: Find the minimum and maximum values of n.**\nWe are given that 36 ≤ n ≤ 72. Therefore, the minimum value of n is 36 and the maximum value of n is 72.\n**Step 3: Find the minimum and maximum values of x.**\nTo find the minimum value of x, we substitute n = 36 into the expression for x:\n```\nx = 36 - 4√36 + 4 = 28\n```\nTo find the maximum value of x, we substitute n = 72 into the expression for x:\n```\nx = 72 - 4√72 + 4 = 60\n```\n**Step 4: Choose the answer that satisfies the range of x.**\nThe range of x is 28 ≤ x ≤ 60. Therefore, the answer that satisfies this range is **D: 28 < x < 60**.\n**Action: Answer(\"D\")**"
