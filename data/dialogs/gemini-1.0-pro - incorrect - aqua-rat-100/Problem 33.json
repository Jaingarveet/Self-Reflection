The diameter of each semi-circle is 20 cm, so the radius is 10 cm.\n3. The area of each semi-circle is (π * 10²)/2 = 50π cm².\n4. The total area of the two semi-circles is 100π cm².\n5. The area of the remaining paper is 400 cm² - 100π cm².\n6. Using a calculator, we find that 400 cm² - 100π cm² ≈ 8.79 cm².\n**Action:** Answer(\"B\")"
