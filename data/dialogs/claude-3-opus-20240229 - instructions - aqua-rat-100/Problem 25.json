        "content": "Okay, let's approach this step-by-step using the reflection as a guide:\n1. Let the height of the tower be h, the car's speed be v, and the distance of the car from the base of the tower at 45° be x.\n2. Using the tangent function:\n   tan(45°) = h/x, so x = h\n   tan(60°) = h/(x - 10v), so x - 10v = h/√3\n3. From the first equation, x = h. Substituting into the second equation:\n   h - 10v = h/√3\n   h(1 - 1/√3) = 10v\n   h(√3 - 1)/√3 = 10v\n   h = 10v√3/(√3 - 1)\n4. The remaining distance is h/√3 (since tan(60°) = h/(remaining distance)).\n   Remaining distance = 10v√3/(√3 - 1) * 1/√3 = 10v/(√3 - 1)\n5. Additional time = Remaining distance / Speed\n                    = (10v/(√3 - 1)) / v\n                    = 10/(√3 - 1)\n6. Simplify:\n   10/(√3 - 1) = 10/(√3 - 1) * (√3 + 1)/(√3 + 1)\n                = 10(√3 + 1)/(3 - 1)\n                = 10(√3 + 1)/2\n                = 5(√3 + 1)\n7. The expression is already rationalized.\n8. Double-checking the calculations, the simplification appears correct.\n9. The answer that matches the simplified result is A: 5(√3 + 1).\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
