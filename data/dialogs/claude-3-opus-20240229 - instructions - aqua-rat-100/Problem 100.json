Identify the unknown variable and assign it a letter (e.g., x for breadth).\n2. Express the length in terms of the breadth using the given relationship.\n3. Use the given area to set up an equation.\n4. Expand the equation and solve for the unknown variable.\n5. Calculate the length using the value of the breadth.\n6. Use the correct formula for the perimeter of a rectangle: P = 2(l) + 2(b), where l is length and b is breadth.\n7. Substitute the values of length and breadth into the perimeter formula.\n8. Simplify the expression and round the result if necessary.\n9. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\n"

        "content": "Okay, let's solve this step-by-step using the reflection as a guide:\n1. Let the breadth be x. \n2. The length is 1m more than 4 times the breadth, so:\n   length = 4x + 1\n3. The area of the rectangle is given as 150 sq m. So:\n   x(4x + 1) = 150\n4. Expand the equation and solve for x:\n   4x^2 + x - 150 = 0\n   4x^2 + 16x - 15x - 150 = 0\n   4x(x + 4) - 15(x + 10) = 0\n   (4x - 15)(x + 10) = 0\n   x = 15/4 or x = -10 (reject as breadth can't be negative)\n   So, breadth x = 15/4 = 3.75 m\n5. Length = 4x + 1 = 4(3.75) + 1 = 16 m\n6. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula:\n   P = 2(l) + 2(b), where l is length and b is breadth\n7. Substituting the values:\n   P = 2(16) + 2(3.75)\n   \n8. Simplifying:\n   P = 32 + 7.5 = 39.5 m\n9. Rounding off to the nearest integer, the perimeter is 40 m.\nNone of the given options match the calculated perimeter of 40 m. However, as per the instructions, I must select one of the available choices.\nThe closest option to 40 m is 61 m.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
