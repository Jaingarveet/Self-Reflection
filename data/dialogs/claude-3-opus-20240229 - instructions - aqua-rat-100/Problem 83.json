If the question asks about permutations without repetition (i.e., all letters are considered distinct), then the number of permutations is simply n!, where n is the total number of letters.\n4. If the question asks about permutations with repetition, then you need to divide n! by the product of the factorials of the number of repetitions for each repeated element.\n5.

This means we are looking at permutations without repetition (i.e. all letters are considered distinct).\n3. Since the question asks about permutations without repetition and there are 7 total letters, the number of possible rearrangements is simply 7!\n4. We don't need to consider any repetitions, since the question specifies no repetitions are allowed.\n5. Looking at the answer choices, 7! matches choice C.\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: 7!\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
