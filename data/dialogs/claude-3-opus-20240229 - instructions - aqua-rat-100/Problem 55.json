Given information:\n   - Man's rowing rate in still water is 4 kmph\n   - Man's rate against the current is 2 kmph\n   - Need to find the man's rate along the current\n2. Assign variables:\n   - Let the speed of the current be x kmph\n3. Set up equations:\n   - Rate downstream = Still water rate + Current rate\n   - Rate upstream = Still water rate - Current rate\n   - So: 4 + x = Rate downstream, and 4 - x = 2\n4. Solve equations:\n   - 4 - x = 2\n   - -x = -2\n   - x = 2\n   - The current speed is 2 kmph\n   - Rate downstream = 4 + 2 = 6 kmph\n5. Calculate final answer:\n   - The man's rate along the current is 6 kmph\n6. Review answer choices:\n   A: 15 kmph\n   B: 6 kmph\n   C: 12 kmph\n   D: 14 kmph\n   E: 6 kmph\n7. Select matching answer(s):\n   - The calculated answer 6 kmph matches choices B and E\nTherefore, the man's rate along the current is 6 kmph.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
