        "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n1. The school has more than 501 students. Let's call the total number of students n.\n2. 20% of the students took physics. This means the number of physics students must be a whole number. \n   20% of n must be a whole number.\n3. Similarly, 28% of the students took math. So 28% of n must also be a whole number.\n4. We need to find the least possible value of n greater than 501 that satisfies these conditions.\n5. Let's start checking from 502:\n   20% of 502 = 100.4 (not a whole number)\n   28% of 502 = 140.56 (not a whole number)\n6. Let's try 510: \n   20% of 510 = 102 (a whole number)\n   28% of 510 = 142.8 (not a whole number)\n7. Let's jump to 600:\n   20% of 600 = 120 (a whole number) \n   28% of 600 = 168 (a whole number)\n8. 600 satisfies both conditions and there's no number between 501 and 600 that does so.\nTherefore, the least possible number of students in the school is 600.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
