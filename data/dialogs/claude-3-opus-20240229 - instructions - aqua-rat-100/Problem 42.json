        "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n1. Each picket is 1/2 inch wide.\n2. There are 6 inches of space between each pair of pickets. \n3. The total width of one picket plus one space is:\n   1/2 inch + 6 inches = 13/2 inches\n4. With x pickets, there are x-1 spaces between the pickets.\n5. The total width of all x pickets is: \n   x * (1/2 inch) = x/2 inches\n6. The total width of the x-1 spaces is:\n   (x-1) * 6 inches = 6x - 6 inches\n7. The total fence width in inches is:\n   Picket width + Space width\n   = x/2 + 6x - 6\n   = 6x + x/2 - 6\n   = 13x/2 - 6 inches\n8. To convert the total width to feet, divide by 12:\n   (13x/2 - 6) / 12 = 13x/24 - 1/2\n9. Simplifying:\n   13x/24 - 12/24 = (13x - 12)/24\n10. Looking at the answer choices, the one that matches this result is:\n    E: (13x-12)/24\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
