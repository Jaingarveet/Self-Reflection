        "content": "Okay, let's approach this step-by-step using the reflection:\n1. The points are in the order A, B, C, D on the circle.\n2. Minor arc AC is 160°, and B bisects it. So:\n   - Minor arc AB = 160° / 2 = 80°\n   - Minor arc BC = 160° / 2 = 80°\n3. Minor arc BD is given as 150°. \n   The major arc BD must be 360° - 150° = 210°\n4. Visualizing:\n   - A and B are 80° apart\n   - B and C are 80° apart\n   - B and D are 150° apart on the minor arc, 210° apart on the major arc\n   - We need to find the minor arc AD\n5. To find minor arc AD, we can add the measures of minor arcs AB and BD:\n   - Minor arc AD = Minor arc AB + Minor arc BD\n   - Minor arc AD = 80° + 150° = 230°\n6. Double-checking: \n   - 230° is more than 180°, so it can't be the minor arc\n   - The major arc AD must be 360° - 230° = 130°\n   - Therefore, the minor arc AD is 130°\n7. The answer choice that matches 130° is B.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
