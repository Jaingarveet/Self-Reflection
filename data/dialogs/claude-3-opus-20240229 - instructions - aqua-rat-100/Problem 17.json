What is the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee that the yearly profit (revenue from sales minus production costs) will be at least $626,400 ?\nChoices:\n  A: 226\n  B: 230\n  C: 240\n  D: 260\n  E: 280\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the relevant information: monthly production, production cost per unit, desired yearly profit.\n2. Calculate the yearly production by multiplying monthly production by 12.\n3. Calculate the yearly production cost by multiplying yearly production by the production cost per unit.\n4. Calculate the total revenue needed by adding the desired yearly profit to the yearly production cost.\n5. Calculate the minimum selling price per unit by dividing the total revenue needed by the yearly production.\n6. Round up the calculated minimum selling price to the nearest whole number.\n7.

        "content": "Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:\n1. Relevant information:\n   - Monthly production: 420 units\n   - Production cost per unit: $110\n   - Desired yearly profit: $626,400\n2. Yearly production:\n   420 units/month * 12 months = 5,040 units/year\n3. Yearly production cost: \n   5,040 units/year * $110/unit = $554,400/year\n4. Total revenue needed:\n   Desired yearly profit + Yearly production cost\n   $626,400 + $554,400 = $1,180,800\n5. Minimum selling price per unit:\n   Total revenue needed / Yearly production\n   $1,180,800 / 5,040 units = $234.29/unit\n6. Rounding up the minimum selling price:\n   $234.29 rounded up to the nearest whole number is $235\n7. Selecting the answer:\n   The smallest answer choice that is greater than or equal to $235 is $240\nTherefore, the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee the desired yearly profit is $240.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
