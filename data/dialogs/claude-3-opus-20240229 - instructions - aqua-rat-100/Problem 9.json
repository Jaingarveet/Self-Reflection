        "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n1. The key information is:\n   - The grocer makes a 25% profit on the selling price of each bag of flour\n   - Each bag is sold for $100\n   - The total profit is $3,000\n2. The relationship between selling price, cost price, and profit is:\n   Selling Price = Cost Price + Profit\n   \n3. To calculate the profit per bag in dollars:\n   - The selling price is $100 per bag\n   - The profit is 25% of the selling price\n   - 25% of $100 = 0.25 × $100 = $25\n   So the profit per bag is $25\n4. To calculate the number of bags sold:\n   - Total profit = Profit per bag × Number of bags sold\n   - $3,000 = $25 × Number of bags sold\n   - Number of bags sold = $3,000 ÷ $25 = 120\n5. Looking at the choices, the closest answer to 120 is:\n   D: 120\nTherefore, the grocer sold 120 bags of flour.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
