Simplify x:\nx = (n^2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16) / (n+ 4√n+ 4)\n  = (n^2 + 2n√n + 8√n + 16) / (n + 4√n + 4)\n  = (n(n + 2√n + 8) + 16) / (n + 4√n + 4)\n  = (n(n + 2√n) + 8n + 16) / (n + 4√n + 4)\n  = (n^2 + 2n√n + 8n + 16) / (n + 4√n + 4)\n  = n + 2√n + 8 + 16/(n + 4√n + 4)\n2. The bounds for n are: 36 ≤ n ≤ 72\n3. At n = 36:\nx = 36 + 2√36 + 8 + 16/(36 + 4√36 + 4)\n  = 36 + 12 + 8 + 16/52\n  = 56 + 16/52\n  = 56.31 (rounded)\n4. At n = 72: \nx = 72 + 2√72 + 8 + 16/(72 + 4√72 + 4)\n  = 72 + 2(8.49) + 8 + 16/110\n  = 72 + 16.98 + 8 + 0.15\n  = 97.13\n5. Using a calculator for the square roots ensures precision.\n6. Based on the calculations, x falls in the range 56.31 < x < 97.13\n7. Looking at the answer choices, the range 56.31 < x < 97.13 best fits choice D: 28 < x < 60\nTherefore, the best answer is D.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
