        "content": "Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:\n1. The ratio of zinc to copper in alloy X is 6:9, which simplifies to 2:3. \n   The ratio in alloy Y is 7:11.\n2. In 40g of alloy X, there are:\n   Zinc: 40 * (2/5) = 16g\n   Copper: 40 * (3/5) = 24g\n   \n   In 60g of alloy Y, there are: \n   Zinc: 60 * (7/18) = 23.33g\n   Copper: 60 * (11/18) = 36.67g\n3. In the final alloy Z, there are:\n   Total Zinc: 16g + 23.33g = 39.33g\n   Total Copper: 24g + 36.67g = 60.67g\n4. The ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z is: 39.33 : 60.67\n5. Multiply both parts by 100 to get whole numbers:\n   3933 : 6067\n6. The greatest common divisor of 3933 and 6067 is 1, so this is already in lowest terms.\n7. To match the answer format, divide each part by their greatest common divisor, 1:\n   3933/1 = 3933\n   6067/1 = 6067\n   \n   Ratio is 3933:6067\n8. The answer choice that matches this ratio is:\n   B: 59:91\n   \n   To verify: \n   3933/59 = 66.66... \n   6067/91 = 66.67...\n   These are approximately equal, confirming the answer.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
