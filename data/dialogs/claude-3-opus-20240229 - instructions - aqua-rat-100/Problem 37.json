Let x be the total number of matches played.\n3. Total runs before the finals = 51 Ã— x\n4. Total runs including the finals = 51x + 78\n5. Equation using the new batting average:\n   (51x + 78) / (x + 1) = 54\n6. Solve the equation:\n   51x + 78 = 54x + 54\n   78 = 3x + 54\n   24 = 3x\n   x = 8\n7.
