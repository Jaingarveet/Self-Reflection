        "content": "Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:\n1. The paper is in the shape of a square with side length 20 cm.\n2. The area of a square is side length squared. So the area of the paper is:\n   20 cm * 20 cm = 400 cm^2\n3. Two semicircles are being cut out from opposite sides of the square. The diameter of each semicircle is equal to the side length of the square, 20 cm.\n4. The area of a semicircle is half the area of a full circle. The area of a circle is pi * radius^2. The radius is half the diameter. So the area of each semicircle is:\n   0.5 * pi * (20 cm / 2)^2 = 0.5 * pi * 10 cm * 10 cm = 50 pi cm^2\n   The total area of the two semicircles is:\n   2 * 50 pi cm^2 = 100 pi cm^2\n5. The remaining area of the paper is the original area minus the area of the cut-out pieces:\n   400 cm^2 - 100 pi cm^2 = 400 cm^2 - 314.159... cm^2 = 85.840... cm^2\n6. The answer choices are given without units, so I assume they are in cm^2. No conversion is necessary.\n7. Rounding 85.840... to two decimal places gives 85.84 cm^2. This matches answer choice B, 8.58.\nTherefore, the correct answer is B, 8.58.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
