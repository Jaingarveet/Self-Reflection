        "content": "  Let's call the other two numbers y and z. Since the sum of the three numbers is 855, we can write:\n\nx + y + z = 855\n\nWe know that x is 50% more than the sum of y and z, so we can write:\n\nx = 1.5(y + z)\n\nSubstituting this expression for x into the first equation, we get:\n\n1.5(y + z) + y + z = 855\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n2y + 2z = 855\n\nSubtract z from both sides:\n\n2y = 740\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\ny = 370\n\nNow we can find z:\n\nz = 855 - 2y\n= 855 - 2(370)\n= 855 - 740\n= 115\n\nSo, x = 1.5(y + z) = 1.5(370 + 115) = 1.5(485) = 727.5\n\nTherefore, the value of x is between 727 and 728 (since x is an integer). The closest answer is:\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
