A temperature increase of 1 degree Fahrenheit is equivalent to a temperature increase of $\\frac{5}{9}$ degree Celsius.\n\nThis statement is false. If the temperature increases by 1 degree Fahrenheit, the temperature in Celsius will increase by $\\frac{9}{5}$ degrees.\n\nII. A temperature increase of 1 degree Celsius is equivalent to a temperature increase of 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nThis statement is true. We can see this by rearranging the equation:\n\n$$F = \\frac{9}{5}C + 32$$\n\nIf the temperature in Celsius increases by 1 degree, the temperature in Fahrenheit will increase by $\\frac{9}{5}$ degrees, which is approximately 1.8 degrees.\n\nIII. A temperature increase of $\\frac{5}{9}$ degree Fahrenheit is equivalent to a temperature increase of 1 degree Celsius.\n\nThis statement is false. If the temperature increases by $\\frac{5}{9}$ degrees Fahrenheit, the temperature in Celsius will increase by less than 1 degree.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option B: II only. A temperature increase of 1 degree Celsius is equivalent to a temperature increase of 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit."
