The correct answer is \"D: The words 'Money is like dung' and 'Friends are worth a thousand dollars' are either true or false.\" This answer is correct because the two statements are not necessarily true or false, but they can lead to a logically invalid conclusion. The other choices are not correct because they do not address the logical problem in the statements."
