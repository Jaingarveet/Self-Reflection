        "content": "## Reflection on previous incorrect answer:\nMy previous answer was incorrect because I did not correctly calculate the population of City X in 2015. I incorrectly added the 20% increase to the 2010 population, resulting in an inflated population for City X in 2015. This led me to choose an incorrect answer for the population of City Y in 2010.\n## Step-by-step solution:\n1. **Define variables:**\n    - Let $X_{2010}$ be the population of City X in 2010.\n    - Let $Y_{2010}$ be the population of City Y in 2010.\n2. **Translate the problem into equations:**\n    - We know that $X_{2015} = Y_{2015}$ (populations were equal in 2015).\n    - We also know that $X_{2015} = 1.2X_{2010}$ (population of City X increased by 20%).\n    - Finally, we know that $Y_{2015} = 0.9Y_{2010}$ (population of City Y decreased by 10%).\n3. **Solve the equations:**\n    - Since $X_{2015} = Y_{2015}$, we can substitute the second equation into the third equation:\n        - $1.2X_{2010} = 0.9Y_{2010}$\n    - We are given that $X_{2010} = 120,000$:\n        - $1.2(120,000) = 0.9Y_{2010}$\n    - Solving for $Y_{2010}$:\n        - $Y_{2010} = \\frac{1.2 \\times 120,000}{0.9}$\n        - $Y_{2010} = 160,000$\n4. **Double-check:**\n    - Verify that the calculated population of City Y in 2010 is consistent with the given information and the population growth/decline rates.\n## Action: Answer(\"C\") \nThe population of City Y in 2010 was 160,000. \n"
