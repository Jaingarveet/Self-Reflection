I have learned that when the slope of a line is undefined, it means that the line is vertical and passes through the point $(0,0)$.\nAction:\n1. The two points that determine the line are $(2, k)$ and $(k, 32)$.\n2. The slope of the line is calculated as follows:\n```\nslope = (32 - k) / (k - 2)\n```\n3. Setting the slope equation equal to zero, we get:\n```\n(32 - k) / (k - 2) = 0\n```\n4. Solving for $k$, we get:\n```\nk = 32\n```\n5. Checking if $k = 32$ is a valid solution, we see that it does not make the denominator of the slope equation zero. Therefore, $k = 32$ is a valid solution.\nAnswer: Answer(\"D\")"
