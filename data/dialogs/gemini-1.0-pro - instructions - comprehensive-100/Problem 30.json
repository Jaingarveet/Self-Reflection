At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.\nQuestion: If G is placed on the top shelf, then which one of the following could be a complete and accurate list of the books placed on the middle shelf?\nChoices:\n  A: H, I\n  B: I, L\n  C: H, I, L\n  D: I, K, L\n  E: F, I, M\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n1. Carefully read and understand all the given conditions.\n2. Identify the books that have specific shelf placements (e.g., G on the top shelf, I on the middle shelf).\n3. Analyze the remaining conditions to determine the relative placement of other books (e.g., K above F, O above L).\n4. Consider all possible arrangements that satisfy the given conditions.\n5. Eliminate arrangements that violate any of the conditions.\n6. Choose the arrangement that satisfies all conditions and has the required number of books on each shelf.\n"
