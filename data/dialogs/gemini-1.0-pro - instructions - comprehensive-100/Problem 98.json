Determine if the amino acid is directly translated from mRN[REDACTED] or formed by post-translational modification.\n4. If the amino acid is directly translated from mRN[REDACTED], choose the answer that indicates aminoacyl t-RN[REDACTED] is required.\n5. If the amino acid is formed by post-translational modification, choose the answer that indicates aminoacyl t-RN[REDACTED] is not required.\n6.

Aminoacyl t-RNA is required for the translation of amino acids from mRNA into proteins.\n3. Proline, lysine, and methionine are all directly translated from mRNA.\n4. Hydroxylysine is not directly translated from mRNA but is formed by post-translational modification of lysine.\n5. Therefore, aminoacyl t-RNA is not required for hydroxylysine.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
