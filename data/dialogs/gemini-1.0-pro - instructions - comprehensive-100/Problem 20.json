Carefully read the passage and identify the key concepts.\n2. Identify the question being asked and the options provided.\n3. Analyze each option and compare it to the definition or description provided in the passage.\n4. Choose the option that most accurately matches the definition or description.\n5. Do not prioritize figurative language over literal definitions.\n"

        "content": "## Self-Reflection on Previous Incorrect Answer:\n**Mistake:** I previously chose option A (\"The bottom line ethics is not to steal or kill.\") as the answer. However, this is too narrow and only covers two specific actions.\n**Reasoning:** The passage emphasizes that \"bottom line ethics\" are basic and fundamental codes of conduct for ordinary people in a society. This suggests a broader range of behaviors and principles.\n## Analysis of Options:\n**A:** This option is too limited and does not encompass the broader concept of \"bottom line ethics.\"\n**B:** This option aligns well with the description in the passage. It defines \"bottom line ethics\" as basic codes of conduct and rules that should be followed by everyone in society.\n**C:** This option is partially correct in that \"bottom line ethics\" do not require extreme selflessness. However, it focuses solely on what it is not, rather than providing a positive definition.\n**D:** This option uses a metaphor to describe \"bottom line ethics\" as the foundation of human morality. While this is a valid interpretation, it is less direct and clear than option B.\n## Conclusion:\nBased on the analysis, option B (\"The bottom line ethics are some of the most basic and basic codes of conduct and rules that should be observed by ordinary people in a society.\") best captures the essence of \"bottom line ethics\" as described in the passage.\n## Action:\nAnswer(\"B\") \n"
