Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.\nQuestion: If Robertson is assigned parking space #3, then which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Souza is assigned parking space #4.\n  B: Togowa is assigned parking space #2.\n  C: Vaughn is assigned parking space #5.\n  D: Xu is assigned parking space #6.\n  E: Young is assigned parking space #2.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI made a mistake in my reasoning by not considering all possible scenarios. \nI incorrectly assumed that Young must be assigned parking space #2, which led me to choose answer [REDACTED]. \nHowever, Young could have been assigned parking space #1, which would have allowed Souza to be assigned parking space #4.\n"

Given that Robertson is assigned parking space #3, Young could have been assigned parking space #1, which would have allowed Souza to be assigned parking space #4. Therefore, the correct answer is A: Souza is assigned parking space #4."
