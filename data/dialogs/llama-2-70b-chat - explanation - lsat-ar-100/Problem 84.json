At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.\nQuestion: Which one of the following could be a complete and accurate list of the books placed on the bottom shelf?\nChoices:\n  A: F, M\n  B: F, H, M\n  C: G, H, K\n  D: F, G, M, O\n  E: G, H, L, M\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI incorrectly answered the question because I misunderstood the given information.\nI mistakenly believed that the bottom shelf must have more books than the top shelf, and therefore, it cannot be empty.\nHowever, the question only states that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, which means that the bottom shelf can still have fewer books than the middle shelf.\n"
