Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day. The following conditions apply: No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.\nQuestion: If the number of batches made on Friday is exactly one, then which one of the following could be true?\nChoices:\n  A: The first batch of sugar cookies is made on Monday.\n  B: The first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Tuesday.\n  C: The third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Friday.\n  D: The first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Wednesday.\n  E: The second batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI incorrectly answered the question because I made a mistake in my reasoning. I incorrectly assumed that the first batch of sugar cookies was made on a day before Thursday, when in fact, it could have been made on Thursday itself.\n"

The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies, which means that the first batch of peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Monday. Therefore, the first batch of sugar cookies can be made on Monday, making option A a possible answer. My previous mistake was assuming that the first batch of sugar cookies had to be made on a day before Thursday, but it can actually be made on Thursday itself."
