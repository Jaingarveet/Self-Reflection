At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.\nQuestion: Which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: O is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf M is placed on.\n  B: K is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf G is placed on.\n  C: I is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf F is placed on.\n  D: G is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf O is placed on.\n  E: F is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf L is placed on.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\n"

I incorrectly assumed that the bottom shelf had to have more books than the top shelf, which led me to choose answer A. However, upon further review, I realized that the question only states that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, not necessarily that the bottom shelf has to have more books than the top shelf.\n\nTherefore, I will choose answer E: F is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf L is placed on.\n\nMy reasoning is as follows:\n\n* We know that F is placed on the same shelf as M, and M is not on the bottom shelf. Therefore, F cannot be on the bottom shelf.\n* We also know that L is placed on a lower shelf than O, and O is placed on a higher shelf than F. Therefore, L must be on the bottom shelf.\n* Since F is placed on a shelf higher than L, the only possible placement for F is on the middle shelf.\n\nI believe that answer E is the correct choice based on the given conditions."
