Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.\nQuestion: Which one of the following could be a complete and accurate list of the sales representatives working in Zone 3?\nChoices:\n  A: Kim, Mahr\n  B: Kim, Tiao\n  C: Parra, Quinn\n  D: Stuckey, Tiao, Udall\n  E: Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Udall\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI incorrectly answered the question because I misunderstood the conditions provided. I thought that Parra and Quinn worked together in a sales zone, and Stuckey and Udall worked together in a sales zone, which led me to choose option [REDACTED]. However, upon re-reading the conditions, I realized that Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other, and Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other, but not necessarily together.\n"

Also, Tiao cannot work in Zone 3, as either Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2, and Udall works in Zone 3. Therefore, the only possible combination of sales representatives working in Zone 3 is Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, and Udall, which corresponds to option E."
