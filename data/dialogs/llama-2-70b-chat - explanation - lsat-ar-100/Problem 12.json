I misunderstood the rules provided and mistakenly believed that J and P could not be shown consecutively. However, upon further review, I see that they can be shown consecutively, just in reverse order. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nAction: Answer(\"E\")\n\nThe pair of houses that CANNOT be shown consecutively in either order is M and P. This is because M must be shown before P, and P must be shown in the evening, which means M cannot be shown in the evening. Therefore, it is not possible to show M and P consecutively in either order."
