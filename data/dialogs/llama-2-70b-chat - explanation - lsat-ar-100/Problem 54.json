The following conditions must apply: Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.\nQuestion: If Jiang does not review Tamerlane, then which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Jiang reviews Sunset.\n  B: Lopez reviews Undulation.\n  C: Megregian reviews Sunset.\n  D: Megregian reviews Tamerlane.\n  E: O'Neill reviews Undulation.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI made a mistake in my reasoning and incorrect assumptions.\nI assumed that Jiang could only review Sunset or Undulation, which is not necessarily true.\nI also assumed that Megregian could not review Tamerlane, which is also not true.\n"

Let's analyze the question again:\nIf Jiang does not review Tamerlane, then which one of the following must be true?\nWe know that Kramer and Lopez each review fewer plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.\nFrom the given information, we can deduce that Megregian cannot review Sunset, as that would mean Megregian reviews more plays than Kramer and Lopez combined, which contradicts the given information.\nTherefore, Megregian must review Undulation, as it is the only play left.\nNow, we know that Jiang does not review Tamerlane, so Jiang must review Sunset.\nThe correct answer is A: Jiang reviews Sunset.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
