Each session will be led by a different lab assistant—Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, or Rebecca. The assignment of lab assistants to sessions is constrained as follows: Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day. Nessa must lead an afternoon session. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.\nQuestion: If Lan does not lead a Wednesday session, then which one of the following lab assistants must lead a Thursday session?\nChoices:\n  A: Rebecca\n  B: Olivia\n  C: Nessa\n  D: Kevin\n  E: Julio\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI made a mistake in my reasoning and incorrect assumptions. I assumed that if Lan does not lead a Wednesday session, then [REDACTED] cannot lead a Wednesday session. However, that is not necessarily true. Lan and [REDACTED] cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day, but that does not mean they cannot both lead sessions on Wednesday.\n"

However, that is not necessarily true. Lan and [REDACTED] cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day, but that does not mean they cannot both lead sessions on Wednesday.\nTherefore, the correct answer is option B, Olivia. If Lan does not lead a Wednesday session, then Olivia must lead a Thursday session."
