If both of them have worked for almost similar number of hours how many toys have been prepared by Jacob?\nChoices:\n  A: 15\n  B: 16\n  C: 17\n  D: 18\n  E: 19\n"

We know that A + J = 35. \nSince they worked for almost the same number of hours, the ratio of toys made by Alex to Jacob is the inverse of the ratio of time it takes for them to make a toy. So, A/J = 9/7.\nWe can solve these two equations to find the number of toys made by Jacob.\nAction: \nFirst, substitute A = 35 - J into the second equation: (35 - J)/J = 9/7.\nSolving this equation gives J = 15. \nSo, Jacob made 15 toys.\nAnswer(\"A\")"
