        "content": "Thought: \nLet's denote the number of friends who were supposed to go to the picnic as x. The total cost of the eatables is Rs. 96, so each friend was supposed to contribute Rs. 96/x. However, 4 friends did not show up, so the remaining x-4 friends had to contribute Rs. 96/(x-4). According to the problem, this amount is Rs. 4 more than the original contribution, so we have the equation 96/(x-4) = 96/x + 4. Solving this equation will give us the number of friends who attended the picnic.\nAction: \nFirst, we need to solve the equation for x. We can start by multiplying all terms by x(x-4) to get rid of the fractions:\n96x = 96(x-4) + 4x(x-4)\nSimplifying this gives:\n96x = 96x - 384 + 4x^2 - 16x\nRearranging terms and simplifying further gives:\n4x^2 - 16x - 384 = 0\nDividing all terms by 4 gives:\nx^2 - 4x - 96 = 0\nThis is a quadratic equation in the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0. We can solve it using the quadratic formula x = [-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / (2a):\nx = [4 ± sqrt((4)^2 - 4*1*(-96))] / (2*1)\nx = [4 ± sqrt(16 + 384)] / 2\nx = [4 ± sqrt(400)] / 2\nx = [4 ± 20] / 2\nx = 24/2 or -16/2\nWe discard the negative solution because the number of friends cannot be negative. So, x = 12. This is the total number of friends who were supposed to go to the picnic. Since 4 friends did not show up, the number of friends who attended the picnic is 12 - 4 = 8.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
