He already gets a salary of 1500, so he needs to earn an additional 6000 - 1500 = 4500 from commission. \nThe commission is 15% of the monthly sale, so to find out how much sale he needs to do, we can set up the equation: \n0.15 * X = 4500, where X is the amount of sale he needs to do. \nSolving for X gives us X = 4500 / 0.15 = 30000. \nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
