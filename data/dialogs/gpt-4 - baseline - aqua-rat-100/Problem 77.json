        "content": "Thought: \nThe sum of 5 consecutive odd numbers is 5 times the middle number. This is because in a sequence of consecutive odd numbers, the middle number is the average of the sequence. \nFor example, if we take 5 consecutive odd numbers starting from 41, they would be 41, 43, 45, 47, 49. The sum of these numbers is 225, which is 5 times the middle number 45. \nThe sum of these 5 numbers divided by 10 should be a perfect square. So, 225 divided by 10 is 22.5, which is not a perfect square. \nWe can repeat this process for the other options. \nFor 47, the numbers would be 43, 45, 47, 49, 51. The sum is 235, divided by 10 is 23.5, not a perfect square. \nFor 91, the numbers would be 87, 89, 91, 93, 95. The sum is 455, divided by 10 is 45.5, not a perfect square. \nFor 67, the numbers would be 63, 65, 67, 69, 71. The sum is 335, divided by 10 is 33.5, not a perfect square. \nFor 44, it's not an odd number, so it can't be in a sequence of odd numbers. \nSo, none of the options given can be one of the 5 numbers.\nAction: Answer(\"None of the Above\")"
