Since the area of each triangle is 70 square feet, the area of the rectangle (which is made up of two of these triangles) is 2*70 = 140 square feet.\nLet's denote the side of the square as x. After trimming, the rectangle has dimensions x (the untrimmed side) and x-4 (the trimmed side). So, the area of the rectangle is x*(x-4) = 140.\nSolving this quadratic equation, we get x = 14 (ignoring the negative root as it doesn't make sense in this context).\nSo, the perimeter of the original square cloth is 4*x = 4*14 = 56 feet.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
