The least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of both of them. \nGiven that the GCF of the two numbers is 11 and one of the numbers is 350, the other number must also be a multiple of 11. \nThe LCM of two numbers is equal to the product of the two numbers divided by their GCF. \nSo, we can set up the equation: (350 * x) / 11 = 7700, where x is the other number. \nSolving for x gives us x = (7700 * 11) / 350 = 242.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
