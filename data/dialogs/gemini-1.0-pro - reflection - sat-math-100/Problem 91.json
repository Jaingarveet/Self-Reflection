Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

Identify the value of $f(n)$ when $n$ is equal to the first value in the table.\n4. Calculate the y-intercept of the function by subtracting the product of the slope and the first value of $n$ from the first value of $f(n)$.\n5. Write the equation of the function in slope-intercept form: $f(n)=mx+b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept.\nAdvice:\n - When analyzing linear functions, pay close attention to the change in the output value for each change in the input value.\n - Remember that the slope of a linear function represents the rate of change of the function.\n - Remember that the y-intercept of a linear function represents the value of the function when the input value is zero.\n - Always double-check your calculations and reasoning before selecting your final answer."
