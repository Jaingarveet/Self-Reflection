Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "## Reflection on Incorrect Answer\n**Explanation:**\nMy initial approach was correct in attempting to solve the system of equations using substitution. However, I made an error in the calculation of $x$ after substituting the value of $y$. Instead of $-31$, I incorrectly calculated $x$ as $-19$. This resulted in selecting the wrong answer choice.\n**Error Keywords:**\n* Calculation error\n* Substitution error\n* Sign error\n**Solution:**\nFollowing the correct steps of substitution:\n1. From the second equation, $x = 2y - 19$.\n2. Substitute this expression for $x$ in the first equation: $3(2y - 19) + 4y = -23$.\n3. Simplify and solve for $y$: $6y - 57 + 4y = -23$, $10y = 34$, $y = \\dfrac{34}{10}$, $y = \\dfrac{17}{5}$.\n4. Substitute the value of $y$ back into the second equation to solve for $x$: $2(\\dfrac{17}{5}) - x = -19$, $\\dfrac{34}{5} - x = -19$, $x = \\dfrac{34}{5} + 19$, $x = \\dfrac{133}{5}$.\n5. Therefore, the correct solution to the system of equations is $(x, y) = (\\dfrac{133}{5}, \\dfrac{17}{5})$.\n**Instructions for Future:**\n1. Carefully perform calculations, paying close attention to signs and operations.\n2. Double-check calculations before moving to the next step.\n3. Use a calculator for complex calculations to minimize manual errors.\n4. Review the solution process to identify any potential mistakes.\n**General Advice:**\n* Understand the underlying concepts of the problem before attempting to solve it.\n* Choose an appropriate method for solving the problem based on its type.\n* Break down complex problems into smaller, manageable steps.\n* Be meticulous and organized in your calculations and reasoning.\n* Always double-check your work before finalizing your answer."
