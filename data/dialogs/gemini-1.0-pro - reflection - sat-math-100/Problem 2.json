Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "## Explanation:\nMy initial thought process was correct in terms of distributing the negative sign and combining like terms. However, I made a mistake while combining the $x^2y$ terms. I incorrectly added them instead of subtracting them, leading to an inaccurate final answer.\n## Error Keywords:\n* Sign error\n* Combining like terms error\n* Addition/subtraction error\n## Solution:\n1. Distribute the negative sign:\n$$(x^{2} y-3 y^{2}+5 x y^{2}) - (-x^{2} y+3 x y^{2}-3 y^{2}) =$$\n$$x^{2} y-3 y^{2}+5 x y^{2} + x^{2} y-3 x y^{2}+3 y^{2}$$\n2. Combine like terms:\n* Combine $x^2y$ terms: $x^2 y + x^2 y = 2x^2 y$\n* Combine $xy^2$ terms: $5xy^2 - 3xy^2 = 2xy^2$\n* Combine $y^2$ terms: $-3y^2 + 3y^2 = 0$\n3. Final expression:\n$$2x^2 y + 2xy^2$$\n## Instructions:\n1. Carefully distribute any negative signs.\n2. Identify like terms (terms with the same variables and exponents).\n3. Combine like terms by adding or subtracting their coefficients, depending on their signs.\n4. Double-check your calculations and ensure all like terms are combined.\n5. Write the final simplified expression.\n## General Advice:\n* Pay close attention to signs when distributing or combining terms.\n* Double-check your calculations to avoid arithmetic errors.\n* Organize your work to keep track of like terms and their coefficients.\n* If unsure, break down the problem into smaller steps and tackle them one at a time.\n* Practice similar problems to solidify your understanding and avoid repeating mistakes. \n"
