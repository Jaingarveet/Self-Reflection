        "content": "Explanation:\nI incorrectly identified the slope and y-intercept of the linear equation that represents the helicopter's altitude. \nI correctly identified the rate of change (21 feet per second) as the slope, but I mistakenly used the initial altitude (40 feet) as the y-intercept instead of the initial time (0 seconds).\nError Keywords:\n - Misidentification of slope\n - Misidentification of y-intercept\n - Linear equation error\nSolution:\nThe helicopter's initial altitude is 40 feet, and it gains altitude at a rate of 21 feet per second. This means that the helicopter's altitude is increasing linearly with time.\nThe slope of the linear equation is equal to the rate of change, which is 21 feet per second.\nThe y-intercept of the linear equation is equal to the initial altitude, which is 40 feet.\nThe equation for a line with a slope of 21 and a y-intercept of 40 is $y=21t+40$.\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the initial value (y-intercept).\n2. Identify the rate of change (slope).\n3. Determine the equation of the line using the slope-intercept form: $y=mx+b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept.\n4. Substitute the values of the slope and y-intercept into the equation.\n5. Simplify the equation.\nAdvice:\n - Pay close attention to the units of the variables involved.\n - Make sure to distinguish between initial values and rates of change.\n - Double-check the units of the slope and y-intercept to ensure they are consistent with the units of the variables.\n - Remember that the slope-intercept form of a linear equation is $y=mx+b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept."
