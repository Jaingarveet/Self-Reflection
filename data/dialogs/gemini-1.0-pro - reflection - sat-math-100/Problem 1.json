Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

I should have factored out a negative $v$ from both terms on the right side of the equation, resulting in a positive $16t$ term instead of a negative one.\n## Error Keywords:\n* Sign error\n* Factoring error\n* Algebra error\n## Solution:\n1. Move the constant term to the left side:\n$$h+k=-16 t^{2}+v t$$\n2. Factor out $v$:\n$$h+k=v(t -16 t)$$\n3. Isolate $v$:\n$$v=\\frac{h+k}{t}-16 t$$\n## Instructions:\n1. Identify the term containing $v$.\n2. Isolate the term containing $v$ on one side of the equation.\n3. Factor out $v$ from the remaining terms.\n4. Be mindful of signs when factoring.\n5. Simplify the expression for $v$.\n## General Advice:\n* Double-check all calculations and signs to avoid careless errors.\n* Break down complex equations into smaller, more manageable steps.\n* Practice factoring and manipulating algebraic expressions.\n* Review the order of operations (PEMDAS) to ensure correct calculations.\n* When unsure, double-check your work or consult additional resources."
