        "content": "Explanation:\nI incorrectly assumed that the line passes through the point $(0,0)$ because it passes through the origin. This assumption is incorrect because the line can pass through any point on the $y$-axis as long as its slope is $\\frac{1}{7}$.\nError Keywords:\n - Incorrect assumption\n - Misinterpretation of the problem\n - Failure to consider all possibilities\nSolution:\nThe slope of the line is $\\frac{1}{7}$.\nThis means that for every 1 unit increase in the $x$ coordinate, the $y$ coordinate increases by $\\frac{1}{7}$ units.\nStarting from the origin $(0,0)$, we can move 14 units to the right to get to the point $(14,0)$.\nTo get to a point on the line, we need to move $\\frac{1}{7}$ units up from $(14,0)$.\nTherefore, the point $(14,2)$ lies on the line.\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the slope of the line.\n2. Remember that the slope represents the change in $y$ for every 1 unit change in $x$.\n3. Starting from the origin, move the $x$ coordinate by the desired amount.\n4. Calculate the corresponding change in $y$ based on the slope.\n5. Move the $y$ coordinate by the calculated amount.\n6. The resulting point lies on the line.\nAdvice:\n - Carefully read the problem and identify all given information.\n - Do not make assumptions that are not explicitly stated in the problem.\n - Consider all possible scenarios and eliminate answer choices that do not fit.\n - Use the given information to calculate the unknown values step-by-step.\n - Double-check your calculations and reasoning before choosing an answer."
