Read the problem carefully and understand the situation.\n2. Identify the variables and their meanings.\n3. Write down the equation that represents the situation.\n4. Simplify the equation by combining like terms.\n5. Solve the equation for the unknown variable.\n6. Check your answer to make sure it makes sense in the context of the problem.\n7. If necessary, use additional information from the problem to find the actual value of the unknown variable.\nAdvice:\n- Be careful when simplifying equations, and make sure you are combining like terms correctly.\n- Check your work carefully to avoid making careless mistakes.\n- If you get stuck, try to break the problem down into smaller steps.\n- Don't be afraid to ask for help if you need it."
