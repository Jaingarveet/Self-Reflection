[REDACTED], brimonidine, and brinzolamide decrease aqueous outflow through the trabecular meshwork.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Misunderstanding the effect of drugs on the trabecular meshwork\n* Confusing the functions of different drugs\n\nSolution:\nThe trabecular meshwork is a structure in the eye that regulates aqueous outflow. [REDACTED] increases aqueous outflow through the trabecular meshwork by increasing the number of channels between the trabecular cells, allowing aqueous humor to flow more easily.
