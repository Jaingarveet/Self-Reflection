However, the correct answer is option [REDACTED], which is the actual cut-off value for CA-125 in ovarian cancer.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Misunderstanding the cut-off value\n* Confusion with similar values\n\nSolution:\nCA-125 is a tumor marker used to diagnose and monitor ovarian cancer. The cut-off value for CA-125 is an important factor in determining whether a patient has ovarian cancer or not. The correct cut-off value for CA-125 in ovarian cancer is [REDACTED].\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Identify the tumor marker being discussed (CA-125).\n2. Understand the purpose of the tumor marker (diagnosis and monitoring of ovarian cancer).\n3. Determine the cut-off value for CA-125 in ovarian cancer ([REDACTED]).\n4. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n5. Choose the answer that matches the correct cut-off value.\n\nAdvice:\n\n* Always review and understand the topic and question before answering.\n* Take your time and read the question carefully to avoid mistakes.\n* Use a systematic approach to solve the problem, breaking it down into smaller steps.\n* Double-check your calculations and final answer to ensure accuracy.\n* Stay up-to-date with the latest medical knowledge and guidelines to improve your performance.\n"
