A placenta previa is a condition where the placenta is located low in the uterus and covers the cervix, which can cause bleeding and other complications during pregnancy.\n\nAdvice:\nIt is essential to carefully evaluate the patient's medical history and current symptoms to determine the correct diagnosis. In this case, the patient's history of previous normal deliveries and unstable lie at 34 weeks suggest a possible placenta previa, which should be further investigated and managed appropriately.\n\nAnswer: (B) Placenta previa"
