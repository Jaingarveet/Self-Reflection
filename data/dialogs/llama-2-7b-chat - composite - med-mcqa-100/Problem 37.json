Here is my reflection:\n\nError Keywords: PPH, Mifepristone, Misoprostol, Oxytocin, Ergotamine\n\nSolution: I mistakenly selected Mifepristone as the drug not commonly used in PPH.\n\nCorrect Answer: Misoprostol is not commonly used in PPH.\n\nExplanation: PPH stands for Postpartum Hemorrhage, which is a serious and potentially life-threatening bleeding that occurs after childbirth. Misoprostol is not typically used in the management of PPH, while Mifepristone, Oxytocin, and Ergotamine are commonly used.\n\nAdvice: It is essential to carefully review and understand the topic before answering questions to avoid making mistakes. Additionally, it is important to take the time to reflect on any incorrect answers and use them as an opportunity to learn and improve."
