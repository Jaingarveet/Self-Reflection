Here's how you can answer the question correctly:\n\nSpring catarrh is a type of hypersensitivity reaction, and the correct answer is (B) type I.\n\nExplanation:\nSpring catarrh is a type of allergic rhinitis that occurs during the spring season, typically in March to May in the Northern Hemisphere. It is caused by an allergic reaction to pollen, which is a type of type I hypersensitivity reaction. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) type I.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Hypersensitivity reaction\n* Allergy\n* Type I\n* Type II\n* Type IV\n* Type V\n\nSolution:\nSpring catarrh is a type of hypersensitivity reaction caused by an allergic reaction to pollen. The correct answer is (B) type I.\n\nAdvice:\n\n* Always re-read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n* Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n* Always think through each step of your reasoning explicitly.\n* Never skip any steps; double-check your answers to ensure accuracy.\n* Remember that type I hypersensitivity reactions are caused by the activation of IgE antibodies, while types II-IV are caused by different immune mechanisms."
