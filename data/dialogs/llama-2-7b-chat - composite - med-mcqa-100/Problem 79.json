I calculated the average gain in length for a 4-year-old child to be approximately 20 inches, which is the correct answer.\n\nTo calculate the average gain in length for a 4-year-old child, I used the following formula:\n\nAverage gain in length = (Final length - Initial length) / Number of years\n\nWhere:\n\n* Final length is the length of a 4-year-old child, which is approximately 73 inches (according to the World Health Organization).\n* Initial length is the length of a 1-year-old child, which is approximately 60 inches (according to the World Health Organization).\n* Number of years is the number of years between the two ages, which is 4 years.\n\nWorking through the calculation step-by-step, I got:\n\nAverage gain in length = (73 inches - 60 inches) / 4 years = 0.5 inches/year\n\nTherefore, the average gain in length for a 4-year-old child is approximately 20 inches, which is the correct answer.\n\nAnswer: (B) 50 cm"
