I focused on the overall purpose of the recipe instead of analyzing the specific steps and their logical sequence. \nBy carefully reading the text and considering the details, I realized that the next step should involve removing the eggplant from the water and wringing out the excess liquid. This aligns with the common practice of removing excess moisture from vegetables before frying to achieve a crispy texture. \nI have learned the importance of paying close attention to the specific instructions and details within the text to avoid misinterpretations and ensure logical reasoning."
