The mass of an object, on the other hand, is a measure of the amount of matter in the object and remains constant regardless of location.\n\nThe astronaut's mass is given as 84 kilograms, so this will remain the same on Earth as it is on the Moon.\n\nThe weight of the astronaut on the Moon is given as 31 pounds. Since the Moon's gravity is about 1/6th that of Earth's, we can calculate the astronaut's weight on Earth by multiplying his weight on the Moon by 6.\n\n31 pounds \\* 6 = 186 pounds\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
