If there were no errors, then the hypothesis may need to be revised or rejected.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")\nExplanation:\nMichelle should repeat the investigation to ensure that the results were not due to chance or error. If the results are consistent, then she can consider revising or rejecting her hypothesis. Changing the hypothesis to match the results is not a valid scientific approach. Performing the investigation in a different way or choosing a different investigation may not address the issue with the original hypothesis."
