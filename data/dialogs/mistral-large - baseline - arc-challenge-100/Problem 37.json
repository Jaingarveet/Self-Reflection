In this case, I will choose the option that is least likely to be an example of animal instinct.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")\n\nExplanation:\nWhile hunting skills can be an example of animal instinct, they can also be learned behaviors. For example, a mother lion may teach her cubs how to hunt. Therefore, hunting skills are not always an example of animal instinct."
