As the cloud collapses, it begins to spin and form a disk of material around a central protostar. The protostar continues to gather material from the disk, eventually becoming hot and dense enough to initiate nuclear fusion, at which point it becomes a main sequence star.\n\nThe process described in choice A is associated with the death of stars, not their formation. Choice B describes the formation of second-generation stars, which occurs after the first generation of stars has died and released material into space. Choice C describes a process that occurs in the later stages of a star's life, not during its formation. Choice D is not necessarily associated with the formation of new stars.\n\nAction: Answer(\"None of the Above\")\n\nWait, I cannot select \"None of the Above\".
