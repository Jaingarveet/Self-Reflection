(1) The two floors of the human resources department and the sales department are not adjacent; (2) The finance department is on the next floor of the planning department; (3) The floor of the administrative department is above the planning department, but in the manpower Below the Resources Department.\nQuestion: If the Human Resources Department is not at the upper level of the Administration Department, which of the following may be correct?\nChoices:\n  A: The sales department is on the upper level of the R & D department\n  B: The sales department is one level above the administrative department\n  C: The sales department is at the next level of the planning department\n  D: Sales Department is on the second floor\n\nThought:\nFrom the given information, we can deduce that the Human Resources Department cannot be on the top floor since it is not above the Administration Department. Also, the Sales Department cannot be adjacent to the Human Resources Department.\n\nLet's consider the options:\n\nA: The sales department is on the upper level of the R & D department. This is possible since the Sales Department and the Human Resources Department are not adjacent.\n\nB: The sales department is one level above the administrative department. This is not possible since the Sales Department cannot be adjacent to the Human Resources Department, and the Administration Department is below the Human Resources Department.\n\nC: The sales department is at the next level of the planning department.
