Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

They are also typically small and mobile, making them more prone to torsion.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: C"

Identify the specific characteristics of each type of ovarian tumor.\n2. Consider how these characteristics affect the likelihood of torsion during pregnancy.\n3. Evaluate the risk factors associated with each type of ovarian tumor during pregnancy.\n4. Choose the answer that best fits the criteria for the most likely type of ovarian tumor to undergo torsion during pregnancy.\n5. Double-check your answer to ensure that it is consistent with the specific features of each type of ovarian tumor.\nAdvice:\n - Always consider the specific features of each type of medical condition when answering questions.\n - Never make assumptions about the likelihood of a medical condition based on general knowledge.\n - Always evaluate the risk factors associated with each type of medical condition.\n - Always double-check your answer to ensure that it is consistent with the specific features of each type of medical condition.\n - Remember that the most common type of medical condition is not necessarily the most likely to cause a specific complication."
