It takes the shape of its container.\nThe correct statement describing a liquid sample is:\n\"It will retain its volume if transferred to a larger container.\"\n\nReflection:\nAfter reflecting on my previous mistake, I realized that I had incorrectly described a liquid sample's properties. I had stated that a liquid keeps its shape when transferred to a larger container, which is incorrect. Liquids take the shape of their container, so their shape can change depending on the container's size and shape.\n\nTo answer this question correctly, I need to identify the properties of a liquid sample and consider how a liquid's volume and shape change based on its surroundings. The statement that accurately describes a liquid sample's properties is:\n\"It will retain its volume if transferred to a larger container.\"\n\nI will make sure to review the properties of different states of matter, including liquids, and consider the behavior of liquids in different situations, such as pouring water from a bottle into a cup. I will also pay attention to the given choices and eliminate any obviously incorrect options. Finally, I will double-check my answer by re-reading the question and my chosen statement."
