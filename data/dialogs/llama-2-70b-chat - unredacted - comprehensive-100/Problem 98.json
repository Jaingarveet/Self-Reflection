Aminoacyl t-RNA is required for all amino acids except proline, which is synthesized from glutamine. However, hydroxylysine is also synthesized from glutamine and does not require aminoacyl t-RNA.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Misunderstanding\n* Exception to the rule\n* Confusion between similar concepts\n\nSolution:\nAminoacyl t-RNA is required for all amino acids except proline and hydroxylysine. Hydroxylysine is synthesized from glutamine, just like proline.\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Review the exceptions to the rule that aminoacyl t-RNA is required for all amino acids.\n2. Understand the difference between proline and hydroxylysine synthesis.\n3. Recall that hydroxylysine is also synthesized from glutamine.\n4. Choose the correct answer, C, Hydroxylysine.\n\nAdvice:\n\n* Always review and understand the exceptions to a rule.\n* Be aware of similarities and differences between related concepts.\n* Double-check your answers, especially when there are similar options.\n* Use mnemonic devices to remember exceptions to rules.\n* Practice, practice, practice to build your knowledge and confidence.\n"
