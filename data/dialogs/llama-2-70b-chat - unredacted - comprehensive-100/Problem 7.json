The average weight of the group of vehicles increased by 2.6 tons after a new heavy duty truck was added to the group? What is the weight in tons of the heavy duty truck?\nChoices:\n  A: 40.8\n  B: 41.6\n  C: 42.2\n  D: 43.5\n  E: 44.8\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI made a mistake in my calculation. I misunderstood the formula for finding the new average and incorrectly applied it. I also made a calculation error in finding the weight of the new truck.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Formula error\n* Calculation error\n* Arithmetic mistake\n\nSolution:\nLet's break this down step by step:\n\n1. The average weight of the 10 vehicles before adding the new truck is 12.2 tons.\n2. The average weight of the group of vehicles increased by 2.6 tons after adding the new truck.\n3. To find the weight of the new truck, we can use the formula for finding the new average:\n\nNew average = Old average + (Change in weight / Number of items)\n\nIn this case, the change in weight is 2.6 tons, and the number of items has increased by 1 (the new truck).\n\nNew average = 12.2 + (2.6 / 11)\n\nNew average = 12.2 + 0.236\n\nNew average = 12.436\n\nSince the new average is 12.436 tons, the weight of the new truck must be the difference between the new average and the old average:\n\nWeight of new truck = New average - Old average\n\nWeight of new truck = 12.436 - 12.2\n\nWeight of new truck = 0.236 tons\n\nNow, we can check our choices:\n\nA: 40.8\nB: 41.6\nC: 42.2\nD: 43.5\nE: 44.8\n\nThe weight of the new truck is 0.236 tons, which is closest to choice A: 40.8.\n\nAction: Answer(\"A\")\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Identify the old average weight of the vehicles.\n2. Identify the change in weight after adding the new truck.\n3. Use the formula for finding the new average to calculate the weight of the new truck.\n4. Check your answer by comparing it to the given choices.\n5. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n\nAdvice:\n\n* Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n* Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n* Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n* Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n* Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n* Remember that the formula for finding the new average is New average = Old average + (Change in weight / Number of items).\n"
