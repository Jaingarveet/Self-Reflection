What is the actual distance, in miles, from Town F to Town G along this road?\nChoices:\n  A: 800\n  B: 720\n  C: 960\n  D: 1140\n  E: 1160\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI made a mistake in my conversion from inches to miles.\nI incorrectly divided 1 inch by 40 miles instead of multiplying by 40 miles.\nThis resulted in an incorrect answer of 200 miles instead of 800 miles.\nError Keywords:\n- Conversion error\n- Unit conversion error\n- Multiplication error\n\nSolution:\nLet's convert the length of the road from inches to miles.\n1/4 inch represents an actual distance of 10 miles.\nSo, 1 inch represents an actual distance of 40 miles.\nNow, we can convert 20 inches to miles:\n20 inches = 20 x 40 = 800 miles\n\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the conversion factor between inches and miles.\n2. Convert 1 inch to miles using the conversion factor.\n3. Multiply the length of the road in inches by the conversion factor to get the actual distance in miles.\n4. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n5. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n6. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\n\nAdvice:\n- Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n- Always use the correct conversion factors when converting units.\n- Always double-check your calculations, especially when working with different units.\n- Remember that multiplication is commutative, meaning the order of the factors does not change the result.\n- Practice converting between different units to become more comfortable with the process.\n"
