Identify the system of equations.\n2. Choose a method to solve the system of equations (substitution or elimination).\n3. Multiply the equations by appropriate values to eliminate decimal points and make the coefficients of one variable the same in both equations.\n4. Subtract one equation from the other to eliminate one variable.\n5. Solve for the remaining variable.\n6. Substitute the value of the variable back into one of the equations to solve for the other variable.\n7. Round the values of the variables to the nearest tenth to match the answer choices.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember to round the values of the variables to the nearest tenth to match the answer choices.\n"
