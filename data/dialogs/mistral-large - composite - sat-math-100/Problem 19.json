Subtract z from both sides of the equation.\n2. Combine like terms.\n3. Divide both sides of the equation by 2.\n4. Simplify the equation.\n5. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\n\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always follow the order of operations.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember to distribute the subtraction sign when subtracting a variable from both sides of an equation.\n - Remember to simplify the equation after combining like terms.\n - Remember to divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of the variable to solve for the variable.\n"
