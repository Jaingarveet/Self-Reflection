        "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n1) Alan currently drives 100 miles per week on average. His car gets 25 miles per gallon.\n2) To calculate his current weekly gas cost:\n   Gallons used per week = 100 miles ÷ 25 miles/gallon = 4 gallons\n   Cost per week = 4 gallons × $4/gallon = $16\n3) Alan wants to reduce his weekly gas cost by $5. So his new weekly cost should be:\n   New cost per week = $16 - $5 = $11\n4) Let's say the reduced number of miles driven per week is m. We can set up an equation:\n   New cost = (miles driven ÷ miles per gallon) × cost per gallon\n   $11 = (m ÷ 25) × $4\n5) Simplify:\n   $11 = (4m ÷ 25)\n   25 × $11 = 4m\n   $275 = 4m\n   m = $275 ÷ 4\n   m = 68.75 miles\n6) The equation that matches this setup is:\n   (4 ÷ 25) × m = 5\n   Rearranging: (4 ÷ 25)m = 5\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: $\\frac{4}{25} m=5$\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
