The speed of the first car is 12 mph, and the speed of the second car is 13 mph.\n\nTime = 80.47 km / (12 mph + 13 mph)\nTime = 80.47 km / 25 mph\nTime = 3.22 hours\n\nTherefore, the cars will meet after 3.22 hours (or 3 hours and 12 minutes) of driving.\n\nI hope this revised solution is correct! Let me know if you have any further questions."
