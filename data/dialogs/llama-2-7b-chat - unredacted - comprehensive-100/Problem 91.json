Drug to treat such a case is:\nChoices:\n  A: Topical antibiotic\n  B: Benzoyl peroxide\n  C: Retinoids\n  D: Estrogen\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI selected option B, Benzoyl peroxide, as the drug to treat comedonal acne, but the correct answer is option C, Retinoids.\n\nComedonal acne is a type of acne that occurs when dead skin cells and oil clog pores.

Identify the type of acne: Comedonal acne is a type of acne that occurs when dead skin cells and oil clog pores.\n2. Understand the treatment options: Retinoids, benzoyl peroxide, and topical antibiotics are common treatments for comedonal acne. Estrogen is not a treatment for comedonal acne.\n3.

Use retinoids as the primary treatment for comedonal acne.\n3. Consider additional treatments, such as benzoyl peroxide or topical antibiotics, if necessary.\n4. Monitor progress and adjust treatment as needed.\n\nAdvice:\n\n1. Consult a dermatologist for personalized advice on treating comedonal acne.\n2.
