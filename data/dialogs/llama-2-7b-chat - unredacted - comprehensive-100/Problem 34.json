This is evident in the statement \"most Acme employees cannot afford housing within a 30-minute commute of Ocean View.\"\n\nAction: Answer(\"E\") Acme's move to Ocean View will not be accompanied by a significant pay raise for Acme employees.\n\nExplanation:\nThe argument assumes that most Acme employees cannot afford housing within a 30-minute commute of Ocean View, which means they will have a long commute after the company moves. Therefore, it is unlikely that Acme will provide a significant pay raise to its employees to compensate for the increased commute time."
