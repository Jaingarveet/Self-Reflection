(2)\n\nWe can solve this system of equations by substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution. Solving equation (1) for x, we get:\n\nx = -3y + 14\n\nNow, substitute this expression for x into equation (2):\n\n-3y + 14 - 2y = -6\n\nExpand and simplify:\n\n-5y = -20\n\nNow, divide both sides by -5:\n\ny = -4\n\nNow, substitute y = -4 into one of the original equations to solve for x. For example, using equation (1):\n\n2x - 3(-4) = -14\n2x = -14 + 12\n2x = -2\n\nNow, divide both sides by 2:\n\nx = -1\n\nSo, x = -1 and y = -4 is a solution to the system of equations.\nNow, we need to find the value of x - y:\n\nx - y = -1 - (-4)\nx - y = 3\n\nThe correct answer is C: -4.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
