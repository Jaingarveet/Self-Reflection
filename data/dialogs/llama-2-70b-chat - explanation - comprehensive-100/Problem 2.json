If there are 6 inches of space between each pair of pickets, which of the following represents the length of fence in feet?\nChoices:\n  A: 13x/2\n  B: 13x/2 - 6\n  C: 13x/24\n  D: (13x+1)/24\n  E: (13x-12)/24\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nThe correct answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED].\n\nThe reasoning for this answer is as follows:\n\n1. The total width of all the pickets is x/2.\n2. The total width with spaces is x/2 + 6.\n3. The length of the fence is the total width times the number of pickets, which is x/2 + 6 \\* 13 = [REDACTED] + 78.\n4. To find the length of the fence in feet, we need to convert the result from inches to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so we can divide the result by 12: [REDACTED] + 78 / 12 = [REDACTED].\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED].\n"
