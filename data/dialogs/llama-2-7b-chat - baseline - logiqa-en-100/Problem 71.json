This suggests that the main reason why people prefer to hire college students as nannies is not because they are the best at housekeeping, but rather because they believe it is a valuable opportunity for the students to gain practical experience and build their resume. This explains the seemingly contradictory phenomenon where 63% of the respondents favor college students as nannies, but nearly 60% would not ask them to do housework."
