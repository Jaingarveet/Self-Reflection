However, the argument itself is not providing any such standard, and it is circular to assume that there is a standard for judging arguments without providing one.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\") - The above argument has a logical error of \"confused concept\". The argument is confusing the concept of subjectivity with the concept of objectivity, and it is trying to use subjectivity as a basis for objectivity."
