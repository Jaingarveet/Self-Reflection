Additionally, the experts' beliefs may be based on incomplete or outdated information. Therefore, it is more important to improve drivers' traffic safety awareness than to rely solely on strict management of drunk driving. By addressing the root causes of traffic accidents, such as driver behavior and awareness, the incidence of accidents can be reduced more effectively."
