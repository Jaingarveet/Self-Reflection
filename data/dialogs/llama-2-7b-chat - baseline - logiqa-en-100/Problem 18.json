By coming forward to refute the rumors, the celebrity can regain control of the narrative and prevent the gossip news from spreading further. This is the only option that can potentially mitigate the damage to their personal reputation. Choices \"A\" and \"D\" are not valid options, as they do not address the situation effectively. Choice \"B\" is also not valid, as it implies that the celebrity's reputation will not be affected by gossip news in the media, which is not necessarily true."
