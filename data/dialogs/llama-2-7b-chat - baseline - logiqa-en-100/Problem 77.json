Since K is not in the printing group, J cannot be in the printing group either.\nFrom condition (4), we know that M is at least one of the members of the two groups.\nFrom condition (5), we know that at least one of the same employees is in both groups.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each of the given options:\n\nA: The binding group and the printing group happen to have a common member.\nThis is not true because, according to condition (3), J cannot be in the printing group if K is in the group. Therefore, there cannot be a common member between the two groups.\n\nB: The binding group and the printing group have exactly two members in common.\nThis is true because, according to condition (5), at least one of the same employees is in both groups. Since there are only three members in the printing group, the only common member between the two groups is G, H, and L.\n\nC: The number of members in the binding and printing groups is the same.\nThis is false because the printing group has only three members, while the binding group has at least four members (according to condition (1)).\n\nD: The number of members of the bookbinding group is at least one more than that of the printing group.\nThis is false because the printing group has three members, and the binding group has at least four members (according to condition (1)).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: The binding group and the printing group have exactly two members in common."
