If X is allocated in the sales department, W is allocated in the production department.\n\nFrom condition 1, we know that H and Y must be in the same department. Let's assume H and Y are both in the production department (P).\n\nFrom condition 2, we know that F and G cannot be in the same department. So, F must be in a different department than G. Let's assume F is in the sales department (S).\n\nFrom condition 3, we know that if X is in the sales department, W is in the production department. So, X is in the sales department (S).\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA: G is assigned to the sales department.\nThis option is false because G is not in the sales department (by condition 2).\n\nB: H is assigned to the production department.\nThis option is true because H is in the production department (by condition 1).\n\nC: I was assigned to the sales department.\nThis option is false because I is not in the sales department (by condition 2).\n\nD: W is assigned to the public relations department.\nThis option is false because W is in the production department (by condition 3).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: H is assigned to the production department."
