Therefore, the position of F can be represented as:\n\nF | H\n\nFrom (2), we know that I and E are adjacent. Therefore, the position of I can be represented as:\n\nI | E\n\nFrom (3), we know that G is somewhere in the north of F. Therefore, the position of G can be represented as:\n\nG | F\n\nNow, we have the positions of all the islands in the diagram:\n\nE | F | G | H | I\n\nThere are 5 possible arrangements for this group of islands:\n\n1. E | F | G | H | I\n2. E | F | I | G | H\n3. E | G | F | H | I\n4. E | G | I | F | H\n5. E | H | G | F | I\n\nSo, the answer is (C) 4 possible arrangements."
