Therefore, the first two houses must be L and M, in that order, since L must be shown after K and before M.\nThe third, fourth, and fifth houses to be shown will be shown in the afternoon. Since K cannot be shown in the morning, it must be shown in the afternoon. Therefore, K must be one of the houses shown in the afternoon.\nThe sixth and seventh houses to be shown will be shown in the evening.

I also did not consider the rule that J must be shown in the evening. I have now considered these rules and have determined that the correct answer is \"B: L is shown in the afternoon.\""
