        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Exactly five witnesses—Franco, Garcia, Hong, Iturbe, and Jackson—are to be scheduled to testify at a hearing that is to take exactly three days of one week—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Each witness testifies on exactly one day of the hearing. The schedule must meet the following conditions: Franco does not testify on the same day that Garcia testifies. Iturbe testifies on Wednesday. Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday. Hong does not testify on Monday. At least one witness testifies on Monday.\nQuestion: If Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong, which one of the following must be true of the schedule?\nChoices:\n  A: Franco is scheduled to testify on Wednesday.\n  B: Garcia is scheduled to testify on Monday.\n  C: Garcia is scheduled to testify on Wednesday.\n  D: Hong is scheduled to testify on Tuesday.\n  E: Iturbe is the only witness scheduled to testify on Wednesday.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI made an incorrect assumption about the witnesses' schedules.\nThe gap in my knowledge was not in law but in logical reasoning.\nI knew the conditions for the schedule but made an incorrect inference.\nError Keywords:\n - Incorrect assumption\n - Logical reasoning error\n - Inference error\nSolution:\nSince Franco and Garcia cannot testify on the same day, and Iturbe is already scheduled to testify on Wednesday, Franco and Garcia must testify on either Monday or Tuesday.\nSince exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday, and Franco and Hong must testify on the same day, Franco and Hong must be scheduled to testify on Tuesday.\nTherefore, Garcia must be scheduled to testify on Monday.\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the conditions for the schedule.\n2. Identify the possible days for each witness to testify based on the conditions.\n3. Identify the day on which Franco and Hong must testify together.\n4. Identify the day on which Garcia must testify based on the conditions.\n5. Choose the answer that matches your inferred schedule.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never make assumptions; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your inferences and final answer.\n - Remember that logical reasoning is a critical skill in law.\n"
