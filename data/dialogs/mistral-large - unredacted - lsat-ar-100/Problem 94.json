        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: A shopping center has exactly seven spaces—space 1 through space 7—arranged in a straight row. Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.\nQuestion: If the veterinarian is in space 5, which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: The optometrist is in space 2.\n  B: The pharmacy is in space 7.\n  C: A restaurant is in space 4.\n  D: The shoe store is in space 6.\n  E: The toy store is in space 3.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI made an error in my reasoning by not considering all the possible options for the restaurants.\nThe gap in my knowledge was not in the law but in logical reasoning.\nI knew the correct constraints but made a reasoning error.\n\nError Keywords:\n- Logical reasoning error\n- Incomplete analysis\n- Incorrect assumption\n\nSolution:\nThe pharmacy must be at one end of the row, so it can only be in space 1 or space 7.\nSince the veterinarian is in space 5, the pharmacy cannot be next to it, so it must be in space 1.\nThe two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, so they cannot be in spaces 2 and 3, or spaces 6 and 7.\nSince the pharmacy is in space 1, the only possible spaces for the restaurants are spaces 3 and 7, or spaces 4 and 6.\nSince the veterinarian is in space 5, the only possible spaces for the restaurants are spaces 2 and 6, or spaces 3 and 7.\nHowever, since the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, it cannot be in space 4 or space 6.\nTherefore, the only possible space for the toy store is space 3, and the only possible space for one of the restaurants is space 4.\n\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the constraints given in the problem.\n2. Consider all the possible options for each business based on the constraints.\n3. Eliminate the options that violate the constraints.\n4. Work step-by-step through your logical reasoning.\n5. Double-check your reasoning to ensure accuracy.\n6. Choose the answer that matches your logical conclusion.\n\nAdvice:\n- Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n- Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n- Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n- Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n- Always double-check your reasoning and final answer.\n- Remember that logical reasoning requires considering all possible options and eliminating the ones that violate the constraints.\n"
