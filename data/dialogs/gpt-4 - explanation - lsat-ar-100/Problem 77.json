Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.\nQuestion: For how many of the six new employees is the assignment of a parking space limited to one of only two possible spaces?\nChoices:\n  A: none\n  B: two\n  C: three\n  D: four\n  E: five\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI answered the question incorrectly because I failed to fully consider the implications of each rule on the parking space assignments. I only considered the direct limitations imposed by each rule, but I did not consider how these rules interacted with each other to further limit the options for each employee.\n"

Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.\n4. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.\nFrom these rules, we can deduce that:\n- Togowa can only be assigned parking space #1 or #2 because Young must have a higher number and Robertson (who must have a higher number than Young) can only go up to #4.\n- Young can only be assigned parking space #3 or #4 because he must have a higher number than Togowa (who can only be #1 or #2) and a lower number than Robertson (who can only be #1, #2, #3, or #4).\n- Robertson can only be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4 as per the rules.\nSo, Togowa, Young, and Robertson each have only two possible spaces they can be assigned to.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
