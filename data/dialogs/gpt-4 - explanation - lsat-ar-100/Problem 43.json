Three of the articles—G, H, and J—cover finance; three other articles—Q, R, and S—cover nutrition; and the remaining article, Y, covers wildlife. The order in which the articles are edited is subject to the following conditions: Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other. S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third. S must be earlier than Y. J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.\nQuestion: If Y is fourth, which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: J is second.\n  B: J is third\n  C: Q is first.\n  D: Q is third\n  E: R is seventh.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI misunderstood the conditions given in the question. I failed to consider that if Y is fourth, then S, which must be earlier than Y, cannot be third because Q can only be third if S is earlier than Q. This led me to incorrectly eliminate option [REDACTED] and choose option [REDACTED].\n"
