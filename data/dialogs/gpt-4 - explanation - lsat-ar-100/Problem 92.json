Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.\nQuestion: Quinn CANNOT work in the same sales zone as which one of the following?\nChoices:\n  A: Kim\n  B: Mahr\n  C: Stuckey\n  D: Tiao\n  E: Udall\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI answered the question incorrectly because I misunderstood the conditions. I incorrectly assumed that if Quinn and [REDACTED] were in the same zone, Parra and [REDACTED] would also be in the same zone. However, the conditions do not state that Parra and [REDACTED] cannot be in the same zone. The conditions only state that either Parra or [REDACTED] (but not both) works in Zone 1, and either [REDACTED] or [REDACTED] (but not both) works in Zone 2. Therefore, my assumption was incorrect.\n"
