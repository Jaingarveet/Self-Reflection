Each witness testifies on exactly one day of the hearing. The schedule must meet the following conditions: Franco does not testify on the same day that Garcia testifies. Iturbe testifies on Wednesday. Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday. Hong does not testify on Monday. At least one witness testifies on Monday.\nQuestion: If Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong, which one of the following must be true of the schedule?\nChoices:\n  A: Franco is scheduled to testify on Wednesday.\n  B: Garcia is scheduled to testify on Monday.\n  C: Garcia is scheduled to testify on Wednesday.\n  D: Hong is scheduled to testify on Tuesday.\n  E: Iturbe is the only witness scheduled to testify on Wednesday.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI misunderstood the question and made an incorrect assumption. I assumed that since Franco and Hong testify on the same day, and Hong cannot testify on Monday, they must testify on Tuesday. However, the question does not specify that Franco and Hong cannot testify on Wednesday. This led me to incorrectly conclude that Garcia must testify on Monday.\n"

Therefore, Hong must be scheduled to testify on Tuesday.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
