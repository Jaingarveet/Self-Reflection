Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.\nQuestion: If the shoe store is in space 4, which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: The optometrist is next to a restaurant.\n  B: The pharmacy is next to the veterinarian.\n  C: A restaurant is next to the toy store.\n  D: The shoe store is next to the toy store.\n  E: The shoe store is next to the veterinarian.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI answered the question incorrectly because I misunderstood the constraints. I assumed that the pharmacy and the restaurant must be in spaces 7 and 1, respectively, which led me to conclude that the optometrist must be in space 6. However, the constraints only state that the pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other, not specifically which end. This led me to the incorrect conclusion that the optometrist is next to a restaurant.\n"

The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian. The shoe store is in space 4. Given these constraints, the only option that must be true is that the pharmacy is next to the veterinarian. This is because the pharmacy must be at one end, and it must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. Since the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, the pharmacy must be next to the veterinarian to satisfy all constraints.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
