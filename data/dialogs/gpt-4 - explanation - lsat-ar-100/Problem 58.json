Each bay is holding a different one of exactly six types of cargoâ€”fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles. The following apply: The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock. The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles. The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel. The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.\nQuestion: Which one of the following CANNOT be the type of cargo held in bay 4?\nChoices:\n  A: grain\n  B: livestock\n  C: machinery\n  D: produce\n  E: textiles\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI answered the question incorrectly because I misunderstood the constraints given in the problem. I incorrectly assumed that [REDACTED] could not be in bay 4 because it must be in a higher-numbered bay than [REDACTED]. However, the correct answer is [REDACTED], which cannot be in bay 4 because it must be in a higher-numbered bay than both [REDACTED] and [REDACTED].\n"

Therefore, the type of cargo that cannot be held in bay 4 is textiles.\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
