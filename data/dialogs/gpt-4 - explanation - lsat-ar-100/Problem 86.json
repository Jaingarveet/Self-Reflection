The following apply: The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock. The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles. The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.

The bay holding livestock must be lower than the bay holding grain and higher than the bay holding textiles. Therefore, the bay holding livestock must be either bay 2 or bay 1. The bay holding fuel must be lower than the bay holding produce, so it must be either bay 1, bay 2, or bay 3. However, since bay 2 or bay 1 may be holding livestock, the bay holding fuel must be bay 3. Therefore, the bay holding textiles must be bay 5. This means that the bay holding livestock must be bay 2. Therefore, the cargo for bays 2, 3, 4, and 5 is completely determined.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
