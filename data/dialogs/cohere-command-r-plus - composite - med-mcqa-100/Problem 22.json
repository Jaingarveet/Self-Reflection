Read the question carefully and identify the specific term \"isthmus classification.\"\n2. Recall the contributions of Dr. [REDACTED] to endodontics, specifically his root canal isthmus classification.\n3. Avoid misassociating root canal classifications with other notable endodontists, such as [REDACTED], who focused on the number of canals rather than isthmi.\n4. Select the correct choice, which is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n - Pay close attention to the specific terms or keywords in the question.\n - Be mindful of potential misassociations, especially when multiple notable figures are involved.\n - Ensure that your answer directly addresses the specific aspect mentioned in the question.\n"
