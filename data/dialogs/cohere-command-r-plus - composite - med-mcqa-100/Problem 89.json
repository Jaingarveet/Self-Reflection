Understand Spondylolisthesis and its standard diagnostic approach.\n2. Recognize that AP X-rays are essential for initial diagnosis.\n3. Identify that [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] scans are not always necessary but have specific indications.\n4. Choose the answer that represents the most routine and fundamental diagnostic tool.\nAdvice:\n - Ensure you have a solid understanding of the standard diagnostic approach for common conditions.\n - Avoid making assumptions based on specialized or advanced techniques.\n - Consider the fundamental tools used in initial diagnosis.\n - Remember that the most common and widely accessible investigation is often the correct answer.\n - Do not overthink the question; rely on your foundational knowledge.\n"
