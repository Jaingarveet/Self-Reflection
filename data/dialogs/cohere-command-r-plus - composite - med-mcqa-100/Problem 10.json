Understand the question: Identify the pattern in question and its key characteristics. \n2. Review and understand each option: Interpret each pattern name and its corresponding visual structure. \n3. Connect patterns to names: Establish clear connections between the visual patterns and their descriptive names. \n4. Match description to pattern: Compare the provided description with the options and select the most fitting pattern name. \n\nAdvice:\n- Familiarize yourself with the unique characteristics of each pattern and their corresponding names. \n- Take time to visualize and associate the patterns with their real-world equivalents to strengthen memory and recognition. \n- Practice pattern recognition and naming to improve accuracy and speed. \n- When faced with similar questions, take a systematic approach by breaking down patterns and names into constituent parts for easier comparison and matching.\n"
