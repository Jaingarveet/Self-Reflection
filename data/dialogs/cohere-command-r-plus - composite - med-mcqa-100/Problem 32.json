        "content": "Topic: Medicine\nSubtopic: ENT\nQuestion: 60-year-old male complaints of right-sided nasal obstruction and nasal discharge, which sometimes is blood tinged. Biopsy finding is also shown below. What is your diagnosis?\nChoices:\n  A: Rhinoscleroma\n  B: Wegener's granulomatosis\n  C: Stewa's granuloma\n  D: Rhinosporidiosis\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI focused on the patient's symptoms and biopsy result, which led me to consider an autoimmune disorder as the primary possibility. However, I overlooked the critical detail of geographic location and the patient's travel history, which is a key factor in the correct diagnosis of [REDACTED]. This is a disease caused by a parasite often found in specific regions, and travel history is an important indicator.\n\nError Keywords:\n - Overlooked geographic factor\n - Insufficient travel history consideration\n - Biopsy misinterpretation\n\nSolution:\nThe patient's symptoms of unilateral nasal obstruction and blood-tinged nasal discharge are nonspecific and could be indicative of various conditions. The biopsy image shows a characteristic spherule with an endospores arrangement, which is pathognomonic for [REDACTED]. This disease is caused by the parasite *Rhinosporidium seeberi*, often found in specific geographic regions, particularly in endemic areas with still water like ponds and lakes. Therefore, the patient's travel history to such regions would be a crucial factor in making the correct diagnosis.\n\nInstructions:\n1. Consider the patient's demographic information, including age, gender, and geographic location.\n2. Evaluate the presented symptoms, such as unilateral nasal obstruction and blood-tinged nasal discharge.\n3. Assess the biopsy image for characteristic features.\n4. Recognize the significance of travel history to endemic areas for certain parasites.\n5. Correlate the clinical presentation, biopsy findings, and epidemiological factors to reach a diagnosis.\n\nAdvice:\n - Always consider demographic and geographic factors, especially in infectious or parasitic diseases.\n - Evaluate all provided information, including symptoms, laboratory results, and imaging.\n - Interpret biopsy images carefully and look for characteristic features.\n - Keep a broad differential diagnosis and consider the possibility of less common conditions.\n - Correlate clinical, laboratory, and epidemiological data for a comprehensive assessment.\n"
