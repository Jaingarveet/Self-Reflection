My mistake was not recognizing that NADH is the reduced form of NA[REDACTED].\n\nError Keywords:\n- Recall error\n- Overlooked detail\n- Missed conversion\n\nSolution:\nAnaerobic glycolysis is the process of breaking down glucose in the absence of oxygen. It occurs in certain conditions, such as during intense exercise when oxygen supply to muscles is limited. The end products of anaerobic glycolysis are indeed [REDACTED] molecules and 2 molecules of NADH. However, the correct answer choice in this context is \"[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]\" because NADH is the reduced form of NA[REDACTED], and it is formed by the addition of electrons and a hydrogen ion to NA[REDACTED].\n\nInstructions:\n1. Read the question and identify the biological process: anaerobic glycolysis.\n2. Recall the end products of anaerobic glycolysis: ATP and NADH.\n3. Recognize that NADH is the reduced form of NA[REDACTED] and that NA[REDACTED] is the correct answer choice.\n4. Select answer option \"[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]\" as the correct answer.\n\nAdvice:\n- Read the question carefully and identify the biological process in question.\n- Recall the end products of anaerobic glycolysis, including energy molecules and electron carriers.\n- Consider the reduced and oxidized forms of electron carriers, such as NADH and NA[REDACTED].\n- Pay attention to the specific molecules listed in the answer choices and their roles in the process.\n- Avoid making assumptions and overlooking details; carefully evaluate each answer choice.\n"
