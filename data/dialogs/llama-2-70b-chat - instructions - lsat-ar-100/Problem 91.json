Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other.\n2. S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.\n3. S must be earlier than Y.\n4. J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.\n\nNow, let's create a sequence of articles that satisfies all the conditions:\n\n1. S (nutrition)\n2. J (finance)\n3. Q (nutrition)\n4. G (finance)\n5. R (nutrition)\n6. H (finance)\n7. Y (wildlife)\n\nNow, let's check each choice:\n\nA: G is second - Violates condition 4, as G must be earlier than R.\nB: H is second - Violates condition 3, as H is a finance article and should not be consecutive to J.\nC: S is second - Violates condition 2, as S and Q cover the same topic (nutrition).\nD: R is third - Satisfies all conditions.\nE: Y is third - Violates condition 5, as Y must be later than S.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: R is third.\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
