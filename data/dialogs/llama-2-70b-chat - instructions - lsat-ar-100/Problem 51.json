Each rider will then test a different one of the bicycles on the second day. Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day. The assignment of riders to bicycles is subject to the following conditions: Reynaldo cannot test F. Yuki cannot test J. Theresa must be one of the testers for H. The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.\nQuestion: Which one of the following is a possible assignment of riders to bicycles, with the riders for each bicycle listed in the order in which they test the bicycle?\nChoices:\n  A: F: Seamus, Reynaldo; G: Yuki, Seamus; H: Theresa, Yuki; J: Reynaldo, Theresa\n  B: F: Seamus, Yuki; G: Reynaldo, Theresa; H: Yuki, Seamus; J: Theresa, Reynaldo\n  C: F: Yuki, Seamus; G: Seamus, Reynaldo; H: Theresa, Yuki; J: Reynaldo, Theresa\n  D: F: Yuki, Seamus; G: Theresa, Reynaldo; H: Reynaldo, Theresa; J: Seamus, Yuki\n  E: F: Yuki, Theresa; G: Seamus, Yuki; H: Theresa, Reynaldo; J: Reynaldo, Seamus\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n"
