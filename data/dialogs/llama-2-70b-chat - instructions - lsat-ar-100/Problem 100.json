The order of their performance must satisfy the following conditions: T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R. At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F. O is performed either first or fifth. The eighth composition performed is either L or H. P is performed at some time before S. At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.\nQuestion: Which one of the following lists the compositions in an order in which they could be performed during the concert, from first through eighth?\nChoices:\n  A: L, P, S, R, O, T, F, H\n  B: O, T, P, F, S, H, R, L\n  C: P, T, F, S, L, R, O, H\n  D: P, T, F, S, O, R, L, H\n  E: T, F, P, R, O, L, S, H\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n\n1. Read the problem carefully and make sure you understand all the conditions that must be satisfied.\n2. Decompose the problem into smaller sub-problems, focusing on one condition at a time.\n3. Use a step-by-step approach to solve the problem, ensuring that each condition is satisfied in the correct order.\n4. Double-check your work to ensure that all conditions are satisfied and that there are no errors in your reasoning.\n5.
