Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.\nQuestion: If Young is assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, then which one of the following could be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Togowa is assigned parking space #1.\n  B: Young is assigned parking space #2.\n  C: Robertson is assigned parking space #3.\n  D: Souza is assigned parking space #3.\n  E: Vaughn is assigned parking space #4.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n"

Therefore, Souza cannot be assigned parking space #1, which means that Togowa cannot be assigned parking space #1 either.\n\nWith that in mind, let's re-evaluate the options:\n\nOption A: Togowa is assigned parking space #1. [REDACTED]\n\nOption B: Young is assigned parking space #2. This is a possibility, as Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, and Souza cannot be assigned parking space #2.\n\nOption C: Robertson is assigned parking space #3. This is a possibility, as Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young, and Young cannot be assigned parking space #3.\n\nOption D: Souza is assigned parking space #3. [REDACTED]\n\nOption E: Vaughn is assigned parking space #4. This is a possibility, as Vaughn can be assigned any parking space that is not already assigned to Robertson, Young, Togowa, or Souza.\n\nBased on my reflection and re-evaluation of the options, the correct answer is:\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
