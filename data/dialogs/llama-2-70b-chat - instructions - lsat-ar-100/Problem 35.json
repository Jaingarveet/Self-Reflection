Read the problem carefully and understand the conditions.\n2. Break down the problem step-by-step.\n3. Infer the information that can be deduced from the given information.\n4. Evaluate the choices and determine which one is false.\n5. Answer the question.\n\nSelf-Reflection:\nPreviously, I answered this question incorrectly by selecting choice A.\nUpon reflection, I realized that my mistake was due to a lack of careful analysis of the given information.\nI misunderstood the condition that states \"No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day\" and incorrectly assumed that each day would have at least one batch of each kind of cookie.\nI also overlooked the fact that the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies, and the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.\nTo answer this question correctly, I need to carefully evaluate the choices and deduce the information that can be inferred from the given conditions.\n\nBreakdown of the problem:\n1. The bakery makes three kinds of cookies: oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.\n2. Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday).\n3. Each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day.\n4. No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.\n5. At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.\n6. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.\n7. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.\n\nInference:\nFrom condition 4, we can infer that each day will have at most one batch of each kind of cookie.\nFrom condition 6, we can infer that the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on the same day as the second batch of oatmeal cookies.\nFrom condition 7, we can infer that the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.\n\nEvaluation of choices:\nA. At least one batch of cookies is made on each of the five days.\nThis choice is false.\nFrom the given conditions, we know that each day will have at most one batch of each kind of cookie.\nTherefore, it is possible that a day may not have any batch of a particular kind of cookie.\nB. At least two batches of cookies are made on Wednesday.\nThis choice is false.\nFrom the given conditions, we know that the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.\nTherefore, Wednesday cannot have two batches of cookies.\nC. Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday.\nThis choice is true.\nFrom condition 5, we know that at least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.\nSince each day can have at most one batch of each kind of cookie, Monday must have exactly one batch of cookies.\nD. Exactly two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday.\nThis choice is false.\nFrom the given conditions, we know that the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.\nTherefore, Tuesday cannot have two batches of cookies.\nE. Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Friday.\nThis choice is true.\nFrom condition 4, we know that each day will have at most one batch of each kind of cookie.\nSince Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday each have at most one batch of cookies, Friday must have exactly one batch of cookies.\n\nConclusion:\nTherefore, the answer is B. At least two batches of cookies are made on Wednesday.\nThis choice is false because Wednesday cannot have two batches of cookies due to the second batch of sugar cookies being made on Thursday.\nBy carefully evaluating the choices and inferring the information that can be deduced from the given conditions, I have arrived at the correct answer.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
