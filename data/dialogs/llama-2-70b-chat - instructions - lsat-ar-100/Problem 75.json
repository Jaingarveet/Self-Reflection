I mistakenly assumed that Lopez reviewed Sunset, when in fact, it was Jiang who reviewed Sunset. I also incorrectly assumed that Megregian reviewed Tamerlane, when in fact, it was Kramer and O'Neill who reviewed Tamerlane.\n\nTo correctly answer the question, I needed to carefully read and understand the given conditions. I identified the student who reviews the most plays, which is Megregian. I determined which plays Jiang reviews, which is Sunset. I also determined which plays Megregian and Lopez do not review, which is Sunset. Additionally, I determined which plays Kramer and O'Neill review, which is Tamerlane. Lastly, I identified the student who reviews Sunset, which is Lopez.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: Lopez."
