After reviewing the problem, I realized that I misunderstood the condition that states \"if Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.\" I thought this meant that Nina couldn't give a report on Wednesday, but that's not what the condition states.\n\nLooking at the choices again, I see that choice B has Nina giving a report on Wednesday morning, which is allowed under the conditions. Therefore, choice B is the correct answer.\n\nHere's the corrected answer:\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
