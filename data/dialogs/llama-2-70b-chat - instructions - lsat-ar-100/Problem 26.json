Each solo will be either a modern piece or a traditional piece. The choice of pianist and type of piece for the solos must conform to the following conditions: The third solo is a traditional piece. Exactly two of the traditional pieces are performed consecutively. In the fourth solo, either Wayne performs a traditional piece or Zara performs a modern piece. The pianist who performs the second solo does not perform the fifth solo. No traditional piece is performed until Wayne performs at least one modem piece.\nQuestion: What is the minimum number of solos in which Wayne performs a traditional piece?\nChoices:\n  A: zero\n  B: one\n  C: two\n  D: three\n  E: four\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n\n1.
