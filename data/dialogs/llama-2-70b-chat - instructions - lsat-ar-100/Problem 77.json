Read the question carefully and understand the rules governing the assignment of parking spaces.\nThe rules are:\n* Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.\n* Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.\n* Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.\n* Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.\n2.

Choose the answer that matches the count.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")\n\nReflection:\nMy previous mistake was not carefully evaluating the rules and their impact on each employee's parking space assignment. I incorrectly assumed that Robertson had limited options, which led me to choose answer \"C\" (three employees with limited options). This time, I carefully evaluated each employee's options and identified only two employees with limited options, Young and Togowa. Therefore, the correct answer is \"B\" (two employees with limited options)."
