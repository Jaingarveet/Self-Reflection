Check the answer choices and select the one that is not true based on the inferred schedule.\nAction: Answer(\"D\") \n\nJulio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's, so Julio's session must be on Wednesday or Thursday, and Olivia's session must be on Thursday or Friday.\nLan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day, so Lan's session must be on Wednesday or Thursday, and Olivia's session must be on Thursday or Friday.\nNessa must lead an afternoon session, so Nessa's session must be on Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday afternoon.\nKevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day, so Kevin's session must be on Wednesday or Thursday, and Rebecca's session must be on Wednesday or Thursday.\nBased on the inferred schedule, the only answer that is not true is:\n\nD: Olivia's session meets Thursday morning.\n\nOlivia's session cannot meet on Thursday morning because Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's, and Julio's session cannot meet on Thursday morning because Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
