The following conditions must apply: Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.\nQuestion: If Jiang does not review Tamerlane, then which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Jiang reviews Sunset.\n  B: Lopez reviews Undulation.\n  C: Megregian reviews Sunset.\n  D: Megregian reviews Tamerlane.\n  E: O'Neill reviews Undulation.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n1.

After reflecting on the problem, my solution, and the correct answer, I realize that I missed a crucial condition that eliminates one of the answer choices.\nLet's break down the problem step-by-step:\n1. Kramer and Lopez each review fewer plays than Megregian.\n2. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.\n3. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.\n4. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.\nIf Jiang does not review Tamerlane, then we can deduce the following:\n1. Jiang reviews Sunset (Choice A).\n2. Lopez reviews Undulation (Choice B).\n3. Megregian reviews Sunset (Choice C).\nGiven that Kramer and Lopez each review fewer plays than Megregian, Megregian must review at least two plays. Since Megregian does not review Tamerlane, she must review Sunset and another play. Therefore, Choice C is correct.\nThe correct answer is C: Megregian reviews Sunset.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
