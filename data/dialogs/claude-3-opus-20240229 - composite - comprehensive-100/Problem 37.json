        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: People who are allergic to cats are actually allergic to certain proteins found in the animals' skin secretions and saliva; which particular proteins are responsible, however, varies from allergy sufferer to allergy sufferer. Since all cats shed skin and spread saliva around their environment, there is no such thing as a cat incapable of provoking allergic reactions, although it is common for a given cat to cause an allergic reaction in some-but not all-people who are allergic to cats.\nQuestion: Which one of the following statements is most strongly supported by the information above?\nChoices:\n  A: Any particular individual will be allergic to some breeds of cat but not to others.\n  B: No cat is capable of causing an allergic reaction in all types of allergy sufferers.\n  C: Not all cats are identical with respect to the proteins contained in their skin secretions and saliva.\n  D: The allergic reactions of some people who are allergic to cats are more intense than the allergic reactions of other allergy sufferers.\n  E: There is no way to predict whether a given cat will produce an allergic reaction in a particular allergy sufferer.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI focused too much on the variability in allergic reactions between individuals, and not enough on the variability in the proteins produced by different cats. While the passage does strongly support that no cat causes allergies in all people, upon re-reading, it also directly states that the particular proteins responsible for allergies vary from person to person. This implies that cats must differ in the specific proteins they produce.\nError Keywords:\n - Misinterpretation of key information\n - Overlooking directly stated facts\n - Overemphasis on tangential points\n - Insufficient re-evaluation of all answer choices\nSolution:\nThe passage states: \"which particular proteins are responsible, however, varies from allergy sufferer to allergy sufferer.\" \nThis directly implies that cats produce different allergy-causing proteins.\nIf all cats produced the exact same proteins, the proteins causing an individual's allergies would not vary.\nTherefore, not all cats are identical with respect to the proteins in their skin secretions and saliva.\nWhile the passage also supports that no cat causes allergies in everyone, this implication about protein variability in cats is more direct.\nInstructions:\n1. Read the passage carefully, noting all directly stated facts.\n2. Identify the key pieces of information, ignoring tangential points.\n3. Analyze each answer choice in light of the key information.\n4. Determine which choice is most directly supported by the facts as stated.\n5. Re-read the passage to confirm your selected answer is fully supported.\n6. If multiple choices seem supported, determine which has the strongest and most direct support.\n7. Do not infer beyond what is directly implied by the stated information.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the passage multiple times to ensure full comprehension.\n - Focus on the facts directly stated, not just the implications you draw.\n - Be careful not to overemphasize tangential or less relevant information.\n - Always re-evaluate all the choices after your initial selection.\n - The correct answer will be strongly and directly supported, not just potentially inferred.\n - Avoid making assumptions beyond what is clearly implied by the passage.\n - Remember that the question asks what is most supported, not just possibly true.\n"

        "content": "Okay, let's carefully analyze the passage and answer choices:\nThe key facts stated are:\n1) Cat allergies are caused by certain proteins in cats' skin secretions and saliva\n2) The particular proteins responsible vary from person to person\n3) All cats shed skin and spread saliva in their environment\n4) No cat is incapable of causing allergies, but a cat may cause reactions in some allergic people but not others\nLooking at each answer choice:\nA) This is not directly supported. The passage discusses variability in people's reactions, not breeds of cats.\nB) This is somewhat supported, as the passage says a cat may cause reactions in some but not all allergic people. However, it's not the strongest answer.\nC) This is the most strongly supported answer. If the proteins responsible vary between allergy sufferers, the proteins must differ between cats. Otherwise there would be no variation.\nD) The passage does not compare the intensity of reactions, only whether a reaction occurs at all.\nE) This is contradicted by the statement that a cat may cause reactions in some allergic people but not others. That implies some predictability.\nUpon re-reading, answer C is most directly supported by the information given. The variability in allergy-causing proteins between individuals necessarily means that cats differ in the proteins they produce.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
