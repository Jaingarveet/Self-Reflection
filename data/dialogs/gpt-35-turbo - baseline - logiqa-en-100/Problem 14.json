According to the third statement, the Administration Department is above the Planning Department, but below the Human Resources Department. Therefore, the Human Resources Department must be on the 6th floor. Since the Sales Department is not adjacent to the Human Resources Department, it cannot be on the 5th floor. Therefore, the Sales Department must be on the 4th floor or lower. The only option that satisfies this condition is that the Sales Department is one level above the Administration Department, which is option B."
