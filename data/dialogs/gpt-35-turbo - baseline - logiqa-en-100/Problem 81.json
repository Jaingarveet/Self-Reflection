        "content": "Topic: Logic\nContext: Research has found that insects “breathe” through the stomata system on their bodies.The stomata are connected to the trachea, and more and more layers of smaller and smaller air are attached from top to bottom, thereby bringing oxygen to the whole body.At the current level of oxygen in the atmosphere, the total length of the stomata system has reached the limit; if the total length exceeds this limit, the oxygen supply capacity will be insufficient.Therefore, it can be judged that the amount of oxygen content can determine the size of insects.\nQuestion: Which of the following, if true, would best support the above argument?\nChoices:\n  A: Studies of invertebrates in the ocean have also found that in colder water and with higher oxygen content, the organisms there are also larger\n  B: During the Carboniferous period, the concentration of oxygen in the earth ’s atmosphere was as high as 35%, much higher than the current 21%.At that time, there were many giant insects on the earth, and the wingspan of the dragonfly was close to one meter.\n  C: Small locusts cannot survive in a low-oxygen environment, especially in an environment with an oxygen concentration below 15%.Adult locusts can survive in an environment with 2% oxygen\n  D: Under the environment with high oxygen content and high air pressure, the tested fruit flies lived to the fifth generation and their body size increased by 20%\n"
