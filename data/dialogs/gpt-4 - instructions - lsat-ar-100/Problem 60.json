Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.\nFrom these conditions, we can deduce that:\n- Day 1 cannot be Himalayan (condition 4) and Day 7 cannot be the same breed as Day 1 (condition 3), so Day 7 also cannot be Himalayan. \n- Since Himalayans are featured on exactly three days (condition 4), the only possible days for Himalayans are Day 2, Day 4, and Day 6.\n- No breed is featured on any two consecutive days (condition 2), so the breeds on Day 3 and Day 5 must be different from Himalayan, and the breeds on Day 1, Day 3, Day 5, and Day 7 must be different from each other.\nComparing these deductions with the options given, only option C fits all the conditions.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
