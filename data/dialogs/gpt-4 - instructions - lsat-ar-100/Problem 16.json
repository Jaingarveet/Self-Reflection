Each session will be led by a different lab assistant—Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, or Rebecca. The assignment of lab assistants to sessions is constrained as follows: Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day. Nessa must lead an afternoon session. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.\nQuestion: Which one of the following could he an accurate assignment of lab assistants to morning and afternoon sessions, respectively, on the three days?\nChoices:\n  A: Wednesday: Rebecca, Kevin Thursday: Julio, Lan Friday: Nessa, Olivia\n  B: Wednesday: Olivia, Nessa Thursday: Julio, Lan Friday: Kevin, Rebecca\n  C: Wednesday: Lan, Kevin Thursday: Rebecca, Julio Friday: Olivia, Nessa\n  D: Wednesday: Kevin, Rebecca Thursday: Julio, Nessa Friday: Olivia, Lan\n  E: Wednesday: Julio, Lan Thursday: Olivia, Nessa Friday: Rebecca, Kevin\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n1.
