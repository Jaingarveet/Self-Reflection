Each session will be led by a different lab assistant—Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, or Rebecca. The assignment of lab assistants to sessions is constrained as follows: Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day. Nessa must lead an afternoon session. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.\nQuestion: If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, then for how many of the other lab assistants can one determine which sessions they lead?\nChoices:\n  A: one\n  B: two\n  C: three\n  D: four\n  E: five\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n1.

Therefore, Olivia must lead a session on Friday. Since Nessa must lead an afternoon session and the Friday afternoon session is the only one left, Nessa must lead the Friday afternoon session. Since Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day and Friday is the only day with two sessions left, Kevin and Rebecca must lead the Friday morning and afternoon sessions. However, since Nessa is already leading the Friday afternoon session, Kevin and Rebecca must lead the Friday morning session and another session on a different day. Therefore, we can determine the sessions for three other lab assistants: Olivia, Nessa, and either Kevin or Rebecca.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
