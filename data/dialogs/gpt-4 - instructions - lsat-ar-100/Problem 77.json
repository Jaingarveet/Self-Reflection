Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.\nQuestion: For how many of the six new employees is the assignment of a parking space limited to one of only two possible spaces?\nChoices:\n  A: none\n  B: two\n  C: three\n  D: four\n  E: five\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n1. Understand the rules and restrictions given in the problem.\n2. Analyze each rule individually and note the direct limitations it imposes on the parking space assignments.\n3. Consider how the rules interact with each other to further limit the options for each employee.\n4. Identify the employees whose parking space options are limited to only [REDACTED] possible spaces.\n5. Count the number of such employees and choose the corresponding answer.\n"

This means Togowa cannot be in space #6 and Young cannot be in space #1.\n2. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. This means Souza cannot be in space #6 and Xu cannot be in space #1.\n3. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. This means Young cannot be in space #4, #5, or #6 and Robertson cannot be in space #1.\n4. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4. This is already considered in the previous rule.\nFrom these rules, we can see that:\n- Togowa can be in spaces #1, #2, #3, #4, or #5.\n- Young can be in spaces #2, #3.\n- Souza can be in spaces #1, #2, #3, #4, or #5.\n- Xu can be in spaces #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6.\n- Robertson can be in spaces #2, #3, #4.\n- Vaughn has no restrictions and can be in any space.\nSo, only Young and Robertson have their assignment of a parking space limited to one of only two possible spaces.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
