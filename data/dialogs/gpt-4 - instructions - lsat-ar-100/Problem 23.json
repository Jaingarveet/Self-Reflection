Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.\nQuestion: If Kyle gives the afternoon report on Tuesday, and Helen gives the afternoon report on Wednesday, which one of the following could be the list of the students who give the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively?\nChoices:\n  A: Irving, Lenore, and Nina\n  B: Lenore, George, and Irving\n  C: Nina, Irving, and Lenore\n  D: Robert, George, and Irving\n  E: Robert, Irving, and Lenore\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n1. Understand the conditions given in the question.\n2. Do not make assumptions that are not stated in the conditions.\n3. Identify the constraints for each day.\n4. Eliminate options that do not meet the constraints.\n5. Choose the option that fits all the conditions and constraints.\n"

Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports, so they can only give morning reports. Since Helen is giving the afternoon report on Wednesday, the only options for the morning report on Wednesday are Nina, Lenore, and Irving. However, if Nina gives a report, then Helen and Irving must both give reports the next day, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. Therefore, Nina cannot give the morning report on Wednesday, leaving only Lenore and Irving. Looking at the options, the only one that fits these conditions is Lenore, George, and Irving.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
