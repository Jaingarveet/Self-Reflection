The order of their performance must satisfy the following conditions: T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R. At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F. O is performed either first or fifth. The eighth composition performed is either L or H.

This means that at least two compositions are performed after F and before R. Since F is performed sixth, R must be performed seventh or eighth. But the eighth composition is either L or H, so R must be performed seventh. This means that the two compositions performed after F and before R are R and either L or H. Since P is performed before S and at least one composition is performed after O and before S, S cannot be performed first, second, third, or fourth. Therefore, S must be performed either fifth, sixth, seventh, or eighth. But T is performed fifth, F is performed sixth, and R is performed seventh, so S must be performed eighth. \nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
