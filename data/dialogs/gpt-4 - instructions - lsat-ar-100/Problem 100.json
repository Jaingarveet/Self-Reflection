The order of their performance must satisfy the following conditions: T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R. At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F. O is performed either first or fifth. The eighth composition performed is either L or H. P is performed at some time before S. At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.\nQuestion: Which one of the following lists the compositions in an order in which they could be performed during the concert, from first through eighth?\nChoices:\n  A: L, P, S, R, O, T, F, H\n  B: O, T, P, F, S, H, R, L\n  C: P, T, F, S, L, R, O, H\n  D: P, T, F, S, O, R, L, H\n  E: T, F, P, R, O, L, S, H\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n1. Read the question and all conditions carefully.\n2. Understand the constraints of the problem.\n3. Go through each option one by one.\n4. Check each condition against the option.\n5. If an option fails any condition, eliminate it and move to the next.\n6. The correct answer is the option that satisfies all conditions.\n"
