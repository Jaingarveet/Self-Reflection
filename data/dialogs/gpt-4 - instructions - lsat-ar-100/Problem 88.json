At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.\nQuestion: It is fully determined which of the shelves each of the books is placed on if which one of the following is true?\nChoices:\n  A: I and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  B: K and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  C: L and F are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  D: M and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  E: H and O are placed on the same shelf as each other.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n1. Understand the conditions given in the question.\n2. Do not make assumptions that are not supported by the conditions.\n3. Consider each choice and how it would affect the placement of the books.\n4. Remember that a book being on a higher shelf than another book does not necessarily mean it is on the top shelf.\n5. Choose the answer that allows the placement of all the books to be determined.\n"

This means K and O are on the middle shelf, and I is also on the middle shelf. The remaining books G, H, and M are on the top shelf.
