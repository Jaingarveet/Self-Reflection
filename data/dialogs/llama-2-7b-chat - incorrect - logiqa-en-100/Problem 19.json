However, this does not necessarily mean that his analysis is correct. It is possible that some of the objections to the post are more fully justified, and therefore, the conclusion that \"Most people agree with me\" may not be accurate.\n\nIn this case, (C) Some of the objections to the post are more fully justified is the best option to question the blogger's conclusion. This option acknowledges that there may be valid objections to the blogger's analysis that have not been fully addressed, which could cast doubt on the accuracy of the blogger's conclusion."
