However, some people have not been poisoned after eating this fish.\nQuestion: Which of the following, if correct, is most helpful in explaining the contradictions in the above statement?\nChoices:\nA: The fish contaminated with this chemical has not been harmed by the chemical itself.\nB: Toxic chemicals gather in the parts of the fish that seals eat but people don't.\nC: Traces of this chemical poison were also found in the bodies of some people who ate neither fish nor fish products.\nD: Fish contaminated with this chemical only accounts for a small portion of the seal's total food intake.\n\nReflection:\nAfter reviewing my previous answer and the correct answer, I realized that I made a mistake in my reasoning. The correct answer is (B) Toxic chemicals gather in the parts of the fish that seals eat but people don't.\nThe statement suggests that the chemical is more toxic to seals than to people, which means that the parts of the fish that seals eat are more likely to contain higher concentrations of the chemical. Therefore, the contradiction between the seals dying and some people not being poisoned can be explained by the fact that seals eat more of the contaminated fish than people do.\n[REDACTED]"
