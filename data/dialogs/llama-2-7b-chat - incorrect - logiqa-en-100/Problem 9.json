To determine which member K can replace without violating the conditions, I will analyze the members of each group and their relationships.\n\nPrinting Group: F, H, L, and M\nBinding Group: G, H, and J\n\nFrom condition (1), each group has at least 3 employees, so both groups have 3 members.\nFrom condition (2), F and K cannot be in the same group, so K cannot replace F.\nFrom condition (3), if K is in a certain group, J must also be in this group. Since K is not in the printing group, J cannot be in the binding group.\nFrom condition (4), M is at least one of the members of these two groups. Since M is a member of the printing group, K cannot replace M in the binding group.\nFrom condition (5), at least one of the same employees in both groups. Since H is a member of both groups, K cannot replace H in either group.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the only option that allows K to replace a member without violating any of the conditions is:\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\")\n\nExplanation: K can replace L in the printing group without violating any of the conditions."
