However, if the number of internet users has quadrupled in the past 5 years (B), it could indicate that the increase in negative posts is due to the growing number of internet users, rather than a deterioration in the social atmosphere.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")\n\nReflection:\nI previously answered this question incorrectly by selecting option A, which does not weaken the argument. Upon further reflection, I realized that the increase in negative posts could still be due to a deterioration in the social atmosphere, even if the number of internet users has increased. The growing number of internet users could lead to more people sharing negative content and creating a feedback loop of negativity. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
