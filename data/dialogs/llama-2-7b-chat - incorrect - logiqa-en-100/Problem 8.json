My reasoning was that since Xiao Qiang's study time is longer than Xiao Gang's, and Xiao Qiang has more books than Xiao Gang, it means that Xiao Qiang's knowledge is richer than Xiao Gang's. However, this is not the correct conclusion.\n\nUpon further reflection, I realized that the question is asking about the relative knowledge of Xiao Qiang and Xiao Gang, not their absolute knowledge. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) Xiao Qiang's knowledge is richer than Xiao Gang's.\n\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
