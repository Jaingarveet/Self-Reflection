However, if the cave was actually used as a cemetery and funeral venue, then it would not be as large as four football fields, as there would be limited space for living quarters. Additionally, the presence of tools, pottery, obsidian, silver, and copper utensils in the cave could be explained by their use in funeral rituals rather than as everyday objects for a prehistoric village.\n\nTherefore, option (B) provides the best refutation of the argument."
