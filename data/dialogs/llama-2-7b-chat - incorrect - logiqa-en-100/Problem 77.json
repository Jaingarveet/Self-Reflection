Upon reflection, I realized that I made a mistake in my reasoning. Here is my corrected solution:\n\nThe correct answer is (B) The binding group and the printing group have exactly two members in common.\n\nExplanation:\nThe conditions given in the problem are:\n\n1. Each group has at least 3 employees.\n2. F and K cannot be in the same group.\n3. If K is in a certain group, J must also be in this group.\n4. M is at least one of the members of these two groups.\n5. At least one of the same employees in both groups.\n\nFrom the given information, we can conclude that the printing group has only three members: G, H, and L.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible combinations of members for the two groups:\n\n1. G, H, and L are in both groups. (This is the only combination that satisfies all the conditions.)\n2. G and H are in the printing group, and L is in the binding group. (This combination violates condition 3, as K is not in the same group as J.)\n3. G and L are in the printing group, and H is in the binding group. (This combination violates condition 4, as M is not one of the members of these two groups.)\n4. H and L are in the printing group, and G is in the binding group. (This combination violates condition 5, as there are no common employees in both groups.)\n\nTherefore, the only possible combination that satisfies all the conditions is: G, H, and L are in both groups. This means that the binding group and the printing group have exactly two members in common: G and H.\n\nSo, the correct answer is (B) The binding group and the printing group have exactly two members in common."
