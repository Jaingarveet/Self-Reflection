H and Y must be allocated in the same department.\n2. F and G cannot be allocated in the same department.\n3. If X is allocated in the sales department, W is allocated in the production department.\n4. F must be allocated in the production department.\n\nNow, let's consider the options:\n\nA: G is assigned to the sales department.\nThis option violates condition 2, as G and F cannot be in the same department.\n\nB: H is assigned to the production department.\nThis option satisfies conditions 1 and 3, but violates condition 4, as H is not allocated in the production department.\n\nC: I was assigned to the sales department.\nThis option violates condition 3, as W is allocated in the production department if X is allocated in the sales department.\n\nD: W is assigned to the public relations department.\nThis option satisfies conditions 1 and 4, but violates condition 2, as W and F cannot be in the same department.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) H is assigned to the production department."
