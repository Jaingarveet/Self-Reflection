The correct answer is (C) Employees of Jiutian Company can speak English, Lin Yingrui is an employee of Jiutian Company, therefore, Lin Yingrui can speak English.\n\nExplanation:\nThe argument in the original question is a classic example of a logical deduction. It starts with a premise (Li Wenbing's family cannot see the landscape) and uses it to conclude that Li Wenbing's family is not a landscape room. The argument is similar to the one in choice (C) because it also starts with a premise (employees of Jiutian Company can speak English) and uses it to conclude that Lin Yingrui can speak English.\n\nIn both arguments, the conclusion is logically deduced from the premise, and the conclusion is the most reasonable explanation based on the given information. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) Employees of Jiutian Company can speak English, Lin Yingrui is an employee of Jiutian Company, therefore, Lin Yingrui can speak English."
