I will use my self-reflection to help me answer this question correctly.\n\nThe correct answer is (D) The increase in dust storms is mainly due to human factors such as overloaded grazing and predatory management of grasslands.\n\nExplanation:\nThe statement \"sand and dust storms are caused by grassland degradation and desertification caused by climate drought\" suggests that the increase in dust storms is due to natural factors. However, the information provided in the reflection section challenges this opinion.\n\nOption (A) provides a specific example of how the height of grass in the Xilin Gol grassland has decreased significantly since the 1950s, which suggests that human activities such as overgrazing and poor management of grasslands are contributing to the increase in dust storms.\n\nOption (B) provides a contrast between the degraded grasslands of Hulunbeier and Xilinguole in Inner Mongolia and the healthier grasslands of Mongolian grassland, which suggests that the increase in dust storms is not solely due to natural factors.\n\nOption (C) provides information that the grasslands on the border line between China and Mongolia have maintained their height since the 1950s, which suggests that the increase in dust storms is not due to a natural change in the environment.\n\nTherefore, the opinions expressed in the passage can be questioned, and the correct answer is (D) The increase in dust storms is mainly due to human factors such as overloaded grazing and predatory management of grasslands."
