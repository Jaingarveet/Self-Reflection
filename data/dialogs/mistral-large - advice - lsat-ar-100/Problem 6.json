Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.\n3. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.\n4. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.\n\nFrom condition 1, we know that Megregian reviews more plays than both Kramer and Lopez.\nFrom condition 2, we know that Jiang reviews different plays than both Lopez and Megregian.\nFrom condition 3, we know that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.\nFrom condition 4, we know that exactly two students review the same plays. This means that Jiang must review only one play, and it cannot be Tamerlane (since Kramer and O'Neill both review it). Therefore, Jiang must review Sunset or Undulation.\n\nNow let's analyze the answer choices:\n\nA: Jiang reviews more of the plays than Lopez does.\nSince Jiang reviews only one play, and Lopez reviews fewer plays than Megregian, it is possible that Lopez reviews zero plays. In this case, A could be true.\n\nB: Megregian reviews more of the plays than Jiang does.\nSince Jiang reviews only one play, and Megregian reviews more plays than both Kramer and Lopez, it is possible that Megregian reviews two plays. In this case, B could be true.\n\nC: Megregian reviews more of the plays than O'Neill does.\nSince O'Neill reviews Tamerlane, and Megregian cannot review Tamerlane (because Jiang cannot review any play Megregian reviews), it is possible that Megregian reviews only one play that is not Tamerlane. In this case, C could be false.\n\nD: O'Neill reviews more of the plays than Jiang does.\nSince Jiang reviews only one play, and O'Neill reviews Tamerlane, it is possible that O'Neill reviews only one play. In this case, D could be false.\n\nE: O'Neill reviews more of the plays than Kramer does.\nSince Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, it is possible that Kramer reviews only one play. In this case, E could be false.\n\nAction: Answer(\"A\")\n\nExplanation:\nSince Jiang reviews only one play, and Lopez reviews fewer plays than Megregian, it is possible that Lopez reviews zero plays. In this case, A must be true. The other answer choices (B, C, D, and E) could be false based on the given conditions."
