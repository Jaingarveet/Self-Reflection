At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.\nQuestion: If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: F and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  B: G and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  C: H and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  D: I and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  E: K and O are placed on the same shelf as each other.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never make assumptions that are not supported by the given conditions.\n - Always double-check your reasoning and final answer.\n - Remember that logical reasoning is a critical skill in law and many other fields.\n"

K is placed on a higher shelf than F.\n4. O is placed on a higher shelf than L.\n5. F is placed on the same shelf as M.\n6. L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on.\n\nNow let's analyze the possible placements of the books:\n\n1. Since more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, the bottom shelf must have at least 3 books.\n2. I is placed on the middle shelf, so the middle shelf must have at least 2 books (including I).\n3. Since L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, L cannot be on the bottom shelf.\n4. If L is on the top shelf, then H must be on the bottom shelf.\n5. If H is on the bottom shelf, then the bottom shelf must have at least 3 books, and since more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, the top shelf must have at most 2 books.\n6. Since K is placed on a higher shelf than F, and F is placed on the same shelf as M, K cannot be on the bottom shelf.\n7. If K is on the top shelf, then O must be on the top shelf as well (since O is placed on a higher shelf than L, which is on the middle shelf).\n8. If K and O are on the top shelf, then the top shelf has 2 books, and the bottom shelf must have at least 4 books.\n9. However, since F and M must be placed on the same shelf, and K is on a higher shelf than F, F and M cannot be placed on the top shelf.\n10. Therefore, F and M must be placed on the bottom shelf.\n11. Since the bottom shelf must have at least 4 books, and F and M are already placed on the bottom shelf, H must also be placed on the bottom shelf.\n12. Therefore, L cannot be placed on the top shelf, and must be placed on the middle shelf.\n13. Since I is already placed on the middle shelf, and L is placed on the middle shelf, the middle shelf has 2 books.\n14. Since the top shelf has at most 2 books, and the middle shelf has 2 books, the bottom shelf must have 4 books.\n15. Therefore, the books on the bottom shelf are F, M, H, and one more book.\n16. Since K and O are placed on the top shelf, and G is the only remaining book, G must be placed on the bottom shelf.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\") (G and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.)"
