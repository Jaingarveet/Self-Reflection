Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.\nQuestion: For how many of the six new employees is the assignment of a parking space limited to one of only two possible spaces?\nChoices:\n  A: none\n  B: two\n  C: three\n  D: four\n  E: five\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always analyze each rule given in the problem.\n - Always consider the implications of each rule on the possible assignments.\n - Never stop your analysis too early; consider all rules and their implications.\n - Always double-check your analysis and calculations.\n - Remember that logical reasoning and analysis are crucial in solving complex problems.\n"

Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.\n\nFrom rule 4, we know that Robertson can only be assigned one of four possible spaces. However, this does not mean that Robertson is limited to only two possible spaces.\n\nFrom rule 3, we know that Young must be assigned a lower-numbered parking space than Robertson. Since Robertson can only be assigned one of the first four spaces, Young can only be assigned one of the first three spaces. However, this does not mean that Young is limited to only two possible spaces.\n\nFrom rule 1, we know that Togowa must be assigned a lower-numbered parking space than Young. Since Young can only be assigned one of the first three spaces, Togowa can only be assigned one of the first two spaces. Therefore, Togowa is limited to only two possible spaces.\n\nFrom rule 2, we know that Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
