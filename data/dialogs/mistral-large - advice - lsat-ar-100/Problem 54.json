Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.\nQuestion: If Jiang does not review Tamerlane, then which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Jiang reviews Sunset.\n  B: Lopez reviews Undulation.\n  C: Megregian reviews Sunset.\n  D: Megregian reviews Tamerlane.\n  E: O'Neill reviews Undulation.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never make assumptions that are not supported by the given conditions.\n - Always double-check your reasoning and final answer.\n - Remember that logical reasoning is a systematic process that requires careful analysis and deduction.\n"

Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.\n3. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.\n4. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.\n\nNow let's consider the question: If Jiang does not review Tamerlane, then which one of the following must be true?\n\nSince Jiang does not review Tamerlane, and neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews, it means that Lopez and Megregian cannot review Tamerlane either.\n\nNow, since Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, they cannot be the pair of students who review exactly the same play or plays as each other, because there must be exactly two students who review the same plays, and Kramer and O'Neill already share Tamerlane.\n\nTherefore, the pair of students who review exactly the same play or plays as each other must be Jiang and one of the remaining students (Lopez, Megregian, or O'Neill). Since Lopez and Megregian cannot review Tamerlane, they must review the other two plays (Sunset and Undulation).\n\nSince Jiang does not review Tamerlane, Jiang must review either Sunset or Undulation. If Jiang reviews Sunset, then Lopez must review Undulation to maintain the condition that Lopez reviews fewer plays than Megregian. If Jiang reviews Undulation, then Lopez must review Sunset for the same reason.\n\nIn either case, Megregian must review both Sunset and Undulation to satisfy the condition that Kramer and Lopez each review fewer plays than Megregian.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\") (Megregian reviews Sunset.)"
