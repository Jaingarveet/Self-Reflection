Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1. Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.\nQuestion: If Himalayans are not featured on day 7, then which one of the following pairs of days CANNOT feature both the same breed of kitten and the same breed of puppy?\nChoices:\n  A: day 1 and day 3\n  B: day 2 and day 6\n  C: day 3 and day 5\n  D: day 4 and day 6\n  E: day 5 and day 7\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never make assumptions about the problem without verifying them.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the conditions of the problem may limit the availability of certain breeds on certain days.\n"

No breed is featured on any two consecutive days.\n3. Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7.\n4. Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1 or day 7.\n5. Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.\n\nNow let's analyze the choices:\n\nA: day 1 and day 3 - Since Greyhounds are featured on day 1, they cannot be featured on day 3. So this pair cannot feature both the same breed of kitten and the same breed of puppy.\nB: day 2 and day 6 - This pair is possible since there are no restrictions for these days.\nC: day 3 and day 5 - This pair is possible since there are no restrictions for these days.\nD: day 4 and day 6 - This pair is possible since there are no restrictions for these days.\nE: day 5 and day 7 - Since any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7, and Greyhounds are featured on day 1, they cannot be featured on day 7. So this pair cannot feature both the same breed of kitten and the same breed of puppy.\n\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
