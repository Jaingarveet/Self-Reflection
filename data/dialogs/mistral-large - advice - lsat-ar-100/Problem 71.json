Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.\nQuestion: Which one of the following could be a complete and accurate list of the sales representatives working in Zone 3?\nChoices:\n  A: Kim, Mahr\n  B: Kim, Tiao\n  C: Parra, Quinn\n  D: Stuckey, Tiao, Udall\n  E: Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Udall\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never make assumptions based on incomplete information.\n - Always consider all possible scenarios based on the given conditions.\n - Always eliminate scenarios that violate any of the given conditions.\n - Always double-check your reasoning and final answer.\n - Remember that logical reasoning is a critical skill in law.\n"

Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.\n4. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.\n5. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.\n\nFrom conditions 1 and 3, we know that if Parra is in Zone 1, then Quinn must also be in Zone 1. However, this would leave only one sales representative (either Tiao or Udall) for Zone 2, which contradicts condition 5. Therefore, Tiao must be in Zone 1.\n\nFrom conditions 2 and 4, we know that if Tiao is in Zone 2, then Udall must also be in Zone 2. However, this would again leave only one sales representative (either Parra or Quinn) for Zone 1, which contradicts condition 5. Therefore, Udall must be in Zone 2.\n\nNow we know that Tiao is in Zone 1, Udall is in Zone 2, and Parra and Quinn work together in either Zone 1 or Zone 3. Since Tiao is already in Zone 1, Parra and Quinn must be in Zone 3.\n\nStuckey must be in the same zone as Udall, which is Zone 2. This leaves only Kim and Mahr. Since there must be more representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, and there are already two representatives in Zone 3 (Parra and Quinn), both Kim and Mahr must also be in Zone 3.\n\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
