Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.

Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.\n3. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.\n4. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.\n5. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.\n\nFrom conditions 1 and 3, we know that if Parra is in Zone 1, then Quinn must also be in Zone 1. However, if Tiao is in Zone 1, then Parra and Quinn cannot be in Zone 1, so they must be in either Zone 2 or Zone 3 together.\n\nFrom conditions 2 and 4, we know that if Tiao is in Zone 2, then Udall must also be in Zone 2. However, if Udall is in Zone 2, then Stuckey must also be in Zone 2, which contradicts condition 5 (there cannot be more representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2). Therefore, Tiao cannot be in Zone 2, and Udall and Stuckey must be in either Zone 1 or Zone 3 together.\n\nNow let's consider the possible scenarios for Quinn:\n\na) If Parra is in Zone 1, then Quinn is also in Zone 1. In this case, Tiao must be in Zone 3 (since Tiao cannot be in Zone 1 or Zone 2), and Udall and Stuckey must be in Zone 3 as well (since they must be together and cannot be in Zone 2). This scenario satisfies all conditions.\n\nb) If Tiao is in Zone 1, then Parra and Quinn must be in either Zone 2 or Zone 3 together. However, since Tiao cannot be in Zone 2, Udall and Stuckey must be in Zone 3. This means that there are already three representatives in Zone 3 (Tiao, Udall, and Stuckey), so Parra and Quinn must be in Zone 2. This scenario also satisfies all conditions.\n\nBased on these scenarios, we can conclude that Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Tiao, since they are always in different zones in both scenarios.\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
