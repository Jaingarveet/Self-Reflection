This is possible since Garcia cannot testify on Monday due to the condition that Franco and Garcia cannot testify on the same day.\n* B: Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Iturbe. This is not possible since Iturbe testifies on Wednesday and Franco cannot testify on the same day as Garcia, who cannot testify on Wednesday since two witnesses must testify on Tuesday.\n* C: Garcia and Hong are both scheduled to testify on Tuesday. This is possible since Franco cannot testify on Tuesday due to the condition that Franco and Garcia cannot testify on the same day.\n* D: Garcia is the only witness scheduled to testify on Monday and Hong is one of two witnesses scheduled to testify on Wednesday. This is not possible since at least one witness must testify on Monday and Hong cannot testify on Monday.\n* E: Jackson is scheduled to testify on Tuesday and two witnesses are scheduled to testify on Monday. This is not possible since exactly two witnesses must testify on Tuesday.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")\n\nReflection:\nI previously answered this question incorrectly because I did not carefully consider the condition that Franco and Garcia cannot testify on the same day. I also did not eliminate choices that violated this condition. In the future, I will make sure to carefully read and understand all conditions given and eliminate any choices that violate them. I will also double-check my work to make sure I have not made any errors in my analysis."
