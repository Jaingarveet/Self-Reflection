Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.\nQuestion: If Robertson is assigned parking space #3, then which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Souza is assigned parking space #4.\n  B: Togowa is assigned parking space #2.\n  C: Vaughn is assigned parking space #5.\n  D: Xu is assigned parking space #6.\n  E: Young is assigned parking space #2.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n"

        "content": "Reflection:\nI previously answered this question incorrectly by not considering all the rules governing the assignment of parking spaces.\n\nTo solve this problem, I need to consider all the rules and the fact that Robertson is assigned parking space #3.\n\nSince Robertson is assigned parking space #3, Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than #3. Therefore, Young cannot be assigned parking space #2, so answer choice E is incorrect.\n\nSince Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa, and Young cannot be assigned parking space #2, Togowa must be assigned parking space #1 or #2. Therefore, answer choice B is not necessarily true.\n\nSince Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, and Robertson is already assigned parking space #3, Souza cannot be assigned parking space #4. Therefore, answer choice A is not necessarily true.\n\nSince Robertson is assigned parking space #3, and Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa, and Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, the only remaining option is that Vaughn must be assigned parking space #5. Therefore, answer choice C must be true.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
