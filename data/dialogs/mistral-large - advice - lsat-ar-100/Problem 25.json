S must be earlier than Y. J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.\nQuestion: If G is fourth, which one of the following could be true?\nChoices:\n  A: H is fifth.\n  B: J is first.\n  C: Q is second.\n  D: S is fifth\n  E: Y is sixth.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n\n* Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n* Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n* Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n* Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n* Always double-check your reasoning and final answer.\n* Remember to consider all the conditions given in the question.\n* Remember to analyze the possible positions of all the articles, not just the article in question.\n"

If Q is second, then S cannot be earlier than Q, which violates the condition that S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third. Therefore, we can eliminate choice C.\n\nThe only remaining choice is E.
