Each rider will then test a different one of the bicycles on the second day. Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day. The assignment of riders to bicycles is subject to the following conditions: Reynaldo cannot test F. Yuki cannot test J. Theresa must be one of the testers for H. The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.\nQuestion: If Theresa tests G on the second day, then which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Reynaldo tests H on the first day.\n  B: Reynaldo tests J on the first day.\n  C: Theresa tests H on the second day.\n  D: Theresa tests J on the first day.\n  E: Yuki tests H on the second day.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never make assumptions without verifying them against the given information and conditions.\n - Always double-check your reasoning and final answer.\n - Remember that logical reasoning is a critical skill in law and other fields.\n"
