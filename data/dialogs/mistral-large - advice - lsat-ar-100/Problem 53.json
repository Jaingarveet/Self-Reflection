I realized that I needed to carefully analyze each rule and how they affect the order in which the houses can be shown.\n\nAdvice:\nTo solve this problem, we need to consider the following rules:\n\n1. J must be shown in the evening.\n2. K cannot be shown in the morning.\n3. L must be shown after K and before M.\n\nSince J must be shown in the evening, it can only be the sixth or seventh house shown. Since K cannot be shown in the morning, it can only be the third, fourth, fifth, sixth, or seventh house shown. Since L must be shown after K and before M, it cannot be the first or last house shown.\n\nUsing this information, we can eliminate some of the answer choices.\n\nA: K is shown in the evening. This is not necessarily true, as K could be shown in the afternoon.\n\nB: L is shown in the afternoon. This could be true, as L could be the third, fourth, or fifth house shown.\n\nC: L is shown in the evening. This is not necessarily true, as L could be shown in the afternoon.\n\nD: M is shown in the morning. This is not possible, as L must be shown before M, and L cannot be shown in the morning.\n\nE: M is shown in the afternoon. This could be true, as M could be the fifth house shown.\n\nTherefore, the answer must be either B or E. However, since L must be shown after K, and K cannot be shown in the morning, L cannot be the third house shown. Therefore, L must be shown in the afternoon.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
