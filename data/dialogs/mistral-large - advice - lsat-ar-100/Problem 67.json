Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day. The following conditions apply: No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.\nQuestion: If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Exactly three batches of cookies are made on Tuesday.\n  B: Exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday.\n  C: At least two batches of cookies are made on Monday.\n  D: At least two batches of cookies are made on Thursday.\n  E: Fewer batches of cookies are made on Monday than on Tuesday.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never make assumptions that are not explicitly stated in the problem.\n - Always consider the implications of each condition in the problem.\n - Always double-check your reasoning and final answer.\n - Remember that the conditions in the problem may have implications that are not immediately obvious.\n"

Since no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day, neither Monday nor Wednesday can have two batches of the same kind of cookie. Therefore, the second batch of oatmeal cookies and the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on either Tuesday or Thursday.\nThe second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday. Since no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day, the first and third batches of sugar cookies must be made on Monday and Tuesday.\nNow we have:\nMonday: 1 batch (either oatmeal, peanut butter, or sugar)\nTuesday: 2 batches (one of which is sugar, and the other is either oatmeal or peanut butter)\nThursday: 2 batches (one of which is sugar, and the other is either the second batch of oatmeal or the first batch of peanut butter)\nFriday: 3 batches (the remaining batches of oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar)\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
