This means that F must be performed after R. Since at least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F, and F is performed after R, at least two compositions must be performed after F and before the end of the concert. Since O is performed fifth, and O is performed immediately after T, which is performed immediately after R, R must be performed fourth. Since F must be performed after R, F cannot be performed first, second, or third. Since at least two compositions must be performed after F and before the end of the concert, F cannot be performed seventh. Therefore, F must be performed either fourth or sixth. However, since R is performed fourth, F cannot be performed fourth, so F must be performed sixth.\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
