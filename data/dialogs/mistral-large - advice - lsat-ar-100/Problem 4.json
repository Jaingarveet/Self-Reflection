Each session will be led by a different lab assistant—Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, or Rebecca. The assignment of lab assistants to sessions is constrained as follows: Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day. Nessa must lead an afternoon session. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.\nQuestion: If Lan does not lead a Wednesday session, then which one of the following lab assistants must lead a Thursday session?\nChoices:\n  A: Rebecca\n  B: Olivia\n  C: Nessa\n  D: Kevin\n  E: Julio\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n- Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n- Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n- Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n- Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n- Always double-check your reasoning and final answer.\n- Remember that constraints may refer to the same day of the week or the same day of the lab schedule.\n- Remember to consider all constraints when determining the correct answer.\n"

However, since Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day, Olivia cannot lead a session on Thursday or Friday.\n\nSince Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's, Julio must lead a session on Wednesday.\n\nSince Nessa must lead an afternoon session, she cannot lead a Wednesday morning session. Therefore, Kevin must lead the Wednesday morning session.\n\nSince Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day, Rebecca must lead the Wednesday afternoon session.\n\nTherefore, the only lab assistant who can lead a Thursday session is Lan.\n\nAction: Answer(\"A\")\n\nReflection:\nI previously answered this question incorrectly because I did not consider all of the constraints. I did not realize that Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's, which means that Julio must lead a session on Wednesday. I also did not realize that Nessa must lead an afternoon session, which means that Kevin must lead the Wednesday morning session. By considering all of the constraints, I was able to determine the correct answer."
