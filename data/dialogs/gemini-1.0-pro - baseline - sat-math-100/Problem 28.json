We can do this by recognizing that the numerator is in the form of a difference of squares: $x^2 - 1 = (x+1)(x-1)$.\nNext, we can divide both sides of the equation by $(x-1)$, but only if $x \\neq 1$. This gives us:\n$$x+1 = -2$$\nSolving for $x$, we get:\n$$x = -3$$\nHowever, we need to remember that we divided by $(x-1)$, so $x = 1$ is not a valid solution.\nTherefore, the only value of $x$ that satisfies the equation is $x = -3$.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
