The functions above are the estimated supply and demand functions for a certain product. The function $S(P)$ gives the quantity of the product supplied to the market when the price is $P$ dollars, and the function $D(P)$ gives the quantity of the product demanded by the market when the price is $P$ dollars.\nQuestion: How will the quantity of the product supplied to the market change if the price of the product is increased by $\\$ 10$ ?\nChoices:\n  A: The quantity supplied will decrease by 5 units.\n  B: The quantity supplied will increase by 5 units.\n  C: The quantity supplied will increase by 10 units.\n  D: The quantity supplied will increase by 50 units.\n"
