        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: For the school paper, five students—Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, Megregian, and O'Neill—each review one or more of exactly three plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation, but do not review any other plays. The following conditions must apply: Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.\nQuestion: If exactly three of the students review Undulation, which one of the following could be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Megregian does not review Undulation.\n  B: O'Neill does not review Undulation.\n  C: Jiang reviews Undulation.\n  D: Lopez reviews Tamerlane.\n  E: O'Neill reviews Sunset.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nError Keywords:\n- Logical error\n- Misinterpretation\n- Assumption\n\nSolution: Given that Kramer and O'Neill both review \"Tamerlane,\" and exactly three students review \"Undulation,\" we can deduce the following:\n\n- Lopez and Megregian cannot review \"Tamerlane\" as it would result in three students having the same play in common, contradicting the clue that there should only be pairs.\n- This leaves \"Sunset\" to be reviewed by Kramer and Lopez, ensuring that Megregian and Jiang can take the remaining spots for \"Undulation.\"\n- Therefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED]: O'Neill reviews Sunset, along with Kramer.\n\nSolution:\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the given conditions and constraints from the context.\n2. Interpret the conditions correctly, especially the one stating \"exactly two students review the same play or plays.\"\n3. Deduce the possible combinations of play reviews for each student.\n4. Eliminate options that contradict the given conditions.\n5. Choose the answer that aligns with the deductions.\n\nAdvice:\n- Read and understand the context and question carefully.\n- Break down the conditions and constraints into manageable components.\n- Avoid making assumptions or overgeneralizing.\n- Consider all possibilities and apply logical deduction systematically.\n- Double-check your interpretations and deductions to ensure they align with the given conditions.\n"
