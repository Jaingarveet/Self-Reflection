        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Exactly five witnesses—Franco, Garcia, Hong, Iturbe, and Jackson—are to be scheduled to testify at a hearing that is to take exactly three days of one week—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Each witness testifies on exactly one day of the hearing. The schedule must meet the following conditions: Franco does not testify on the same day that Garcia testifies. Iturbe testifies on Wednesday. Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday. Hong does not testify on Monday. At least one witness testifies on Monday.\nQuestion: Which one of the following is an acceptable schedule of witnesses?\nChoices:\n  A: Monday: Franco Tuesday: Hong and Iturbe Wednesday: Garcia and Jackson\n  B: Monday: Franco and Hong Tuesday: Iturbe and Jackson Wednesday: Garcia\n  C: Monday: Garcia Tuesday: Franco and Iturbe Wednesday: Hong and Jackson\n  D: Monday: Garcia and Jackson Tuesday: Franco and Hong Wednesday: Iturbe\n  E: Monday: Garcia and Jackson Tuesday: Hong Wednesday: Franco and Iturbe\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nError Keywords:\n- Misinterpretation\n- Oversight\n- Condition misinterpretation\n- Inattention to detail\n\nSolution:\nThe conditions provided sequentially:\n1. Franco and Garcia cannot testify on the same day.\n2. Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.\n3. Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.\n4. Hong does not testify on Monday.\n5. At least one witness testifies on Monday.\n\nStep-by-step solution:\nMonday: \n- Hong cannot testify on Monday, per condition 4.\n- At least one witness must testify on Monday, per condition 5.\n- Franco is a suitable choice for Monday, as this meets condition 5 and avoids conflict with Garcia per condition 1.\n\nTuesday:\n- Exactly two witnesses must testify on Tuesday, per condition 3.\n- Hong is suitable for Tuesday, as this does not conflict with Monday's schedule and meets condition 3.\n- Iturbe is chosen for Tuesday, as this meets condition 3 and does not conflict with Wednesday's schedule per condition 2.\n\nWednesday: \n- Iturbe is scheduled for Wednesday per condition 2, leaving Garcia and Jackson for Wednesday.\n\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the conditions that must be met for the witness schedule.\n2. Break down the conditions step-by-step to create a logical sequence.\n3. Start with the conditions that eliminate specific options.\n4. Continue with conditions that provide specific scheduling requirements.\n5. Ensure that the schedule meets all conditions before selecting it as the answer.\n6. Double-check that no two conditions contradict each other and that all conditions can be met simultaneously.\n\nAdvice:\n- Read and understand all conditions before attempting to create a schedule.\n- Break down complex conditions into simpler, more manageable steps.\n- Start with conditions that provide clear restrictions on scheduling.\n- Look for conditions that can be used to narrow down options and make informed choices.\n- Double-check that your chosen schedule meets all conditions, especially those that are easily overlooked.\n"
