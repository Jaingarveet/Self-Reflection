        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: A software company employs exactly seven sales representatives—Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall—to work in its three sales zones—Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3. Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.\nQuestion: Which one of the following could be a complete and accurate list of the sales representatives working in Zone 3?\nChoices:\n  A: Kim, Mahr\n  B: Kim, Tiao\n  C: Parra, Quinn\n  D: Stuckey, Tiao, Udall\n  E: Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Udall\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nError Keywords:\n- Oversight\n- Incomplete analysis\n- Misinterpretation of conditions\n\nSolution:\nLet's break down the conditions and relationships step by step: \n\n1. Parra and Quinn must work in the same zone.\n2. Stuckey and Udall work in the same zone.\n3. Either Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1, but not both.\n4. Either Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2, but not both.\n5. Given that more reps are in Zone 3, and Stuckey and Udall are together, they must be in Zone 3. \n6. Now, we can place the remaining reps. [REDACTED], or both must be in Zone 3 to satisfy the condition of more reps in Zone 3 than Zone 2. \n7. Therefore, the list of sales representatives working in Zone 3 is: [REDACTED], Stuckey, and Udall. \n\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the given conditions and relationships between employees and zones. \n2. Start with the definite relationships: Parra-Quinn and Stuckey-Udall. \n3. Consider the mutual exclusivity conditions for Zones 1 and 2. \n4. Given the condition about Zone 3, place Stuckey and Udall there. \n5. Place the remaining employees based on the conditions and available zones. \n6. Ensure that all conditions are satisfied and that the placement adheres to the question's constraints. \n\nAdvice:\n- Carefully read and identify all given conditions and relationships. \n- Begin with definite relationships and work step by step from there. \n- Consider all conditions and their implications systematically. \n- Avoid focusing on a subset of conditions while neglecting others. \n- Ensure your placement satisfies all constraints and conditions.\n"

If Parra is in Zone 1, then Tiao must be in Zone 2, and vice versa.\n6. Therefore, the list of sales representatives working in Zone 3 is D: Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
