        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Exactly eight books—F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O—are placed on a bookcase with exactly three shelves—the top shelf, the middle shelf, and the bottom shelf. At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.\nQuestion: If G is placed on the top shelf, then which one of the following could be a complete and accurate list of the books placed on the middle shelf?\nChoices:\n  A: H, I\n  B: I, L\n  C: H, I, L\n  D: I, K, L\n  E: F, I, M\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI overlooked the condition that \"K is placed on a higher shelf than F.\" \nThis condition eliminates the option where I, K, and L are on the middle shelf because it would mean K is on the same shelf as F, contradicting the given condition. \nError Keywords:\n - Oversight\n - Condition oversight\n - Contradiction oversight\nSolution:\nGiven conditions: \n- At least two books on each shelf\n- More books on the bottom shelf than the top\n- I is on the middle shelf\n- K is on a higher shelf than F\n- O is on a higher shelf than L\n- F and M are on the same shelf\n\nIf G is placed on the top shelf, we know that the middle shelf must have at least two books, and K and F cannot be on the same shelf. \n\nThe only option that satisfies all conditions is: \n- I, K, and L are on the middle shelf (D)\n\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the given conditions and rules. \n2. Understand the question: If G is on the top shelf, which books could be on the middle shelf? \n3. For each choice, assess if it satisfies all conditions. \n4. Eliminate choices that contradict any condition. \n5. Choose the answer that remains viable after this process. \n\nAdvice:\n - Always read and re-read the conditions and rules to ensure you don't miss any. \n - Break down complex conditions into simpler ones. \n - Understand the implications of each condition and how they relate to each other. \n - For shelf-organization questions, visualize the placement and consider all relationships between books and shelves. \n - Double-check each choice against every condition to avoid oversights.\n"

There are no contradictions with the given conditions.\n\nD: I, K, L - If K is placed on the middle shelf, it would be on the same shelf as F (since F is on the bottom shelf with M), contradicting the condition that K is on a higher shelf than F. So, this option can be eliminated.\n\nE: F, I, M - This option also violates the condition that K is on a higher shelf than F, as K would have to be on the bottom shelf with F and M.
