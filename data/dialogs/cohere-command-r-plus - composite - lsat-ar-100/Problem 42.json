        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: A panel of five scientists will be formed. The panelists will be selected from among three botanists—F, G, and H—three chemists—K, L, and M—and three zoologists—P, Q, and R. Selection is governed by the following conditions: The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types. If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. F and K cannot both be selected. K and M cannot both be selected. If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.\nQuestion: Which one of the following is an acceptable selection of scientists for the panel?\nChoices:\n  A: F, G, K, P, Q\n  B: G, H, K, L, M\n  C: G, H, K, L, R\n  D: H, K, M, P, R\n  E: H, L, M, P, Q\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nError Keywords:\n- Misinterpretation\n- Oversight\n- Condition misinterpretation\n\nSolution:\nLet's break down the conditions and analyze each choice: \n\nConditions: \n- At least one scientist of each type (botanist, chemist, zoologist) must be included. \n- If there are multiple botanists (more than one), then there can be one or none zoologists. \n- F and K cannot be both selected. \n- K and M cannot be both selected. \n- If M is selected, both P and R must be on the panel as well. \n\nAnalyzing the choices: \n[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] - This selection includes F and K together, violating one of the given conditions. \n\n[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] - This option has two botanists and no zoologists, violating the condition about multiple botanists and the requirement to have at least one zoologist. \n\n[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] - This selection satisfies all the conditions. It includes one of each type of scientist and does not violate any of the given restrictions. \n\n[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] - This option includes two zoologists (P and R) and multiple botanists (F and G), which goes against the condition about selecting multiple botanists and zoologists. \n\n[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] - While this choice includes the required types, it violates the condition that if M is selected, both P and R must be present. \n\nSo, the correct answer is indeed [REDACTED]: [REDACTED]. \n\nInstructions:\n1. Identify and clearly understand each of the given conditions. \n2. Break down each condition and determine its impact on the selection. \n3. Analyze each choice by applying the conditions to the selection of botanists, chemists, and zoologists. \n4. Look for any condition that is not met or any restriction that is violated. \n5. Choose the option that satisfies all the conditions without violating any restrictions. \n\nAdvice:\n- Read and understand all the conditions before analyzing the choices. \n- Pay close attention to the wording of each condition, especially terms like \"at least,\" \"at most,\" \"cannot,\" and \"must.\" \n- Be systematic in your analysis by checking each condition for each choice. \n- Ensure that your interpretation of the conditions is consistent throughout your analysis. \n- Double-check your reasoning for each option to avoid overlooking any relevant conditions or restrictions.\n"
