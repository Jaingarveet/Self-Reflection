        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: A panel of five scientists will be formed. The panelists will be selected from among three botanists—F, G, and H—three chemists—K, L, and M—and three zoologists—P, Q, and R. Selection is governed by the following conditions: The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types. If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. F and K cannot both be selected. K and M cannot both be selected. If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.\nQuestion: If P is the only zoologist selected, which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: If K is selected, G cannot be selected.\n  B: If L is selected, F cannot be selected.\n  C: If exactly one chemist is selected, it must be K.\n  D: If exactly two chemists are selected, F cannot be selected.\n  E: If exactly two chemists are selected, G cannot be selected.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nError Keywords:\n- Misinterpretation\n- Overlooked constraint\n- Incorrect assumption\n\nSolution:\nGiven that P is the only zoologist selected, we know that at least two botanists must be chosen to fulfill the condition that there is \"at most one zoologist\" when there are \"more than one botanist.\" \n\nThe key constraint I overlooked is that F and K cannot both be selected. If F is selected, K cannot be, and vice versa. Now, let's consider the options: \n- If F is selected, G and H can be the other botanist, but we can't choose K as the chemist because of the constraint. \n- If G is selected, F and H can be the other botanist, and we still can't choose K. \n- The same applies if H is selected. \n\nIn all cases, exactly two chemists can be selected, but F cannot be one of them due to the constraint with K. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED]: \"[REDACTED]\" \n\nInstructions:\n- Identify the given condition: P is the only zoologist selected. \n- Interpret the conditions correctly: \"more than one botanist\" means two or three botanists, and \"at most one zoologist\" means one or zero zoologists. \n- Consider all relevant constraints, especially those that restrict certain scientists from being selected together. \n- Analyze the options by considering the possible combinations of scientists that fulfill the given and underlying conditions. \n- Determine which statement(s) must be true based on the provided information. \n\nAdvice:\n- Read and interpret the conditions carefully, ensuring a correct understanding of the constraints. \n- Identify and explicitly consider all relevant constraints, especially those that restrict certain entities from being selected together. \n- Avoid making assumptions that are not explicitly stated in the problem. \n- Analyze each option thoroughly, considering all relevant conditions and constraints. \n- Look for definitive statements that must be true based on the provided information.\n"
