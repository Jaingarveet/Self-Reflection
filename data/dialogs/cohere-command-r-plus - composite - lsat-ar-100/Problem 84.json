        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Exactly eight books—F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O—are placed on a bookcase with exactly three shelves—the top shelf, the middle shelf, and the bottom shelf. At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.\nQuestion: Which one of the following could be a complete and accurate list of the books placed on the bottom shelf?\nChoices:\n  A: F, M\n  B: F, H, M\n  C: G, H, K\n  D: F, G, M, O\n  E: G, H, L, M\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nError Keywords:\n- Oversight\n- Misinterpretation\n- Inattention to detail\n\nSolution:\nThe conditions state that K is placed on a higher shelf than F, and O is placed on a higher shelf than L. This means K and O cannot be on the bottom shelf, eliminating choices [REDACTED], [REDACTED], and [REDACTED]. \n\nThe condition, \"F is placed on the same shelf as M,\" means that F and M must be on the same shelf. As a result, the only option that satisfies this condition is choice [REDACTED], with F, H, and M on the bottom shelf. \n\nThe prompt also states that there must be at least two books on each shelf, and there are no restrictions that would prevent two books from being placed on the bottom shelf. \n\nTherefore, choice [REDACTED] is the correct answer. \n\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the conditions provided in the prompt and list them clearly. \n2. Interpret each condition carefully and systematically. \n3. Eliminate choices that violate any of the conditions. \n4. Pay close attention to detail and ensure you don't overlook any conditions or details. \n5. Double-check your interpretation and reasoning for each step. \n\nAdvice:\n- Always read and re-read the conditions and choices carefully. \n- Break down complex conditions into simpler components. \n- Systematically apply each condition to the choices. \n- Avoid making rushed assumptions or interpretations. \n- Maintain a clear and organized thought process. \n- Regularly review and reflect on your reasoning to identify any potential oversights or misinterpretations.\n"

This eliminates choices A, C, and D as they do not meet these requirements. Choice E can be eliminated as well because it places O on the bottom shelf, contradicting the condition that O is placed higher than L. Therefore, choice B is the only option that satisfies all the conditions.\n\nAnswer: \"B\" is the correct answer as it fulfills all the conditions: F and M are on the same shelf, there are at least two books on the bottom shelf, and it does not place K or O on the bottom shelf, adhering to their respective conditions."
